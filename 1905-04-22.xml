                    <p>The consensus , of opinion here is that Rodjestvensky has gained a great
                        advantage through having coaled, and reprovisioned in Kamaranh Bay. (Reuter

                    <p>The "Daily Telegraph" learns from Tokio that Japan has Addressed a formal
                        protest to France with reference to the stay of the Russian Fleet in
                        Kamaranh Bay. (Reuter.) </p>
                    <p>Paris, April 20. </p>
                    <p>The Japanese Minister here has called the attention of M. Delcassé to tho
                        presence of the Russian ships at Kamaranh. It is maintained, on behalf of
                        France, that she has taken precisely the same measures as when the Japanese
                        cruisers lately visited Kamaranh. Moreover, it is affirmed that the Baltic
                        Fleet has quitted the territorial waters. (Reuter ) </p>

                    <p>Japan has protested to the French Government against her breach of neutrality
                        in favor of the Russian squadron. The latter left Kamaranh Bay several days

                    <p>Paris, April 21.</p>
                    <p>It is semi officially announced that the Japanese representative principally
                        desired to obtain formal assurance from France that she would continue to
                        strictly observe her neutrality, just as she did when Rodjestvensky passed
                        Cherbourg, and when be was stationed in the vicinity of Madagascar. Special
                        instructions have been sent to Indo-China and M. Delcassé was, therefore,
                        able to calm the Japanese anxiety, for which hitherto there has been no
                        justification. The Government as regards Indochina' has adopted, in
                        connection with the Russians, the same measures as those recently taken when
                        the Japanese cruisers visited Kamaranh. ( Ratter.) </p>

                    <p>The Japanese resentment against France is growing. It is manifesting itself
                        in the shape of public meetings which pass heated resolutions. A great
                        popular demonstration is proposed. (Reuter.) </p>

                    <p>It is stated here that France has addressed a communication to Sr.

                        insist upon the Russians observing French neutrality. (Reuter.) </p>

                    <p>M. Rouvier, in the Chamber, emphatically reaffirmed that formal, precise, and

                        annuities where possible from 15 to 50 years, or even longer periods. The
                        sum required for this operation is reckoned at about eight millions
                        sterling, and it is said that it has been guaranteed by Sir Ernest Casual at
                        a rate equal to about 3 3/4%. As the rate of interest on the annuities is to
                        be 5 1/2%, the difference between 3 3/4% and 5 1/2% on eight millions will

                    <head>M NICOLAOU’S CONCERT. </head>
                    <p>M. Constantin Nicolason gave a very successful concert at the Grand
                        Continental Hotel on Wednesday evening. The great heat had naturally some
                        effect on the attendance, but the artist was in great form, and those who
                        heard him enjoyed a great treat To show M. Nicolson's versatility we may say
                        that he gave us songs, many of them with extremely difficult and taxing
                        airs, from eight different composers, all or Dearly all of them operatic. M.
                        Nicolason was most successful, as we thought, in the "Aria del Fishio,” from
                        Boito Mefistofele. and in the drinking song from Bizet’s Fair Maid of PeriX.
                        He sang with exceptional taste and charm and never pushed his voice, a very
                        pleasant "basse chantante,” in attempting to gain effect. </p>

                    <p>The Golf Steward begs to remind members that the entries for Lbs golf meeting
                        dose at 12 noon to-morrow, 23rd inst. So far many members who play golf
                        constantly have not entered for any event. The Golf Steward points out that
                        the system of allowing the full handicap greatly increases the chances of
                        the ordinary or indifferent player, whilst correspondingly minimizing those
                        of the "scratch" man. He hopes therefore that any long handicap players who
                        are hesitating about entering will now take the earliest opportunity of
                        sending in their names for some events. Aboukir Company.—Th e profit and
                        lorn account for 1904 shows a credit balance of £23,049, which added to
