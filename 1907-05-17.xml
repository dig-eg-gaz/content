                    <head>THE SULTAN AND THE ARABS.</head>
                    <p>It has been announced lately, writes a Correspondent of "Globe," that the
                        Sultan has appointed a Commission, composed of disting uished generals and
                        ulemas, and has directed them to proeeod to the Yemen, to discuss witli the
                        rebel Arab tribes the nature of their grievances, and to arrange terms of
                        settlement. Although it is rather late in the ilay to take this step, it is
                        to he hoped that the negotiations may suceoed. The civil</p>
                    <p>war which has so long raged in the Yemen has been disastrous in its effects,
                        not only upon the population, but also upon the prestige of the Sultan. For
                        more thart three years the Arab tribes have paid no taxes, nor have they
                        provided the customary recruits to the Army. They have been in open
                        rebellion; they have repeatedly defeated the Turkish troops with heavy
                        losses; they have captured important fortresses like Sanaa, with large
                        stores of arms, artillery, and ammunition. Whole regiments tf the Sultan's
                        troops have deserted Itodily to the enemy. I/ast year when the Arab forces
                        surrounded Sanaa, the Turkish Governor surrendered ; the garrison marched
                        out as prisoners of war, the officers were shot, and such of the rank and
                        file as did not join the Arabs were escorted to Hodeida and shipped back to
                        Akabeh. The reconquest of the Yemen wus, indeed, a hopeless task, and Abdul
                        Hamid has done wisely in abandoning the effort. If the Sultan's Commission
                        can satisfy the demands of the rebellious tribes by offeringthem autonomy,
                        such as was granted years ago to the Lebanon, ami a similar amount of Home
                        Rule which will free the Arabs from the oppressive taxation of the Turkish
                        Valis, the Moslem world will rejoice, and its ruler will gain strength and
                        prestige. Upon our side also there will be cause for rejoicing if a peaceful
                        settlement can he effected, for it will free Aden, Egypt, the Sudan, and the
                        Indian Empire from a cons-_ taut cause of anxiety and religious restlessness
                        among our Moslem subjects. It is probable that the high-handed proceedings
                        of the German Ambassador in Constantinople, in demanding the exile of Fehim
                        Pasha, the foster-brother of the Sultan himself, has opened the eyes of the
                        latter to the grave danger which threatens his Empire through German
                        aggression. Notable evidence of a change in Abdul Hamid's feelings towards
                        Germany has been shown recently by the growing favour which he has exhibited
                        to British enterprise in his dominions. The construction of the-quay*.
                        docks, and workhouses in Constantinople, which had been so long delayed,
                        notwithstanding their necessity, has now been entrusted to an Anglo-French
                        syndicate, in the face of strenuous opposition by the German Ambassador. An
                        English engineer, Sir William Willcocks, has been entrusted with the survey
                        of the works for restoring the ancient canals and irrigation works along the
                        Tigris, and an Irade has been issued by the Sultan, ordering their
                        completion. It is to be hoped that the carrying out of these important works
                        will also be entrusted to British capitalists and engineers, who have
                        already proved their efficiency by the remarkable public works which they
                        have carried out in India and Egypt, with such notable success. The effects
                        of irrigation upon the fertile lands between the Tigris and the Euphrates
                        will be to render Mesopotamia as rich as Egypt, with important advantages to
                        the finances of the Ottoman Empire, as well as to increase of commercial
                        activity in those regions, by which India and Great Britain will benefit. It
                        is too much to hope that as a result of the friendly feelings of the Sultan,
                        lie may be induced to entrust to British enterprise the completion of a line
                        of railway to connect Koweit on the Persian Gulf with Bagdad, placing it
                        under international control ? German trade would not suffer by the
                        completion of the Bagdad Railway in tlie.se circumstances. On the contrary,
                        the commerce which British enterprise in the Persian Gulf would bring to the
                        railway; would soon make any payment by the Sultan, on account of the
                        kilometric guarantee which is so stubbornly insisted upon by the Berlin
                        financiers altogether unnecessary. But the successful completion of the
                        public works in Mesopotamia, and of the Bagdad Railway, depends chiefly upon
                        the power of t he Sultan to protect the engineers and the workmen
                        constructing them. And it is only by consent of the Arab tribes, who liave
                        been so victorious hitherto, that their safety can be assured. For this
                        reason the visit of the Sultan's Commission, now on its way to the Yemen, is
                        so important at the present juncture. Its task will be a difficult one, for
                        the tribes believe that their recent successes in the field are a guarantee
                        of future ones. It is an illusion,.for it is well known that the Sultail
                        could easily obtain the aid of the Kaiser if hq asked it, in subduing the
                        whole of Arabia and establishing his rule more effectively than he has been
                        able to do hitherto. It is true that the price which would he asked for such
                        assistance would be onerous, and such as he would not willingly pay, hut
                        desperate cases require desperate remedies sometimes. British Ministers have
                        now a chance of gaining the goodwill of the Sultan by offering their
                        services as mediators between him and his rebellious subjects, which may
                        never occur again, and it is to be hoped thut Sir Edward Grey,| either
                        through the Indian Government or directly, will feel able to seize it. It is
                        probable that the inde)>endent chiefs, having now formed on Arabian
                        Federation, and elected their own Caliph, will not easily believe in the
                        genuineness of the promises which will he made to them by the Sultan's
                        Commissioners, and will be unwilling to surrender the results of their
                        victories. In that case, no other Power could claim to command so much
                        confidence as Great Britain. There is little doubt as to what Lord
                        Beaeonsfield, if he were still alive, woidd do in the circumstances. </p>

                    <head>MR. EDWARD DICEY'S OPINION.</head>
                    <p>Writing in the "Empire Review," Mr. Edward Dicey remarks :—</p>
                    <p>"I had for long past been of opinion that it would he for tho advantage both
                        of England and Egyfyt if his lordship were replaced by a younger man, less
                        autocratic in character,more sympathetic in disjiosition, and more ready to
                        recognise the fundamental differences between the West and the Easb, and as
                        I lutve already expressed these opinions in print, I cannot deny that the
                        retirement of Lord Cromer and his replacement by a younger man will, in my
                        judgment, by a gain to Egypt and possibly to to England.</p>
                    <p>"First. 1 hold that though the material prosperity of Egypt has been greatly
                        increased under the reign of economy and order which Lord Cromer has
                        introduced, this prosperity has not earned, und could not reasonably be
                        expected ,to earn, the gratitude of the native Egyptians. ,</p>
                    <p>"Secondly. I hold that during the quarter of a century throughout which Egypt
                        has been ruled under an absolute, though benevolent, autocracy, Egypt' has
                        become less fitted for self-government or any kind of autonomy than she was
                        at the commencement of our military occupation.</p>
                    <p>"Thirdly. I contend that the latent dislike entertained by all Mohammedan
                        races for Christian supremacy constitutes a permanent cause of unrest.</p>
                    <p>"Fourthly. I consider that the attempt to administer the affairs of Egypt hy
                        English officials and thus excluding the natives from any important share in
                        the internal administration of Egypt*!ms proved a failure.</p>

                    <p>A number of rumours have been bruited 'about as to the exact fcliaracter of
                        the otlicial speeches at yesterday's ceremony at Ras el-Tin Palace'These
                        reports appear to have originated Owing*to the fact that the local
                        newspapers were unable to obtain the text of the Khedive's and -Sir Eldon's
                        speeches from the official sources to which application vjtfs Inode.
                        Consequently the quidnuncs drew elaborate conclusions from the
                        noii-piimication of the^Speeches and it was rumoured that important
                        political reasons rendered publication unwise. We are authorised to slate
                        that all such rumours are entirely destitute of any foundation and the
                        speeches were of n simple official character in no way differing from the
                        usual type of speeches delivered on these occasions.</p>

                    <head>EXCESSIVE SPECULATION. FOUNDERS' SHARES IMPUGNED- </head>
                    <p>The Bulletin of the British Chamber of Commerce of Egypt in its May issue
                        contains the following article :—</p>
                    <p>For some time past warnings have been given by prudent and experienced people
                        against the excessive speculation which has been going on in local stocks
                        and shares and in building land. No heed was given to these warnings by many
                        people who had the means of checking this excessive speculation. The
                        Egyptian banks did their beat to moderate the gambling fever by refusing to
                        increase their advances on local shares, whilst several of them went further
                        and confined their advances to the better class of securities, entirely
                        eliminating those of a financial or land speculating character. The bettor
                        class stockbrobers also, discouraged speculation by refusing to execute
                        purchases which would have had to be carried over. The hanks and respectable
                        brokers at tho time came in for the usual invective from the disappointed
                        gambler, and from the enter- prisingbrokeror promoter desirous of unloading
                        his wares on an unsuspecting public. The fresh wave of prosperity,
                        engendered by a record- breaking, bumper cotton crop, marketed at prices
                        hitherto unhoped for, proved, however, in spite of the conservative action
                        of the hanks and others, to he such an incentive</p>
                    <p>to.................. shall we say enterprise 7 that</p>
                    <p>scarcely a day passed without the shares of one or more new companies being
                        offered for public subscription. The promoters of these ventures secured the
                        favour of the Bourse frequenting fraternity, and the subsequent necessary
                        official quotation, by a judicious distribution of founders' shares (which
                        vicious feature in public companies is one which finds much favour with the
                        Levantineapeculator). (l) These founders' shares of the nominal value of 1
                        /- each were quickly rigged up to (in some cases) £4 or £0 apiece, and the
                        happy allottees at jiar, having realised a handsome profit with no initial
                        risk, could not do loss than bid up the ordinary shares to a premium, almost
                        before the prospectus was out of the printer's hands. Without going so far
                        a^ to say that ntPconipany could get its shares quoted officially, without
                        in some way subsidising the leading brokers, it is quite true that those who
                        did not do so had to wait a long time for a quotation. A premium being thus
                        established, the whole of the capital was inevitably over subscribed. This
                        phenomenon was many times repeated, and a remarkuble feature was that the
                        premium remained some considerable time after allotment.</p>
                    <p>The first successful promoters naturally found many imitators. Business on
                        the Bourse was brisk. One heard of colossal sums gained in brokerages alone.
                        Consequently, side by side with the creation of new companies, recruits came
                        thick and fast to the Bourse ; hank clerks 'left their employment to start
                        as brokers, with the aid of borrowed capital ; oilier brokers turned their
                        concerns into companies (needless to say the shares were immediately quoted
                        at a premium), and people without the means of paying differences, let alone
                        taking up their purchases with their own money, were induced to speculate
                        and were promised unlimited accommodation. Naturally this could not go on
                        for ever. Carrying over rates at from 20 to 80 per cent, and even more in
                        some cases, could not he eternally borne, and nil at once business came to a
                        full stop, owing to many people being unable to carry their load any longer,
                        and prices fell 25 or more per cent. It is perhaps as well that the pace was
                        made so fast : it was merry while it lasted, hut fortunately the check has
                        come at a time when the market is well able to support losses. It is indeed
                        remarkable that there have been hitherto so comparatively few failures.</p>
                    <p>The methods of the brokers' committee in practically declaring a moratorium
                        (2) are doubtless open to much criticism, and we doubt whether they will be
                        sufficiently appreciated in? Europe by bankers and others who have lent
                        money on Egyptian shares. This much is, however, to he said for them, that
                        they have given a certain amount of breathing time, mid have enabled the
                        monthly settlement for the end of April to lie carried through quietly.
                        There were two or three failures earlier in the month (.3) and one small
                        failure recently, while nnotfibr firm has had to lie helped over. At the
                        time of wilting, the feeling is distinctly better, and we have heard of
                        several enquiries for shares at good prices. Many shares, are in our
                        opinion, still too high to attract the bona fide investor, while on the
                        other hand, many of the more speculative varieties are worthy of attention.,
                        from people who have the means and the inclination to go in for such.</p>
                    <p>We do not wish it to be understood that all local stockbrokers, or even
                        promoters, are mi; scrupulous. We are thankful to say that there are many
                        honourable exceptions; and we deliberately record our conviction that the
                        country at bottom is sound, and that there is no ground for anxiety as to
                        the ultimate results of the majority of Egyptian Companies.</p>

                    <head>CATTLE PLAGUE.</head>
                    <p>Up to the close of the week ending 13th May, 144 fatal cases of cattle plague
                        were reported in Egypt Of these, 24 cases occurred in the Beba district, 49
                        in Maglmgho, 22 in Beni-Mazar, 22 in Aboil Kerkes, 10 in Minieh, 3 in Fashn,
                        7 Melluwi and 1 at Dei rout. Even though tlie complaint is confined to a few
                        restricted areas 'it is none the leas a matter for uneasiness, both to the
                        farmers and the Public Health Department, and no effort is being spared by
                        the latter to obtain a clean bill of health for Egypt. Judging by the
                        information that the Serum Institute, which the Public Health Department
                        established some three years ago at Abassieh, is about to lie re-opened, it
                        might be assumed that the cattle plague is really on tho increase, unless
                        the object of reopening the Institute is for the supply of serum to the
                        Sudan. It is a well-known fact that when the Serum Institute was closed some
                        eighteen months ago there was an enormous reserve of serum and a great
                        portion of this was sent to the Sudan : the lengthy transit, however, had a
                        deteriorating effect on the serum and there were statements made that it was
                        not so efficacious in the south as the north. It has been well proved in
                        Egypt itself and has contributed greatly to the suppression and localising
                        of cattle plague. </p>

                        at the twenty- seventh annual general meeting of the company, to be held in
                        London :—</p>
                    <p>In presenting the twenty-seventh annual report of the company together with
                        the balance sheet ami accounts for the year ended 31st March, 1907, the
                        directors have again the pleasure of being able to state that tlie result of
                        the year's operations justifies them not only in continuing the payment of a
                        dividend for the whole year at the rate of 10 per cent,, but in adding 1 per
                        cent, by way of bonus.</p>
                    <p>The shareholders were informed last year that to avoid the trouble and,
                        expense incurred by the frequent re-issues of debentures to replace those
                        paid oft' by drawings the directors had decided to create debenture stook,
                        bearing 4 per cent, interest, of the total amount of £400,000 ; within which
                        amount the company were empowered to issue and reissue debentures to rank
                        pari passu in point of security, the resujt being that £106,700 4 per cent,
                        debenture stock has been issued to date.</p>
                    <p>The directors have to lament the loss of their late colleague, Viscount
                        Hampden, who died in November last In his place they have appointed Mr.
                        Huri, their Manager in Egypt, who lias been a faithful sen-ant of the
                        company for many years. The board were of opinion that ns nobody possessed
                        so much knowledge of the affairs of the company as their manager, they cQuld
                        not do better than reward his past services and secure them for the company

                    <p>DEVELOPMENT OF TRADE. MR. KOHLER'S REPORT. </p>
                    <p>EXPORTS. </p>
                    <p>The exports from Port Sudan were at first 1 tampered by the unreadiness of
                        the port, but gum, senna, etc. are now regularly shipped. Abyssinian coffee
                        reaches the coast via Gain- bela and Khartoum, and ia gent from Port .Sudan
                        to Aden, whence it is transhipped'to Europe and America. Goat-skins come
                        from Kassala and are sent to Aden for America. Wheat comes from the Berber
                        province, and is taken to Jeddah and the Yemen; and dhurra goes this way
                        from Omdurman to Massowah. The principal items of export were as follows.
                        The figures represent the value in £ sterling : Coffee, 438 ; .Skins, 1,309
                        ; Cattle, 25 ; Ghee, 804 ; Gum, 34,769 ; Senna, 105 ; Cotton, from the
                        Atbara district, 240 ; Cotton seeds, 60 ; Sheep, 116. Tho above figures
                        really only represent tho trade of Port Sudan from April 1 to October 31, os
                        up to the former date the harbour was quite unprepared to receive ships.
                        Also wash-outs on tho railway and quarantine (duo to the preaence of plague
                        in Suez) did much to divert trade back to- the old Nile route. SHIPPING AT
                        PORT SUDAN. From January 1 to October 31, 1906, 111 steamers, of 123,645
                        tons net, called at Port Sudan, and landed 744,280 packages. Of these 29
                        came direct from Europe, i e., 7 German, 3 Dutch and 19 British. The
                        remainder came from Suez. Further, 134 coasting steamers brought 20,440
                        packages—mainly food stuffs from Suakin, whither the goods had been taken by
                        ships which did not call at Port Sudan. In the same period 105 steamers, of
                        116,022 net tons, cleared, taking 18,836 packages, mostly gum. * Tho
                        Suez.trade is at present practically a monopoly of the Khedivial Line. The
                        Norddeutsoher Lloyd takes skins to Adjn for America, and they are making
                        trial shipments of gum to Australia. It is stated that the Austrian Lloyd
                        are about to start regular sailings to the port, and the Peninsular and
                        Oriental are believed also to be considering tho matter. A new line is also
                        reported to be in process of. formation. The other lines chiefly interested
                        in the port at present are the Strtck Line and the Dale Line. t .The above
                        figures are sufficient to show how considerable is the increase in the value
                        of the goods passing through Port Sudan. It will now be suitable to consider
                        the prospects of merchants desiring to establish a connection in the town.
                        As already stated, the dangers which snr round the sea approach to Suakin
                        cannot be said to exist here. Tho fairway ia clear and well-lighted and
                        pilots ore available, if desired. Pilot dues will shortly be imposed, bat M
                        yet there are no harbour or light Joes. The harbour is safe, but tho wharves
                        and appliances for loading, dre,, are not yet ready, but before long the
                        port will be aa well equipped as Alexandria. </p>

                    <head>THE RUINS OF PETRA.</head>
                    <head>A MYSTERIOUS CITY.</head>
                    <p>Ma'an, March 9.</p>
                    <p>It was an hour past noon ; since morning we had ridden up the gentle slope
                        which declines from the broad, round-backed range of Edom on to the vast
                        Arabian plateau, dim and illimitable behind us. We luul left the stretches
                        of brown gravel strewn with black.flints, traversed the calcareous ridges,
                        thinly clad with stunted, thorny bushes, and crossed the patches of snow in
                        the hollows, which we ate and gave to our horses, for die sun was hot and we
                        had the desert thirst on us. We came to n patch deeper than the rest,
                        through which the horses floun- iered, slipping on the hidden stones. It
                        proved to be the lust summit. "Behold Wady Moussa," said the most
                        communicative of our escort of Kurdish cavalry. There was magic Ilk the.
                        ridden change of scene. Before us rose a mountain muss of fantastic beauty,
                        ravine and peak and precipice, overtopped by a weird peak towering in lonely
                        grandeur. No need to tell ns that it was Mount Ilo'r, the lust resting place
                        of Aaron, ami that hidden in the recess of those strange mountains lay
                        Petra.</p>
                    <p>Down a narrow valley by a purling stream, the limestone clad with turf, whoso
                        bright emerald was thickly studded with gay (lowers, we rode until our
                        shadows grew long. As the light grew mellow we reached ii little plateau
                        above the stream and were greeted by the barking of dogs, the cries of
                        children, and the human sounds that haunt a village, even though it be hut
                        the transitory home of nomads. Before sunset our tent was pitched, its white
                        cone standing out sharply against the low black tents of the Bedouin who
                        were to lie our neighbours for the night. They cleared away the stones from
                        our camping ground, lent us tent-pegs, and helped our men to pitch the tent.
                        The Sheikh sent us n carpet, a great boon for our equipment had been
                        shamefully neglected by our civilised contractor. They supplied us with salt
                        and delicious milk. Of course we had to take coflee with the Sheikh in his
                        tent. The berries were of the semi- opaqne variety which Yemen alone-
                        produces. They were carefully doled oet from a bag into an iron ladle,
                        roasted over the embers, pounded in a mortar, put into water and brought to
                        boiling point. The process was lengthy, hut it resulted in a beverage
                        totally differing from the black gruel, half coffee-grounds, known as
                        Turkish coffee and mainly composed of burnt hurley. We were struck by the
                        beauty of the children, slender and of delicate features. Our domestic
                        arrangements excited interest. The bed linen was a subject of great wonder.
                        But the people were very discreet, and retired the moment we showed a
                        disposition to he left alone. For a time we heard conversation at the tent
                        doors around ns—the quiet hum of u village. It was not easy to get rid of
                        the notion that iliis was a permanent habitation. Yet on the morrow,
                        perhaps, the "houses of hair" might vanish and not a human sight or sound
                        break the solitude.</p>
                    <p>At sunrise we moved down the valley ; then mounted an acclivity to Kljy, the
                        one village of the Wady Moussa oasis. The people are cultivators, settled
                        Bedouin of pure race, ami here again wo were struck by tlie beauty of the
                        type. The young girls were pictures of rustic comeliness, with dear, rosy
                        complexions which not even profuse tattooing could hide. They were shy and
                        dignified, and we rejoiced in the entire absence of the begging persecution
                        to which travellers are subjected in Palestine. The valley narrowed into a
                        ravine, and now we saw the first vestiges of antiquity —truncated pyramids
                        cut dean away from 'the rock, dark doorways, carved friezes and pilasters
                        with people grouped around them, for these chambers, unlike those of Petra,
                        arc inhabited by the Arabs. The ravine ended in a sort of amphitheatre, and
                        the stream made a sudden liend and disappeared through a narrow slit in the
                        face of the precipice. We dismounted and plunged into it, for this was the
                        Sik— strangest of approaches to a strange city. It is a diasm. a mere rent
                        in the mountain, not more than twelve feet wide for much of its course,
                        never more than thirty, with twists and turns innumerable. .'Sometimes the
                        overhanging cliffs completely shut out the heavens anil made a red twilight.
                        Then wotild cornea narrow, irregular ribbon of sky far above us. We seemed
                        to he penetrating into the entrails of the earth rather than approaching the
                        seat of a once opulent civilisation. We came to a wider opening and a grassy
                        bank, on which we rested. Before us rose a huge shoulder, round which the
                        water foamed into a narrow cleft. At length we turned it. Framed as in a</p>
                    <p>vignette by the jagged contour of the mouth of the chasm was an exquisite
                        fairy-like thing of column and capital, frieze and niche and winged figures,
                        not built, but hewn out of the nigged face of a precipice. It was of a
                        delicate rosy line, and bathed in a flood of sunlight that shot across the
                        gloom. Whatever it is, temple or tomb —the Arabs call it Pharaoh's
                        Treasury,for they associate everything ancient with money,—it haunts the
                        memory. We went down this broader ravine, making our way through the
                        thickets of oleanders which lined the stream, the cliff's on cither hand
                        honeycombed with rock-hewn cavities richly carted, differing each from each
                        in bewildering variety. We came to the theatre, tier above tier cut out op
                        the living rock, and we camped on a plateau of springy turf amid chimps of
                        lilies. Westward loomed the rugged ruins of a mountain range dominated by
                        the majestic rafts* of Mount Hor. Behind us rose a precipice whose ffice was
                        carved into column, frieze, and cornice. Immediately above us was _»
                        structure in an artificial recess with a terrace Hanked by cloister-like
                        colonnades. A few yards beyond was what is called the Corinthian tomb, and f
                        urther a stupendous cliff made into a pillared facade with projecting
                        cornice. We were impressed most by the grandeur of the situation and the
                        vast extent of the remains. In this confusion of mountains ravine after
                        ravine is cut and carved into a labyrinth of ornate facades, some of them,
                        as in the case of the great temple called the Deir, in almost inaccessible
                        situations. There is a singular charm in the contrast between the elaborate
                        work of a polished people and its ruggetf setting. Pilaster and colonnade
                        and pediment are surmounted by jngged peaks and flanked by savage
                        gorges.</p>
                    <p>The rain came on—March is a month too early for Petra,—and we shifted our
                        tent into one of the rock-hewn cavities. Night fell, and by the light of the
                        camp fire onr guards told us of bad Arabs yonder toyards Akaba who would
                        kill n man for a beshlik—a trifle under sixpence. Sheikh Hamed, not to be
                        outdone, told stories of leopards in the mountains who ate men, and gave a
                        pantomimic illustration of the two blows from the paws of the beast, one on
                        each side of the head. Though we wore not disturbed either by Arabs or
                        leojiards, it was long before we slept, for the mystery of Petra had taken
                        hold of us. Was it really a necropolis 1 Then why so vast for the small
                        city, whose scanty remains at our feet took up scarce a square mile ? How
                        much of the work wq# Nabathcan and how much Roman ? Were the cavities the
                        dwellings of a primitive race adorned in a later age by a more polished
                        people 1 The notices are so few and brief of this city without a story. They
                        cease altogether in the sixth century. Then comes the great romance. For
                        twelve long centuries the .very site, of these stupendous remains was
                        unknown to civilised man, until that August day in 1812 when Burckhardt
                        toiled through the Sik with a water-skin, while his Arab guide carried a
                        kid, which was duly sacrificed at the tomb of Aaron. By this subterfuge
                        only,could the intrepid explorer compass the discovery of the long lost city
                        which his predecessor Seetzeu hud sought for in vain.</p>
                    <p>. There was no rain next morning, and we revelled in bur hath in the crystal
                        rock pools of the stream,-while the sun wrought magic on I ho gorgeous
                        colouring of the rocks. Sheikh Ilamerl and his men, who hud di.sappeared in
                        the night, clattered down the ravine to greet iis. We had heard evil reports
                        of the Petra Bedouin. We found them courteous and helpful. They are said to
                        he rapacious ; wc only heard the word backsheesh once. It was uttered by a
                        poor man who had led my horse. Ho was sternly repressed by the Sheikh, who
                        was eon tent- with the very modest reward he received for his services. It
                        is said that the good behaviour of the Bedouin was due to fear of the
                        soldiers. We had two against at least a hundred armed men, who knew every
                        inch of the country. I have heard of trouble with the Bedouin from people
                        who boasted that they had threatened them with their repeating rides, and
                        they were a strong party of men. I took my wife among them with perfect
                        confidence, and we were unarmed. My confidence was justified. The Turkish
                        Government obliged us to take an escort. Had we gone alone I am convinced we
                        should have met with the same treatment, perhaps with greater sympathy.

                        veins, drive out the poisons that cause disease, and restore lost strength.
                        Striking instances are related by Mrs. H. A. Turner and her daughter, of
                        Sheffield, for they speak in eloquent terms of cures effected by Dr.
                        Williams' Pink Pills in Rheumatism and Amentia.</p>
                    <p>" I dreaded boing laid up with Rheumatism, " said Mrs. Turner, who
                        successfully carries on a general business at -205, Eyre- street, Sheffield.
                        " I had only my daughter to rely upon, and she was ill herself. But for
                        years my logs ached with a dull, heavy pain. RHEUMATISM'S Then sharp pains
                        pierced to</p>
                    <p>SYMPTOMS, the hone the moment my foot touched the ground, and I know that
                        Rheumatism was in my blood. Even at night I got no relief or sleep, and
                        during the day I had to sit with my feet raised on pillows.</p>
                    <p>" Swellings former! round my knees and ankles. I was feverish, and almost
                        distracted by neuralgia and headaches. I could scarcely touch food. I grow
                        so weak and nervous that I was afraid to lifta cup for fear of dropping it.
                        If I went upstairs I collapsed at tho top from pain and exhaustion. Every
                        time I moved it seemed as if the sinews in my legs wore boing torn out. The
                        Rheumatism was so acute that with any change in the weather I suffered
                        agony. In spite of all tho modi', cines that- were tried I felt no
                        improvement or relief.</p>
                    <p>"My daughter, then nineteen years of age, hod been suffering for months from
                        Anamiia. She grow deathly pale, her eyes were dull and sunken, and her lips
                        livid. In the morning she complained of sick headaches and pains in the
                        chest and back, and could hardly drag herself out of bed through weakness.
                        She lost her appetite completely, and AHtCMIA'8 was troubled by shortness of
                        8YMPT0MS. breath. I was pained to see hor so thin and weak. She was so
                        nervous thot when I spoke she would be seized with palpitation of the heart.
                        *</p>
                    <p>"But when I was at the worst she began to get better, could eat well, hor
                        spirits brightened, and her strength returned. She told me it was Dr.
                        Williams' Pink Pills that had done her so much good. In a few weeks she was
                        completely restored.</p>
                    <p>"So I began Dr. Williams' Pink Pills, and after a steady course there was a
                        splendid improvement in me. The pains and swellings disappeared, my blood
                        became pure and rich, and I was free from the tortures of Rheumatism I
                        obtained further supplies of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills, when</p>

                    <p>now life was given to me, and in two months I could take outdoor ex6rci.se,

                        feet from morning till night without fatigue. Dr. Williams' Pink Pills saved
