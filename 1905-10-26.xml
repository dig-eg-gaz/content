                    <head>TRAFALGAR AND TSUSHIMA</head>
                    <p>The fact that Togo's crowning success at Tsushima took place in the
                        cententary year of Nelson's great victory at Trafalgar has not escaped the
                        public and the press, and the real- isation of the influence of sea-power on
                        history is now stronger than it ever has been in our history. The great
                        battles which destroyed the fleets of Napoleon and the Tsar will go down to
                        history as decisive and epoch-making encounters : the first saved the
                        British, the second the Japanese from the menance of inva- sion, and both
                        resulted in the total overthrow of the hostile fleets. But in celebrating
                        the great sea flight on Saturday last the British people had no desire to
                        wound the feelingso f their erstwhile foes and present cordial friends. The
                        French navy is now in better condiiton than it ever was, its vessels are
                        among the best, its officers gallant and highly trained, and it is pleasant
                        to hope that this most efficient force will never again be ranged against
                        our navy. The success of Japan is also a subject for rejoicing among
                        Britons, who feel a certain, pride at the fact that Admiral Togo was trained
                        on the Worcester, and that his best vessels were armed and built by our
                        yards; but it need not prevent us from hoping tha our own rela- tions with
                        great Power defeated in the Eastern Seas may become more and more friendly.
                        Defeat, unless followed by dismem- berment, seldom leaves a lasting pain,
                        and our people have long ago forgotten or forgiven Beachy Head and Yorktown,
                        Fontenay, and Saratoga.</p>

                    <head>THE SUCRERIES</head>
                    <p>The second report of Sir William Willcocks on the situation of the Sucrecries
                        Company from the agriculutral point of view is of pain- ful interest to the
                        Egyptian public, which, till the first rumours of a crash, had obstinately
                        refused to criticise or even to think of question- ing the excellance of the
                        company's manage- ment of its estates in Upper Egypt. In future, we hope,
                        the would-be shareholder (we do not refer to the speculative buyer) will
                        take a little more trouble to acquaint himself with the actual working of
                        the undertakings in which he wishes to invest ; the information is generally
                        procurable with very little trouble, though cases can easily be imagined in
                        which it has to be taken with a grain or two of salt. A discharged servant,
                        for example, is not always a fountain-head of truth.</p>
                    <p>Sir Williams Willcock's criticism are numer- ous and important. He points out
                        that over- centralisation has been fatal to the proper management of the
                        factories, the Cairo head- quarters fixing the rates for transport and
                        taking into its hands other questions of detail which might have been far
                        more rapidly and profitably settled by local managers. Managers have
                        obviously failed at times to "hit it off" with local growers, so
                        emphatically does Sir William state that necessity of dispensing with the
                        services of managers who do not succeed in winning the confidence of the
                        cultivators. The premiums and percentages allowed to managers should be
                        expressed. Two suggestions which Sir William makes are of special im-
                        portance : that an attempt should be made to adopt the system of payment for
                        sugar-cane according to its quality- the system adopted in the early days of
                        cotton culutre in Egypt- and that a hardly variety of cane that can resist
                        frost should be imported, and that the Government, aided by the Khedivial
                        Agri- cultural Society, should aid its acclimiatisation.</p>
                    <p>As to the future of the Secreries, we are left in truly Egyptian darkness.
                        Sir William Willcocks deals with the problem from the point of view of the
                        agriculutral expert, but the future is for the financier to decide. Those
                        few members of the public who still talk op- timistically of reconstruction
                        by the efforts of Sir X.Y. or Mr. A. B. deserve the utmost credit for their
                        optimism, but we should like to remind them that financier does not ne-
                        cessarily spell philanthropist.</p>

                    <head>THE FATE OF NELSON’S SIGNALMAN.</head>
                    <p>The finding, in a state of abject destitu- tion, forty one years after
                        Trafalgar, of tho man who, with his own hands, hoisted Deleon’s signal on
                        board the Victory, is a pathetic little story. It was quite acci- dental,
                        and through a medical man, then living in South London, the son of the sur-
                        geon of another old Trafalgar man-o’-war, the Tonnant. The doctor, as he
                        himself relates, bad a practice in the then respect- able neighbourhood of
                        Upper Stamford- street, Black friara, when one day, in the winter of 1816,
                        something prompted him to take notice of "an old and broken-down man who
                        made a scanty livelihood by crying watercress and red herrings through the
                        streets.” He had often seen the old man, who appeared to be a quick,
                        sharp-witted old man, and had a gTeat reputation for sagacity among the
                        lower class of neighbours. Becom- ing interested in him, the doctor in due
                        course, had some inquiries made, during which a surprising fact came out "We
                        discovered that be was an old sailor named John Roome, and that ho had
                        served with Nelson at Trafalgar— in fact, that he was then a signalman on
                        board the Victory. That led to further inquiries,and one day the old man was
                        called indoors and questioned, with a view of seeing if anything could be
                        done to better his position. "I at length," says the doctor, “took the
                        opportunity of calling the man in, and then seating him before me, asked him
                        : Who was the signal officer on board the Victory at Trafalgar 1 He replied
                        : Mr. Pasoo, sir. Did you serve under him ? Yea. Who, then, hoisted the
                        signal ‘England expects every man to do his duty' 11 did. I bad felt
                        somewhat prepared for this answer; still, as it was uttered I could scarce-
                        ly refrain from a demonstration ,of reverenca towards the old embarrassed
                        signalman, who sat uneasily before me.”</p>
                    <p>Old Roome was then 63 years of age. Ha had been a seaman from his early
                        youth, although be had served only three or four years in the Royal Navy.
                        His intelligence and smartness as a lad got him rated A3, soon after
                        entering the Navy, and then he became a signalman. After Trafalgar unfor-
                        tunately he had deserted, ad the “K" (Run) against his name debarred him
                        from pension. The case, however, was brought to the notice of Captain Pasco
                        (Nelson’s flag-lieutenant at Trafalgar), then filling the post of captain of
                        the Victory, and be took up the cause of "my old shipmate," as be called
                        Roome, warmly, and in the end so successfelly that be was able to get Roome
                        admitted to Greenwich Hospital as in-pensioner for life. At Greenwich old
                        Roome lived for thirteen years in comfort, and making a "good thing,” we are
                        told, out of the ‘ tips" given him by old naval officers and their friends.
                        He died in December, 1860, in the same month that saw the launch of the
                        first ironclad ever built for the British Navy, the Warrior.</p>
                    <p>Roome’s discovery and arrival at Green- wich Hospital, it would appear from
                        all accounts, was not received very warmly there. It spoiled a pretty little
                        game that had been^going on for years, and' seriously affected a very
                        profitable little business that Some of the Greenwich pensionera had long
                        carried on at Greenwich in the neighbourhood of the Hospital, particularly
                        with country visitors to the place, who were always asking to be shown “the
                        man who hoisted Nelson’s signal. The pensioners, we are told, were always
                        ready, to oblige. Some “Greenwich canary”—as pensioners in disgrace for
                        getting drunk on Sunday, who wore the punishment dress of a long, yellow
                        coat with red sleeve*, in place of the ordinary dark wine uniform coat— was,
                        it is on record, as a regular thing palmed off on the gaping visitors ss the
                        very man. It wss added, to improve the occasion and draw more coppers, that
                        the peculiar garb of the ‘ canaries," of whom there were always three or
                        four to be seen about, was "worn as a special Admiralty privilege
                        exclusively by men who had foughton board the Victory at Trafalgar!” It is
                        on record furthermore, indeed, that some- times two or three of the
                        "canaries” themselves would be showing people round at the same time, each
                        touring his own little party of country visitors, and passing himself off as
                        the one and only Trafalgar signalman in existence.</p>

                    <head>EXHIBITION OF BRITISH GROWN COTTON.</head>
                    <p>The British Cotton Growers’ Association's exhibition of cotton grown within
                        the limits of the British Empire was,-opened in Man chaster last week by the
                        Lord Mayor. The exhibition includes a'l specimens which were displayed some
                        time ago at the Imperial Institute, with many additions. There was on view
                        Sea Island cotton from the West Indies tree cotton and Egyptian cotton from
                        India Egypitian and American cotton from Eat Africa, and native and American
                        cotton Iron West Africa. Mr. J. A. Hutton, vice president of the
                        association, said visitor to the exhibi- tion could see for themselves the
                        truth of the assertion that cotton suitable for Lancashire could be grown in
                        the British Empire. The samples were taken from shipments represent . ing
                        the production of thousands of acres. The bad already received this year
                        over 4,0O0 bales from the West Indies, over 3,000 from West Africa, and ever
                        500 bales from east Africa representing a value of well over £100,000 Large
                        shipment were coming in every week, and then was every reason to hope that
                        before the end of the year we should have received over £200,O00 worth of
                        cotton, every pound of which was due to the work of the association.</p>

                    <head>STATESMENS BLUNDERS.</head>
                    <p>Sir Clements R. Markham, late president of the Royal Geographical Society,
                        last week inaugurated a course of geographical study Cambridge University,
                        and gave instances of mistakes made by statesmen through lack of
                        geographical knowledge.</p>
                    <p>It was on one occasion essential to the inte- rests of our country and of the
                        natives of another that in settling a boundary a certain region should be
                        kept within the British fron- tier. The matter came before a former Prime
                        Minister, which, seeing that a meridian line on a map appeared to bring the
                        region in question within the British frontier, decided that this imaginary
                        line should form the boundary. He did not enquire whether the line was
                        correctly placed, bat thought it was all right because it was on the map,
                        just-aa the old woman thought a story was true because it was in print When
                        the country came to be surveyed it was found that the chosen meridian did
                        not give us the | required region, and much injury and embar- rassment were
                        the consequence. No future Prime Minister, who had gone through a course of
                        surveying and map-making at Cam bridge, could be guilty of snob a blander.
                        Another illustration of the disastrous consequences of ignorance was
                        afforded by the Foreign Office. Great Britain possesses a great dependency
                        in the East, but on its coast there is a small district occupied by a
                        foreign power about two miles in extent Absolutely useless to its possessor,
                        it was a serious incon- venience to us because malefactors constantly
                        escaped over the border, and could not be brought to justice. During the war
                        this district was taken by us, and became part of oar great dependency. But
                        when terms of peace were arranged our Minister for Foreign Affairs, in total
                        ignorance of its position and of the importance of its retention, ceded it
                        to the Power that had previously held it He did so thinking it was a small
                        West Indian island of no consequence. Thus the incon- venience of the proper
                        administration of the country was continued.</p>
                    <p>A much more recent instance of the urgent need that a knowledge of geography
                        should it be possessed by oar raters was shown in the case of the Chumbi
                        Valley, respecting which Sir Frank Young husband made a well considered
                        treaty with the ruling lamas of Tibet Thin “excellent clause in the treaty
                        was disallowed, and its adoption was censured at home because Ministers were
                        ignorant of the position and history of the Chumbi Valley, and of the race
                        to which its inhabitants belong. They thought it was in Tibet It has been
                        occupied for some if years by aggressive lamas, bat is entirely or the

                            improved position of the old reserve, which has increased since our last
                            by over £ ,000,000 to £21,672,620. The ratio pf reserve to liabilities

                        <p>With reference to the £1,000,000 of gold which we mentioned last week as
                            likely to be taken for Egypt on its way westward, it is now question
                            whether this may not be reduced y £100,000. At the time of writing there
                            is boot £1,800,000 in gold on the way to this I country, of which about
                            one quarter is doe to arrive next week. Unless a larger demand for
                            shipment than is anticipated at the moment, eta in, we may expect to see
                            a further im- provement in next week’s figures. After the announcement
                            that no change was made in the I lank rate, the Consols market hardened
                            1/14 But the gilt-edged securities barely responded to the improved
                            monetary position. There is no change in these worthy of note since last
                            I week, for those who are prepared to look np I heir money, and be
                            content in the meantime I nth a low rate of interest, Consols at the
                            pre- sent prices should certainly afford a good opportunity of making a
                            considerable profit after the turn of the year.</p>

                        <p>With reference to the Egyptian market, there is nothing new to report
                            here. The shares of the National Bank are quoted to- day at 27 1/4 and
                            those of the Agricultural Bank at 9 13/15 There has been soma little
                            demand for the latter during the week. The shares of the New Egyptian
                            Company have come into prominence and are distinctly a harder market at
                            If. It is anticipated that the report which is due next month will be of
                            an encouraging nature. Delta Land shares are being quietly bought np in

                        <p>In the African mining market nothing that the dealers and financial
                            houses directly connected with the Kaffir circus can devise seems to
                            have any effect upon the public mind. There has been steady selling all
                            the week, one, it is said, to liquidations from Paris, the backwash, no
                            doubt, of the sugar crash, and the result has been that prices Lave been
                            on the downward grade all the time, Rand being well below 8. Trouble is
                            already beginning to be looked for in the coming settlement here next
                            week. Rhode- sians maintained a fairly firm tone, though, acting in
                            sympathy with the depression in the Kaffir market, there was a slight
                            easing off in prices. Rhodesia Exploration lost 8/32 at 3 1/3, but in no
                            other case did the fall exceed 1/14.</p>

                        <p>It was hoped that the Egyptian market would be able to disentangle itself
                            from the results of the general mining market, although at the moment of
                            writing the independent line taken a week ago is not being maintained

                            1/2, but United African Exploration shed 1/32 to 1 21/32. Egyptian
                            Options were also down 1/8 to 7/8 and Egyptian Estates declined" to 1

                    <p>London, October 14.</p>
                    <p>Captain L. 0. FitzM. Stack, Border Regiment Military and Private Secretary to
                        I the Sirdar, has been given the local rank of Major whilst so employed.</p>
                    <p>The vacant majority in the King’s Royal Rifle Corps has been filled by the
                        promotion of Captain Richard Byron, D.S.O. Major Byron has had a variety of
                        active service since he joined the “Green Jackets” in May, 1890. His first
                        was in the Hazara Expedition, 1891, when he was a subaltern of the 1st
                        Battalion, now at Cairo (medal with clasp), and the same year ho was in the
                        Miaranzai Expedition, including the actions of Bangor and Mastan (clasp),
                        and the following year it was farther service in the Isaui Expedition. Ha
                        was orderly officer to Brigadier-General Kinloch in the Chitrail Relief
                        Expedition, 1895, including the capture of the Malakaland Pass, and the
                        engagement at Khar (medal with clasp). He was adjutant on the 9th Battalion
                        (North Cork Rifles) in the late Boer War (mentioned in despatches, medal
                        with four clasps, and D.S.0.)</p>
                    <p>It is stated that the Admiralty is about to make soma very important
                        experiments with I motor-propelled torpedo boats and possibly ''destroyers."
                        One of the drawbacks of these craft is the smoke and flame which belch forth
                        from their funnel* when driven at fall power. This especially after night,
                        when they are most useful, indicates their presence, and of coarse detracts
                        from their striking powers. The ap- plication of a suitable motor would
                        remedy this defect, whilst creating a new one, (or petrol is a ticklish
                        cargo to carry in any dam of ship. It would be more so in a torpedo I boat
                        Russians have experimented success- fully.</p>
                    <p>One of the best known cruisers in the fleet, the Calliope, presently moored
                        in “Rotten Row,’’ at Mother bank, will, it is believed, shortly change
                        hands, as the Spanish Ad- miralty is negotiating for her purchase with I the
                        view of using her as a training ship for naval cadets, a duty she long
                        discharged in our own navy.. The name of the Calliope came into prominence
                        whilst attached to the Pacific Squadron in 1889, by the gallantry and
                        seamanship her skipper, Captain Kane, displayed in tho awful storm at Apia,
                        Samoa Islands, in the March of that year. Captain Kane steamed out to sea in
                        the teeth of the typhoon, and weathered it, whilst the German and Yankee
                        ships, which remained in the har- bour, were blown ashore, or lost The
                        staunch little cruiser which performed this deed was invariably an object of
                        the keenest interest at the ports she visited during her training ser- vice
                        and recruiting service. If only from a sentimental point if view, she should
                        be retained in our fleet as a monument of the seamanship of her Irish
                        captain and the im- plicit obedience of her crew in a crisis which called
                        forth all that is brave and loyal. To I weather the storm her boilers were
                        loaded practically to the bursting point.</p>
