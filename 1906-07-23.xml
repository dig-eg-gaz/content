                    <head> BAGDAD RAILWAY'S FUTURE.</head>
                    <p> The construction of a railway from Kouia to Bagdad by a German syndicate,
                        for which the concession from the Sultan of Turkey was obtained in
                        1903,rapidly approaching comple¬tion, and it is announced on semi-official
                        authority that the whole line can be built without any appeal for foreign
                        financial sup port This line, with its many branches and ramifications, was
                        intended to be an extension in the direction of the Persian ^i‘e jor of th“
                        Anatolian Railway, the concession for which was transferred to the present
                        syndicate by the original' Anatolian Company. </p>
                    <p> This syndi-z cate, it may be added, is composed of some of the wealthiest
                        financial houses in Germany, and is the direct outcome of the visit of the
                        Emperor William to the Sultan in 1898. The first section of the extension
                        towards Bagdad was completed in 1904, and comprised 125 miles of land
                        between Konia and the small settlement of Bregli. </p>
                    <p> The commercial prospects of this extension (says the “Morning Post”) have
                        never been of the brightest, and it seems more than probable that -a good
                        many years will have to elapse before the promoters can receive anything in
                        the way of a re turn for the money they have sunk in the line. Indeed,
                        reviewed from a strictly commercial aspect and leaving all thoughts of the
                        political side of the question out of the reckoning, it seems that this line
                        from Konia to Bagdad will never pay its way, the traffic that is likely to
                        be attracted to the line being insuffcient to pay the ex¬penses of transport
                        This being the case, the ultimate extension of the line from Bagdad to the
                        Persian Golf was bound to take place, and this was probably in the minds of
                        those responsible for the railway when first they took the project in hand. </p>
                    <p> It is, indeed, a paramount necessity. Even granting the fact that the
                        country through which this extension to the Gulf will pass is in some parts
                        little more than a barren desert, the fact that an outlet to the sea will be
                        provided for the trade of the interior greatly improves the chances of the
                        line some day paying its way. </p>
                    <p> Even with this extension in working order, however, the line will have to
                        face the severe competition of the native boatmen on the rivers, who possess
                        at the present time the monopoly of the carrying trade of the Per sian Gulf.
                        Can the railway hope to offer such rates as will induce producers and
                        mer¬chants to patronise it in preference to the somewhat slower river
                        transport ? It seems as though the answer to this question must be in the
                        negative. This trade consists for the most part of grain and grass, balky
                        merchandise to handle, which is now con¬veyed for rates that to the European
                        mind seem impossibly low. </p>
                    <p> If the railway cannot hope to meet this situation, and it is very difficult
                        to see how it can, then the line is foredoomed to failure. </p>
                    <p> The construction of a line from Bagdad being, from the point of view of the
                        conces¬sionaires, absolutely essential, the question of the precise spot on
                        the Gulf where a new mo¬dern port shall be created at once arises, and it is
                        here that future trouble promises to arise. Great Britain is vitally
                        interested in this ques¬tion, and those charged with the protection of her
                        interests cannot possibly allow this matter to escape them. The German
                        syndicate hints at a port on the Khor Abdullah. This is a shallow arm of the
                        Gulf beset with dangerous sand banks, and gradually silting up at the
                        entrance. </p>
                    <p> A more unlikely place for the establishment of a large port it would be
                        almost impossible to imagine. There are at the present time, it is true, a
                        few customs stations maintained along the Khor, but the arrival of a vessel
                        of any size is a matter for languid astonishment on the part of the few
                        local of¬ficials. There can be no doubt that the real objective of the
                        railway is Koweit, and it is certain that every effort will he made to
                        achieve this ambition. At Koweit, however, British interests are supreme,
                        and if a concession of any kind is to be granted there it is surely Great
                        Britain that should receive it. </p>
                    <p> It is per missible under these circumstances to seek from the Government
                        some assurance that no great Continental Power will be permitted to acquire
                        such supremacy there, at the head of the Persian Gulf, that it will be able
                        to create, without let or hindrance a first class port and coaling station
                        for its fleat, as Koweit stands on the very threshold of India, Bombay being
                        less than four days' steaming from it. </p>
                    <p> The Khor Abdullah has absolutely nothing to commend it to the notice of
                        modern engineers seeking to form and develop a port at which the largest
                        vessels might call, and its utter worthlessness in this respect cannot but
                        create suspicion that Germany has some unannounced motive in expressing her
                        desires to form the terminus of her great railway line there. There is,
                        indeed, every promise of a stern diplomatic struggle between England and
                        Germany over this question. After its experiences in regard to Morocco,
                        Germany, it is only reasonable to suppose, will not he too anxious to repeat
                        the experiment of an In¬ternational Commission, and, probably, armed with a
                        concession to create an independent port on the Khor Abdullah, Germany will
                        approach England with suggestion that this should be discarded for a line to
                        Koweit, to be controlled by Germany and Great Britain jointly. Great
                        Britain, however, will need to be very careful in considering any such
                        pro¬posals should they be put forward, since under the most favourable
                        circumstances the line cannot possibly pay its way for many years to come,
                        possibly >not for a generationkso that the advantage to England would be
                        absolutely nothing. If the German syndicate is convinced that the line can
                        be made pay able by using the route from Bagdad to the Khor Abdullah, then
                        we can raise small objection to its trying the experiment, but any proposal
                        for Koweit to be converted into the terminus of this railway line, even with
                        the joint control of England and Germany, most be sternly resisted. No
                        possible advan¬tage to Great Britain can possibly accrue from it, and the
                        formation of a great coaling station at Koweit would be a standing menace to
                        the integrity of our Indian Empire. ></p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Under the heading of "Metamorphosis of a Yacht,” the "Evening Standard and
                        St. James’s Gazette” says The paddle yacht Mahroussa, which was built by the
                        old Thames firm of Samuda Bros, for the Khedive Ismail in 1865, has just
                        been transformed on the Clyde by Messrs. A. and J. Inglis into a turbine
                        vessel of handsome proportions and luxurious accommo¬dation. </p>
                    <p> The large paddle boxes have been removed, and the antique stern, with its
                        galle¬ries, has been altered to accommodate the latest type of engine. </p>
                    <p> Theoperation has revealed the perfection of the old workmanship, for, when
                        the hull was gutted not a single plate or rivet had to be renewed. </p>
                    <p> On three previous occasions the yacht was altered, and the work upon her
                        during forty years’ service may be said to epitomise the development of the
                        steam ship. </p>
                    <p> She is 4OOft in length, 42ft. in breadth, and 29ft. in depth, and the three
                        turbines of the Parsons type will give a speed of over 16 knots.</p>
                    <p> Motor Bus Accident</p>
                    <p> Our attention has been drawn to some erroneous statements made by a Cairo
                        morning oontemporary under the heading of "Collision d’Automobiles.” </p>
                    <p> The accident referred to, which occured on the Ramleh road, was duly
                        re¬ported by us. According to our informant the responsibility for the
                        collision lies entirely with the chauffeur of the privately-owned auto
                        mobile. </p>
                    <p> The police inquiries, which took place immediately after the', accident, and
                        also the following day on the site of the accident, resulted in ascribing
                        the fault as above. </p>
                    <p> The motor omnibus was proceeding on the right of the road at a speed of less
                        than 10 kilo metres an hour,and the private automobile was behind the 'bus. </p>
                    <p> The chauffeur of the former declared to the police that the automobile was
                        going at the rate of 40 kilometres an hour. At the turning of the road
                        leading into Ibrahimieb, the private automobile went off the road on the
                        sidewalk, ran against a tree (pieces of the latter are in the hands of the
                        police), and then went straight into the omnibus, passed on and stopped on
                        the other ride walk in front of a beer garden belong¬ing to the Crown
                        Brewery. </p>
                    <p> The omnibus at the time of the accident was full of passengers. The
                        chauffeurs engaged by the Egyptian Motor Traction Co. moat, we are informed,
                        all go through a course of instruction in driving, and be passed by the
                        police as competent before taking sole charge of an omnibus.</p>

                    <p> MORE or MR. DILLON.</p>
                    <p> In the House of Commons last week Mr. Dillon asked the Secretary for Foreign
                        Affairs whether he had any official information to the effect that a native
                        had been killed by British soldiers near the village of Sersina on June 13th
                        last ; whether a secret military inquiry was now being held ; and, if so,
                        why the enquiry was secret, and why was it not he'd by the ordinary
                        tribunal. Mr. Runciman : The dead body of a native was discovered at
                        Sersina, and it was alleged that the deceased had been chased and struck by
                        two soldiers. As British o’diers are only amenable to martial law in Egypt,
                        the matter has been dealt with by a military court of inquiry, but the
                        information obtained does not point to the conclusion that the man was
                        killed by a soldier, I believe that such inquiries are not usually held in
                        public. ’J HE DENI8HWAI AFFRAY.</p>
                    <p> Mr, Runoiman, replying to Mr. Dillon, who asked questions regarding the
                        measures adopt¬ed against the villagers of Denishwai in conse¬quence of the
                        events of June 13th, said the village of Denishwai had been deprived of an
                        omdih, and had been attached to the adjacent village of Abu Kullos. The
                        former village watchman had been dismissed, and other watchmen sent from
                        Cairo to take their places. The Secretary for Foreign Affairs hoped to be
                        able to lay the papers upon the table soon. The detailed account of the
                        evidence would, however, not be included, as there had not yet been time to
                        translate it.</p>
                    <p> We are authorised to state that the expenses in connection with the
                        Denishwai trial amount¬ed to L E. 774 66m. only. This dispels of the
                        fantastic figures published by the native papers, some of which related that
                        the ex¬penses amounted to L.B. 12,000. “A1 Moayad” is in error in stating
                        that the "Egyptian Gazette” was the first to publish the latter figure.</p>

                        NECESSITY FOR REPRESSIVE MEASURES.</head>
                    <p> Writing to Sir Edward Grey on May 21 last with references to the Boundary
                        dispute, Lord Cromer says : — In a separate despatch of to-day’s date I
                        dwell on the feelings which recent events had evoked amongst the Moslem
                        population of this country. I may perhaps with advantage add a few remarks
                        on this subject. It is perfectly natural that an Opposition should exist in
                        Egypt. Moreover, in view of the full liberty granted to the press, of the
                        stimulus which for the last twenty years and more has been given to
                        education, and of the fact that the new generation are only very partially
                        acquainted with the abuses of the past, it can be DO matter for surprise
                        that the leaders of the Opposition should for the most part be ambitious
                        young men with a very superficial acquaintance with public affairs, and with
                        very little serious sense of responsibility. The. point, however, which is
                        worthy of attention is not so much the existence of an opposition, to which
                        no reasonable objection can be urged, but rather the grounds on which the
                        opposition mainly bases its attacks. The enormous material benefits
                        con¬ferred on Egypt by the British occupation are so patent to all the world
                        that criticism in that direction, save perhaps on some very minor points of
                        detail, is debarred. Endeavours have, indeed, been made to show that moral
                        progress has been neglected, more especially in the matter of education; but
                        here also the facts speak for themselves, and they are so strong as to be
                        incapable of distortion by misrepresentation, however gross, The attempt to
                        create a National party by de¬manding an extension of parliamentary
                        insti¬tutions has been made, but has met with no hearty response. The time
                        has not yet arrived when an idea so eminently exotic can take firm root
                        amongst the Egyptians. Moreover, although they may be unwilling to express
                        their opinions openly, the whole of the thinking and intelligent portion of
                        the native population are fully aware that, under existing institutions,
                        full opportunity is given for an expression of their opinions, and that any
                        radical change of system would be premature, if not absolutely dangerous. In
                        default of these ordinary, and relatively unobjectionable, methods of
                        attack, the Egypt¬ian opposition is almost necessarily obliged to resort to
                        the use of an instrument which, more especially in dealing with a Moslem
                        population, most of whom are in a very back¬ward state of education, is
                        certainly more effective than any other—they appeal to reli¬gious
                        fanaticism. In this despatch, most of which, I may observe, has been drafted
                        by Mr. Fiud’ay, of whose assistance daring the recent crisis I cannot apeak
                        too highly, incidental allusion has been made to the writings of the Pan-
                        Islamic press. I am aware that even the most violent of these newspapers
                        occasionally make use of a few conventional phrases exhort¬ing Moslems to
                        remain calm ; but half hearted advice of this sort, which is merely given
                        for the sake of appearances, does not explain away the fact that the general
                        tendency of the writing, which has for some long time past appeared in these
                        papers, has been of a nature to inflame Moslem sentiment against Christians
                        and Europeans. Further, there can be no doubt that this writing has not been
                        discouraged, even if it has not been actually encouraged, by many persons
                        occupying very high positions both inside and outside Egypt. That these
                        utteraces have produced a certain amount of effect, more especially on the
                        more ignorant classes in the large towns, cannot be doubted. Many will ask
                        why should not these news¬papers be suppressed, more especially as the
                        existing law, although it has for a long time been allowed to remain in
                        abeyance, furnishes the Government with complete powers to sup press them I
                        If I allude to this subject, it is mainly because the view generally taken
                        as regards the liberty of the press in Egypt by those most
                        interested—namely, the Egyptians themselves—is so wholly different from that
                        which most Europeans, and notably most of my own countrymen, would think
                        that they should take, that a few words of explanation will perhaps not be
                        out of place. The ordinary English idea, I conceive, is that the Egyptians
                        value the full liberty now allowed to the press, and would resent any
                        measure tending to impose restrictions on that liberty. My strong belief is
                        that the Egyptian view, though it would probably not find expression in any
                        of the vernacular papers, is quite different. In my Report for the year 1904
                        ("Egypt No. 1, of 1905," p. 58) I alluded to the fact that in 1902, and
                        again in 1904, the Egyptian General Assembly urged the Government to take
                        strong action against the press. I have talked to scores of Egyptians on
                        this subject, and I have heard their views through many other sour¬ces. I do
                        not think I have ever heard a single expression of opinion in favour of the
                        liberty, degenerating into licence, which the vernacular press now enjoys.
                        On the other hand, I have been urged over and over again to adopt repressive
                        measures. The truth is that British policy in this matter is not understood.
                        AN educated native said a short time ago to a high British official in the
                        Sudan, " I cannot ></p>

                    <p> Religious fanaticism and ‘’the Legislative Council's new paper have engaged
                        the attention of "Al-Muayad's” representative in Cairo, who has had, within
                        the last few days, a series of interviews with several distinguised
                        inhabitants —Moslom and Christian—of Cairo. The follow ing is a summary of
                        fifteen columns of interviews published in the last two issues of
                        ,PA1-Moayad,” as leading articles. Religions fanaticism does not exist in
                        Egypt, according to the view of several of the notables interviewed, "We
                        have seen no signs of fanati¬cism in Egypt," said Sayid Omar Mokarram, but
                        it is not impossible that the Governmenthas got evidence to prove that
                        fanaticism does exist in this country. ‘ The opinion of the Govern¬ment
                        should be known as regards this.” Negnib Pasha Shakhour points out that
                        there is no unusual trouble arising from fanaticism in the country. In any
                        differences which sometimes occur between natives and Europeans in Egypt the
                        former always rely on the Tribunals. "We read and hear about inci¬dents
                        taking place” every where in the world,” continued Shakhour Pasha, “and we
                        may remark that the incidents which often occur at Montmartre, near Paris,
                        ate altogether more serious than those which take place in Egypt; and as
                        long I would rather pass alone at night through Sharia El Nabhaseen and the
                        Saida Zenab quarter than through the Montmartre streets, I can never believe
                        that any fanaticism exists in this country, "Fanaticism in Egypt," says
                        Iskander Bey Ammoun, advocate of Cairo, “is much less apparent than in any
                        other part of the Orient. The fanaticism which is a result of ignorance
                        exists generally in the East" “Oriental Moslems and Christians are all
                        fanatical,” says M. Habib Lutfatls, a notable of Syrian origin,*liv ing in
                        Cairo. THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL’S PAPER. George Eff. Zaidan, proprietor of
                        "Al Hilal,” is of opinion that the nation wants a univer¬sity more than it
                        does a big paper, "The Legislative Council's paper would have been entitled
                        “Al-Umma” (The Nation) had not another paper already taken the same name,”
                        says Basili Pasha Tadros. "The na¬tion's paper,” continued the Pasha, “is
                        not the Legislative Council's one, as only 10 members of the SO who compose
                        the Council own the new organ.” Sayed Omar Mokarram declares that the new
                        paper,which will be managed by the Legis¬lative Council, can produce no more
                        effect than the Council itself: it cannot do anything for the public welfare
                        which the Council itself is unable to do.></p>

                    <p>The annual distribution of prizes took place yesterday afternoon under the
                        presidency of M. Pierre Girard, the French Consul General, and in the
                        presence of a large and distinguish¬ed company. The distribution was
                        preceded by two plays * King Alfred” (in English) by Dr. A'kin, and “Le
                        premier triomphe de Dagoes- clin"—an operette in one aot by H.
                        Depfives.></p>
                    <p>The English play was one proof the more of the remarkable progress made by
                        the college in teaching the language; both in point of pro¬nunciation—always
                        a stambling-blook—and grammar, the actors, no less than their precep- tors,
                        deserved our most hearty congratulation. The name of King Alfred is one ever
                        dear to Anglo Saxon hearts ; when reproduced by aliens and under the shadow
                        of the exotic palm, the hero of our national history appeals even more so.
                        The only Unit to be found was in the acting of the part of the historical
                        burnt oakes. History sayeth that the King was severely chidden for his
                        neglect ; but in yesterday's play the Royal guest escaped the scolding. The
                        title role was taken by M. F. Kayat, M. A. Balbay was the farmer, andM.
                        Gorodissky was his son George. “The Triumph of Duguesclin” introduc¬ed us to
                        the good old days and scenes of baron outlawry in Brittany. Bertrand Du-
                        guesolin (M. N. Zahar) is the son of a Norman nobleman (M. G. Soussa).
                        Chafing at the insult of one of the domestics he flees the castle and forms
                        a roving band of youths of his companionship, who are the terror of the
                        country. They capture a robber and bring. him prisoner to an inn kept by a
                        cowardly aubergist, who is the fun of the p'ay. In the midst of the trial of
                        their captive Baron Duguesclin enters to arrest his errant son, who however
                        is pardoned on account of his bravery, and so the whole troop, arrayed in
                        the bravery of the middle ages, march off triumphant. The musical part of
                        the entertainment was supplied by the college orchestra, who were up to
                        their usual high standard. In connexion with the prizes an exhibition of
                        work by the scholars was held, and included a number of very excellent
                        drawings and plans></p>

                        terminating in an easy win for The Heat, for whom Marsden and Mustard hit
                        very freely, especially on the leg side, though both had a great deal of
                        luck. The bad fielding of The Rest was remarkable, and very probably cost
                        them the game. BThe batting of The Rest was as bad M some of their fielding.
                        Mention must, however, be made of the good work in the field done by W. E.
                        Peel and H. P. Carver and the fine catch at point that dismissed Mustard.

                    <p> The Egyptian State Railways have the ho- nour to inform the public that, to
                        avoid overcrowding of the Railway goods platforms during the Cotton Season,
                        and the confusion necessarily resulting therefrom, the following regulations
                        will be enforced: "1—All consignments must be separated from one another by
                        a minimum distance of two feet. "2—Consignments must be well arranged and
                        stacked together. "3—When one lot of consignments has been received and
                        stacked on one platform no more will be allowed to be placed on that
                        platform until there is vacant space, ie., all stacking of subsequent
                        consignments on the top of these already existing will be prohibited. "4 — A
                        sufficient space must be l left on each platform as a roadway for carts.
                        'Should the Railways find that these are rangemonts are not being carried
                        out, and that tbere is confusion amongst the consign- ments, notice is her,
                        by given that in such a case the gates of the station will be shut, and no
                        more consignments will be accepted until the platforms are empty, and there
                        after receipt will only be given for the amount of goods for which wagons
                        are avail- able each day. ‘ The Railways invite the co-operation of the
                        public in carrying out these regulations which will avert the irregularities

                        <p> Major W. F. Elmslie, Lancashire Fusiliers, has been selected for the
                            appointment of second in command of the 2nd Battalion^ Fermoy, and
                            returns from the 3rd Battalion, Pretoria, to take up his duties. He is

                    <head>ARMY AND NAVY. POSSIBILITIES OF THE SUDAN.</head>
                    <p> We have called the following from one of the many London financial papers,
                        and re¬produce it for what it is worth. </p>
                    <p> The author seems to have some very elastic ideas </p>
                    <p> Sudan as an agricultural land presents a large field for safe and sound
                        investment. The agricultural land of Sudan is by far superior to the land of
                        Egypt, and it is hoped by everybody that it will make a better and more sure
                        progress. </p>
                    <p> The Sudan Delta, which is very large in ares, is fertile and promising, to
                        such an extent that it makes one forget the land of Egypt and expect great
                        things for Sudan. The Government, after connecting Sudan with Egypt by the
                        railway started by Lord Kitchener, and with Europe by the Nile and Red Sea
                        Railway, is hurrying up in crossing the different parts of the country with
                        the rail lines. She also projects to cross Sudan Delta with one or two
                        canals for a dis¬tance of about 600 miles and last year sent a
                        representative to America to study the latest methods of excavation, so that
                        she might employ them in this great enterprise. That Sudan is going to
                        surpass Egypt is quite beyond doubt, and I might mention Khartoum, the
                        capital of the country, as a striking evidence. This city, though it is only
                        about five years old, has attained comparative¬ly a wonderful success, and
                        the price of its land has risen a hundred and two hundred per cent. </p>
                    <p> The city is quite modern in its arrange¬ments, and the avenues, which
                        represent the British flag, are beautiful, spacious, symmetric cal, and wall
                        constructed. It is recognised by all visitors as having, except in America,
                        no parallel as a modern city in its sanitary arrange¬ment and beauty .of
                        avenues, and I presume that it is this which has resulted in the rise in the
                        price of land. </p>
                    <p> Khartoum Land Values. </p>
                    <p> The square metre is sold now from 12s. to £4, and it is believed by many to
                        be a very low price still in comparison with the success expected for the
                        country. Although now the land of this promising city is seized firmly by
                        financiers and companies , yet there are still some central and first-class
                        pieces, which with some skill and endeavour can be bought from Egyptian and
                        Sudanese owners. As an agricul¬tural land, Sudan undoubtedly is very much
                        superior to Egypt or any other agricultural country. Various English and
                        Egyptian finan¬ciers are flocking to the Sudan, and rushing upon its land,
                        but the Government is against speculation and she does her best to
                        discourage them, and the only financiers and companies who are doing real
                        business are those who have got permanent representatives in the country to
                        watch the affairs and </p>
                    <p> Seize the opportunities when they occur. By the way, as to the land
                        question, I should not omit to mention Cyprus —an island in the eastern
                        basin of the Mediterranean, between 30° 33' and 35° 41' north latitude, and
                        between 32’ 20' and 40° 33' east longitude, about 200 miles from Port Said.
                        It is the third largest island in the Mediterranean. I was very much
                        impressed on visiting the island *last summer by the cheapness of its land.
                        The Government(English)has constructed a railway from Famagusta, the
                        intended port of the island,to Nicosia.its capital,and is constructing a
                        port in Famagusta. As yet the people there are asleep, and the land of
                        Famagusta is still very cheap. The agricultural land is also good and cheap.
                        Famagusta, which, as it is ru¬moured, is becoming a head port and a naval
                        station, is a very ancient and historically interesting city. Its old ruins,
                        when they become known to tourists,are alone sufficient to secure for it a </p>
                    <p> Rapid and Prosperous Growth, </p>
                    <p> The island, on the whole, might be said to be very interesting. Its summer
                        resort, Mount Troodos, is fascinating, being a forest of pines, and its top,
                        which is called Mount Olympus, is about 6500 ft. above sea level,
                        overlooking beautiful scenery. 7 at I saw in the island, I had every
                        evidence it is going to grow, and that the cheapness of its lands at present
                        gives a most lucrative opportunity. Sir William Wilcocks, in his capacity as
                        chairman of the Anglo-Egyptian Land Allotment Company, only a few months
                        since introduced to the island the enterprise of Establishing an
                        Agricultural Bank at Famagusta similar to the Agricultural Bank of Egypt.
                        Sir W. Wilcocks also bought some thirty thousand acres of land from the
                        Govern¬ment, and he is introducing important irriga¬tion works to the island
                        ; but the opportunities there are still abundant, as the natives are deeply
                        asleep.></p>

                        celui-ci n'opère bien que lorsqu'il est pris avec de bons aliments et des
                        boissons fortifiantes, telles que vin, café, thé. Chacun choisit, pour se

                        occupations. La fatigue de la purgation étant annulée par l'effet de la
                        bonne alimentation, on se décide aisément à recommencer autant de fois que
