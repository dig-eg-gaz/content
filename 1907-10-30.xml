                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed to
                        Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel accommodation
                        for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr. Najem Houry
                        proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the sea. Magnificent
                        Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For information apply to
                        Mr. Najem Houry, Managing Director of Cyprus Hotel Co., Army Contractor,
                        Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia (on Railway) to
                        Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin Cathedral (now a mosque)
                        begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with other ancient ruins and the
                        Venetian fortifications, the finest in the world. Also the tower or palace, the

                    <head>MR. W. T. STEAD'S NEW APOSTOLATE. </head>
                    <p>Mr. W. T. Stead believes that it is of little use for the Hague Conference to come to cer. certain decisions if mankind in general knows nothing about them. He advocates, therefore, that a world-wide mission or apostolate should be set on foot which would utilise the services of the best known citizens of the world in a combined appeal to the nations of the world.</p>
                    <p>"As a beginning," says Mr. Stord, "I have proposed that a company of twelve representative persons chosen from As many nationalities should next March start from Europe</p> 
                <cb n="2"/>                    
                    <p>for a pilgrimage round South America, visiting every Republic which expresses A desire to receive the international postles. The journey would last for four months, the actual contract cost of mail and railway fare would be under £120, but the hotel bill would double that amount, 80 that allowing for contingencies, the cost per head would be under £500. Wa have already received Assurances of a warm welcome from most of the South American Republics, and it is already clear that we should suffer from an embarrassment of riches in the shape of offers of hospitable receptions from Caracas in the North to Valparaiso in the South.</p>
                    <p>"The fundamental idea of the Pilgrimage is that it is a mission charged with the duty of explaining the importance of the principles of the Hague Conference with the authority that Attaches to a group of distinguished men who would be a microcosm of the human race. It would be an informal International Commission constantly on circuit to ascertain what has been done to give effect to the conventions and væux of the Hague Conference, and to form in every capital which it visits local centres of International Union, composed of men and women who are prepared to co-operate on the broad general principles of the Hague.</p>
                    <p>"The proclamation of the great truth - the Federation of the World--is at hand, and the preaching of a definite practical daty resulting therefrom will elicit extraordinary enthusiasm everywhere, especially among the youth of the colleges and of the schools. The doctrine of the unity of the human family is as capable of kindling the ardoar of youth as was the doo trine of the unity of Italy when preached by Mazzini.</p>
                    <p>"And as the International Pilgrimage goes from capital to capital it will everywhere flush the brillant light of this high ideal upon the eyes of men, and at the same time it will explain the definite practical duties laid down at the Hague, the performance of which will hasten its realisation. The mere conception of the Governments undertaking the duties hitherto left to peace societies, the possibility of a policy of active promotion of brotherly relations with all nations, instead of actively preparing to defend yourself against all nations, is enough to make the success of the Pilgrimage.</p>
                    <p>"For the South American Pilgrimage we have already begun to make recruits among the delegates now at the Hague . . . so that the nucleus of the expedition is already in existence."</p>
                    <p>"From South America we have received assurances of the heartiest welcome from Mexico, Salvador, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Brazil, Urugаay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Argentine, Hayti, San Domingo.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Drago, the eminent jurist, who represents the Argentine Republic at the Conference, writes :-"I have read with very great interest your articles concerning a projected pilgrimage of eminent persons through South America, which would make known and explain the principles proclaimed by the Second Peace Conference in order by that means to favour the rapprochement of the peoples. It could not have a mission more elevated or more noble. The peace of the world will be obtained much sooner by the incessant propaganda of the ideas of fraternity and concord than by the formulas of the Foreign Offices."</p>

                    <head>CAIRO POLICE SCHOOL.</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian police, like every other body of public servants, are from time to time subjected to criticism not always of the kindest nature. Occasionally it is deserved, sometimes it is not, but whatever may have been the shortcomings of the service in the past, an enquiry into the working system of the police school in Cairo should be sufficient to convince the most pessimistic, that, if training and discipline count for anything, the cadets of this year will be turned out as thoroughly efficient policemen in the next.</p>
                    <p>It has been said that the police force is composed for the most part of boys of 16 or 17 years, who have received only the most superficial training before being placed on duty as finished constables. Nothing could be further from the truth. There is not a constable cadet in the school who is under the age of 18 years, the boys are carefully chosen with regard to both physical and mental standard, and are subjected to a stiff medical examination before being allowed to enter the school for training.</p>
                    <p>No doubt as to the physical fitness of those in training could be entertained by any one who has visited the school and watched the cadet officers and constables on drill, while their mental capacity is vouched for by the fact that every cadet constable in training is in possession of the secondary school certificate, and though the medium of instruction is of course the Arabic language, about ten per cent of the cadets possess a working knowledge of some European tongue, an advantage which cannot be too highly estimated in view of the manifold duties which they are called upon to perform.</p>
                    <p>The school was started on its present lines in 1900, and it is interesting to mark the enormous development which has taken place since that time when the number of cadets was only ten, whereas at the present time its establishment consists of 68 cadet officers, and 300 cadet constables. There has also been an extraordinary increase in the number of candidates for admission to the school daring the past two years, for at the last entrance examination no less than 1275 candidates presented themselves for admission, against 400 the previous year.</p>
                    <p>This increase is largely due to the fact that the director of the school made &amp; personal inspection of the provinces with a view to recruiting the best men available, &amp; course which has in its results proved to be a most wise one, as the standard of physique obtaining among the cadets of this year is an exceptionally high one, and the class of man generally good, cases of breach of discipline being practically unknown.</p>
                    <p>The period of training is for cadet officers two years, and that for cadet constables has recently been increased from six and a half to eight months, and while the varied nature of a constable's duties naturally demand long service and experience before he can be considered to have throughly mastered his work, the instruction afforded by the school is the most excellent grounding he could have before he is called upon to act for himself in the larger school of the streets.</p>
                    <p>The anthropometric statistics issued by the school are very gratifying as shewing the improvement achieved after six months of training, and the general health of the cadets has been good.</p>
                    <p>Of the 800 men now onder training as constables only 78 were drawn from Cairo and 2 from Alexandria, the remainder being all brought from the provinces.</p>

                    <head>OASIS OF SIWA.</head>
                    <p>IMPORTANT FRENCH EXPEDITION.</p>
                    <p>A French archaeological expedition will go to the Oasis of Siwa in the course of the coming winter in order to excavate in and about the site of the oracle of Jupiter Ammon, 30 renowned throughout the ancient world. No systematic excavations have ever yet been undertaken there and it is expected that the French archaeologists will be richly rewarded by their journey to this remote corner of Egypt. The head of the expedition will be the Vicomte de Mathuisieulx, who has had considerable experience in North Africa. Two years ago, it will be remembered, he made a bold journey through the wildest part of the hinterland of Tripoli and thereby much annoyed the Italiang, who hope to have the reversion or that country and were afraid that France was contemplating some political design in the person of the adventurous Viscount.</p>
                    <p>The ancients speak of three things as remarkable in the basis : first, a well, called the Well of the Sun, of which the water was warm in the morning and evening, and cold at mid-day (Herod., iv. 181; Diodor., xvii. 50 ; Lucr., vi. 849, &amp;c.; Pomp. Melo, i. 8); secondly, a large palace of the ancient kings of the Ammonians, which was surrounded by a triple wall, and situated in the centre of the OASIA (Diodor., xvii, 50); and thirdly, the temple of Jupiter Ammon, which was surrounded by a shady grove. Cambyses made an unsuccessful attempt to take the Ammonium (Herod., iii. 25); and it was visited by Alexander the Great. In the reign of the Ptolemies and under the Romans tip oasis belonged to that nomos or province which was called Libya (Ptolem., iv. 5). In the time of Strabo xvii. p. 813) the oracle was almost entirely neglected. In the middle Ages the Arabs called this oasis Santariah.</p>
                    <p>The Ammonium, during its most flourishing state in ancient times, seems to have been well peopled ; and the inhabitants, who lived in villages, are said to have consisted of three distinct tribes. The southern and western parts were inhabited by Æthiopians, the middle part by the Nasamones, and the north by a nomade tribe of Libyans. The description which Diodorus gives of the beautiful climate of the oasis, and of its fertility, especially in frnit, is still applicable to it; nearly the whole oasis forms an uninterrupted succession of fields, and palm-groves; and the gardens produce an abundance of the most delicious fruits. The water however is said to be injurious to camels.</p>
                    <p>The present inhabitants consist chiefly of Berbers mixed with negroes, and are very zealous Mohamedans. The principal place in it bears the name of Siwa. This town and several other smaller places in the oasis are built upon eminences, and surrounded by walls to protect them from bostile inroade. The housos are all wretched huts, and the streets are narrow and dark.</p>
                    <p>Ruins of the ancient temple of Ammon are still visible. The paintings, sculptures, and hieroglyphics which remain on the walls, are copied and described in the work of Minutoli. There are also ruins of other places, especially in the neighbourhood of the modern village of Shargiah, which probably mark the sites of the ancient villages. The Well of the Sun is near Shargiah, and is still remarkable for its varying temperature. Catacombs cut in the rocks have been discovered in four different parts of the oasis.</p>

                <head>DENISHWAI PRISONERS.</head>
                <p>APPEAL FOR RELEASE</p>
                <p>SIR E. GREY'S REPLY.</p>
                <p>The following is the copy of a memorial to Sir Edward Grey on behalf of the Denishwat prisoners, with Sir Edward Grey's reply.</p>
                <p>Right Hon. Sir Edward Grey, M.P, etc.,</p>
                <p>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.</p>
                <p>Sir,-We, the undersigned, respectfully invite you to consider the advisability of an immediate release of the persons concerned in an assault on certain British officers near the village of Denishwai on Wednesday, 13th June, 1906.</p>
                <p>The impression under which public opinion was reconciled to the Depishwai sentences (always excepting the resort to flogging which many Englishmen consider inadmissible under apy circumstances) has been completely changed by the publication of the official papers (White Papers, Egypt, 1906, Nos. 3 and 4). I That impression was that a party of British officers had been attacked without provocation in an Egyptian village, and one of them pat to death in an outburst of anti-English prejudice and Moslom fanaticism.</p>
                <p>The White Papers prove that the affair had no political or religious significance, that the officers thoughtlessly gave very serious provocation ; that those officers who did not escape were rescued from the mob by the sheikhs and gaffirs of the village and sent on to the British camp ; that the deceased officer, who took to flight, died of sunstroke at a considerable distance from Denishwai : that one of the prisoners, now undergoing sentence of penal servitude for life, assaulted the officers under a reasonable (though mistaken) impression that the wound his wife had received in consequence of the discharge of Lieutenant Porter's gun was fatal ; and that, in short, nothing had happened that might not have been expected in any British village if a shooting party of foreigners, ignorant of our language and customs, had begun to shoot the domestic animals and farm stock under the impression that they were fere naturæ.</p>
                <p>When we add that the tribunal which awarded the sentences of hanging (4), flogging (8), penal servitude for life (2), and á number of shorter sentences, including one for 15 years, was constituted in a manner altogether repugnant to British practice, in that there was no jury, we have said enough to show how strong and justifiable the feeling in Egypt (and in the British Isles) is against the sentences, and how many of our countrymen are deeply discouraged, as long as the sentences are maintained, in their faith in the impartiality, equity, and humanity of the British administration in Egypt.</p>
                <p>We deeply regret that the severest sentences are beyond recall; the hangings and floggings | are irrevocable ; but we would urge you to remember that every day's delay creates an impression unfavourable to the Foreign Office and to British justice in Egypt.</p>
                <p>Under these circumstances, without asking you to retract your personal support of what we may call the official view of the calamitous incident at Denishwai, we do venture most strongly to press upon yon, Sir, the necessity of relieving the present strain and anxiety by the speedy release of the prisoners from an imprisonment which has already lasted fifteen months.-- We have the honour to be, Sir, your most obedient, humble servants.</p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN COTTON IN SIND.</head>
                    <p>A favourable view of the prospects of Egyptian cotton in Sind is expressed in an official report recently published. The Bombay Government acknowledge their obligation to the enterprise of the Abmedabad firms who made arrangements to bny the Sind cotton of last year's crop, thus enabling the Zamindars to receive the encouragement of a good price. They also express their obligations to the Jamrao Colonisation Officer and the Commissioner in Sind. It appears that the only failure so far in the experimente has been duo to the ravages of the boll-worm, which ruined a large portion of last year's crop. The authorities have, however, started a campaign against the insect, and have arranged to assist Zamindars in the selling of their produce on the same lines as last year. Given ono thoroughly good year, the official view is that nothing can prevent Egyptian cotton in Sind going forward ; but whether the improvement of cotton will lead to the supply of Lancashire is believed to be a very doubtful question.</p>

                        <p>Dear Sir, I notice in your issue of to-day a statement with reference to the Skye Meeting held at the Alexandria Sporting Club on the 26th inst. You mention that an objection had been lodged against Radium by the rider of Khadronf in the 5th Race, which was upheld by the stewards. Having taken a ticket on Khadrouf for a win I should very much like to known what claim I have against the stewards of the A S.C. for allowing the Parimutuel to pay on Radium before the objection lodged against this horse had been rejected or sustained ?</p>

                        <p>To The Editor of The "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE"</p>
                        <p>Sir,-A few days ago you dealt with the subject of the claims of the Cypriot Greeks to union with Greece and remarked that the Turks in that island were fully justified in strongly opposing any such preposterous idea. The matter cannot claim to belong to practical politics, but as the "Egyptian Gazette" is largely read in Cyprus it is worth noting in your columns the following paragraph in the "Times," :-</p>
                        <p>Mr. Halil Halid writes from 28, Trumpington-street, Cambridge, on October 15 enclosing translations of two letters just received from "Cretan dignitaries," who draw attention to the encreasing frequency of outrages committed upon the Musulman inhabitants of the island. They declare that these outrages occur more frequently in the British zone than elsewhere. They are unable to get any redress from the Greek authorities. One of the correspondente saya "Musulmans are practically besieged in the towns and suffering great hardships, being frequently reduced to absolute destitution. Any Musulman who ventures out of a town to look after what farm or garden or field still remains in his possession does so at the risk of his life. Daring the month which has just passed the number of Musulmans murdered in cold blood, was - in Candia, eight; in Rethimo, one, in Canea, two." The other correspondent remarks, "All these savageries are committed by the Greeks in order to compel us to abandon oor estates and to leave the island." Mr. Halid observes that "it is a pity that the four Great Powers, which forcibly sovered Crete from the Ottoman Empire because the Sultan's rule in Crete was not humane or just, should have left the administration of Cretan affairs in the charge of Greeks, who appear to have no sense of humanity or justice to enable then to respect the lives, honour, and and property of thousands of their compatriots who follow Islam."</p>
                        <p>In view of these facts it is impossible for any British statesman to lend any countenance to the agitation of the Cypriot Greeks and I am glad that Mr. Winston Churchill refused to do so. There are nearly 50,000 Turks in the island and judging from Crete it is not difficult to imagine what their position would be if we were foolish enough to abandon the island.</p>
                        <p>Truly Yours.</p>

                        <p>Referring to the drain of gold to Egypt Lord Cromer said that this was likely to occur annually because the cotton crop was now assured and the country guaranteed against drought by Sir William Garstin and Sir Colin Scott-Moncrieft.</p>
                        <p>He hoped that the Egyptian slump would stop objectior.able speculation. Egypt's wealth was essentially agricultural; there were only two things which could endanger her prosperity and they were the diminution of the demand for cotton and a change of British policy.</p>

                    <p>The wind, though moderate in strength, was very tricky and the light was not always good, --causing many to fall off at 600 yards. Scores :-</p>

                        <p>Beyrout, October 26.</p>
                        <p>After a rather long drawn spell of drought we have had general and in certain places torrential 
                            rain. It was in fact an echo-much attenuated by distance and climatic conditions of the violent 
                            storms that have been sweeping over Europe strewing disaster in their wake. ' Our somewhat story 
                            weather started in the North and as the rain travelled southward some heavy torrential showers 
                            washed away about five kilometers of embankment on the line between Nema and Aleppo, but the 
                            railway company has made the repairs with creditable promptitude and only eight hours interruption 
                            of the service occurred. It is hoped that the forthcoming crops will profit by these generous rains 
                            which are so much needed for ploughing and sowing of the winter grain.</p>

                        <p>A private message from Constantinople announces the death of Madame Mazaffer Pasha, wife of the 
                            late Governor General of the Lebanon. After her recent life of official splendour to end one's 
                            day's ander rather humble conditions in a hospital is a sad illustration of the fickleness of 
                            fortune and even those who had no reason to bear the deconsed any particular affection felt some 
                            sorrow on receiving the intelligence.</p>

                        <p>On Tuesday while a suburban train of the Tramway Libanais was steaming into the station it collided 
                            with a few trucks that had not been properly shunted. A few of the passengers sustained slight 
                            injuries, but this case of neglect is so flagmant that the attention of the railway administration 
                            should be seriously drawn thereto. The accident happened in open daylight, and the speed of the 
                            train while nearing the station is slow enough to afford time of warning to a careless employé.</p>

                        <head>Beyrout as a Town.</head>
                        <p>Somebody once justly remarked that Beyrout is a large village, and there are in fact none in it of the characteristics of a modern town. There are neither boulevards por parks properly so called, neither public monuments nor fine hotels such as one may find in humbler and less rich towns in Europe. People of initiative and with an eye for profitable investment have lately been considering seriously the building of a large first class hotel and casino where respectable ladies may after or before their afternoon drive stop to have some refreshments, hear pleasant music and in short indulge in the recognized forms of social diversion. As things are, the only resource for ladies in the way of outdoor social intercourse is a drive along the seashore as far as the lighthouse and sometimes further beyond to the cliff facing the Pigeon Island. The panorama commanded by that elevated spot is indeed superb and to my mind is unique in mystic charm and delicacy of coloring, but appreciative lovers of nature are very few and our fashionable set meets there chiefly for parade, and as there is not even a café to sit in they have to stay in their carriages for the exchange of social commonplaces and this is hardly a means for showing off their resplendent toiletters. Therefore a public meeting place, decent and elegant enough for ladies of the upper class has come to be not only a recommendable enterprise but a necessity. The choice of a suitable site was a vital consideration and a unique one was discovered in that narrow strip of overhanging shore and the shallow bay in front of it facing the Grand Hotel d'Orient where Cook's Office stands. About two years ago there was a talk of the formation of a syndicate of capitalists to buy up this bit of land and shallow sea from the Government but through want of goodwill presumably on either or both sides the negotiations did not result in any materialissue. Now however a new circumstance compels prompt action. I have described at length in a recent article the Hamidieti School of Industry and Commerce and the Hamidieh Hospital. His Excellency Khalil Pasha to whose initiative these two important institutions owe mainly their existence is naturally desirous to crown this good work with fruitful results. It is not enough to have such institutions founded in so tar only as the raising of the edifice is concerned but funds are required to put and keep them in working order. As the nett proceeds of the land and beach above mentioned are to be devoted to these funds it is expected that his Excellency will hasten the maturity of the scheme outlined above. It is said also that a headtax such as has been imposed on Ottoman passengers entering or leaving the town of Beyrout to provide the necessary capital for raising the buildings will be in poned, also in other seaports of the Vilayet to provide the necessary funds for endowing these institutions with their staffs and running them permanently. The carpet industry is to be taught in the School of Industry and expert artisans will be brought from Smyrna and Armenia to teach and direct this very lucrative industry. Several thousand bales of wool are shipped from Syria yearly to Liverpool and the United States as well as to Italy and Marseilles, and why should not at least part of this drude produkt bootilitad in its native place of origin, now especially that oriental carpets and rugs are in great dealand, and command handsome prices 1 This scheme if realized will be a lasting memorial to the Governor General of Beyrout, and future Governors, will do walk to follow his example in this particular instance.</p>

                    <p>CONCERNING AN OMDEH.</p>
                    <p>By MADGE HOOLE</p>
                    <p>The village of Maadoom will not be found by the curious observer on any map,
                        as I have concealed its real name, but it exists, and I propose to relate
                        the circumstances that introduced the light of civilisation there, and the
                        disasters that followed in its train. This is the manner of its undoing. For
                        centuries the inhabitants had pursued their quiet life, undisturbed by
                        modern ideas. They led a purely pastoral existence, and robbed each other
                        when occasion offered in a simple childlike manner that made the ensuing
                        buckshot almost unnecessary. Just as Mons Jourdain had talked prose all his
                        life without knowing it, so had our villagers died of plagne all their lives
                        without knowing it. Mons Jourdain's accession of knowledge brought him
                        happiness, our villagers alas had to entfer many things as the price of
                        their introduction to the blessings of modern ideas. It occurred to a
                        paternal Government that the happiness of the villagers would be increased
                        if a light railway was prolonged from the nearest point so as to reach
                        Maadoom. The facilities thus afforded to the villagers of disposing of their
                        products in a wider market could not, thought the paternal Government, but
                        be beneficial to their welfare. As a matter of fact, the villagers had no
                        products worth mentioning to dispose of, and this, coupled with the fact
                        that the engineer sent to report on the matter, did not know any Arabic,
                        whilst his clerk, who happened to own some land in the vicinity of the
                        proposed line, did not remember his English in time, resulted in a
                        misunderstanding for which no one can be blamed. The line was duly
                        completed, and with it a new era began for our friends. At first distrustful
                        of the train, they soon became accustomed to it. In fact, when they grasped
                        the idea that the tares had been specially fixed low by Government so as to
                        enable them to enjoy all the advantages of travel they conceived the
                        brilliant notion of belping Government in their turn, by travelling at still
                        lower fares, the "Komsary entendu" as the Reglement sweetly directs. The
                        post office, introduced by Government at the same time, was also a popular
                        favourite. The facilities afforded by it for sending threatening letters
                        were much appreciated, whilst the humour of sending them unstamped, and
                        causing the recipient to pay double for learning that life is uncertain, and
                        that his female relations were far from all that could be desired, was
                        patent to all. The one eyed "Ardahalgy," who sat on an empty paraffin tin in
                        the village and wrote the letters in question, made so much money, not only
                        by writing the letters, but also by informing the recipients where they came
                        from, that he was soon able to retire on his gains, and was murdered in due
                        course. The savings bank, however, which the Government tried to introduce
                        at the same time, was merely looked upon as a delightful piece of humour on
                        the part of the Government. The idea of any bane man handing over his money
                        in exchange for a piece of paper from a Coptic clerk, who was known to be in
                        debt to the village "Baqqal," being too preposterous to be taken seriously,
                        Matters were in this happy strain when the events occurred, which had such
                        far reaching effects on the villagers. The Omdeh, who directed the simple
                        policies of the community, was a new man, who had been lately selected by
                        the Government as one who showed signs of an enlightened spirit with a
                        leaning to modern ideas. As a matter of fact, he regarded modern ideas
                        merely as a convenient and more efficacious way of carrying out the very
                        oldest customs, but this was not known to Government, which still retained a
                        touching faith in long range circulars. In pursuance of this train of
                        thought, our Omdeh knocked down a culprit with the butt end of a cheap
                        German revolver, instead of breaking open his head with a nabbut, as his
                        less enlightened ancestors would have done. The culprit, who had refused to
                        carry out a work of public utility, when ordered so to do by the Oudeh, ie,
                        had refused to demolish the wall separating his and the Omdeh's land, and to
                        build up the wall at a much farther distance from the Omdeh's other
                        partition, had been stirred by feelings of revenge to take advantage of the
                        new post office to despatch a letter of complaint to Cairo, relating all
                        that had occurred to him, not to say a good deal more The result was that
                        the Omdeh was summoned to Cairo to give an account of his actions. The Omdeh
                        was alarmed but cool. He first of all arranged mattery with his denouncer, a
                        readiness to overlook injuries on moderate terins being a charming and
                        noticeable trait in the native character. As soon as he knew that a second
                        letter had been sent by the injured man, stating that the Omdeh was his
                        father, mother. and all his female aunts, and that the first letter had not
                        been written by him but by another man of the same name, he departed for
                        Cairo by the new line. Having duly arranged his official business, and
                        having been assured that his character was cleared, he wandered about Cairo,
                        which he bad never seen before, looking at Europa as she is dis: played in
                        the Opera Square and elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>It was remarked by Chateaubriand that whilst playing with his cat, and
                        imagining that she was an object of amusement to him, it might be that in
                        reality he was an object of amusement to her. "Mutato nomine, fabula de te
                        narratur". When we imagine fondly that the East is regarding us with
                        feelings of envy and approbation, the Fast may so be doing, or again it may
                        not. The real views of a country Omdeh on Baropean civilisation as
                        displayed, say, at a Cairo</p>
                <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>ball, would be interesting and well worth not publishing. In the course of
                        his wanderings, he came across an old friend also an Omdeb, and they sat
                        down at a café and exchanged their budget of news. After giving each other
                        the latest information from their respective spheres of influence, and this
                        differed in a most surprising way from the official versions of the same,
                        they discussed in a friendly way various points of interest to Omdebs, such
                        as the use and abuse of the telephone in proving that you were in two places
                        at the same time, should events make such a course appear advisable, etc, in
                        short, after proving that there are more things in Heaven and (Egyptian)
                        earth than are ever dreamt of by any official Hainlet, they began to
                        question each other as to the reason for their presence in Cairo. Our Omdeh
                        explained that he had been called up to clear his character from un. just,
                        or at any rate inconvenient accusations, whilst his friend, after
                        sympathising with him and detailing the steps he personally took with any
                        native who displayed lack of delicacy in his dealings with bin, said that
                        the reason of his presence in Osiro was something much more pleasant, namely
                        to receive a reward. Pressed for details, he informed his friend that there
                        was a department in the country called the Department of Public Happiness;
                        that their chief object as far as he could understand it, was to find people
                        with swellings on them ; that any one discovering persons suffering from the
                        above mentioned swellings, received a reward ; that he had so discovered
                        persons and had received a reward ; and that why Allab should have placed
                        the Faithful under the temporary role of people so clearly mad, he for one
                        could not say. Our Omdeh returned to Maafloom thoughtful and excited. He too
                        might discover swellings and gain the reward, the only difficulty being that
                        he had no clear idea of what kind of swellings were required. It could not
                        be the ordinary, swelled official head, that was too common and widely
                        spread to be worth money. It could not be the swel. ling, the frequent
                        concomitant of the "warning" given by the police before prosecuting an
                        offender, although he had known that bring in money when properly handled.
                        In short he was completely at sea, the only fixed idea he had being that
                        high priced swellings must be found at any price. On his return he ordered
                        his satellites to give him early information of any persons suffering from
                        swellings, which they promised to do wondering greatly what these things
                        might mean. At last his chance came. He received information that a man was
                        lying ill in his house and had swellings on his body, "just like the ones we
                        used to have years ago" said his informant innocently, being quite unaware
                        that the disease was new, and had only been tracked down and discovered
                        quite recently by the zeal of the Department of Public Happiness. The Omdeh
                        went at once to the house, where profound Egyptian caliu reigned, there
                        being only 7 or 8 wailers round the sick man. After calming their agitation
                        with the edge of the "Instructions to Omdehs" which he happened to have in
                        his hand, he inspected the patient who certainly had swellings which looked
                        as if they were worth money. Disregarding the views of the village barber,
                        who was desirous of operating on the patient with a tin opener, which he had
                        been induced to buy from a Greek as the latest surgical instrument known to
                        the faculty, he hurried home, and concocted a letter to Cairo announcing the
                        discovery of a swelling, which he described as "tamam khalas" He then
                        awaited developments with the feelings of a man, who if he could not command
                        success, could at any rate deserve it. The next day he was called to the
                        station to meet the Inspector. Charmed with the alacrity displayed by the
                        Powers that be in recognising his merits, he hastened to lead the way to the
                        house of the sick man, and awaited with anxiety the official recognition of
                        his zeal and energy. He had not long to wait. The Inspector informed him
                        that it was a case of plague, which did not convey any meaning to his mind,
                        and went on to say that the whole village would have to be disinfected,
                        whilst a house to house visitation would immediately take place to discover
                        any other suspicious cases. When it dawned on the villagers that their
                        houses were going to be cleaned down, and that their choicest collections in
                        the way of refuse were going to be scattered to the winds, their indignation
                        against the Omdeh knew no bounds. An indignation meeting took place that
                        night in the chief hashish cafe of the place, to discuss the best way of
                        escaping from the impending desecration of their Lares and Penates. When the
                        Omdeh endeavoured to protest his innocence, the noise that ensued would have
                        done credit to the whist room in a lady's club. He was simply bowled down,
                        and the Sheikh of Gaffirs, who was present, fortifying himself against the
                        risks of sleeping all night in the open, was voted to the chair. His remarks
                        and those of ten or twelve others, who happened to be speaking at the same
                        time, although not wanting in fervour, did not lead to any effective plan
                        being suggested, and the meeting broke up in most adınired disorder. When an
                        army of disinfectors arrived and began their dread operations, the feelings
                        of the villagers against the Omdeh rose to fever pitch. The Inspector, after
                        despatching the patient to hospital, carried out his precautionary measures
                        with a zealous thoroughness that left a good deal to be desired from the
                        point of view of the villagers. He was fully imbued with the conviction,
                        common to all officials of his department, that the chief end of man is to
                        be disinfected, and that a house requires as much whitewashing as a modern
                        financier, and very nearly as often. How to revenge themselves on their
                        Omdeh was now the chief idea amongst the villagers. They had of course
                        accused him anonymously to Cairo of all the crimes mentioned in the Penal
                        Code and of some that were not, but that of course</p>
                <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>was merely as a form to satisfy the requirements of the regulations, and was
                        not intended seriously. One enterprising native, who had had the advantage
                        of a liberal education, having been expelled from a mission school in early
                        youth, even tried the effect of patting his accusations in English. That he
                        had not grasped the piceties of the English language may be assumed from the
                        fact that he addressed his letter to the Ministry of "Interference", because
                        although there is a close connection between "Interference" and "Interior"
                        in Arabic, there is no connection between the two ideas in English. When
                        however the news spread round the village, some weeks after this. that a
                        member of the Omdeh's own family was ill, and that the presence of swellings
                        was more than suspected, the villagers began to see their way to relieve
                        their feelings. The prospect of seeing the Omdeh's house, spared on the
                        recent visitation, turned upside down and whitewashed, and his family sent
                        to hospital, if not himself, filled their minds with the most delightful
                        anticipations, and the zeal and vigour of their denunciations of the Omdeh
                        would have done credit to the secretary of a Temperance Society denouncing a
                        rival organisation. The Omdeh, who was quite aware of all this, was filled
                        with the gloomiest forebodings. The idea of his house being invaded and
                        cleaned, and of his people sent to a hospital filled him with an indignation
                        he had been unable to feel. when it was a question of other people. Yet what
                        to do he could not imagine. As surely as the morning's sun would rise, so
                        surely would the Inspector arrive, and being an Englishman, he would neither
                        have sufficient delicacy of mind to see the Omdeh's son without inspecting
                        him ; nor sufficient absence of mind to inspect the Omdeh's son without
                        seeing him. In fact the Omdeh began to fear that he might be reduced to
                        speaking the truth, which he objected to on general principles.</p>
                    <p>In the East, the truth is looked upon much as we look on garlic in a salad; a
                        necessary ingredient in small quantities, but not meant to be used alone,
                        except in dealing with the coarsest palates. A Palace of Truth is not very
                        likely to be erected in Europe, where we regard the article as chiefly
                        intended as an "Object d'Exportation," for the use of missions and other
                        places where they sing, but in the East the very idea is unthinkable. At
                        last a brilliant idea struck him. In the course of his judicial inquiries,
                        he had often felt it advisable to "make that which was appear like unto that
                        which was not"; and fully intended to do so again. Why should he not enlarge
                        on the idea, and make an illness which was not appear like unto an illness
                        which was He remembered that quite close to his house there dwelt a certain
                        native, whose son was Also ill with an attack of jaundice. As luck would
                        have it, he had been caught red handed by the Omdeh in certain illicit
                        actions botas he had been able to explain matters to the satisfaction of the
                        Omdoh, he had not been prosecuted. The Omdeh knew too much of the world to
                        use any one to whom he had done a favour, that being one of the few things
                        never forgiven in this life, he preferred a man to whom he had shown the
                        quality of mercy, quite unstrained although the law might have been. He
                        waited till the evening and then went to the house, and after recalling
                        certain transactions that had taken place between themselves, began to
                        arrange his bargain. The idea which had occurred to him was to exchange the
                        son of his neighbour, who was not suffering from any infectious illness, for
                        his own, who was. As soon as the Inspector had departed, they could be
                        exchanged again, and nobody would be any the wiser, whilst he would be
                        spared the horrors of disinfection. Owing to his official position, he would
                        be able to prevent any one except the Inspector, entering the house, and he
                        naturally would rot know one child from the other. He was not long in coming
                        to terms with his neighbour The latter had a sense of past favours, and a
                        till more lively sense of those that might come. As a cattle remover, he
                        naturally liked to oblige one who could place a generous interpretation on
                        any little unpleasantness incidental to his profession, and the matter was
                        soon arranged at the current rate of exchange, without any of that
                        disturbing element of Contango, which too often accompanies transaction in
                        the more sordid world of the Bourse. In the small hours of the night, the
                        exchange was effected, and the Omdeh retired to rest fairly confident of the
                        result of his strategem. Next morning the Inspector duly arrived, and guided
                        by many willing assistants, arrived at the house of the Omdeh. He told him
                        that he bad been informed that the Omdeh's son was suffering from an
                        illness, suspected to be I plague, and he must make an inspection, and see
                        if it was so. The Omdeh replied in flowery terms that his house and all it
                        contained was at the disposition of His Honour, but that his son was not ill
                        of the plagae, and that the villagers were liars of the first water. The
                        Inspector, whilst not dispating such a probable statement, replied that he
                        must see the patient for himself, and that if he was really suffering from
                        plague, he expected the Omdeh to set a good example to his people by
                        submitting cheerfully to the steps which must be taken. The Omdel made a
                        suitable reply and led the way to the bedside with a light heart. The
                        Inspector made a careful inspection and soon saw that that it was not a case
                        of plague. He gave the Omdeh some advice as to the treat. ment required, and
                        departed, cursing the villagers for having given him a long journey for
                        nothing. The villagers experienced the lively feeling of disappointment,
                        common to us all, when we have endeavoured to do a mischief under the guise
                        of duty, and have not succeeded. The Omdeh was smiling to himself, and
                        receiving the congratulations of his people on his escape from enforced
                        cleanliness, where he saw his accomplice making signs that he wanted to
                        speak to him. He dismissed his flock with a paternal smile that made
                        them</p>

                    <p>look forward to the rutore with considerable apprehension, and retired to his
                        house, followed by his neighbour. His feelings may be imagined when he heard
                        that his son had died that morning in his neighbour's house ! In addition to
                        bis grief as a father, he was in a most unpleasant predicament ag an Omdeh.
                        He found himself on the horns of a dilemma.</p>
                    <p>If he were to confess that it was his son who was dead, grave suspicions
                        would be aroused, resulting probably in an inquiry, and the loss of his
                        position ; but if he did not, he could not bury his son in the state proper
                        to an Omdeh. He had to decide quickly, as his neighbour gave him most
                        clearly to understand that the sooner he removed the dead and restored the
                        living, the better pleased he would be. He was driven to consult bis wife,
                        and she, although the first to approve of any scheme in order to hide their
                        family affairs from an inquisitorial Government, made it very clear that if
                        he did not fetch away their son's body and give him proper burial, she would
                        do so herself The Omdeh, who had had sufficient experience of women to know
                        that the only thing to do when a woman insists on anything, is to refuse,
                        and then go away as quickly as possible and do it, gave in, and called
                        together the elders of his village to unburden his mind to them. He began
                        his peroration by remarking that some of his brother Omdehs had the
                        misfortune to govern an ungrateful and perverse generation. He gave many
                        instances to show how some of them hnd endeavored to betray their chiefs,
                        and mentioned with particular clearness the misfortunes that had descended
                        on their heads for so doing. They, he knew well, were of quite another
                        nature, but even they might have misunderstood their chief's action in the
                        matter. It was true he had deceived the Government, but was it for his own
                        sake ? no, it was for the sake of his beloved people and to prevent further
                        calamities falling on their heads. Had they forgotten the recent horrors, or
                        were they still fresh in their minds ? (Great sensation amongst the elders,
                        each trying to look like the model man in an ideal flock) Awful as their
                        experience had been, it was as nothing to the horrors, which had been
                        hanging over their heads, and which had only been averted by his, the
                        Omdeh's, self sacrifice. He had lately received another circular stating
                        that if another case of plague occurred, the whole village would be removed
                        to hospital! Did they want to be taken from their homes and removed to a
                        place well known to be full of "Afrits" of the worst description ? (Cries of
                        "Ya Salam"). It was true his son had died of plague, but what of that! It
                        seemed to him, and would doubtless so appear to them that to prevent any one
                        dying of plague, which must have been allotted to him by Allah, was
                        decidedly irreligious, and not to be borne by the faithful. He had therefore
                        determined to save his people by a trifling deception, for which he hoped
                        they would be grateful. He wound up by declaring that if however any member
                        of his flock proved unworthy of the confidence placed in him, another
                        circular might be forthcoming, the provisions of which would render the
                        village a very undesirable place of abode. He then ordered the Elders to
                        communicate the substance of his speech to the others, and withdrew to his
                        house. His remarks were duly communicated to the village and a general
                        discussion took place. The villagers finally arrived at the conclusion that
                        it would be better to keep their own counsel. and let the matter drop. It
                        was evident that their scheme of revenge had failed, for one thing, and for
                        the other, it was felt to be safer to leave a man alone, who had shown
                        himself so fall of resource as had the Omdeh.</p>
                    <p>It did not occur to them to disbelieve what he had told them. Although they
                        could lie themselves in a mild way, which could fairly claim to rival the
                        best efforts of the late lamented Baron Munchausen, they did not suspect
                        that their Omdeh had been indulging in "Terminological Inexactitudes," which
                        would have done credit to a Radical stamping his constituency. They were
                        also scared by the dim horrors suggested by the word circular. Without
                        clearly understanding what it was, they regarded a circular as a fearful
                        wildfowl, which generally portended much fresh discomfort to themselves.
                        They had perhaps more reason for their distrust than they knew. There have
                        been many kind of Governments in the history of the world, varying from
                        "Nob-ocracy," or government by the type of the fittest, to "Mob-ocracy," or
                        Government by the specially unfit type. It has been reserved for Egypt to
                        discover new method, that of "Circular-ocracy," or Government by the
                        typewriter. The Omdeh therefore was left in peace to bury his son, which he
                        did with a splendour which left him bankrupt for weeks, and nothing more was
                        ever heard of the matter. In the course of time, it is not impossible that
                        he will figure in a myth as the local St. George, who saved his people from
                        the dragon of disinfection. There does not appear to be any moral to be
                        deduced from this veracious narrative.</p>

                    <p>(Aujourd'hui à midi)</p>
                    <p>La crise américaine a fini par produire son effet sur les valeurs égyptiennes
                        à Londres, où elles ont fléchi dans de notables proportions, tandis que le
                        taux privé d'escompte a été élevé sans désemparer jusqu'à 5 3/4% ! Comment
                        la Banque d'Angleterre, avec ses énormes exportations d'or pourra-t-elle
                        défendre son encaisse en maintenant le sien à 4 1/2 ? On peut done
                        s'attendre très prochainement à une élévation correspondante du taux
                        officiel.</p>
                    <p>Ici, il est à peine besoin de le dire, l'aspect était des plus mornes ce
                        matin ; une foule de vendeurs avaient à constater que les acheteurs se
                        raréfient de façon inquiétante. Rien à faire. Quelques échanges en Comptoir,
                        Delta Land et National Bank, ainsi qu'en Helouan et Estates, mais tout cela
                        à des prix a faire pitié. Sur le reste, les transactions ont été si légères
                        et clairsemées qu'elles ne valent même pas une mention.</p>
                    <p>Nous avions donc bien raison de prévoir hier une baisse pour aujourd'hui. De
                        plus, la tendance continue à être franchement mauvaise.</p>
                    <p>Parmi les fluctuations les plus sensationnelles, il faut citer la National
                        Bank qui perd 9/16 à 20 13/16, l'Alexandria Water 1/2 à 10 1/2 vendeur, la
                        Béhéra, la Differed Delta et les Nungovich Hotels 1/4 aux cours respectifs
                        de 22.1/2, 1/4 et 16 3/4.</p>
                    <p>L'Agricole rétrograde également de 8 1/16 à 8, la Delta Light Privilégiée de
                        10 1/8 à 10, la Land Bruk de 7 1/16 à 7, l'Urbaine de 3 5/8 à 31/2, l'Union
                        Foncière de 4 13/16 à 4 3/4, le Crédit Franco-Egyptien de 4 1/8 à 4 1/16 et
                        la Banque d'Orient de 117 à 116.</p>
                    <p>Tandis que l'Obligation nouvelle Crédit Foncier avance de 255 à 256,
                        l'ancienne recule de 298 1 297.</p>
                    <p>En titres d'ordre secondaire nous voyons les Cotton Mills céder de 1/9 à 1/6,
                        la Salt and Soda do 17/3 à 17, la Cassa di Sconto de 49 à 48, los Estates de
                        15/32 à 3/8, le Comptoir de 2 21/32 à 2 25/32 l'ancienne et de 2 29/32 8 2
                        27/32 la nouvelle, la Building Lands de 1 15/16 8 1 7/8, et la Lavico de 8/8
                        à 11/32.</p>
                    <p>Si l'on considère que la plupart des prix nouveaux sont vendeurs, on constate
                        que les mariruvres récentes des haussieurs (vendeurs véritables) n'ont guère
                        réussi. En jetantinn coup d'æil rétrospectif sur le chemin parcouru par la
                        baisse depuis 3 semaines, ceux qui se sont tenus à l'écart nous seront
                        reconnaissants de n'avoir cessé d'agiter la sonnette d'alarme. Ce qu'il faut
                        éviter surtont, si l'on veut rétablir un peu d'équilibre dans notre bourse,
                        c'est de faire de nouvelles victimes. On ne semble le comprendre ni dans la
                        presse, ni dans la corbeille.</p>
                    <p>Il a été vendu aux enchères publiques 50 actions anciennes Comptoir Financier
                        à 2 13/16, 25 Crédit Franco Egyptien à 4 5,32 et 25 Levico à 3/8.</p>

                    <p>Le taux de l'escompte libre à Londres est renseigné en hausse de 1/4 à 5 1/8
                        pour cent.</p>
                    <p>Au Stock Exchange, le Consolidé anglais a baissé hier de 1/4 à 82 1/2.
                        L'Unifiée est restée invariée à 102 1/2. La National Bank a fleebi de 1/8 à

                        Light a 10 1/4.</p>
                    <p>A Paris, le Crédit Foncier Egyptien a perdu i franc à 689. La Banque
                        d'Athènes a baissé de 3 francs à 107. Les Lots Tares ont été fermes à
                        168.</p>
                    <p>Ici, les liquidations qui pèsent sur le marché depuis quelque temps ont
                        continué ce matin et vu la tendance peu favorable n'ont rencontré pour la
                        plupart que le vide. Naturellement la tendance à la faiblesse s'est encore
                        accen. tuée, et bien que les opérations aient été à peu près nulles, tonte
                        la cote est en nouvelle baisse.</p>
                    <p>Les valeurs dirigeantes que les liquidations ci-dessus ne peuvent plus
                        atteindre, ont seules conservé un peu de fermeté, et encore par suite du
                        défaut absolu d'affaires. Le recul est surtout sensible sur les petites
                        valeurs et les sociétés foncières.</p>
                    <p>D'ailleurs les prix de notre cote de ce jonr sont pour la plupart

                        contre remonte à 298-299 et la nouvelle à 254. La Privilégiée Béhéra est
                        ramenée à 4 1/8. L'Allotment se relève à 2 1/16 tandis que sa part
                        s'alourdit à P.T. 55. Les Heliopolis tombent à 230 et l'Union Fopcière
                        fléchit à 4 3/4 de même que l'Anglo-American Nile à 2 7/16.</p>
                    <p>Dans le groupe des Hotels, les Nungovich mollissent à 16 3/4-7/8. Les Upper

                    <p>Nous lisons dans "The Economist" la ni confortante appréciation suivante sur
                        les tendances actuelles du marché monétaire anglais :</p>
                    <p>"On peut se rappeler que le 19 Octobre 1906 (on vendredi) le taux officiel
                        minimum de la Banque d'Angleterre fut élevé de 5 à 6%. le montant de
                        l'encaisse métallique ayant été réduit à 18,861,000 livres sterling en
                        raison de l'importance extraordinaire des retraits d'or effectués de Londres
                        à destination des EtatsUnis. Alors que le taux de l'escompte est à 4 1/2 %
                        le dernier bilan de la Banque publie indique que son encaisse s'élève à
                        23,836,000 livres sterling de sorte que la situation est bien meilleure que
                        l'automne dernier. Quand bien même il serait sorti samedi 500,000 liv. st.
                        d'or de la Banque d'Angleterre pour l'Egypte, il n'y a pas lieu de redouter
                        une élévation de l'escompte à 5 % d'ici quelque temps, pourvu qu'il ne
                        survienne pas l'improviste une crise de crédit. Il faut bien avouer que les
                        faillites de Hambourg et de New-York sont tant soit peu d'un aspect
                        menaçant, mais, autant qu'il est possible d'en juger, la situation de
                        Londres est extraordinairement saine et rassurante. Notre marché monétaire,
                        toutefois, est extrêmement sensible et doit tenir compte de la situation
                        moins bonne des autres centres monétaires. Il a éprouvé de la satisfaction
                        vendredi dernier en constatant que la Banque Impériale d'Allemagne n'avait
                        pas élevé son taux d'escompte car depuis longtemps on se préoccupe beaucoup
                        de la situation à Berlin. On approuve généralement la Banque d'Angleterre de
                        diminuer l'excédent des disponibilités du marché libre mais néanmoins les
                        capitaux restent jusqa'ici abondants à 3%. L'effet de cette nesure s'est
                        fait toutefois sentir sur le marché de l'escompte car jendi et vendredi le
                        taux du papier à trois mois s'est élevé à 4 3/8 %, attei. grant presqne le
                        taux de la Banque."</p>

                        des bruits tendancieux et de nature à causer un préjudice très sérieux à

                        <p>Port Said, Monday.</p>
                        <p>Last Saturday afternoon a cricket match was played between the above
                            mentioned teams, and ended in a win for Port Said, in spite of the fact that
                            they were without the assistance of Messrs. Williams, Macdonald, Newbould,
                            Dr. Coffey, and Tweedie (jan.). A. J. Tweedie and King opened the innings
                            for the club, but with the score at 6 the latter was dismissed by Lieut.
                            Coppin White followed, but had his wicket displaced after scoring a single.
                            With 8 wickets down for 36, the club looked in a bad situation, but Chesman
                            showed considerable skill in the way he monopolised the bowling and hit up
                            his 14 runs. In an hour and a half Port Said were all dismissed for a total
                            of 49. Mention must be made of the splendid fielding of the visitors, in
                            this department; they were much better than their opponents. Lieut. Coppin
                            and Paymaster Jinkin bowled well, the former taking 5 wickets for 20, and
                            the latter 5 for 29.</p>
                        <p>The innings of the visiting team was opened by Lieut. Stahlknecht and A. B.
                            Timmins; the latter player, however, was dismissed in the second over by
                            White. The second wicket fell for 8, third for, 10, and so on, till when the
                            seventh wickets fell the total was 37.</p>
                        <p>A. J. Tweedie relieved King at the top end, and in his first two overs
                            secured the last 3 wicket at a cost of 2 runs.</p>
                        <p>This match, which will probably be the last this season, was by far the most
                            exciting game of the year. Mr. Wallis, the Captain, showed great judgment in
                            changing bowlers when he did. Mr. Chesman deserved the applause he received
                            for his amart catch. The score was as follows :-</p>

                    <p>DEAR MR. SPICER. —The work of which you send me photos is certainly of very
                        high quality and I have rarely seen Heads mounted with such skill and
                        finish. Only an Artist could bestow the amount of care and modelling which
                        appear in the faces of Deer, and in your work you are so highly successful
                        there is little left to be desired. Yours very truly,</p>
