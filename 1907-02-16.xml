                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed
                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.
                        Najem Houry proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the
                        sea. Magnificent Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For

                        Army Contractor, Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia
                        (on Railway) to Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin
                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the
                        world. Also the tower or palace, the scene of "Othello'' and of Ford's
                        "Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus in the winter months is
                        delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                    <head>PANACEAS FOR EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>The comments of Mr. Edward Dicey, C.B., and Mr. J.M. Robertson, M.P., on
                        British Administration in Egypt are considerable interest. Mr. Robertson has
                        spoken in the House and has sinxe visited the country; Mr. Dicey writes
                        after a long series of visits to Cairo Both are critical, but their
                        criticisms differ extraordinarily, the C.B. telling us that we should
                        withdraw our "young officials" for the country, leave a few Advisers and a
                        Governor General and declare a Protectorate. The M.P. gave us to understand
                        that he agreed with the policy of "Egypt for the Egyptians," but did not
                        advocate an immediate scuttle on our part. Indeed, in a recent letter to the
                        "Times" he seemed to express ideas similar to those enunciated by Lord
                        Cromer in what one might term a Radical dress. The M.P. wants to "hurry up"
                        the process of making Egyptians </p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>fit to govern themselves-such, at least, is our deduction. The C.B. would put
                        them for good and all under British Rule leaving them reasonably free in all
                        matters of internal administration.</p>
                    <p>As far as evacuation goes Mr. Dicey opposes it. Mr. Robertson would obviously
                        deprecate it as premature. The seems to be the only point on which these two
                        gentlemen disagree. Mr. Dicey complains that the modern Egyptian is morally
                        inferior to his forbears "or at least not superior", while Mr. Robertson is
                        said, we know not with what truth, to have stated that in his opinion the
                        modern Egyptian was somewhat maligned. While holding that owing to evil
                        traditions, the seclusion of women, and an unfortunate history, the Egyptian
                        is as a rule morally inferior to the average citizen of the principal
                        European states, we are none the less confident that the best type of modern
                        Egyptian is superior to his forbears. It is idle to quote the names of
                        illustrious Egyptians of the past century. Without exception they were not
                        Egyptians, but Turks, European renegaes, Armenians, or Circassians. Suleiman
                        Pasha, the great Mohemet Ali, Lazoghlu, Ibrahim Pasha, Nubar, Tigrane, Riaz,
                        Ismail Pasha were all men who played a great part in the history of Egypt.
                        But they were no more "Egyptian Standard," so that arguments based on their
                        Egyptian origin have no foundation whatever of fact. Indeed, only two
                        Egyptians stand out prominently between 1850 and 1882: one was Arabi Pasha,
                        who was no genius-simply a tool in the hands of a group of intriguersand the
                        Mufettish, of whom the less said the better. Sheikh Mohamed Abdou was the
                        first real Egyptian to show more than ordinary ability, and we have now
                        several men who in the language of the trainer are "coming on." They are
                        pure Egyptians and their advent, in our opinionm betokens that an advance
                        has been made both intellectually and morally.</p>

                        <p>The Egyptian Directory</p>
                        <p>The Egyptian Directory and Advertising Company Limited's Egyptian
                            Directory for 1907 is a very useful work, which has already reached its
                            fifth year of publication. The publishers, Messrs. Rizzo &amp; Co.,
                            during last year transformed their business into a limited liability
                            company and their business was taken over by the company on the 1st
                            inst. One of the most useful features of this year's publication is the
                            very complete list of companies established in Egypt. We have looked
                            through this list, and find that it is very up-to-date and includes all
                            the latest issues.</p>
                        <p>The Affray on the Hodeidah.</p>
                        <p>Our Port Said contemporary the "Verite," narrating the incidents which
                            ensued upon the skirmish on board the Ottoman transport Hodeidah, states
                            that, contrary to what the Turkish commander told the local authorities,
                            there was only one Syrian soldier killed, and whose body was picked up
                            in the canal near Tireh. No other body has since been found. The fight
                            occurred between Kabret and Suez; it was begun by the Turks. There were
                            fifteen wounded in all, two seriously, but the commander and pilot are
                            not of the number. The commander telegraphed to the Ottoman Commissioner
                            reporting the arrival of his vessel at Suez with damages to her engines
                            which will need repair. The number of deserters is 280. The desertion
                            from the transport is the talk of the town at Suez and Port Said, where
                            the question of the neutrality of the Canal is appositely raised in view
                            of the unwarrantable action of the Turks in firing on deserters who were
                            at the time on foreign, or extra-territorial, land or water.</p>

                    <p>A large business has taken place this week in spot Egyptians, and prices have
                        advanced ¼ @ 3/8d per lb, Fair and Good Brown being 4/16, Fully Good Fair ¼,
                        and Good Fair and Fine 3/8 per lb higher. All uppers have advanced ¼ per
                        lb.</p>
                    <p>A considerable business has also been done in Futures, the following being
                        the closing values: -- Feb 10.40d May 10.33d Aug. 10.22d Mar 10.37 June

                    <p>American Futures. The market this week has displayed renewed activity, and
                        with a better tone than for some weeks past prices have advanced 20 ½ @ 26 ½
                        points for old, and 16 ½ @ 19 ½ for new crop positions, over last Thursday.
                        The advance has taken the market rather by surprise, as generally everybody
                        was predicting lower prices, nor is it quite easy to say what has caused the
                        change. There is just an indication that the crop movements are slackening,
                        and undoubtedly the American markets have been running very short and there
                        has been covering on that account, but there has also been some more
                        businessw and a more confident feeling.</p>

                    <p>NORTH EGYPT LAND COMPANY</p>
                    <p>To the Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette." </p>
                    <p>Dear Sir, -- Readers of the "Gazette" will no doubt remember the flotation of
                        the North Egypt Land Company, which company was formed to take over certain
                        lands at Mariout. From the very start the company seemed to be in
                        difficulties from the fact that original subscribers lost confidence in the
                        concern and refused to pay up the second instalment. The thing has been
                        hanging fare for about eighteen months but now a certain amount of energy
                        has been inspired into the directors; the latest move on their part is a
                        circular to all the subscribers threatening them with the confiscation of
                        their shares of they do not at once pay up the amounts due; at the same
                        time, however, they fail to give the shareholders any definite statement of
                        the position of the company except that they have sold a certain 1000
                        feddans for L35,000. No word is said as to when the amount is payable.</p>
                    <p>As a shareholder I would like to ask why it is the directors have not been
                        able to see their way to take the shareholders into their confidence in
                        making a clear statement as to the positions of the company. If there is
                        nothing to conceal there is every reason in the interests of all that all
                        the facts should see the light of day; if, on the other hand, the directors
                        are not able to "face the music" then the less said the better.</p>
                    <p>In the hope that this letter will have the effect of inducing the directors
                        to come out in the open. – Yours, etc.</p>

                    <head>BRITISH CHAMBER OF COMMERCE</head>
                    <p>THE PAST YEAR'S WORK.</p>
                    <p>The following is the text of a speech delivered at the annual general meeting
                        of the British Chamber of Commerce of Egypt by the president, Mr. H. P
                        Kingham: --</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen, -- Before dealing with the actual work of the Chamber during the
                        past 12 months, I think it may interest you if I give a brief summary of the
                        remarkable advance in Egypt's imports and exports during the year 1906. In
                        round figures, the imports amounted to 24 millions, thus showing an increase
                        of 2 ½ millions on the preceding year. On the other hand, the exports
                        totaled 25 millions, or 4 ½ millions in advance of 1905. In 1905, the
                        balance of the imports and exports was slightly against this country, and
                        certain parties deduced from this that Egypt was going to rack and ruin it
                        is, therefore, satisfactory that the figures for 1906 have refuted these
                        pessimistic predictions. With regard to England's share of Egypt's total
                        imports, I find that in 1902 her percentage was 37.4, in 1903 36.1, in 1904
                        33.5, and in 1905 33%. This gradual shrinkage was arrested last year when
                        England's proportion rose to 33.5%. During 1906, France increased her trade
                        with Egypt by nearly one per cent, Germany by 1.1%, and Belgium by 1.3%.</p>
                    <p>There has been much correspondence in the papers with reference to the recent
                        financial stringency in this country, and many explanations – for the most
                        part erroneous – have been advanced. We are accustomed to inaccuracies from
                        newspapers, but it is regrettable that London Bank officials commit
                        themselves in public meeting to the statement that the demand for gold was
                        due to speculation in land,. We have it on the highest authority – that of
                        the Financial Advisor to the Khedive – that the extra demand was for purely
                        trade purposes. The amount of cotton shipped in 1906 was 6,696,569 cantars,
                        against 6,527,085 cantars in 1905. The average price per cantar in 1906 was
                        L3,065, against only L2,421 in 1905. This increase in value more than
                        accounts for the extraordinary imports of gold during the latter part of
                        1906, which I may mention totalled about 8 millions.</p>
                    <p>Turning to our Chamber, it is pleasing to note that the accounts prove a
                        flourishing state of affairs again, and that there is an excess of income
                        over expenditure which is only L5 inferior to that of last year despite our
                        increased expenditure. The Chamber's policy of giving its members, free of
                        charge, almost every conceivable kind of information – even down to advising
                        the Consul on the chances a lady typist would have of earning her living her
                        – has been carefully carried out during 1906. Disputes between manufacturers
                        and their agents here have been referred to us, and a large number of
                        confidential reports on the standing of proposed buyers or agents have been
                        supplied to members, while many firms at home have had agents recommended to
                        them by us. We were asked on more than one occasion to help home
                        manufacturers out of difficulties they had got into through having entered
                        into relations with firms on this side about whom they knew absolutely
                        nothing. As it turned out, an enquiry through this Chamber would, in each
                        case, have put people on their guard. We have had visits during the year
                        from sundry of our home members who have thus received personal attention
                        from our Secretary. We have also corresponded on behalf of members with
                        other Chambers of Commerce – notably with those of New York, Shanghai,
                        Constantinople, Tunis, and Bombay. We have also been able to assist various
                        Departments of the Egyptian and Sudan Governments with information, the same
                        remarks applying to our Consuls both here and in Cairo.</p>
                    <p>During the course of the last 12 months, we have corresponded with the
                        British Agency in Cairo on several matters, one of the most important being
                        on the subject of Bankruptcy Laws. We were asked our opinion on certain
                        proposals put forward by the Import Association here, who wished to modify
                        the existing law on the Concordat Preventif by introducing a clause
                        requiring that a debtor should obtain the sanction of three-quarters of the
                        number of the creditors representing three-quarters of the amount of the
                        liabilities. We, however, disagreed with these proposals, as we held that
                        they would give greater power to the smaller creditors. We put forward our
                        own ideas on the matter, and I am glad to say that the Judicial Commission
                        adopted our views on the Import Association's suggestions.</p>
                    <p>I regret that we have not always been so successful in other efforts we have
                        made for the benefit of British trade. For example, we endeavored to secure
                        the proper folding of piece goods. As you are aware, piece goods are now
                        folded to represent yards or metres, but the folding is frequently
                        misleading and injury is done to honest firms, who fold exactly to measure.
                        However, the difficulties of dealing with the matter were found to be
                        insuperable. Other work which was done by us during the year, including the
                        investigation of various complaints, principally those relating to the
                        application of "ardieh," and the alleged preference given to an onion
                        exporter in the matter of storage ground on the quays. These were however,
                        of minor importance, and I need not trouble you with the details. We were
                        also instrumental in obtaining the continued running during the summer
                        months of the sorting van in connection with the letters for Alexandria by
                        the Brindisi mail. At the suggestion of our Cairo Committee, an employment
                        register was started, and applica <cb n="4"/> tions from clerks and
                        employers were invited. We received many such applications from clerks, but
                        practically none from employers, and this despite the fact that the work was
                        duly advertised and done gratuitously.</p>
                    <p>I am pleased to be able to report a considerable increase in membership
                        during the course of the past year. On 1st January 1906 we had 398 members,
                        whilst at the end of the year the figures were 478, being a net gain of 80
                        supporters.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the monthly Journal, it is rather an anomaly that the greater
                        the increase in membership, the larger becomes the apparent loss on the
                        publication, unless a corresponding increase in advertisements takes place.
                        A number of new advertisements were secured in 1906, but the full benefit
                        does not appear in last year's accounts. At the present moment, the
                        advertisements in force show an increase in value for 1907 over 1906 of L54.
                        More interest is being taken in the Journal, and I think the number of
                        persons who read our publication, and do not immediately throw it into the
                        wastepaper basket as soon as they have removed the envelope, is increasing.
                        Our articles are copied in various trade journals (including the weekly one
                        issued by the Board of Trade) and English newspapers. We also get enquiries
                        from advertisement contractors at home for our rates, and we received more
                        than one advertisement during year for which we in no way solicited, thus
                        showing that the journal is becoming more and more known. A propos of the
                        journal, I cannot help thinking that the increase in the flour shipments
                        from England during 1906 has been in the main due to the manner in which we
                        have from time to time drawn the attention of home millers to this market. A
                        firm of British millers – for whom we found agents here – recently wrote us
                        to the effect that they had done very well with the people we mentioned to
                        them. They also gave us particulars of the flour they were regularly
                        shipping, and they expressed the hope that their tonnage would induce the
                        steamship companies to give them better facilities and more regular
                        sailings.</p>
                    <p>That is nearly all I have to say, but there is just one other matter to which
                        I should like to refer. You will remember that the opinion of this Chamber –
                        along with that of other smaller bodies – on the subject of the abolition of
                        the Capitulations was invited by Lord Cromer in his last annual report.
                        Well, your Committee made a communication to his Lordship on the subject. It
                        is neither necessary nor expedient that I should go into details, but the
                        main drift of our opinion was in favour of the abolition of the
                        Capitulations provided that the necessary guarantees securing the permanency
                        of the British supremacy in Egypt were given. Certain reservations were made
                        as to details. I feel sure that every member of this Chamber will approve
                        our declaration.</p>

                    <p>The great activity and demand for goods during the marketing of the cotton
                        crop from September onwards, culminating in the large clearances during
                        December to settle up accounts, usually bring about a set-back in the volume
                        of imports at the turn of the year. The returns for last month show no
                        exception to the rule, the imports for that month amounting to L.E 2,036,463
                        as against L.E. 2,659,737 in the previous month. There is, however, a big
                        increase of L.E. 258,739 on the figures for January, 1906. The exports
                        during last month amounted to L.E. 3,808,655, an increase of L.E. 845,953 on

                        killed. Shortly afterwards, the Sherif of Mecca received orders to send a

                    <p>The February Skye Meeting at Helouan yesterday was not so well attended as
                        usual, in spite of the genial weather, which was even more balmy and
                        spring-like in Helouan than in Cairo. </p>
                    <p> However, a good many people took advantage of the occasion to lunch at the
                        Twefik Palace and Grand Hotel before the races commenced, among those at the

                        in time to witness the first race, and various others arrived later on. Lady
                        Newborough was noticed on the ground, and the Countess of Karolyi was there
                        with her daughter and the Mlles Villebois. Miss Bullock was with Mrs. Stout,
                        and Capt. and Mrs. Schrieber had Miss Hurley with them. Sir Robert Dashwood
                        was with friends, as also was Lord Rosslyn. Mr. and Mrs. Kershaw were there,

                        kept his lead easily, but there was a hard and exciting fight for second
                        place between Voltigeur and Matarawi which ended in a dead heat. Happy Boy
                        also made a good attempt for second place, but never really looked like

                        its place, though apparently with little chance of winning. From a bad start
                        Ladase had it fairly well his own way all around the course and won with

                    <p> This race was the best contested event of the afternoon, the finish being
                        most exciting. All five horses started off fairly well in a bunch and kept
                        together for a considerable distance, but Glouglou, Beddier, and Nebih
                        gradually drew a head together and the former two kept almost neck to neck
                        with the last named close behind. At the finish Glouglou only won by the

                        the first attempt was bungled. The second effort, however, saw all the
                        horses go off well together and a splendid run for first place was made.
                        Positions were frequently exchanged, but Chere towards the end made a very
                        good effort and got well in front of Siham and Ghzai, with whom he was
                        running almost level, and eventually won by a good length. Ghazi made a good
                        struggle for third place, but was fairly easily beaten in the last lap by
                        Siham.</p>

                                started in life as a journalist, and founded the "Poliziani" at
                                Florence, which only had a short existence; he then published his

                                of Alfieri and Giusti, 1860, and was the same year appointed
                                professor of Italian literature at Bologne University. The 'Hymn to
                                Satan" was his best piece of work he published it in 1865 under the
                                pseudonym of Enotrio Romano, a signature which he employed ever
                                afterwards when writing fiction; he signed his own name only when
                                writing as a professor or critic. Among other of his poetical works
                                were "Levia gravis," "Iambes and Epodes," "New Poems," "Barbarian
                                Odes," "Garibaldi," "Ca ira," "September 1792," "Petrarch," and
                                "Boccaccio." His essays include "Commentaries on Petrarch's Rhymes."
                                In 1887 a special class was formed at the University of Rome to
                                explain the poems of Dante, and show the celebrated writer to be an
                                enemy of the Papacy and of temporal power. He refused the offer of
                                the chair, on the ground that he did not believe what he considered
                                to be a historic falsehood. He was made a Senator in 1890.</p>

                    <head>THE COMING OF KHARTOUM</head>
                    <p>BY ONE OF THE GARRISON</p>
                    <p>As I write this, a few days before Christmas, great tidings are to hand of a
                        valuable consignment- of Christmas puddings on the way from London. These
                        accompanied by a case of good old English holly, berries and all, were
                        safely detrained at the present terminus of the Cape-to-Cairo Railway, just
                        over the way on the Blue Nile opposite to us in Khartoum. Could anything
                        more genially emphasise the wondrous transformation scene — surpassing
                        anything that old Drury Lane could produce— which British rule, or rather
                        the rule of Britons, has effected here in a few short years?</p>
                    <p>Often as the lucubrations of Little Engenders and anti-nationalists, who seem
                        to be the top dog at home just now, filter through to us with the papers
                        from Cairo, one looks around and realises the mighty pity of the remoteness
                        of these great racial object-lessons from the ignorant horde of island-bound
                        fanatics who bark like frightened curs at every distant vision of Empire.
                        But, of course, you must have been here in the dark days of battle, murder,
                        and sudden death to appreciate fully the brilliance of the present,
                        irradiating from a new and splendid city which has arisen in a few short
                        years out of a filthy shambles smelling of blood.</p>
                    <p>Imagine, if you can, that yon are nearing Khartoum by rail, after a thousand
                        miles of comparative waste and barrenness which has become by this time
                        rather wearisome. Some one tells you that the city is in sight. You look
                        towards it and are charmed, for it seems a veritable Eden of verdure after
                        your late experiences. Backed by the African blue of the sky, and bowered in
                        bountiful masses of green, interspersed with graceful palms, rises the white
                        palaces of the Governor, a glistening mass of buildings, in which beauty and
                        elegance have not been sacrificed to certain military considerations which
                        wisely entered into the design of a structure that was to rise upon the
                        scene of Gordon's tragic end. So its walls are stout, and along the river
                        front they present a very plain and militant appearance.</p>
                    <p>The verdant appearance of the city, which adds so much to the strange charm
                        of its situation, is due to the fact that the Dervish hordes who did their
                        best to destroy what Gordon left, including his palace, never thought of
                        cutting down the trees, many of which Gordon himself had placed there; while
                        all .his rose-trees were left by the Mahdist vandals just as he planted
                        them, and still bear witness in the garden of the Governor- General to the
                        heroic soldier's care for simple things amidst the desperate defence of the
                        beleaguered city.</p>
                    <p>From the river front one enters the palace by an arched gateway in the long
                        wall. Once inside, a charming picture captivates our gaze —green lawns
                        shaded by beautiful masses of foliage: vistas of fair gardens ablaze with
                        flowers of many a hue, both tropical and European, which lure one in every
                        direction as one gazes on the parklike scene where sun and shadow divide
                        their reign amidst magnificent trees and tiny streamlets of sparkling water.
                        The grounds are in all about eleven acres in extent, and present a triumph
                        of assiduous gardening in such close proximity to the Equator.</p>
                    <p>The garden front of the Palace is destined to secure the maximum amount of
                        coolness and comfort with its triple tiers of arched colonnades formed in a
                        hollow square. Artisitically curving flights of steps lead up from the
                        rosery to the lower colonnade. This is based upon a further series of
                        arches, which also do much to secure the coolness of the interior. One of
                        these flights of steps leads past the scene of Gordon's last stand and
                        death, and this is marked for the benefit of future generations with an
                        inscription upon a granite slab. The state and private apartments are
                        handsome, well-proportioned rooms, and there can only be one opinion that,
                        chaffed as they may have been at different times over other achievements,
                        Khartoum and its palace will always remain a splendid monument to the
                        architectural ingenuity of the Royal Engineers. They designed and decorated
                        the palace, and it is upon their plans that so many fine buildings have
                        been, and are being, erected in the city at the present moment.</p>
                    <p>Khartoum has been so rapidly modernised that it is impossible to say where it
                        will stop when the completion of the great transcontinental line places it
                        in one of the world's great commercial highways. Already in its present
                        state of development a splendid monument of British civilising energy, it is
                        the wonder of beholders from Europe and America, <cb n="3"/> who walk up and
                        down in the wide streets, laid out at right angles to one another, and
                        traversing this new African metropolis in all directions from the central
                        position of the Gordon Square.</p>
                    <p>Beside the Palace of the Governor-General there rises not far distant another
                        handsome block of buildings. These are the headquarter offices of the Sudan
                        Government, for Khartoum will always remain the seat of administration.
                        Then, adding distinction to other parts of the city, there is the Gordon
                        College, the War Office, the Courts of Justice, Post and Telegraphs,
                        Government stores, police and military barracks, Mudirieh, all handsome
                        specimens of architecture evolved by the genius of the Royal Engineers.
                        Besides these, the banks are housed in extremely fine buildings, while
                        numerous and beautiful private houses are rising up on all sides. There is
                        excellent hotel accommodation for the visitors, who always troop down by
                        rail during the Cairo season, and for residents there is the "Sudan Club.''
                        The entrance fee of the latter is not extravagant, but its subscription is
                        up to the size of a good club in London for those who live in Khartoum. The
                        dinners are good, and its rooms comfortably furnished while polo and
                        race-meetings make it a general rendezvous.</p>
                    <p>As a setting to the many architectural features of the city, beautiful
                        gardens have been laid out in many directions and planted with trees and
                        flowers. For two miles along the river side runs a promenade shaded with
                        palms and other trees, while shrubberies attract the eye on all sides, in
                        which the flora almost entirely belongs to the Soudan. Here Khartoum society
                        rides and walks, or perchance it betakes itself to the zoological gardens,
                        in which a military band always plays on Sundays.</p>
                    <p>It is a pity that more of the actual building of new Khartoum could not have
                        been given to natives, but the Mahdist terror which destroyed the land and
                        all its ancient handicrafts is responsible for the fact that the work has
                        had to be given to Italians. The natives, however, are eager to be taught
                        everything, and under the benign rule of Britain the country is being once
                        more repopulated, and, as a sheikh observed to me the other day, "Our people
                        have never known such blessings, such peace and justice before."</p>
                    <p>There is plenty of work every day in Khartoum for able-bodied natives who,
                        each race by itself, live in their own village cantonments outside Khartoum,
                        each under the rule of their own headman, whom we hold responsible for their
                        orderly behavior and cleanliness. All—men, women, and children—are perfectly
                        happy and contented. Work is well paid, and, besides that which the men do,
                        thousands of women find employment at good wages in the building works,
                        mixing mortar, digging foundations, carrying brick-, etc., or act as
                        gardeners or sweepers. The black hand of oppression has been lifted from the
                        land, and all are free to have and to hold what is their own without fear
                        and trembling. As one moves around and sees the evident happiness of the
                        people, one cannot help an occasional sneaking feeling of pride in the work
                        of one's race, though to doubt our Little Englanders would find something to
                        bark at, as they did at the destruction of the Mahdi's tomb. II .waver, the
                        work is likely to outlast them and their opinions together.</p>
                    <p>The ruins of the Mahdi's tomb, the Khalifa's house, and the Dervish arsenal
                        are still the chief attractions at Omdurman, which is on the White Nile
                        about three miles round the corner westward. With its mud hovels it serves
                        to emphasise the change in the timer, although it is now intersected by wide
                        roads and is under strict police supervision. No doubt it will gradually
                        disappear with the extension of the modern city, for we are still dreaming
                        of future development, and with the abounding prosperity which must come
                        with the development of the great railway communications to the east and
                        south, it is impossible to place a limit to the future magnificence of the
                        new city.</p>
                    <p>Anyway, those with a few weeks to spare will find plenty of unusual interest
                        in and around this fine new African metropolis, which is now only five days
                        by rail from Assouan, a splendid lite with capital dining and sleeping cars,
                        and hot baths awaiting the traveler at Abn Hamed. These are erected close to
                        tin- line, and are fitted with every comfort, the water being pumped from
                        the Nile three- quarters of a mile away. ("Pall Mall Gazette").</p>

                    <p>There will be very few changes in the .army of occupation in Egypt in the

                    <p>A la rigneur, on pourrait scinder la semaine qui vient de fiuir en deux
                        parties, sinon d'egale importance oomme nombre de seaneces, du moins se
                        valant sous le rapport de l'interet qu'elles ont offert au public, quoique
                        dans des sens tout-a-fait opposes. La premiere, qui va de samedi a mardi a l
                        beure, avait debute ferme et en hausse sous les efforts des detenteurs des
                        contrats, mais le releve de la statistique eguyptienne a Liverpool, reca
                        dans le courant de la matinee, n'ayant pas donne' tonte la satisfaction
                        voulue, le calme n'a pas tarde a survenir et pour les deux jour suivants, a
                        la faiblesse s'est jointe la baisse. A chaque c'oture sous etions en recul,
                        au point que nois avions fini par tomber a 21 ½, apres avoir passe par le
                        minimum de 21 3/16 pour le mars.</p>
                    <p>La suspension d'affaires que nous avons ene dans l'apree-midi a l'occasion du
                        Marti-Gra est venue non seulement mette un arret au movement retrograde,
                        mais ondirait qu'elle a eu encore pour effet de modifier les dispositions de
                        la speculation a la hausse, qu s'etait montree jusques-la un pen trop
                        influence par la continuation des gros arrivages et la diminution des
                        exportations, du moins a ce que les scheteurs eux memes ont fini a tort par
                        croire. Le fait est que la rentree des haussiers au marce Mercredimatin a eu
                        lieu avec un sentiment tout different de celui qui avait domine chez eux
                        dans les trois journees precedents, dar, a partir de ce moment-la, c'est la
                        fermete qui a pris le dessus. Dupis, cette nouvelle tendance n'a fait que
                        s'accenteur par la suite, et le tout s'est traduit detinitivement par une
                        avance marquee qui a fini par ramener le Mars a 21 9/16, apres l'avoir fait
                        passer par le maximum de 21 5/8.</p>
                    <p>Tel eat en somme le resume des prouessesdes trois dernieres journees;
                        seulement, ce qui etonne le plus, ce n'est pas le resultat matierla de 1/8
                        de hausse sur la cote de Vendredi dernier, resultat qu aurait pu tout aussi
                        bien etre obtenu moyennant une manoeuvre quelconque, mais c'est la facilite
                        avec laquelle toutes les raisons qui existaient pour la baisse ont ete
                        oubliees ou mises de cote, de maniere a faire penser que les haussiers
                        avaient fini par s'y habituer et par ne plus en faire de cae. Tout drole que
                        dela puisse paratire, la realite est celle-la: Lln'y a que la volonte de la
                        speculation qui compte, et ni movement de la recolte, ni importantce de son
                        rendement, ni abstention de la consummation, rein ne peut faire pencher la
                        balance du cote de la baisse. On veut la hausse, et on tachera de la
                        produire par tous les moyens possibles!</p>
                    <p>Les reste viendra par la suite, plus tard, beaucoup plus tard; ce qu'il y a
                        d'urgent pour le parti de la hausse c'est d'eviter l'ecueil de l'echeance
                        mars et ses consequences et, a sa facon de juger, il n'y a que la fermete
                        pour y arriver, et pour y parvenier toutes les assertions sont bonnes. Et
                        dans ce but, on ne craint pas d'affirmer, malgre l'evidence contraire qui
                        resort des arrivages et des informations de l'interieur, que la recolte
                        n'est que de 6 ½ millions de cantars, qu'il y a un grand decouvert sur mars,
                        qu'il y a une maison deja perparee a recevoir 200,000 cantars de mars et que
                        les artitragistes ont deja reporte une grande partie de la position sur mai;
                        la plupart de ces affirmations ne visent qu'a influence l'opinion en vue des
                        transerts a faire de mars a mai,</p>

                        <p>car, au fond, il n'y a qu'un seul point de vrai et c'est l'assertion que
                            l'interet des haussiers se porte aujourd'hui partiellement sur mai; mais
                            en supposant que l'on reussisse a tout reporter sans angmenter les taux
                            aetuels, qu'aura fait apres tout la speculation a la hausse? Simplement
                            gagner du temps, sans toutefois avoir la certitude finale d'une
                            reussite, la prorogation de l'echeance ne pouvant signifier autre chose
                            que rencherissement de la merchandise et la filature pouvant tonjours se
                            defender en ayant recours aux achats par petite parties, au fur et a
                            mesure des besoinsan cas ou elle serait force de revenir au marche dans
                            un moment defavorable pour elle.</p>
                        <p>Il n'y aurait donc que l'imprevu sur lequel on pourrait jeuer, mais a
                            celui-la on pourrait oppose le fait que la filature refuse de prendre le
                            moindre engagement pour livraisons rapprochees, quell que soit le prix,
                            ce qui indiquerait qu'elle ne pent travailler advantage qu'elle ne le
                            feit et comme elle est naurellement converte pour ce qu'elle a deja
                            vendu en fait de files, elle n'a pas besoin d'acheter du vieux coton
                            pour les contrats qu'elle peat passer pour la prochaine campaign! Du
                            reste, le Novembre a 19 tallaris environ liu offer pour cela une bien
                            meilleure couverture!!</p>
                        <p>Autant les affaires ont ete limitees Durant les trois journees de baisse,
                            autant l'activite a e e grande dans la derniere partie de la semaine,
                            surtout sujourd'hui qui a ete la journee culminante. Toutefois, c'est la
                            nouvelle recolte qui a le plus profite de l'etat du marche expose plus
                            haut, ce qui ne doit geure surprendre, etant donne l'existence reelle du
                            decouvert sur Novembre, L'importance des positions en prescence, ainsi
                            que le fait indeniable de la part prise aux affaires pour l'annee
                            prochaine par l'exportation. La filature a achete et quoique ses
                            operations soient limites a une partie du Continent, il n'en est pas
                            moins vrai que cette participation n'en constitue pas moins une aide
                            precieuse pour la speculation. On pretend que l'Angleterre a
                            aussiachete, mais le fait n'est pas confirme et dans tous les cas il ne
                            assurait etre question que de faits isoles. De la part del l'Amerique, </p>
                        <p>La demande a porte aujourd'hui d'une maniere particuliere sur le janvier
                            que etait en deport et c'est ce te circumstance qui a donne l'eveil a la
                            speculation que le commerce etait en train d'acheter, le janvier dans
                            les conditions cu il se trouvait constituent pour lui me converture plus
                            avantageuse pour ses ventes a l'etranger. On commence peut-etre a
                            exagerer un peu les choses pour ce qui regarde la recoite prochaine,
                            mais en somme jusqu'ici il y a une certaine justification aux haut scour
                            de moment. Pour la suite il y aura la question de la recolte qui reglera
                            les choses. En tous cas, si cette situation persiste, ce sera lea manne
                            pour le cultivateur egyptien qui peut deja assurer une partie de la
                            recolte qu'il n'a pass encore plantee dans les L4 ½ environ pour son
                            coton en grains!! Il faut bien reconnailire que la syeanlation a parfois
                            du bon pour que ques-oos.</p>
                        <p>Nos lecteurs 10:18 rendront cette fois ceite justice que ce qui arrive
                            sur la nouvelle recolte a ete prevu par nous, (et nous employons expres
                            cette phrase comme reponse aux gonailleurs qui trouvaint que nous
                            faisions fausse route avec nos idees sur la situation de la Vielle
                            recolte) mais nous esperons que ceux qui cont a la hausse sauront se
                            moderer pour ne pas gater les choses, car nous persistons tonjours a
                            croire qu'a un moment donne la vieille recolte nous jouera un mauvis
                            tour et <cb n="2"/> il ne faudrait pas risquer de faire empirer les
                            choses en ajoutant erreur sur erreur.</p>
                        <p>La cloture pour la nonvelle recolte a eu lien sur la cote de 19 1/8 pour
                            le novembre et 19 3/16 our le janvier, soit respectivement 7/32 et 11/32
                            de hausse.</p>
                        <p>Le marche du disponible chez nous a eu des moments d'animation, mais
                            comme ensemble, nous sommes dans la meme position qu'il y a huit jours.
                            Pour ce qui est des prix, il n'y a que les Jonnovich qui aient monte de
                            ¼ de tallari, pour cause de rarete et de recherché special, tandis que
                            le restant de la cote est inchange.</p>
                        <p>Les exportations de la semaine ont ete une veritable disillusion avec
                            leur total de 18000 balles, reste inferieur aux previsions moderees qui
                            avaient ete donnees. L'annee dernier le chiffre de la periode
                            correspondante etait de 33000 balles.</p>
                        <p>Pour la demaine prochaine, il n'y aura rien de brilliant, malgre les 16 ½
                            17000 balles en tout pour 1906; on ne saurait toutefois encore enoncer
                            une quantite quelconque.</p>
                        <p>Cette diminution dans nos expeditions est a prendre en serieuse deja
                            lances par nous que la difference entre le mois courant et fevrier 1906
                            sera de 30% en moins. Pour la premiere qunzaine il y a deja 12000 balles
                            et selon toutes probabilities, pour la seconde partie il y aura a peu

                        <p>Il n'y a pas a badiner avec cet e question, car d'autre part comme

                            cantars, cela nous fera, avec les rectifications habitnelles, etc. etc.,
                            une recolte d'au moins 6.800.000 cantars, et peut etre meme de 7

                            en dontions un peu, la difference entre no scours et Liverpool offrant
                            un advantage reel a ceux qui avaient des engagements qu'ils pouvaient

                        <p>La lourdeur du marche samedi et lundi etait attribuee par quelques-uns
                            aux fetes du mardi-gras, mais la tenue des jours suivants a revele que
                            la place etait influence par des causes bien plus graves. La fait es que
                            des deux dernieres séances ont brille par une affluence inusitee de
                            vendeurs ne trouvant pas de contrepartie. Les acheteurs s'etaient
                            eclipses. Il e nest ainsi a chaque nouvelle emission, quelle qu'elle
                            soit. On vend les titres qu'on a pour souscrire. C'est ce qui explique
                            l'absence des acheteurs, l'affluence des vendeurs et l'adminrable
                            success de l'emission du jour qui a ete trente tois (30 fois!) courerte,
                            en depit d'une disette monetaire encore aigue. La prime de cette
                            emission fortune n'est pourtant que de 1/32-1/16. Les titres ont ainsi,
                            a leur facon, leur Carnaval.</p>
                        <p>La consequence de cet etat d'esprit chez nos speculateurs n'a jamais ete
                            aussi elequente que cette semaine. Sur une soixantaine de valeurs
                            inscrites a la cote officielle de notre place, 32 sont eu haisse, 7
                            seulement en hausse et les autres demeurent stationnaires.</p>

                            et c'est en partie a l'influence de ces deux phares directeurs qu'il
                            faut attibuer l'abstention momentanee des gros capitaliates egyptiens,
                            ainsi que les precautions minutienuses des banques. Les principaux
                            establissements de credit du pays ne peuvent moins faire, en efft euq
                            d'obeir aux indications ces places avec lesquelles ils on d'etroits
                            rapports et en l'espece leur reserve s'accroit de la defiance suscitee
                            par les bevues de la speculation locale. De la leur refus de consenter
                            de nouvelles avances. Notre marche devra leur savoir gre de cette
                            attitude, a la condition toutefois que leur rigneur dure assez pour

                            writes: </p>
                        <p>"I have been annoyed with a cough for years. </p>
                        <p>"Often it was so bad that I could not sleep half the night. Many people
                            thought I had consumption.</p>
                        <p>CONSUMPTION WAS FEARED.</p>
                        <p>"A woman recommended Peruna to me two years ago. I began to take Peruna
                            and now I am perfectly free from a cough, </p>
                        <p>"I am glad to say that Peruna cured me entirely, I take Peruna
                            occasionally when I do not feel well and I also give it to my children. </p>
                        <p>"Peruna is the best medicine for coughs and colds. I have told many
                            people how much Peruna has helped me." </p>
                        <p>A neglected cold is a well-worn path to consumption. </p>
                        <p>Many a person catches cold and pays no attention to it. </p>
                        <p>He scarcely recovers from the first cold when he takes the second.</p>
                        <p>Still he gives it no heed, and possibly takes another cold, and so on. </p>
                        <p>He doses himself with bromides, quinine and various expectorants. </p>
                        <p>His case is catarrh, at this stage, and his case should be treated as
                            catarrh. </p>
                        <p>A common cold is acute catarrh. </p>
                        <p>Finally, if the cold is allowed to continue, it becomes chronic catarrh. </p>
                        <p>Mrs, Frances Wilson, 82 Nelson street, Clinton, Mass., writes: </p>
                        <p>"Had you seen me at the time of my illness and now, you would not wonder
                            that 1 take delight in sounding the praises of Peruna. </p>
                        <p>"My ailment was a severe cold which attacked the bronchial tubes and
                            lungs. </p>
                        <p>"I followed your special directions and after using six bottles of Peruna
                            I was on my feet again.</p>
                        <p>"I think Peruna a wonderful medicine." </p>
                        <p>All colds, coughs, bronchitis, laryngtis and tonsilitis should be treated
                            as catarrh, as they are in reality catarrh. </p>
                        <p>The success of Peruna in relieving these cases entirely depends upon the
                            fact that Peruna is a catarrh remedy. </p>
                        <p>It relieves catarrh wherever located in the system. Whether in the
                            throat, bronchial tubes or lungs. </p>
                        <p>CONSUMPTION PREVENTED.</p>
                        <p>It has saved a multitude of peo-ple from consumption by eradicating
                            catarrh before it reaches the lungs. </p>
                        <p>The tendency of catarrh of the throat or head is to spread downward to
                            the lungs. </p>
                        <p>If taken in time, Peruna will prevent these cases. </p>
                        <p>We have in our files many testimonials from people who thought they were
                            victims of consumption, but have been permanently relieved by the
                            faithful use of Peruna. thus showing that catarrh was really the cause
                            of their ailments.</p>

                    <p>"Notre marche a ete calme cette semaine, mais la tendance generale reste
                        favorable. Dans le compartiment des valeurs egyptiennes, il y a eu des
                        demandes en National Bank, en Agricole, Delta Land, Estates et Markets. On
                        prevoit plus d'activite dans la seconde quinzaine.</p>
                    <p>La position de la Banque d'Angleterre continue a s'ameliorer. Cela provident
                        des rentrees d'or qui comblent les vides importants faits l'anne derniere a
                        nos reserves. L'Egypte renvoie une partie de ce qu'elle nois a pris. La
                        Banque vient de recevoir de cette provenance L500,000. On avait craint que
                        l'Inde mit la main sur le metal jaune accumule sur les bords du Nil; mais
                        elle n'en a Presque rien fait. Il est egalement a noter que l'Amerique du
                        Sud, don't on redoutait fort les demandes, s'abstient aussi pour le moment
                        de nous inquieter. Reste a voir ce que peut nous reservoir le marche de New
                        York."</p>

                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased

                        succeeds the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the

                        "used up," and valueless. This wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and
                        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative
                        essence, which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had
