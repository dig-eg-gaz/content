                    <p>Negotiations of considerable importance to* the commercial community of Egypt
                        began this morning between Sir John Deuison Pen- der, K.C.M.G.,
                        vice-chairman and managing director of the Eastern. Telegraph Company, and
                        the Egyptian Government, in regard to the reduction of the Eastern Telegraph
                        Company’s rates for telegrams as far as Egypt is con- cerned. Sir John
                        Denison Pender, who is accompa- nied by his wife, arrived at Port Said
                        yesterday afternoon by the P. &amp; 0. S.S. "Caledonia” from Marseilles and,
                        on disembarking, pro- ceeded at once to Cairo. The negotiations will only
                        last a day or two, and Sir John’s visit to Egypt will be of short duration.
                        If these negotiations are brought to a suc- cessful issue, it is expected
                        that the reductions that will ensue will be considerable. The amount of
                        telegraphic work on the Eastern Telegraph Company’s system between Egypt and
                        Europe has increased greatly, owing to the enormous financial and commercial
                        deve- lopment of this country. Reductions will be welcomed by all the
                        business community, and it is sincerely to be hoped, therefore, that the
                        present negotiations will be brought to a satisfactory termination.</p>

                    <p>jn' Jnnuary 1903 I took the discharge of Ibis Euphrates near Mosaib and found
                        it 750 '" )u’>io lustres per Second with the gauge at 1.00 metres. The width
                        was 250 metres, the 3.30 metres, and the velocity. .90 metres !'n“r second.
                        By calculation I made the maximum ;,)fiischarg® 2koj00cubic metres per
                        second and I the.minimum 250. M. Mougel informed me that the maximum
                        discharge was 3,000 cubic . metres per second and the minimum 300. The width
                        of the Euphrates between Feluja and Mosaib may be taken as 250 metres ; the
                        depth at low water as 2 metres, and in flood as 5.5 inetres.- At Mosaib is a
                        very dangerous curve on the river which needs heavy pro- tective works. If
                        the Euphrates were to burst its banks at this curve,the heaviest inundations
                        would eDsue,’ and the regimen of the river would be disorganised for many
                        years. Below Mosaib is the head of the Hindia Banal. At the head of the
                        Hindia Canal (or more properly speaking ruin) is a weir 230 metres long. The
                        body of the weir consists of heavy blocks of limestone brought down from
                        Hit, and thrown into the water from boats. The width of pitching, at the
                        base is 35 metres, and at top'15 metros,, with a mean height 7.50 ^(metres
                        above the scoured bed of the river. On this base of pitching is a masonry
                        wall 10 ' “metres wide at bottom, 2 metres wide at top, and 2.50 metres
                        higdi. In the middle of the weir is an opening 20 metres wide, where there
                        is no masonry wall overlying the pitching. When I was. there in January,
                        with 750 cubic metres per second'passing down the canal (tor the Ei.phia'.cs
                        itsfcff below the Hindia Canal head, past Bybyloh and Hille, was discharging
                        under 20 cnbiciuietres per secojid)jyhe head of water waa‘2.00 metres,. In
                        high flood the head is reduced to 1.00 metre, while iu low supply it is J
                        .30 metres. In low supply the Euphrates below the Hindia Canal head is dry
                        for about Between the head of the Hindia Canal at Mosaib aud Sawatna, where
                        the Hindia Canal flows back into the river after having trave-sed the Nejel
                        swamps, the Euphrates has a length of about 240 kilometres. Iu this reach
                        there is a fair supply iu flood, but there is no water in summer. At .the
                        beginning of the reach the width of the river iu flood may be taken as be-
                        tween 150 and ioo metres, while at the tail the width is, quite;
                        insignificant; indeed the' river may be said to have ceased to exist be-
                        fore Saw«ua is reached. The true Euphrates to-day is tho Hindia Canal. Past
                        Babylon and Hille the river has silted up to a height of 3 or 4'metres above
                        its ancient bed.-Babylon has known many vicissitudes, but none so severe

                    <head>THE DAWN OF EGYPTIAN TRADE</head>
                    <p>Archaeological research among the ruins ol the cities of the old world has
                        thrown a new and unexpected light upon the beginnings of trade and commerce.
                        There is a yast pre- historic veldt of time stretching far beyond tho
                        threshold of history; a silent age, which has'bequeathed to us no written
                        story, but finds its record in the conteqts of tombs and graves of the Nile
                        valley or the deepest strata of the mounds of Chaldea and Susiannia. What a
                        record of commercial activity is preserved to us by a small fragment, of
                        jade, telling of a, weary caravan journey from the heart of Asia; while the
                        fragments of a carved rhinoceros horn, found with pieces of ivory or ebony,
                        in the dynasty tombs at Nagada and Abydos first show that even at that
                        remote period, some five thousand years before the Christian era, the
                        Egyptian had penetrated into the heart of the Dark Continent. It is this
                        opening up of Africa which forms one of the most interesting chapters in the
                        history of trade and commerce, and in which we find a solution of .the
                        problem of ancient gold-working in South Africa.</p>

                    <head>THE NILE VALLEY</head>
                    <p>were a peaceful race, possessing no aggressive- ambition, but contented to
                        hold their own, to a certain extent maintaining a conservative policy.
                        Still, however,. the exigencies of civili- sation produced certain wants
                        which could only be met by trade and commerce. To the Nile Valley there were
                        two channels of entrance—a southern by the main waterway of the Nile, an
                        eastern chiefly by the isthmus of Suez, and the long narrow valley leading
                        to the shores of the Red Sea. The trade with the Upper Nile regions began in
                        prehistoric times, as shown by the largo quantities of ivory. and ebony
                        found' in the tombs of the archaic and early dynastic periods. One curious
                        feature of this trade was the importation of dwarfs or pigmies.. The
                        skeletons and funeral state of these little men have been found in the The
                        importation of these little men was par- tially connected with religion, for
                        they are ' spoken of as “ the pigmies that' danced before the God,” probably
                        the God Bes, the God of laughter and dancing, the God with- the mask, from
                        whom the Greeks derived their God of Comedy. They become, however, pets, and
                        are curiously enough usually named, in a sarcastic vein, no doubt, Nefer
                        “beauty.” In the second and sixth dynasties we have records of such
                        importations. The most important record of this up-Nile trade is found in a
                        curious papyrus of the time of the Twelfth dynasty, about B.C. 2500;' which
                        records the adventures of a trader who passed up the Nile far into the Dark
                        Continent, when he was shipwrecked.</p>

                        purpose of carrying on the business ot an Investment,Exploration,and
                        Development Company, especially in Bgypt and the Spudan. For aome jreare
                        private Syndicates have been exploring concessions granted by the Egyptian
                        and Soudan Governments with .very satisfactory results; districts previously
                        unexplored Have been opened np, and laud hitherto of little value is now
                        steadily idipioring in price, and is in great demand. The irrigation and
                        reclamation schemes projected are likely to still further inorease the
                        investment for kujj and oonoessions. ^ In view of the above, it is proposed
                        that this Company shall .pay speoial attention to business conneoted with
                        land development, irrigation schemes, and reclamation works. A. \ It is
                        generally admitted that the many industries of Egypt, under the careful
                        snpervision of the Government, are now making steady progress. It is
                        intended to act as financial agents in London, Paris and elsewhere for land
                        .development, mining and other oompaniae) and it is anticipated that
                        considerable profit will result from this source. In view of the increasing
                        interest of French Investors in Egyptian Securities, it is proposed to open
                        a Branch Offioe in Pari* at an ' early date. As the success of Company of
                        this nature is to a large extent dependent upon a thorough knowledge of
                        looal nnnilitinn. it j, extremely satisfactory to have secured the services,

                        and looal) business conditions is probably unequalled. Mr. Hooker has
