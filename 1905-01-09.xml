                    <head><persName>LORD ROBERTS</persName> ON THE ARMY.</head>
                    <p>What “Bobs” has to say about the Army is what the Army and the nation want to
                        hear. And <persName>Lord Roberts</persName> says his say to the extent of
                        five-and-twenty pages in the current number of the Nineteenth Century. His
                        article is large­ly historical, since his object is to draw a com­parison
                        between the Army "as it was and as it is." All that he has to say on this
                        side of the question is deeply interesting. In his own person he has seen
                        the new grafted on the old. He has commanded the old Army in the field and
                        led it to victory. He has also at an ad- vanoed age and bowed by personal
                        trouble with astonishing vigor commanded and led to victory the largest army
                        that we have ever put into the field, fighting under conditions as far
                        removed from those under which <persName>Lord Roberts</persName> first saw
                        service as is the khaki uniform from the bright coatees and cumbrous stocks
                        in which the Peninsular campaigns were fought <persName>Lord
                            Roberts's</persName> claims to reverence, respect and admiration rest on
                        a sure basis of experience and devotion to the highest sense of duty.</p>

                    <p>It is on his advice that interest will be fixed. The historical comparison is
                        extremely interesting, and it leads to the reasoned optimism of a great
                        soldier. In 1854 the British Army, at home and abroad, totalled 189,980 men,
                        with 120 field guns. There was no Reserve and no Volunteer Force. With die
                        Militia and Yeomanry, we had at the most 200,000 men. These men were
                        incessantly drilled, but badly trained ; com­missions were purchased by
                        officers whose education and intelligence were in inverse ratio to their
                        gallantry.; the whole force was armed with inferior weapons and the men were
                        not taught to shoot. In its day that little British Army went far and did
                        wonders. But those were the days of point-blank range and close forma­tion.
                        Since then by degrees we have adapt­ed our forces and our weapons to the
                        changed conditions brought about by the scientific improvement of arms and
                        ammunition and we have always managed to “muddle through.’’ It is not hard
                        to understand that <persName>Lord Roberts</persName>, who knew the old Army,
                        and who has known the new, in barracks, on pa­rade, and in action, should be
                        something of an optimist, or that, seeing very clearly how much still
                        remains to be done and the way in which progress should be attempted, he
                        should give his advice with an apparent belief that advice may be followed
                        before it is too late.</p>
                    <p>But the root of the matter lies rather in the spirit than the letter, It is
                        the spirit alone that can revivify, and to all appearances our War Office is
                        still imbued with the spirit that has done its best to kill the Army and the
                        Empire. There has been a deal of fiddling with Army Corps and Districts and
                        territorial designations and buttons and overcoats and the minutiae of
                        drill. But the Army is as in­sufficient and inefficient as it was before the
                        South African War showed us terrible things. If we desired an illustration
                        of the permanence of bad tradition (fortunately good tradition, courage and
                        tenacity, and self-confidence, is equally permanent in the British Army), we
                        could hot have a better one than<persName> Lord Roberts'</persName> story of
                        how after adopting the Armstrong gun, our first breechloader, in 1858, we
                        re­turned six years later to muzzle-loaders for our artillery. This
                        brilliant notion can only have emanated from the same source as the amazing
                        apathy which left the British Army in 1904 without the essential supply of
                        quickfiring field- guns which had been tested, approved, and promised a year
                        previously. Obviously we must slay this demon of incompetence in
                        organisation before we can turn with much hope of their application to the
                        reforms suggested by <persName>Lord Roberts</persName></p>
                    <p>It is not, however, too much to hope that even our troglodyte authorities
                        will pay the compliment of attention to these suggestions. <persName>Lord
                            Roberts</persName> urges the importance of the Cavalry arm. We must add
                        largely to the numbers of our cavalry and the officers must be much more
                        highly trained. To effect this, without undue interference with the polo and
                        hunting which are “in moderation’’ so valuable a training for a cavalry
                        officer, they must be better paid. If we want the -best we must pay for the
                        best and make the service attractive to those whose abilities are good
                        enough to ensure success in other pro­fessions. We must also have a very
                        large body of Mounted infantry, not less than one fourth of the Infantry
                        establishment. Then since in modern warfare the control and guidance in
                        action must pass to company commanders and section leaden it is "essential
                        that their intelligence, self-reliance, and power of leading should be on a
                        proportionately higher level." Volleys being things of the past and so much
                        depending on accuracy of sum and fire discipline, “special attention should
                        be paid to individual care and control of ammunition." The necessity for
                        higher training and for the service of men as officers and non-commissioued
                        officers, whose intelligence and keenness is beyond question, is further
                        emphasised by Lord Roberts’s conviction that in the future most operations,
                        including the final attack, must,be carried out under cover of darkness, a
                        lesson that is further enforced by the experiences of the Russo-Japanese
                        campaign. “A terrible lesson,” says Lord Roberts with grim warning, “awaits
                        the nation whose soldiers find them­selves opposed to equally brave but
                        better trained opponents on the field of battle."</p>
                    <p>We have only to look to the blood-stained plains of
                            <placeName>Manchuria</placeName> to take the lesson to heart. With the
                        great commander's views on the necessity of some form of national service we
                        are in sympathy. Lord Roberts holds no brief for conscription. He prefers
                        the voluntary soldier, but he feels, that all classes “must be prepared to
                        undergo such a modicum of training as will make them ufelul as soldiers” in
                        time of need. Surely this object and the physical regeneration of the nation
                        could be achieved by the encouragement end extension of the association
                        which interests itself in fostering the military training of our youth
                        between the ages of twelve and sixteen, or thereabouts. It would be the
                        nation’s surest defence against the terrors of conscription. If Lord Roberts
                        can induce the authorities to see to this and to making the service
                        attractive and possible for the right stamp of man, he may render to the
                        Army, which he no longer commands, service almost as great as those services
                        in the field which have earned him his sure place in the ranks of the
                        world’s great soldiers.</p>

                        <p>A sanguinary dispute occurred here between the Latin and Greek clergy
                            whilst the latter were performing the Christmas midnight mass.
                                <persName>The Patriarch</persName> was officiating at
                                <placeName>Bethlehem</placeName>. The Latins were apparently the
                            aggressors, for when the Greek ecclesiastics in vestments were issuing
                            from the northern entrance of the Giotto of the Nativity, the Franciscan
                            monks barred their way and a collision ensued, with the result that one
                            Franciscan was seriously wounded and the Patriarch’s janissary slightly
                            so. The <persName>Governor of Jerusalem</persName> went to the Grotto.
                            Notwithstanding their exclusive ownership of the eastern entrance, the
                            Greeks were ultimately allowed to pass through the northern door, hence
                            the jealousy. (Reuter.)</p>

                        adequate arrangements by which some 200 passengers succeeded in boarding the
                        steamer with their luggage. The sea was then less rough because the wind had
                        dropped somewhat bat it was so cold that no one was surprised to see snow
                        falling. The bad weather and numerous snow storms lasted until the Straits
                        of Messina had been passed, after which the weather became fairly good, with
                        the exception of occasional showers of hail and rain. The ship travelled
                        well in spite of the rough sea, and averaged from 16 .to 17 miles an hour
                        every day. </p>
                    <p>Nearly 100 passengers were booked for Cairo, including <persName>Sir

                        deserved. Full houses are the order of the day, rather night, and the

                            adopted by: the Ramlehites at the mass meeting on Saturday evening, and
                            that harmonious relations have at last'been re-established between the.
                            railway directors, and the public. </p>
                        <p>The mass meeting on Saturday evening was, a great success. In spite of
                            the inclemency of the weather and of the ravages of influenza there was
                            a large and enthusiastic gathering of Ramlehites, and the venerable
                            pile, known to fame as the Theatre of Bacos, was crowded from top to
                            bottom with an audience who bad mustered from every quarter of the
                            Ramleh district. Soon after 9 o'clock the president of the Ramleh

                            fame. D’altronde la delegazione ha sempre pensato che le differenze che
                            sorgono tra il pubblieo ed una pubblica amministrazione devono essere
                            solo risolti civilmente e non all’ombra della polizia, che e spauracchio

                        <head>THE OPPOSITION.</head>
                        <p>The president’s speech was followed by a dis-course from <persName>M.
                                Zenie</persName>, another member of the Ramleh Delegation who spoke
                            in French and Arabic. He dwelt on the great debt whioh all the
                            Ramlehites were under to the president, owing to whose energy,
                            pertinacity, and diplo macy the population of Ramleh had been freed from
                            the yoke which the, directors of -the Railway Company had vainly
                            endeavoured to place on them. While this speech was proceed-ing it
                            became clear that there was a strong opposition to the amicable
                            settlement as proposed by the president. But by the explanation which
                                <persName>Mr. Quintavalle</persName> addressed to the dissen-tients,
                            it was manifest that this opposition was due to failure to grasp the
                            tenour of the president’s speech. One member of the audience reproached
                            the meeting with the charge that all they really wanted was to travel
                            free. This opprobrious imputation was severely resented by the
                            Ramlehites. Another incident occurred when two engineers got up and
                            addressed the meeting on the subject of a motor service. When these
                            gentlemen began to speak, the delegatee withdrew, as the subject under
                            dis-cussion was not on the order of the day moreover the president had-
                            refused to assent to these gentlemen, Messrs. Arcondoulis and Movesse,
                            making any 'remarks. The delegates and the Ramlehites then marched to
                            the residences of <persName>Mr. Alderson</persName> and. <persName>M.
                                Jacot de Combes</persName>, whom they serenaded. </p>

                    <p>Suakin, December 30.</p>
                    <p>H.M.S. “Sealark,” survey ship, returned here from Sheikh Barghout on the 23rd
                        inst. At daybreak on the 24th the Commander's valet was suddenly taken ill,
                        and expired very shortly after. The funeral procession took place at 2.30
                        p.m. the same day. All the officers and crew followed the mortal remains of
                        the deceased in boats to the Christian cemetery on Quarantine Island. The
                        burial service was read by the Commander and the usual naval honors were
                        paid to the deceased at the grave.</p>

                        Cosmopolitan Orchestra, under the directorship of Mr. Henry Moss, the
                        popular Assistant Commandant Suakin Police. The orchestra is composed of a
                        number of Sudan Government employes and is international. The function was a
                        thorough and well deserved success, and the performance reflected the
                        greatest credit on Mr. Muss. The Town Hall, where the concert was held, was
                        tastefully decorated with flags and banners, kindly lent for the occasion by
                        H.M.S. “Sealark” and the Sudan Government steamer “Mukhbir.” The progamma
                        opened by the orchestra playing the March '‘Sardinia.” The Arabic song “Bi
                        Cita Real Yabba Gows Ni,” by El Sayid el Hassan, was heartily encored,
                        especially by the Egyptians. Mr. Kirby and Sig. Ura were successful in their
                        violin duet and were encored several times. Mrs. Purvis elicited great
                        praise by her charming rendering of the pianotorte solo, “Preghiera del
                        Mose.” The orchestra played once more,this time "The English Gentleman," and
                        was encored a second time. Corporal George, K.E., gave a most amusing
                        recitation entitled “British Pluck,” by Kipling. Mr. Razzle, in his banjo
                        solo, was a great success. Commander Somerville, R.N., of H.M.S. “Sealark,”
                        at the request of the guests, sang an Irish comic song, and was encored so
                        heartily that he had to give another. A. B. Myers, R.N., of H.M.S.
                        "Sealark,” sang very well, and was encored by his mates to such an extent
                        that he, too, had to give another song. The Khedivial Anthem was then played
                        by the orchestra, and the proceedings ended with “God Save the King.”</p>
                    <p>A well-stocked buffet was furnished for the guests by the Suakin Mondirieh
                        and Jack Jar did ample justice to the good things that were provided for
                        him. I was glad to see Kaimakam Drury Bey, R.N., Controller of Sudan Ports,
                        on his feet again and entertaining his sailor friends. He was greatly
                        cheered and several Britishers carried him around the hall shoulder-high
                        singing "He's a jolly good fellow.”</p>
                    <p>Among the guests were : Mr. Kerr, Acting Moudir of Suakin, Kaimakam Drury
                        Bey, R.N., Controller Sudan Ports, Bimbashi Spencer, Inspector, Suakin

                        several others.</p>
                    <p>H.M.S. “Sealark" went to sea again on the 26th for surveying purposes.</p>
                    <p>Miralai Macauley Bey, Director, Sudan Railways, went up as far as Railhead on
                        the morning of the 23th inst. by a special train on inspection, returning to
                        Suakin the same evening.</p>
                    <p>The Khedivial mail steamer “Mehallah” arrived here from Suet on the 28th
                        inst, having on board Mr. C. M. Hickley, who has been acting Sudan Agent at
                        Alexandria and who will now resume his duties with the Suakin-Atbara

                        third year of publication, and its success shows that it has met a great
                        want on the part of the British manufacturer and merchant. As a medium for
                        the dissemination of knowledge of centre British inventions to our colonial
                        business houses, it should command an increased circulation—especially in
                        these days of foreign enterprise. The standard of literary merit is a high
                        one, the magazine is illustrated throughout, and in the number for December,
                        1904, will be found an interesting sketch of Lord Ribblesdale’s career, an
                        excellent portrait of his lordship forming the frontispiece of this issue.

                    <head type="sub">RECEPTION AND REVIEW.</head>
                    <p>Yesterday’s Khedivial reception was largely attended, and from an early hour
                        numbers visitors made their way to Abdeen Palace. The Diplomatic Agents and
                        Consuls, the Minister and the Advisers, the heads of department, and many of
                        the chief officers of the British Army of Occupation attended the reception,
                        with a multitude of officials and notables. While it was in progess, many
                        tourists and sight seers paid visits to Abdeen-square to watch the arrival
                        of those who attended the reception, and to make guesses, sometimes very
                        mistaken ones, at their identity.</p>
                    <p>Cairo was favored with bright, if cool, weather. The streets, in consequence
                        of the general holiday, were crowded, and the square before the Khedivial
                        Opera House, the neighbourhood of Abdeen, and the Esbekieh Gardens were
                        gaily decorated.</p>
                    <p>The afternoon's review was a remarkably fine sight The appearance and
                        marching of the troops was very good, and the cavalry, both when trotting
                        and cantering past, went by splendidly, better even than last year. The
                        galloping Maxims caused a good deal of interest to an enormous
                        concourse.</p>
                    <p>The management of the crowd—there must have been more than 15,000 persons
                        round the parade-ground—reflects great credit on the police, and that too
                        though there was not room in the carriage enclosure for all the carriages
                        whose occupants had tickets, and the standing room was decidedly limited.
                        The police, however, did well—there was no unnecessary shooting, and the
                        crowd, if packed pretty tightly, were as good-humoured as an Egyptian crowd
                        can be.</p>
                    <p>The order of the review was as follows:—</p>
                    <p>Cavalry in line, artillery in line at half intervals.</p>
                    <p>lnfantry in quarter-column of half-battalions at Iff; paces interval.</p>
                    <p>After the infantry had passed and repassed the cavalry rode by at the trot
                        and then at a canter. The Khedive took the salute from beside the standard.
                        His Highness looked very well and was mounted on a very fine Arab. The
                        principal officers of the staff and the bodyguard squadron were drawn up
                        behind him. After the cavalry had cantered past, Lewa Lord Edward Cecil
                        Pasha rode to the troops, followed by the officers of the Staff, and ordered
                        the Khedivial salute, three times repeated by the troops and accompanied by
                        the Khedivial Hymn. The Khedive then gave leave to dismiss the troops, and
                        the review ended.</p>
                    <p>Cairo was brilliantly decorated last night, the streets were full, and the
                        xxx proceeded merrily in the Esbekieh Gardens. The decorations were
                        illuminated. A fine pillarlike erection had been got into place near the
                        statue of Ibrahim Pasha and was decorated with red and green lamps and, on
                        the summit, with the crescent and star in white lights. Musicians,
                        conjurors, sweetmeat-sellers, etc., swarmed and by 9 p.m. it was quite clear
                        that Cairo — native Cairo at least—was going to amuse itself till early
                        morning.</p>

                    <head>MALTA.</head>
                    <p>The report of Governor Sir C. M. Clarke on the affairs of the Colony of Malta
                        during 1903-4 has been published in the annual series of Colonial Reports
                        (No. 439, Cd. 2238-16). The revenue for the year 1903-4, exclusive of the
                        value of stores issued, was £464,391, and the expenditure £410,887. The
                        excess of revenue over expenditure for the year was, therefore, £53,704.
                        Including £142, the value of stores issued during the year, and £19,416, the
                        surplus brought forward from 1902-3, the net surplus standing to the credit
                        of the Government at the dose of the financial year was £73,262. The total
                        value of dutiable goods imported in 1903-4 was £7,158,079, showing an
                        increase of £595,281 over the value of the imports in the preceding year.
                        The increase is almost entirely found under wheat, which shows an advance of
                        £579,899. Of the total imports, £1,318,430 is the value of goods landed for
                        local consumption, against £1,361,650 in 1902-3; and £5,839,649 is the value
                        of dutiable goods re-exported in the same bottoms, as against £5,301,148 in
                        the previous year. The value of the dutiable goods exported in 1903 4,
                        exclusive of local produce,was £6,145,883, as against £5,849,576 in 1902-3.
                        This represents an increase of £796,307. The value of whole cargoes which
                        were carried in the same bottoms were £6,022,107, and that of the portions
                        of cargoes which were landed and reexported was £123,776. The number of
                        British ships which entered the ports of Malta in 1903-4 was 1,335, as
                        against 1,837 in the previous year, and their tonnage was 2,464,464, as
                        against 2,390,761—a decrease of two ships and an increase of 73,703 tons.
                        Foreign steamships showed a total of 1,079, with a tonnage of 1,062,420, as
                        against 1,030, with a tonnage of 1,069,299 in 1902-3, an increase of 49 in
                        ships, with a decrease of 6,979. The principal event of 1903 was the visit
                        of his Majesty King Edward VII., who arrived on April 16 on board the Royal
                        yacht Victoria and Albert and remained in Malta till the morning of the
                        20th. This was the first occasion on which Malta had been honored by a visit
                        from the reigning Sovereign, and the King received a loyal and enthusiastic
                        welcome from all classes. The report contains much information as to
                        finance, trade, agriculture, legislation, education, and other matters.</p>

                    <p>From letters which have been received at Cairo it seems that Sir Wm.
                        Willcocks was greatly struck by the possibilities of Koweit. He says it is
                        capable of making a splendid harbour and should be the future Alexandria of
                        that country. He is delighted with the climate, and the comparative nearness
                        to the Himalayas make work there seem much more feasible. Of course. he is
                        full of the grandeur of the Euphrates, and writing to a correspondent from
                        Basra, Sir William says:— The Euphrates is a splendid river here, as wide as
                        the Nile at Cairo and half as deep, with millions of date palms on every
                        side. I hope the country will turn out propitious when I find myself at
                        Bagdad, where I hope to be on the 23rd orv24th (December). I am in Sindbad
                        the Sailor’s home. He would have made loss voyages if he had been cursed

                    <head>EGYPTOLOGICAL RESEARCH.</head>
                    <p>During the past year a strong local committee of Liverpool men in connection
                        with the University of Liverpool has been formed to promote the study of
                        archaeology, and has been strengthened by such well-known names in this
                        connexion as those of Dr. Arthur Evans, Mr. Hilton Price, Prof. Ridgeway,
                        and Prof. Boyd Dawkins. They have taken premises in Bedford-street, where
                        they have established, in addition to a small but fairly complete library, a
                        museum of Egyptian antiquities, presented for the most part by the local
                        patrons of Egyptian exploration, such as Sir John Brunner, Mr. William
                        Johnston, and Mr. John Rankin. Many of these were discovered by Mr. John
                        Garstang, the newly appointed Lecturer in Archaeology, and there are to be
                        found here the duplicate ivory tablet of Aha, found by him at Negadah last
                        year, many of the other objects exhibited by him at the Society of
                        Antiquaries in the summer, and an entirely representative collection from
                        Beni Hassan and elsewhere. A reception held in this museum on Saturday week
                        by Lady Alice Stanley fitly inaugurated the Institute, of which the Princess
                        Henry of Battenberg is the patron ; and the course of lectures announced,
                        which include the archaeology of Greece and Western Asia, as well as that of
                        Egypt, leave nothing to be desired. The Institute has also arranged to
                        conduct excavations on its own account at Edfu and Esneh during the
                        forthcoming season.</p>

                        <p>Sir,—“Q.R.D.," in your issue of the 7th inst, has placed before your
                            readers seriatim et numeratim the advantages afforded by this
                            institution, with all of which I cordially concur. But I think that
                            intending subscribers, before forwarding their donations, are entitled
                            to be informed whether or not it is the fact that:—</p>
                        <p>(а) The hospital is used for maternity cases</p>
                        <p>(b) Soldiers' wives, or rather, the wives of soldiers belonging to the
                            Army of Occupation, are received therein for their confinement
                            gratuitously</p>
                        <p>(e) Fifteen out of the twenty-two beds, which is all the hospital
                            contains, were occupied during the past year at one and the same period
                            by cases of the above description</p>
                        <p>I think, moreover, it ought to be stated whether, assuming the above
                            questions are answered in the affirmative, it was the intention of the
                            founders of this hospital that it should be used for lying-in purposes
                            and, furthermore, whether the executive committee intend to so use it
                            henceforth.</p>

                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                        <p>Dear Sir,—Among the short paragraphs inserted above the initials “T. A.”
                            under the heading “Under the Mosquito Net” in your issue of the 31st
                            December last, the writer, in referring to “ cases of real destitution
                            worthy o fhelp,” incidentally alludes in anything but complimentary
                            terms to the Charity Organisation Society, which he (or she) most
                            unfairly denominates that “Sham of Shams."</p>
                        <p>As an old subscriber to the abused society and a thorough believer, from
                            knowledge, the good which for years past has resulted day by day from
                            the fulfilment of the duties which the society in question has
                            undertaken to perform, I cannot but think that “T. A" must have written
                            his condemnation with but scant knowledge of facts, and perhaps will not
                            object to my attempting to set him right and to my trying to prevent the
                            injury which such comments might, if uncontradicted, inflict on a most
                            deserving institution.</p>
                        <p>The Charity Organisation Society was not instituted for the
                            administration of charitable funds, but for the guidance and assistance
                            of the charitably disposed who might desire that their contributions to
                            the aid of their less fortunate fellow-creatures should not pass into
                            unworthy channels or assist in pauperising, instead of helping, those
                            who might be willing although temporarily unable to support themselves
                            and those dependent upon them.</p>
                        <p>From my own personal knowledge the secretary would be the last person to
                            “turn a deaf oar” to any case of real distress which might come before
                            him. It is not however part of the duty of this particular society to
                            divert the proper employment of its funds to “seeking out" cases of
                            distress, or to put itself into competition with other institutions,
                            whether charitable or rate-aided, whose functions are different from its
                            own, and which may be much better qualified to perform the work to which
                            your correspondent refers.</p>
