                    <p>When two Emperors meet, great diplomatic and military combinations may result
                        from their meeting, but there is no guarantee that their peoples will
                        approve the arrangements into which their masters have entered. William IL
                        and Nicolas II may have arrived at decisions that will alter the map of the
                        world, but their subjects have not been taken into their confidence, and we
                        doubt whether the interview of the Imperial Yachtesmen eeneed more than an
                        uneasy curiosity among the mass of Germans and Russians. No German Mt his
                        patriotic stators lengthened by a cubit because his Emperor boarded the
                        Tsar's yaeht at an unearthly hour of the night, and no Russian, whatever his
                        political views, showed any inclination to throw his cap in the air on the
                        off-chanoe that Russia had gained an ally in a most dangerous political
                        crisis. what a differ-rence at Portsmouth 1 There the Navies fraternised,
                        meeting one another with a cheerful good humour and hospitality that had
                        nothing formal or merely official about it Official countries have their
                        value in international political they are the inispensable preliminarim to
                        all international relations, the bow and salutation end half a minute's chat
                        of acquaintences meeting one another in the world’s diplomatic
                        thoroughfares. Just as acquaintanceship ripens to friendship between persons
                        who ace sympathetic, so the official reception and the royal visit are
                        followed by the fraternisation of the fleets and the exchange of visits
                        between labour anions, corporations, members of Parliament, Chambers of
                        Com-merce and every sort of representative body. His Majesty’s visit to
                        Paris was a success, owing to his great personal popularity in the Prenoh
                        Capital, bat the understanding between nations bad oertainly not reached its
                        present cordiality, and, while we have not the slightest wish to belittle
                        the splendid work that our King has done, and is doing, in the cause of
                        international peace and amity, we most face the fact that any ruler stands a
                        chance of a very good reception in Paris or London, simply because he is a
                        ruler.</p>
                    <p>Then came the visits of Deputies to England, of Members of Parliament to
                        Prance. Commercial and business men on both sides of the water woke up to
                        the fact that international disagreements were bad policy. Editors roared
                        less and less loudly, or, if the sudden cessation of vocal activity proved
                        upsetting, found other recipients for their leonine challenges. Clumsy
                        efforts to injure the understanding which were made by third parties, only
                        strengthened it and the ’entente oor-diale runs few risks to-day from
                        external foes. Its only danger comes from its over enthusiastic partisans,
                        who ware a few years ago its greatest enemies. The jingoes on both sides of
                        the channel have been converted —after a fashion—and are now shaking hands
                        and swearing eternal friendship, but, being still under the influence of old
                        and bad habits, they oannot help suggesting that it would be no bad plan for
                        the reconciled foes to fall upon and rob a third party, who has shown
                        himself somewhat churlish in his attitude towards their reconciliation and
                        is suspected of innumerable intrigues. The converted prisefighter's
                        vehemence occasionally disconcerts even the Salvation Army, and the
                        reasonable and judicious sovereigns or statesmen, who engineer alliance and
                        national understandings must fell a certain apprehension when the ex Jingo,
                        with the warmth and vigour that have characterised his past; suggests that
                        the word ‘understanding’ should be replaced by 'offen-five and defensive
                        alliance.’ There is good enough cause for leaving such questions alone in
                        the early days of the entente. An alliance may develop perfectly naturally
                        in the future—there is no useful object to be gained in hastening it now—and
                        we must always remember that for France an alliance with a purely maritime
                        power is not a sufficient guarantee against certain eventualities.</p>

                        in the hope that the cheap scents he employed would, so to speak, drown the
                        smell of the hashish. But, though like Horace’s lover, ‘perfuses liquidis
                        odoribus,’ he did not escape the vigilance of the quay police.</p>

                    <head>Cairo Assizes</head>
                    <p>As stated in our issue of Saturday the trial of Andraous Meloka and his
                        accomplices, charged with the theft of part of the treasure, consisting of
                        £8,000, which accompanied the Mahmal, came before the Criminal Court of the
                        Native Court of Appeal at Cairo yesterday. The bench consisted of Yehia Bey
                        Ibrahim, who presided, Maltre Yussef Bey Chawki, and Mattre Ahmed Bey Helmi
                        Maltre Ahmed Bey Rifaat represented the Parquet and conducted the
                        prosecution, Maltre Shawir Bey Mikhail, who was appointed by the Tribunal to
                        defend three of the accused, heing unavoidably absent on account of a
                        domestic bereavement, his place was taken by Maltre Mourad Effendi Farag,
                        whilst Said Hannallah the fourth accusd, was .defended by Maltre Guirguis
                        Waasfi. Long before the trial began there was a large number of people
                        waiting for admittance, and soon after the proceedings commenced the court
                        was crowded to its utmost capacity. The three principal accused are Andraous
                        Meloka, Mancarius Khalil, and Ibrahim Ashour. With the exception of the
                        latter, all the other prisoners are Copts. At nine o'clock they were brought
                        into the court and placed in the dock with other prisoners, also awaiting
                        trial, including Leon Fehmi. Andraous Meloka is a powerful looking man of
                        medium height, but the other accused seemed of the ordinary type of native,
                        and showed no distinctive feature calling for mention.</p>
                    <p>The representative of the Parquet opened the case for the prosecution by a
                        speech, clear and succinct, during which he narrated the circumstances under
                        which the theft was committed on the 22nd January last from a truck of the
                        train, which was in waiting at Abbassieh to convey the Mahmal to Suez. At
                        the close of the speech, which lasted well over an hour, the presiding judge
                        asked the principal accused whether he pleaded guilty or not. Andraous
                        Meloka at once jumped to his feet from the wooden bench, where the prisoners
                        were seated, and vehemently protested his innocence, at the same time
                        complaining bitterly of the treatment he had been subjected to in prison,
                        and adding that since his incarceration he had been placed in irons, and
                        beaten on several occasions. In answer to a further question from the
                        president the accused caused some amusement by declaring that the proper
                        persons to enquire from as to the theft were the soldiers who guarded the
                        train, and not himself and that but for the fact of his being a Copt, he
                        would not have been where he was that day. The other prisoners, when
                        interrogated, simply pleaded not guilty, and denied all knowledge of and
                        participation in the crime. When the four accused had resumed their seats
                        the presiding judge began the examination of the thirteen witnesses called
                        for the prosecution, including the wife of Andraous Meloka as well as the
                        two for the defence. Several of these were briefly cross-examined by counsel
                        for the defence, and during this time Meloka, interrupted the witnesses
                        several times, and was often called to order by the Court It was only on the
                        threat of being sent back to the cells that he finally desisted from
                        interrupting.</p>
                    <p>At the close of the evidence of the witnesses the court adjourned for a short
                        time, and on the judges resuming their seats, Maltre Mourad Effendi Farag
                        opened the case for the defence in a speech which lasted slight ly over half
                        an hour, and which was listened to with the greatest interest both by the
                        public present, and by the prisoners. His speech was followed by that of
                        Maltre Guir-guis Wassfi on behalf of his client Said Hannallah, the Mouski
                        money-changer, who was accused of having been a party to the crime after the
                        event. At a quarter to one o'clock the bench retired to deliberate, and on
                        returning to Court after an hour's absence the presiding judge passed
                        sentence of five years imprisonment with hard labour on Andraous Meloka, and
                        three years, also with hard labour, on Said Hannallah. The other two accused
                        were acquitted.</p>
                    <p>LEON Fehmi's CASE.</p>
                    <p>In the afternoon the Court re-assembled to hear the case of Leon Fehmi, who
                        is charged with having attempted to extort the sum of £20 from Mustapha
                        Pasha Orphi, son of the former Governor of Alexandria, by threats. Maltre
                        Mohamed Bey Sadik appeared as counsel for Orphi Pasha and Leon Fehmi was
                        represented by Maltre Ragheb Abd el Fahiro. The Court found the accused
                        guilty, and sentenced him to one year’s imprisonment, and he was also
                        ordered to pay the costs of the case.</p>

                        President of the Municipality, the Inspector of towns and public buildings
                        of the East, and the Sanitary Inspector of the Province: All three will be
                        members of the Commission by right, while eight members are to be elected,
                        vig.—four natives, one of whom- will represent the native exporters, and one
                        the importers, and four Europeans,one of whom will represent the European
                        importers, and one the European exporters. No European nationality may have
                        more than two representatives on the Commission.</p>
                    <p>The electorate is to be composed of all males of 25 years of age and over,
                        residing in Zagazig, and paying a house tax of not less than a year, or
                        occupying any house whose rental is not less than L.E. 24 a year, or

                        but that the Government declines to guarantee these transactions. The
                        permanent Committee, elected yearly, is to consist of the Mudir, one
                        European, and one native elected member. The Mudir is to act as the

                    <p>THE BANK OP SALONICA</p>
                    <p>(From our Correspondent).</p>
                    <p>Constantinople, August 8.</p>
                    <p>The Bank of Salonica has just opened a branch at Smyrna, where, up to the
                        present its interests have been in the hands of Mears. Keyser and Company.
                        The firm of authorisation has already been issued. This bank intends shortly
                        to open branches in Alexandria and Cairo. Since this establishment combined
                        with the Lander bank of Vienna it has beoome a very important bank, and it
                        is known, besides that the last general meeting of the shareholders of the
                        bank of Salonica authorised the administrative council to increase the
                        capital of the Society one million francs thus raising it from frs.
                        5,000,000 to frs. 6.000,000. If the council eventually think fit they are
                        empowered to raise the - capital another two million francs. M. Edward
                        Keyser has been appointed manager of the Smyrna branch.</p>
                    <p>Menelik's ENVOY IN TURKEY.</p>
                    <p>It is announced from Vienna that Abdulla Pasha Sadik, the Ethiopian envoy
                        whose arrival here I mentioned in my last notes, will go next to Berlin,
                        London, and America. He is, at the time of writing, visiting the Austrian
                        factories, with a view to introducing different industries into Ethiopia.
                        Ato Haile Marines Padha, the chief of the Abyssian Mission, who is in
                        Constantinople, has had numerous interviews with H.E. Ferid Pasha, Grand
                        Vizier. and Tew-fik Pasha, Mutishar to the Grand Vizier, on the subject of a
                        certain business, pending between the government of the Port and the Coptic
                        community, in the vilayet of Syria. Ato Haile Mariam Pasha was accompanied
                        by his Mihanadir, Tellat Bey, aide-de-camp to the Sultan. He also visited
                        the museum of the Janissaries.</p>
                    <p>GREEK CONSULAR CHANGES.</p>
                    <p>Some modifications have taken place to the personnel of the Greek consulates
                        abroad. M. D. Verenikis, Vice-Consul at Mansourah has been transferred as
                        secretary of the first-class to the Consul-General at Alexandria, replacing
                        M. J. Dragoninis, who has been appointed Vice-Consul at Dedeaghatoh. M. N.
                        Theotoki, at present Vice-Consul there,has been appointed Vice-Consul at
                        Magnesia, replacing M; N. Stehanaton, who goes to Mansourah. M. J. Theodores

                    <head>Menzaleh To Port Said By Steamer.</head>
                    <p>As we stated in our issue of 30th June last the Meezaleh Canal and Navigation
                        Company hopes to inaugurate the Port Said to Matarieh branch of its service
                        in October, in about two months time. At present the work of dredging the
                        new channel between the two localities is proceeding rapidly aided by two
                        powerful dredgers. When this task is achieved to the middle of October, the
                        other new channel from Matarieh to Gheit El Noussarah, will be token in hand
                        at once, and it is expected that this section will take some eight or nine
                        months to complete. It will be about 28 kilometres to length, the distance
                        being approximately the same at that from Matarieh to Port Said. When the
                        works are completed, to a year or two from now they should stimulate the
                        trade of the district considerably, and benefit Port Said to a remarkable
                        degree.</p>
                    <p>As we stated before, for the passenger traffic trio stern-wheelers are being
                        got ready at Karputy near Port Said by the Anglo American Nile steamer and
                        Hotel Co., who have entered into a contract to work the lines of the Lake
                        Menzaleh Company provionsally two years from the date of inauguration. These
                        two steamers will have good accommodation for a certain number of both first
                        and class passengers besides about 150 third class. In October, therefore
                        there will be a through service between Cairo and Port Said, or vice verses
                        by railway and passenger steamer, for those preferring to travel that way
                        instead of by rail all the distance as now. FOr the goods traffic two tugs
                        and six lighters have been brought out to sections from England, as also
                        were the stern-wheelers, and these are now being put together at
                        Karputy.</p>

                        her house four days ago, and that her husband did not give notice to the
                        police until she had been missing three days. The authorities are actively

                    <p>(From our Correspondent)</p>
                    <p>Nicosia,August.</p>
                    <p>It to announced that a new director of Agriculture has been appointed, after
                        an interval of eight months since the resignation of the former director,
                        Mr. P. Gerrafius. We hear</p>
                    <p>that the new director is a Greek, though it is not yet publicly known who he
                        is. Having regard to the great amount of agricultural departmental work,
                        which should be carried in this essentially agricultural island, and to the
                        possibilities of development to almost every direction, which are apparent
                        even to </p>
                    <p>the casual observer, it to earnestly hoped that the appointment will yield
                        satisfactory results. The vintage in the Limassol district to not expected
                        to be as large as that of last year, but the grapes are said to be of better
                        quality. Threshing is now neatly completed to most parts, and the price of
                        corn and straw will probably fall to a more normal figure than it has been
                        of late.</p>
                    <p>THE MAGISTERIAL COURTS.</p>

                        periodically in various principal villages of the Island, instead of, as
                        hitherto, only in the six chief towns. This measure is calculated to give
                        great satisfaction to the villagers, who by the bye, are born litigants, and
                        who are thus saved the heavy expense, both in time and money, of having to
                        attend themselves and being their witnesses to Court situated</p>
                    <p>at a long distance from their homes. One of the first courts under this
                        recent order is being held this week at the village of Kiladi, one of the
                        most important wine villages in the northern part of the L'massol district.
                        While affording the Limassol advocates a welcome excuse to leave that hot
                        town and obtain a few days pleasant change in a more bracing and healthy
                        climate, it cantes a certain additional amount of money to be circulated in

                    <p>QUESTIONS Municipales</p>
                    <p>Les bains de mer</p>
                    <p>En Egypte, la façon dont loi autorités corn prennent les intérêts du public
                        est pourrit moins originale. Four ne parler que d'Ale-andrie, voilà quatre
                        ans et plus que la presse et la population réclament vainement la créatiou
                        de nouveaux bains de mer eu rempla cement des anciens que le quai a fait
                        dispa raltre. La Municipalité et le Gouvernement se rendent-ils compte que
                        si, eu se désintéressant d'une question de oette importance, alors qu’ik
                        votent et approuvent des centaines de crédits pour des futilités, ils sont
                        coupables de négligence, en s’opposant par dei tracasseries sans nombre 4 la
                        oréation de nouveaux bains, alors que l’abeeuce de ce genre d'établissements
                        nous coûte chaque année de nombreuse-victimes, ils commettent an acte
                        criminel?</p>
                    <p>C'est bien ainsi, pourtant, que les choses se passent. Au lieu de faciliter
                        aux entrepreneur* la construction d’établissemeuts balnéaires ou d’eu
                        construire elles mômes, si elles croient l’entreprise assez lucrative, il
                        n’est pas d’em pècbements que les autorités n'imaginent pour en détourner
                        les particuliers. Pendant ce temps la série noire des accidents oontinué ;
                        de l'brahimieh jusqu’au Palais de la Kbédivah. tantôt sur un point, tantôt
                        sur un autre, op signale des noyés. C’était il y a deux ou trois jours
                        enoore deux capitaines de l’armée d’occupation qui étaient engloutis sans
                        secours parnn tourbillon.il n’yavaitni gardes-côtes, ni barques, ni poteaux
                        indicateurs des endroits dangereux, bien qu’on ait demandé ceux-ci a
                        plusieurs reprises. Or, comment qualifier nue telle négligence, lorsqu'elle
                        s’allie a une hostilité irréductible ooutre les entrepreneurs de bain, sinon
                        de criminelle ?</p>
                    <p>S’il y avait beaucoup de bains, les prix réduits par la concurrence, seraient
                        à la portée de tous. Personne ne voudrait risquer de Be noyer pour épargner
                        une petite piastre. Aujourd’hui, malheureusement, celui qui veut faire la
                        cure de bains de mer doit payer très cher dana les trois établissements qui
                        existent au Mex, a l'brahimieh et 4 San Stefano, faire les frais du voyage
                        aller et retour et sacrifier trois ou quatre heures par jour. N’est-il pas-
                        scandaleux qae dans une localité pourvue d’une trentaine de kilomètres de
                        côtes du Mex à San Stefano il n’y ait que trois bains. Enoore n’en faut-il
                        compter que deux, car celui de l'Ibrahimieh est impraticable (il n'a que 59
                        centimètres d’eau et n’est doté d'auoune commodité.)</p>
                    <p>Nous voulons croire que la Municipalité et le Gouvernement changeront de
                        oonduite. Loin de s’opposer désonnais 4 la création de nouveaux bains, ils
                        la favoriseront de tout leur pouvoir et partout où la côte en restera
                        dépourvue, ils feront planter des poteaux indicateurs des tourbillons. C’est
                        seulement en redoublant de zèle pour assurer la santé et la sécurité
                        publiques qu’ils pourront réparer en partie lean errements passés.</p>

                        splendide et de Brest et de Paris, et la ratification par le peuple anglais,

                        adversaires infatigables. De leur oôté, les historiens français ont toujours
                        rendu justice à la valeur, au courage, à la ténacité, à la grandeur d’ftme
                        des marins anglais, qui ont su conserver inviolé 1e sol de leur patrie. Une

                        depuis si longtemps tendaientà séparer fed deux nations et offraient aux
                        semeurs de discorde mille oooasious de brouiller les cartes. Il ne nous a
                        fallu, de part et d’autre, qa’un peu de bonne volonté poor découvrir qa’il
                        n’y avait entre les deuz pays, aucaue raison pour ne pas se trouver d’accord
                        4 tous les points de vue. Nous avons, les uns ot les autres, notre rôle à
                        jouer dans le monde et notre mission à remplir : nous avons, çbacao, un
                        empire oolonfel dont l’étendue doit suffire à absorber toutes nos éaergiea.
                        La natare a fait de nous des voisios : le oonrs des événements voulait faire
                        de noas des rivaux et des ennemis. Il appartenait à la diplomatie pacifique,
                        au bon sens oalme et intelligent de la génération actuelle, de passer
                        l'éponge snr oes siècles glorieux, à vrai dire, mais dont lo aouvenir
                        éveille en nous une grande tristesse. 11 a fallu auz deuz gouvernements an
                        véritable courage, civique et moral, pour oouolure l'arrangement auglo-franç
                        ris. Maintenant qae q’ast chose faite, il n'est personne parmi nous, qui ne
                        paisse comprendre oombiea oet acte de haute politique était juste et
                        nécessaire. L’arrangement anglo-français n’est dirigé contre aucune
                        puissance et n’eu menace aucune. L’entente parfaite entre la Franoo et
                        l'Angleterre ed la meilleure garantie possible do maintien de l’équilibre
                        aotuel et de la paiz en Europe. Aussi longtemps que les deuz nations
                        prendront sur elles d'être, d’an commun accord, les gardiennes vigilantes du
                        Détroit, elles travailleront ensemble pour la paiz universelle. Quiconque,
                        si haut plaoé qu’il puisse être, essayerait de créer au sentiment d’inimitié
                        entre les deuz grandes puissances de l’Oocident, serait non seulement un
                        ennemi de l’Angleterre et de la Franoe, mais aussi un ennemi dn monde
                        civilisé. Les événements des deux derniers mois ont heureusement prouvé qae
                        L’entente oordialo existe en fait aussi bien qu’en théorie ; elles est aussi
                        au-dessus et à l'abri des menaces et des cajoleries.</p>
                    <p>: L’entente cordiale entre la Franoe et l'Angleterre a été la bienvenue, de
                        ce côté-ai du Détroit Aucun autre arrangement international n'aurait
                        rencontré pareille approbation, dans tontes les classes de la nation et dans
                        tous les partis politiqaes. L’Angleterre apprécie de plus eu plus les mrviom
                        qae la Franoe a rend as depuis des siècles au monde entier. Son histoire
                        exerce sur nos esprits une fascination qui paraîtra peut-être incroyable à
                        nos amis français. Telle est pourtant la vérité. Les pages glorieuses de
                        l'épopée napoléonienne éveillent cher la majorité des lecteurs anglais, un
                        enthousiasme qui réjouirait un vétéran de la Grande Armée. Nous
                        permettrat-on'de demander eu retour à nos voisins de Franoe de nous
                        connaître mieux et plus ? On a tort de tant redouter la traversée de la
                        Manche. Quelques jours, quelques heures même, sur le sol d’Angleterre,
                        prouveraient à nos visiteurs que l'Anglais ou l’Ecossais à la mode du
                        Palais-Royal, tout ainsi que les vagues oohaes de touristes auz vêtements
                        bizarres qui se pressent dans les rues de Paris, du commencement de Juillet
                        à la fia de Septembre ne donnent pas une idée très exacte des indigènes qui
                        peuplent les lies Britanniques. Et que deviendrait la légende de la “Perfide
                        Albion” si l’on se oonuaiasait on pen mieux 1 Mais les Français n’ont pas le

                    <p> d’autant plus redoutables et puis-ites qu’elles sont partout et nulle part,
                        dans l’air même que nous respirons, depuis notre petite enfahoe. La
                        postérité rendra pleine justice an chef respecté de la République Française

                    <head>A COTTON REVOLUTION</head>
                    <p>The New HARVESTING MACHINE.</p>
                    <p>(From a Correspondent.)</p>
                    <p>If it be true, as is reported, that an automatic cotton picker or harvesting
                        machine has at last been brought to perfection, there will be great
                        rejoicing in the hearts of those who depend on this industry. Though cotton
                        is subjected to innumerable mechanical processes in the course of its
                        transformation from a tangled fibre to the finished cloth, no one has
                        hitherto succeeded in devising means for picking the lint from the plant.
                        The grain crop is cut by wonderful machines, and mechanism on the farm has
                        superseded many hand processes. But cotton must still be picked slowly and
                        laboriously by hand. Mr. T. M Young, who recently wrote a valuable and
                        authoritative report on the cotton industry of the United States, said, ‘
                        Cotton harvesting machinery would be of incalculable value, but an efficient
                        machine for picking cotton has yet to be invented. It is a difficult problem
                        for the inventor, because picking cotton is something like picking
                        raspberries, and even American genius has boggled at it. There have been
                        many fruitless efforts, but I am afraid there is not to day in the United
                        States a single machine with which any planter would even attempt to pick
                        ootton.”</p>
                    <p>A Mr. Lowry has, however, at last invented a machine which has excited the
                        greatest interest in the cotton growing regions, and is regarded by many
                        experts as having offered for the first time a practical solution of the
                        difficulty. It has been subjected to some exhaustive tests under the
                        supervision of Mr. R. H. Allen, of Memphis, who was appointed to investigate
                        its work, and it appears to have justified its claims It is a motor-driven
                        vehicle, fitted with eight arms of aluminium, delicately balanced, so that
                        they can be moved in all directions. These arms are fitted with endless
                        belts, covered with wire hooks,and to each pair of arms a man or boy
                        attends. The machine passes down the rows of cotton plants and the operators
                        direct the arm to the opened bolls ; the wire hooks seize the lint, and pass
                        it along to a brush, which gathers it op and collects it in a receptacle.
                        The process of picking by hand is done with much effort by the negroes, who
                        pull off the lint with their fingers, and place it in a bag suspended from
                        the shoulders. The operators sitting on this motor frame merely point the
                        arms under their control to the lint, and if only a few of the fibres are
                        seized, the whole of the lint is drawn away to the brush.</p>
                    <p>The report of Mr. Allen on this machine is certainly favorable. Tests,
                        conducted with a machine having only four arms, showed that the two lads who
                        operated it got results equal to a pick of over five hundred pounds of
                        cotton per man per day. Their capacity as hand pickers in similar cotton
                        would have been about sixty-five pounds per day ; but the work was not
                        merely greater, it was better done, there was less “trash,” such as sticks
                        and dirt in the cotton, and its quality was several degrees higher than that
                        picked by hand in the same field. It is estimated that if such a machine
                        were in universal use at the present time, it would save 75,000,000 dollars
                        in the cost of picking the American crop, and if it can be improved still
                        further and made really serviceable, it will certainly work a revolution in
                        the conditions of the industry, which is already restricted, owing to the
                        scarcity of laboor at the busy time of harvest</p>
                    <p>The change would be as astonishing as that which was effected by the cotton
                        gin invented by Eli Whitney in 1794. When the ootton is picked from the boll
                        the seed from which it springs adheres to it, and when this seed had to be
                        removed by hand the difficulty was so great that it had the effect of
                        limiting the cultivation of cotton. A man was able to separate the seed from
                        the lint so slowly the t he could only clean four pounds of cotton in a week
                        working at night in addition to the usual field work. Thus, it would take
                        him two years to clean the quantity of ootton now made up in a standard
                        bale. The saw-gin of Whitney revolutionised the system. In this machine the
                        seed ootton was placed in a hopper, one side of which was composed of strong
                        wires placed so closely together that no seed could pass between them.
                        Between each pair of wires revolved a circular saw, the teeth of whioh
                        dragged the fibres through while the wires disengaged the seed, and left it
                        to fall into a bin. This principle obtains still in the cleaning of all
                        short-stapled cottons, though a roller-gin is used to clean the fine Sea
                        Island and other more delicate cottons. The result of its application was
                        that whereas the exportation of cotton from the United States in 1793 was
                        only 975 bales of 500 lbs. in tbs following year the number of bales rose to
                        3,200. Farmers were so frightened by what they regarded as over-production
                        that they refused to plant more, and they thought the saw-gin had ruined
                        them. To-day, such is the futility of human forecasts, the American crop
                        amounts to 11,000,000 bales, and still it is not enough. If all the ootton
                        which the world uses today had to be cleared from seed by nand an incredible
                        number of people would have to be employed upon it. But now a single gin,
                        aooording to its power and the number of its saws, will dean from three to
                        fifteen bales of 50&lt;>lb. in a day, and the hydraulic machine, exerting
                        900 tons preesure, makes the bales ready for transport. Thereafter, in the
                        handling and manufacture of the Cotton nearly every step is carried out by
                        machinery, and it is only at the beginning that the difficulty, which is a
                        very grave one, occurs. For over a century men have sought and sought in
                        vain for an appliance which enable the cotton to be</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>gathered rapidly and effectively from the plant Many have declared that the
                        achievement was impossible, and that hand-picking would prevail for all
                        time. As the labour problem is one of increasing gravity in the cotton
                        fields of America, and the plantation of cotton is restricted by the
                        difficulty of getting a reliable supply of workers, the yearning for a
                        machine which would make the planters more independent of the negro was very
                        real and poignant. Therefore, there will be widespread anxiety to learn that
                        the further trials of the Lowry auto-cotton picker have supported its
                        claims, and that at last machinery has been devised which will make a large
                        extension of the cotton fields possible. </p>

                    <p>THE C.M.S. GIRLS’ SCHOOL, KHARTOUM.</p>
                    <p>In January last the committee of the Church Missionary Society in Egypt
                        decided that Miss Bird, one of the energetic educational staff of the
                        society, should be sent to re-organise their girls' school at Khartoum. The
                        hired flat, which at present forms the seat of instruction of their pupils,
                        has been found to be far too small and quite unsuitable for the work, so
                        plans were prepared, and the expenditure of a considerable sum of money,
                        from the funds contributed twenty years ago to the society in memory of
                        General Gordon, was authorised by the “parent committee,” for the erection
                        of suitable premises. The work is now well in hand, and it is anticipated
                        that the building will be ready for use very shortly. Miss Bird writes, “The
                        year 1904 has witnessed a steady increase all along the line. From being one
                        of the smallest, and certainly the least well-equipped of our girls’ schools
                        at the beginning of the year, it is, at the case, the largest in our
                        mission. From 43 names on the register the number rose, before the end of
                        1904, to close upon a hundred. There was but one teacher, working whole
                        heartedly but single-handed, and almost destitute of apparatus. There are
                        now four teachers in separate class rooms in a fairly well-equipped school.
                        So far, children of all ranks, and of all complexions, sit happily side by
                        side ; they learn and play together, though they may be as different from
                        each other as the homes from from which they come. They range in hue from
                        the comparatively fair children of Egyptian officers and officials employed
                        by the Sudan government, to the warm, chocolate brown of the Sudanese, and
                        to the coal-black of the true negro.” </p>
                    <p>Needlework is a great attraction to the children, and they perform the most
                        gorgeous and elaborate feats in this direction. They much prefer the
                        mysteries of drawn thread-work, embroidery, and crewel work to the making of
                        a simple frock, but they are gradually being taught the practical advantages
                        of the simpler kind of work also. The school is, indeed, famous for its
                        needlework, and was congratulated upon the excellency of it by Princess
                        Henry of Battenberg, when the visited this school last February.</p>

                    <p>Railway construction in Erythrea seems to have come to a standstill. Several
                        years ago, the Governor of the colony concluded an ar-rangement with a

                        refused to sanction it as being made with a foreign company, and since then
                        railway construction in Erythrea has ceased entirely. Instead of being taken
                        at the flood, the tide was dammed, and there is much reason to doubt whether
                        it will ever flow again. Nobody seems to expect it in the near future.</p>

                    <p>French science has made a new and important addition to archaeology. Some 20
                        yean ago there were brought to light at Yabroud, an ancient place-name in
                        Syria,two large fragments of a document in Greek, which had never been
                        deciphered. M. Clermont Gannean, a French Archaeologist, now announces that
                        he has suceeded in reading the text, showing the document to be a
                        proclamation of King Herod Agrippa IL,denouncing a certain personage who,
                        after illegally obtaining the priesthood, held the office for more than 40
                        years, and was guilty of extortion to the extent of F64,000 of our money.

                    <head>HOLIDAY MAKING</head>
                    <p>It is over a golden rule with holiday-makers to regard the train which is to
                        bear them to the country or the seaside as a deceitful thing, which may
                        start at any moment, irrespective of its advertised time. Hence it is best
                        to be early.</p>
                    <p>I am no exception to the rule, deeming it always well to be on the safe side,
                        even though there be no other; so it turns out that I arrive at my terminus
                        a clear half hour to the good. The platform is full of wooden frames adorned
                        with large printed instructions as to trains and their starting places; but
                        the atmosphere is one of Holiday, and these kindly aids to distracted
                        travellers might just as well he demolished. In the intervening spaces
                        wander aimless little processions- women carrying babies and dragging by the
                        hand frightened little children, boys and girls, whose troubled faces belie
                        the truculent inscriptions — “H. M. S. Devastation" "Redoubtable," or
                        “Mars"- which adorn the caps of many. Perspiring fathers, grim of face, and
                        laden with bags and parcels, jostle each other savagely. Here and there one
                        sees smiling folk; but the majority are anxious and worried. </p>
                    <p>They drift hither and thither, now thrown into sudden confusion by the blind
                        onslaught of the crowds that dash across the station from each suburban
                        train as it arrives (it is a conflict between the strenuous and the limp,
                        and the result is a foregone conclusion), now re-forming and continuing
                        their march, they know not whither, in the ultimate hope of being guided to
                        the train they seek. In the wake of one such procession I am compelled to
                        follow. It is led by a woman, thin-faced and sour-looking ;she is carrying
                        the usual baby, and she draws after her a little boy, aged about six, in a
                        sailor suit, bran new, bearing on his hat the legend, "H.M.S, Implacable.”
                        This is perhaps more appropriate than many ascriptions, for he is crying
                        bitterly, and in the intervals of his sobs demands to be taken home.
                        Following him is his father—hot, but still cheerful. He is struggling with
                        the family portmanteau, together with a tiny tin pail painted a bright red,
                        and a little wooden spade. In good order, we approach the bar-ier, beyond
                        which we can see our train. The sight gladdens us ; we press on with renewed
                        courage, manoeuvring so as to avoid collision with other processions, and
                        have almost gain-d the desired haven, when a mischievous engine at the far
                        end of the station emits three prolonged, ear-splitting shrieks. “Look
                        alive, father!’’ screams our leader, plunging forward in panic. "That's
                        a-whistling!" We hasten after her, but are caught sideways by a flying
                        column charging down from a suburban train that has, without our noticing
                        it, drawn up near by. Father is swept away; portmanteau, spade, pail, and
                        all—he is swallowed up in the whirling, mass of excited clerks and artisans
                        heading impetuously for the station entrance. As father has the tickets the
                        demoralisation of the little group is complete.</p>
                    <p>I succeed in finding a smoking carriage which contains but two persons,
                        truculent men with black moustaches and new panama hats who eye me coldly. I
                        turn and look out of the window. My procession is moving towards me. Father,
                        breathless and moodily triumphant, at its head ; the implacable one still
                        sobbing bitterly. “Now, then, Halfred, be quiet, do,” says his mamma, “else
                        I shan’t tike you far any more holidays, you norty child." Halfred is heard
                        to sob something about not wanting 'no 'olidays" ; but in spite of his
                        protests he is hoisted into the carriage by his parents. Mam* ma enters next
                        with the baby, and last of all comes father, panting and haggard. Halfred
                        regards me malevolently. He is on the point of voicing his feelings when the
                        door is opening slowly. A new arrival diverts the infant's attention, and
                        draws the gathering wrath upon himself. I suppose I am getting imbued with
                        the holiday spirit, for I find myself in accord with Halfred in resenting
                        this intrusion, though it is really harmless enough. The new comer wears a
                        blue serge coat, white flanned trousers, and boots of an aggressive yellow.
                        He has also a yatching cap. In leisurely fashion he turns the handle ; then,
                        still holding it, steps slowly back, looking up the train and down, as
                        though in search of breakers ahead or some lurking peril astern, Satisfied,
                        apparently, that all is taut abeam and abaft, be gets in with a supercilious
                        look, and Halfred weeps again, demanding that he should be turned out. It is
                        a strange thing, this hostility that childhood bears to its
                        fellow-travellers ; and it seems to survive in maturer years. I have seen a
                        carriageful of passengers scowl each other for a hundred miles or more,
                        until the ice was broken by the offer of a newspaper or a sandwich,</p>
                    <p>We are, certainly, not a happy-looking holiday party. Yellow Boots arises,
                        and comes over to our window, through which he thrusts his head and
                        shoulders, taking observation, no doubt, of the train and its bearings, and
                        eyeing haughtily the crowds that press by. Halfred howls distractedly, and
                        kicks him as hard as he can. I sympathise with Halfred to some extent, for
                        the carriage is getting stuffy, and. after all, it is our window. We glance
                        at each other more genially - we look at Yellow Boots, and our indignation
                        rises again. Not that we really bear him any ill-will, or grudge him his
                        holiday, which he will probably enjoy hugely. For a whole fortnight now, as
                        he paces the pier at the watering place of his choice, with cap set jauntily
                        on one side, and his telescope under hts arm, his talk will be of halyards
                        and marlin-spikes ; he will converse on equal terms with the ancient salts
                        that haunt the beach, cocking a shrewd eye at the weather now and then, and
                        he will return home, empty of pocket, it may be, but with an extra cubit or
                        two of mental stature to carry with him to his desk in the dingy City
                        office. No, we do not grudge him his holiday, but for all that it is our</p>
                    <cb n="4"/>
                    <p>window. Halfred renews his cries, and kicks violently. “Nah then, you kid,
                        shet up, cawn't yer” says the victim, and mamma adds gloomily, “Halfred !
                        you norty child.” Yellow Boots returns to his seat scowling, and Halfred
                        sobs himself into a fitful slumber. We hear the guard’s whistle. The door
                        burst open, and a young lady with a round tin box is propelled violently
                        into the carriage The train is moving. A voice from the platform calls to
                        her, “And you'll give all our loves to Auntie, don’t forget, dear, and
                        little Freddie .” Our fellow passenger has barely time to scream “Good-bye,"
                        and wave frantically ; then she turns away with a happy face, and places her
                        box on the floor with a sigh of pleasure. Anyhow, it looks as if one of us,
                        at least, means to enjoy her holiday. </p>

                    <p>REVOLUTIONARY PAPERS IN RUSSIA.</p>
                    <p>Until a few years ago nobody was allowed to publish a jargon paper in the
                        land of the Tsar, while for a long period the people in that country were
                        prohibited from receiving one, though many copies were regularly sent there
                        singly, as letters, from London. Every Yiddish newspaper published in the
                        metropolis is still prohibited in Russia ; but several of such sheets are
                        now produced on the spot, the Government permitting them to be issued in the
                        hope that they will tend to multiply the effect of the revolutionary
                        literature scattered so freely among the Jews.</p>
                    <p>Among the little papers printed in Russia and produced in London are the
                        official organs of the revolutionary propaganda carried on in Russia and
                        Poland. One of these is sold in London, and frequently justifies its title,
                        printing as it does important tidings from Russia, particularly about the
                        “cause,” a day or two ahead even of “The Times.” It is mainly through this
                        medium that Russian Jews in the East End learn of the conviction of their
                        comrades. The paper, however, is intended for export, while the other
                        journals printed in the same office are exclusively circulatedJn Russia and
                        Poland,</p>
                    <p>Of course, all these periodicals are under the ban of the censor ; but they
                        are nevertheless regularly sent into the Tsar’s dominions— not through the
                        post, but by special messengers, who smuggle them over the frontier. Many of
                        such emissaries as well as their un-suspecting victims— innocent merchants
                        who have undertaken to convey into Russia bundles of the contents of which
                        they knew nothing, and who have been arhorrified when officials have drawn
                        from them a mass of revolutionary literature-—have been caught in the act of
                        smuggling copies of such papers into Russia. But the messengers are only men
                        of straw. The Government never lays by the heels any of the leaders of the
                        movement So the stream of prohibited literature is never really dammed, let
                        alone stopped ; it continues to flow steadily from London to Russia. And
                        never has it flown in such volume as of late.</p>

                    <p>FIRSTS AND THIRDS.</p>
                    <p>The crowded trains which are daily leaving London for holiday places suggest
                        a modern Saturnalia. The ordinary first class passenger sticks his head into
                        a tweed cap, and himself into a third-class smoker ; while the gentleman
                        whom one ordinarily finds travelling third class fares forth in starchy
                        splendour to a first-class carriage, from which to emerge in dignity
                        compatible with tbe awful pride with which he will sign the visitors book at
                        his destination. The transition from first to third is sometimes attended
                        with diverting results. Lord Harris, during his Indian governorship, wished
                        to make the change en route, and asked the stationmaster if he could find
                        him third seats. “I will inquire if any of the third-class passengers
                        object,” was the stately answer. The late Lord Waterford loved at times,
                        after he had booked first, to jump into a third. He did this one day when a
                        friend saw him. Not liking the risk he ran in the rough company into which
                        this brought him, the friend sent into the Marquis’s carriage a sweep in
                        full working uniform. The</p>
                    <p>Marquis was equal to the occassion, he handed his ticket to the sweep, and </p>
                    <p>enjoy the lonely splendour of a first class carriage.</p>
