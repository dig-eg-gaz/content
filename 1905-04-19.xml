                <p>The prolonged stay of the Baltic Fleet in Kamaranh Bay is causing protests here, as it, involves a breach of French neutrality. The Japanese comment upon the stay of Baltic Fleet at Kamaranh in the most severe manner. The “Asahi” charges France with deliberately concealing the presence of the Baltic Fleet. The “Ji Ji” declares that the russians are simply using Kamaranh as a naval base and that Japan must ask Great Britains co-operation under her alliances. (R)

                MR COVINGTON’S EXPLORATIONS.
                
                INTERESTING DISCOVERY.</head>
                <p>Mr. Covington, who iS at present at work on tho Great Pyramid, has relocated the exterior end of the King’SChamber south air channel discovered by Col. Howard-Vyse in 1837. The original discoverer made no arrangements for keeping the aperture permanently open, and it has in consequence, become choked by débris and sand falling from above Were tills air channel, with those of the well shafts, kept clear, the oppressive beat of the interior passages of the Great Pyramid would be much abated, and a temperature of under 70% degrees secured.
                To keep the passage clear Mr. Covington proposes to place a sheet-iron funnel 30 inches-long and nine inches square at the exterior aperture of the air channel. This will keep débris stones, etc, from finding their way into the passage, which is only 9 inches square and' therefore blocks easily.
                Mr. Covington is also at work in the hope of coming across the external outlet of the' Queen's Chamber, south air channel. The interior end of the passage was only discovered by Weyman-Dickson in 1872, after he had chiseled through 5 inches of stone. Manifestly this end of the passage had not been carried through and the pass channel may have no outlet on the exterior of the Pyramid. It was, of course, not boxed, but allowed for in the building of the successive courses.
                Professor Flinders Petrie suggested that its issue is to be looked fur at the 85th course, but Mr. Covington has had to give up the search, alter fruitlessly exploring a radius of 35 feet round the spot suggested. During his search be made -a discovery of some interest, and we give an extract Dorn the finder’s report addressed to Professor Maspero :—
                "Ou Friday last, while searching for the undiscovered exterior end of the Queen's Chamber south air channel, I found embedded in the hardened débris on the 84th course of the Great Pyramid, directly below the outer end of the King’s Chamber south air channel, two fragments (counterparts) of a triangular-shaped high-grade limestone, which originally measured some 17 + 16 +10} inches, two edges being bevelled at an angle of 71 degrees and the other at about 50 to 75 degrees. Deeply incised in thé dressed surface was the full tenth part of an 18-inch diameter circle. The stones, from,' 2 to 2  inches thick, had been let into the pryamid casing atoue probably for astronomical purposes. The reverse side and the bevelled edges retained small patches of bufi-culourod cement."
                The finder adds that in two respects the find may be considered important : with the exception of the inscription mentioned by Herodotus, this is the only record of any stone-bearing characters of any kind being found on the face of tho Pyramid. This is the only known stone that has been let in to the Pyramid casing.	
                
                Mr. Covington hopes that the undiscovered air passage exit may turn up on the 76th coursé It runs up from tho Queens Chamber at its start at an angle of 37 degrees, which should bring it out at this point—always supposing that the angle does not alter.
                Considerable interest is being taken in the clearing of the Sphinx, and a meeting of the committee formed for this purpose will probably be called about the end of the month to go into, some questions of detail and to appoint executive and finance committees. We learn that, if approached on this subject by the responsible authorities, the Prisons Department will agree to supply the services of one or two hundred able-bodied tenants of theirs who would, of course, receive a small wage from the Excavation Committee.
                Instoad of carrying the trench loading from the paws of the Sphinx to the cultivation due East, it is to be taken S.E to avoid the destruction of personal property, and to avoid a large sand hummock which promised groat difficulties. This course will enable the excavators to complete the work at a cost below the original estimate of LE 4,000.

                <p>The bridges on the Egyptian Railway Administration's system have always been a great source of trouble and expense, and the difficulties which the Administration has had to face from this cause have been enormous.
                The Nile bridges at Embabeh, Benha, and Kafr Zayat have now been placed in a fairly good condition, but the bridge over tho Mah-moudieh Canal at Hagar-Nawatieh has recently given rise to considerable apprehension and anxiety. The fault appears to be due to the fact that the steel was not properly tested at first. The bridge was entirely reconstructed a year ago, and totally new one being put up. Lately some of the longitudinals connecting the girders showed signs of cracking, and the Administration has had to replace them by new ones. It is believed that the bridge will now be able to stand the strain of the traffic with safety.
                The Administration has in the person of M. Husson a very capable bridge engineer, and he ought to be given a free hand to undertake everything necessary for the safety of the bridges throughout the Administrations system.

                <head>AMERICAN MISSION SCHOOL</head>
                <p>(From our Correspondent)
                Assiout, April 12
                A few days ago a very interesting musical and literary entertainment took place at the American College. About three hundred people attended, and it proved a great success. It may be here remarked that the entertainment was carried through wholly by the students themselves. It contained songs by some ladies invited for this purpose, pianoforte solos and duets, quartettes and declamations given by Students. One or two minor details might be brought to the notice of the president of the school. Some of the boys appear before the public 'in galabiehs and somewhat unclean. True it is, some of them are poor, but it does not cost much, to have them dressed in uniforms, even at the expense of the school itself. Again, some of the declamations given were of a kind completely useless for the student; he loses a lot of time in learning a long story by heart, to recite it before a number of people, without adding to his store of information or bettering his school life. The time spent in such things might be usefully employed in studying lessons or learning something practical. But on the whole, thanks are due to the managers of this school perhaps things will go better in the future.

                </head>
                <p>The Court of Assiout delivered one more death sentence on Monday. A certain Bekhit Has-saiieio, from Aghanna (Tabta), murdered, a few months ago, the omdeh of his village, in the hope of his (the murderer’s) nephew taking his place. He was arrested and was condemned yesterday. The way in which the criminal carried out his intention Was horrible. He slew the victim with a knife before sunset, in a place about 100 metres from the village, and after killing him, cut his fingers and stabbed his dead body in nine different place. This death sentence is the fourth of its kind passed by tho Assiout Court since 1st March.

                <div type="item"><head>EXECUTIONS.</head> 
                <p>The death penalty is carried out now, according to the new regulations, in the precincts of the prison. People merely hear of them, and I really think that the old system of public executions is more effective. The fellah has not yet arrived at that stage of civilization where he suffered much moral pain. He needs something to strike his sensesin order that they may be affected, and I feel certain that if these four sentences were carried but publicly in Assiout, a very long time would pass without one hearing of such crimes being committed.

                <p>Owing to the increase of crimes presented to the Assiout Court, three more judges have been appointed to our bench, via, Mohamed Bey Dorwich, Mustapha Bey Beheri, and Mr. Charles Blackstone Clapcott; the latter, having come recently from England, has an interpreter, Abdel Rauf Zaki Effeudi. Three more criminal sittings have been added, and thus we have now five sittings a week instead of two.

                <p>To the Editor of The Egyptian Gazette
                Sir.—I am pleased to see from the letters of "No Surrender" and "Anti-Bigot" that there are some people whose’ minds are able to grasp the fact that narrow minded fanaticism is not Christianity nor the spirit of bigotry the "same mind that was in Christ Jesus." I was tempted to exclaim "It is enough. I even I only am left..and they seek my lyfe to take it away."
                Alter long residence to Cairo I confirm all that was said in the 'Mosquito Net”’ of Saturday last, and could add a.lot more that was not said. If any man think there was an exaggeration let him put himself under my guidance, and without police escort, I will show him things which will make him a sadder and a wiser man. I will let Him see sights which will freeze the very marrow of his bones, and yet I will show him nothing which is not sought after earnestly by thousuds of young men in this city, no number of Englishment being on
                the list
                There is a Trinity of Evil at work, Drink, Gambling ud Impurity, and of these three, the last is the worst
                Unless the Social Evil in Cairo is changed, it will continue to grow until the city be ravaged by an epidemic to which the Plague at London will be nothing
                What then are we going to do? Are we going to sit down quitely and watch the triumph of the evil ine? I beg pardon, I mean) I for one am not. As long as I have a voice to raise, and an oppurtinty to raise it, people shall hear, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear,their duty to the thousands of young men, yes and the thousands of unfortunate women, who are to be found on the sstreets of cairo at any time after dark. I speak to you, my brothers, For a silent voiceless cry From the streets of of Egypt's cities Goes up to god on high. By the love ye bear your mothers. Your sisters of your wives, I bid you sheild the honor Of other women's lives
                If all who are ready to help on the work of forming an institute for young men at Cairo will send me a card at my residence, No.9, Sharia Soliman Pasha, we may be able to unite and do something more useful than carry on a wordy war with our friends-I am,etc. Henry C. Sims
