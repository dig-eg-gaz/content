                    the immediate question is whether Mr Haldnae's ideas are Liberal and Radical
                    ideas. Some of them are Liberal and Radical ideas. Some of them ar least are
                    undeniably German. Others strike us as almost Jacobite. Mr. Haldane seems to us
                    to figure English society of the future as organized on some new model of German
                    effiecient, and at the same time teaining and even extending the domain of regal
                    aruistocratic privelege, the machinery of regal class distinction/ it was a
                    little suprising. But Mr Haldane proceeded to speak of the monarchy in terms
                    which michjt have been applied with some point to the Kaiser, but were out of
                    place as a description of an English King. One hardly knows wherher to regard
                    this as a serious constituational doctrine or metely a dextrous revival of the
                    almost lost art of the courtier IF the former, we think that Mr. Haldane's
                    resitinglat us due to this colleagues and to the liberal Part. If the latter we
                    think that flattery so gross ill accords with the postion fo English
                    Constitutonal Minister. "Mr Haldane informed is to his speech at Hampeteed that
                    the great sovereign at greater the initiaivate to interpret we shoul dhave said
                    that spirit of his poeple, We should have said that initiave was very power fo
                    which Mr Haldane ween the two Poers of which Mr Haldane spoke depended on the

                    <p>The Hellenic commanity of Alexandria has frequently afforded os the
                        inspiriting spectacle of a progressive colony and ample evidences of its
                        vitality and of its civilizing character. Within the year that has just
                        passed three important educational and indostrial insti tutions, marking
                        great progress in the evo- lation of the Greek commanity, were esta blished
                        in Alexandria, thanks to the enlight- ened generosity of three of its
                        distinguished members. The schools founded by MM. Benacchi, Salvago and
                        Zervadachi are sure to prove most beneficial, not only to the children of
                        the large Hellenic community, bat also to this great city, to the industrial
                        development of which these young men wil! in time greatly contribute.
                        Yesterday we had again the pleasure of witnessing another manifestation of
                        Hellenic well-directed generosity and philanthropy. Mrs. Virginia Benachi,
                        the honoured wife of the President of the Hellenic commanity in Alexandria,
                        conceived a few months ago the noble idea of establishing in Alexandria a
                        soup- kitchen for the benefit ot those unfortunate people who are unable to
                        provide themselves with the necessary wholesome and well cooked food It was
                        not only the pecuniary problem which Mrs. Benachi quickly solved by her
                        munificence ; there were also other difficulties to be encoontered which had
                        entailed consi derable labour on all those who had volunteered their
                        valuable aid to Mrs. Benachi. And now the establishment has turned out
                        perfect in all ita details, everything having received the most minute
                        attention A magnificen*, spacious and most fully light- ed hall, in Mr.
                        Salvago’s splendid iodustnal school at Chatby, has been allotted for use as
                        adining room. an adjoining ball has been converted into a kitchen, replete
                        with culinary utensils and twocolosaal cauldrons; another serv ing as
                        ascullery, also spacious and well-lighted In fact a special architectural
                        feature of Mr. Salvago's indastrial palace, is the plentiful light which
                        pervades all its innamerable sec tions , an «.lvantage greatly to be
                        appreciated in Alexandria, where most of the buildings, both public and
                        private, are sunk in darkness. At the inangaral ceremony which took place
                        yesterday at 11.30 am. an immense concourse of people of all nationalities
                        and all classes attended, the Greek element predominating. The boys and
                        girls from the Greek schools attended also in strong contingents. Daring the
                        religious part of the ceremony, conducted by H. B. the Patriarch Photius in
                        person, the scbool girls sang the appointed hymns. Extracts from the Acts of
                        the Apostles were also read by » young girl, whose voice and earnestness
                        greatly edified the hearers. Towards the end of the religious ceremony H. B.
                        the Patriarch as well as Mr. Sinadino delivered approprnate orations, in
                        their accustomed warm eloquence, extolling the great work of Mrs. Benachi.
                        When the ceremony was over, dinner was served to the pupils of the schools
                        and a great nomber of ladies and gentlemen By a payment of PC. 2} visitors
                        to the establishment will be provided with ample, wholesome, pure food,
                        cleanlily prepared by cleanly ccoks and attendants. What renders this new
                        establishment part) cularly noteworthy is the fact that its hospitable
                        tables will welcome any person, independently of bis nationality.
                        Philanthropy has larger boundaries. The Greeks are certainly patriotic , but
                        in question of philanthropy their aime are universal. Soffering humanity bas
                        equal claims upon everybody. This great truth, this Christian, moral code,
                        is not only under stood, but is also pot into practice by the Greeks both in
                        their own country and wherever they establish themselves </p>

                    <p> Napoleon's Creat Saying,</p>
                    <p> “ ‘Society,’ said Napoleon, when he was establishing the Coneordat in
                        Fragce, ‘canpot exist without inequality of matetial wealth, and thi«
                        inequality cannot exist without reli- gion. When a man is dying of hanger

                        to patiently bear thie difference if there is not an anthority to say to him
                        “God wills it so. There must be poor and rich in this world, bat later in

                    <p> This most interesting problem, however, Mr. Masterman does not develop
                        explicitly. His immediate object is the diseassion of the siteation inthe
                        country and hew the con- tending forces stand. Hie reading of recent events
                        here is that “realities have crashed into the activities of politics, which
                        generally manage successfully to clude them. The social question has at last
                        ‘arrived’ in England as it has arrived previously in other European lands

                        need to have his debts and earnings a little better paid by man,’ says a
                        great writer, ‘which, let Parliameot# speak of them or be silent of them,

                        is largely boand op with the atti- tude in whieh each political party will
                        confront thie vigorous intruder.</p>

                    <p> “To the Liberal Party, as the party in pos session, is offered the greatest

                        <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                        <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers
                            the accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by
                            which they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange
                            them as accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that
                            none of them are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home
                            there are several things to be considered. To begin with there is the
                            difference in climate between Egypt and the various points at which you
                            may arrive in Europe.</p>
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                            January may be a little warmer than the Riviera and possibly not so warm
                            as Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly
                            warm than many other places in Europe. </p>
                        <p>Many people leave Egypt far too early in the year, for as a rule the
                            weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to go to on
                            leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                        <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent
                            at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list shewing the time occupied on
                            each of the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of
                            Europe.</p>
                        <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                        <cb n="3"/>
                        <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth,
                            Southhampton, London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short ones
                            are as follows:—</p>

                        <p>The steamers of the P.&amp;O., the Egyptian Mail S.S,. Co., North German
                            Lloyd, Orient, and Messageries Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor,
                            British India, Bibby and Henderson Lines are also excellent, and their
                            steamers are largely patronised by travellers to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to
                            Alexandria, without change (3 hours). That to Port Said can now be made
                            without change in 4 ½ hours.</p>
                        <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                            Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German
                            Levant line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                        <cb n="5"/>
                        <p>The quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O. Brindisi express
                            from Port Said, by the Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., from Alexandria to
                            Marseilles and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from
                            Alexandria.</p>
                        <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little
                            luggage is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several
                            good and responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed
                            charge to deliver packages to any address in Europe. The Egyptian Mail
                            S.S. Co., have also made arrangements whereby luggage can be collected
                            and sent to any address.</p>
                        <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by
                            the fast Mail<cb n="6"/> Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to Brindisi. One
                            of these leaves Port Said every week, as soon as possible after
                            receiving the Indian mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                        <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                            attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats"
                            having been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to
                            Brindisi. If you are going straight through to England you will find the
                            train waiting at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without
                            changing. It has complete arrangements for sleeping and eating on board,
                            and you should arrive in London on the fifth day from leaving Port
                            Said.</p>

                        <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers
                            which leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to
                            TAORMENA, one of the most charming and popular places on the island. <hi
                                rend="italic">Giardini</hi> is the station at which to alight, and
                            the drive up to Taormina is most delightful, occupying about one hour.
                            In and around the town is much to interest the visitor. The theatre is
                            of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting
                            place for the ascent of Etna, and here also is a fine Cathedral. The
                            Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over the island,
                            are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history,
                            having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413,
                            and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                            is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO,
                            with about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys
                            a delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city.
                                <hi rend="italic">The Palazzo Reale</hi> is of Saracenic origin and
                            close to it the church of <hi rend="italic">S. Giovannia degli
                                Eremiti</hi> with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum,
                            Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a visit.</p>

                        <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every
                            Wednesday during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3
                            days.</p>
                        <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino
                            Co.’s steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave
                            it without wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely
                            places on its bay—<hi rend="italic">Castellamare</hi> and <hi
                                rend="italic">Sorrento</hi>. The small steamer that takes you to
                            Sorrento [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                        <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can
                            will devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and
                            interesting portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are
                            too well-known to need comment here.</p>
                        <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five
                            hours brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent
                            admiring the <hi rend="italic">City of Flowers</hi> and its surrounding
                            country. In Florence itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing
                            interest, whilst the local promenades and excursions should not be
                            omitted. <hi rend="italic">The Cascine</hi> is the most attractive and
                            fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the <hi rend="italic">Viale
                                dei Colli</hi>, one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years
                            ago, goes winding up through the hills a distance of four miles. The
                            most delightful excursion outside Florence is that to <hi rend="italic"
                                >Vallombrosa</hi>, with its <hi rend="italic">Monastery</hi> 3,300
                            feet above the sea level. This is made first by ordinary train from
                            Florence to <hi rend="italic">St. Ellero</hi>, thence by cog-wheel
                            railway to <hi rend="italic">Saltino</hi>. The ascent through groves of
                            oaks takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to
                            view.</p>
                        <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a
                            fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night
                            should if possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile
                            at sunset.</p>
                        <p>VIAREGGIO.</p>
                        <p> One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa and
                            on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                            house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the
                            air and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                            with the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European

                            deliciously cool breezes from the surrounding mountains and the
                            Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                        <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,

                            are a constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn
                            in Genoa. Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches
                            containing exquisite marble columns and historical paintings, and the
                            incomparable Campo Santo filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                        <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                        <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                            Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful
                            windows illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and
                            the monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                        <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                            SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal

                        <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                            delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                            vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage
                            or bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every
                            turn. The approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any
                            other sea port. The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of
                            the sea. No hills behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of
                            Campaniles appear above the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering
                            town rises like a fairy mirage out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                        <p>Going northwards from <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi> you make the tour of
                            the beautiful Italian lakes.</p>
                        <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in
                            one-and-a-quarter hours by train by way of Monza.</p>
                        <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is
                            very beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                            enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come <hi rend="italic"
                                >Tremezzo</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Cadenabbia</hi>, and <hi

                            on Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in

                            and is an excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso,
                            situated above the town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting
                            paintings, “Entombment," by Ciseri, and ‘Tho Flight into Egypt,” by

                            interest of a visit to Athens from an artistic, historical and
                            archaelogical point of view, and if possible tourists should average to
                            be in Athens for the Orthodox Easter in order to witness the Good Friday
                            and Easter Eve ceremonies, and to be present at the dancing on the
                            Easter Tuesday festival held at Megara, for which a special train is run
                            from Athens.</p>
                        <p>It is worth while to spend a few days in CORFU on account of the beauty
                            of the scenery. There is also good snipe and quail shooting to be
                            had.</p>
