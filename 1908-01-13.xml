                    <p> GREEK ECONOMICAL KITOHENS SS UEEEEEEEEEEEEEn cane INAUGURATION AT CHATBY.
                        —-~” The Hellenic commanity of Alexandria has frequently afforded os the
                        inspiriting spectacle of a progressive colony and ample evidences of its
                        vitality and of its civilizing character. Within the year that has just
                        passed three important educational and indostrial insti tutions, marking
                        great progress in the evo- lation of the Greek commanity, were esta blished
                        in Alexandria, thanks to the enlight- ened generosity of three of its
                        distinguished members. The schools founded by MM. Benacchi, Salvago and
                        Zervadachi are sure to prove most beneficial, not only to the children of
                        the large Hellenic community, bat also to this great city, to the industrial
                        development of which these young men wil! in time greatly contribute.
                        Yesterday we had again the pleasure of witnessing another manifestation of
                        Hellenic well-directed generosity and philanthropy. Mrs. Virginia Benachi,
                        the honoured wife of the President of the Hellenic commanity in Alexandria,
                        conceived a few months ago the noble idea of establishing in Alexandria a
                        soup- kitchen for the benefit ot those unfortunate people who are unable to
                        provide themselves with the necessary wholesome and well cooked food It was
                        not only the pecuniary problem which Mrs. Benachi quickly solved by her
                        munificence ; there were also other difficulties to be encoontered which had
                        entailed consi derable labour on all those who had volunteered their
                        valuable aid to Mrs. Benachi. And now the establishment has turned out
                        perfect in all ita details, everything having received the most minute
                        attention A magnificen*, spacious and most fully light- ed hall, in Mr.
                        Salvago’s splendid iodustnal school at Chatby, has been allotted for use as
                        adining room. an adjoining ball has been converted into a kitchen, replete
                        with culinary utensils and twocolosaal cauldrons; another serv ing as
                        ascullery, also spacious and well-lighted In fact a special architectural
                        feature of Mr. Salvago's indastrial palace, is the plentiful light which
                        pervades all its innamerable sec tions , an «.lvantage greatly to be
                        appreciated in Alexandria, where most of the buildings, both public and
                        private, are sunk in darkness. At the inangaral ceremony which took place
                        yesterday at 11.30 am. an immense concourse of people of all nationalities
                        and all classes attended, the Greek element predominating. The boys and
                        girls from the Greek schools attended also in strong contingents. Daring the
                        religious part of the ceremony, conducted by H. B. the Patriarch Photius in
                        person, the scbool girls sang the appointed hymns. Extracts from the Acts of
                        the Apostles were also read by » young girl, whose voice and earnestness
                        greatly edified the hearers. Towards the end of the religious ceremony H. B.
                        the Patriarch as well as Mr. Sinadino delivered approprnate orations, in
                        their accustomed warm eloquence, extolling the great work of Mrs. Benachi.
                        When the ceremony was over, dinner was served to the pupils of the schools
                        and a great nomber of ladies and gentlemen By a payment of PC. 2} visitors
                        to the establishment will be provided with ample, wholesome, pure food,
                        cleanlily prepared by cleanly ccoks and attendants. What renders this new
                        establishment part) cularly noteworthy is the fact that its hospitable
                        tables will welcome any person, independently of bis nationality.
                        Philanthropy has larger boundaries. The Greeks are certainly patriotic , but
                        in question of philanthropy their aime are universal. Soffering humanity bas
                        equal claims upon everybody. This great truth, this Christian, moral code,
                        is not only under stood, but is also pot into practice by the Greeks both in
                        their own country and wherever they establish themselves </p>

                        was only a small minority who assumed fancy costume The reason is well
                        known. “C'est Ia crise”-—that hideous cry which meets one at every tarn. The
                        organ isers of the ball, however, had evidently put all thoaghta of “la
                        crise’ aside, for they had decorated the theatre in a most lavish and

                        served and the “consommations” were of the best. The boxes of the theatre
                        weré occupied by the leading members of the Italian community, and the
                        arrival of the Italian Consul, the Mer- quis Soragoa, was greeted by the

                            “ ‘Society,’ said Napoleon, when he was

                            “That eternity is vanishing below the hori-
