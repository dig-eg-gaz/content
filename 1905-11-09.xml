                        <head>THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 9. 1905. ALEXANDRIA’S WATER SUPPLY.</head>
                        <p>We recently gave an account of the manga ration of the new system of
                            filtration foi the improvement of onr water supply ; bnt the question is
                            of snoh general interest to the town that it deserves a more detailed
                            stndy. for few are awari of the long and interesting negotiations which
                            led np to the construction of these works, and how it was that the
                            Municipality, with more than their wonted liberality, snbsorib.d so
                            large a sum as £60,000 towards their oost. The new works are the resnlt
                            of discussion which had been going on for more than fifteen years, bnt
                            they had not made much progress np to 1893, when Com- mander Mannsardi,
                            then Vioe President of the Municipality, attended a meeting of the
                            direc- tors of the Water Company and told them that he wanted to make a
                            radical ohange in two in poitant points of their servioe firstly, the
                            price of water sold to the poor, which he wanted to reduce, not by a
                            little, bnt to one fifth of its actual price j and, seoondly, that the
                            water should be filtered in aocordanoe with the most modern requirements
                            of hygiene. He was prepared to admi‘. (hat the oompany had acquired by
                            purchase the right to sell water at the prioe they were oharging, and
                            they were carrying on the very defective system of filtration handed
                            over to them by the Government, whioh was all they were legally obliged
                            to do, bnt that the changes he mentioned were of the highest importance
                            to the well-being of the town, and he was pre pared to offer some
                            serious compensation in exchange for these advantages. The directors of
                            the Water Company replied that the changes he required were of a very
                            serious nature, that the first would entail a loss of revenue whioh
                            would amount to £10,000 a year, that the second proposition would not
                            only require much prelimiaury study, but would require works not ooly
                            very costly in themselves, but entailing.a large annual ex- penditure
                            for their working and maintenance, and that they oould not saorifioe the
                            interests of their shareholders in accepting snoh heavy obligations,
                            odIoss some very material com- pensation was offered in return, however
                            much they might be for the public good. The question was a difficult
                            one, but Vioe- President Manusardi had given up one of the finest
                            positions at the Egyptian Bar to devote the last two or three years of
                            his aotive life to the publio interest of the town, and he was not to be
                            daunted by suoh difficulties. He worked inoessantly at these
                            negotiations for nearly two years, and in 1894 they resulted in a
                            tripartite oonven* ion between the Egyptian Government, the
                            Municipality, and the Water Company, the prinoipal points of which may
                            be summed up as follows. The price of water sold to the water oarriera
                            on sakkas servioe was tp be reduced by instalments, until it oame down
                            to one ipilliame per skin of£6 litres, that is to say, one-fifth of its
                            former prioe. By right of purchase the oompany oould refase to supply
                            any apartment however small at a less rate than ten francs per month ;
                            this was re- duoed to P.T. 10 per bouses of £12 rental and to P.T. 40
                            per houses of £30 per year, but the company was given the right to put a
                            water meter on eaoh bouse, and to oharge for all water oonsomed beyond a
                            speoiged quantity, The Municipality was to pay for tbs first oost of a
                            proper system of filtration, but the oom- pany was to subscribe £10,000
                            towards it I That the poor of Alexandria should have at at their
                            disposal a supply of well filtered water at one fifth og the price they
                            used to pay for a water unfit for human consumption is to them a boon
                            whioh reflects the greatest honor on the man to whom it is chiefly due,
                            and we trust at some later time, when the early doings of our
                            Municipality shall become of some historical interest, that the name of
                            Vioe- President Manusardi may be written in letters of gold. We regret
                            to say that at the time be reoeived bat small thanks, and it was more
                            than hinted by some disaffeoted aud mistaken people, that he had
                            sacrificed the intemu of the town. One would have thought that the
                            shareholders of the Water Company might have had a little more gratitude
                            towards their directors, but Egypt is still a peculiar oountry, and not
                            long after, some of these shareholders so abused their directors at a
                            general meeting, that they appeared to think that if these gentlemen had
                            much respect for themselves they should have resigned and left their
                            task to hands more oapable of wringing increased dividends out of the
                            unfortunate inhabitants. The directors, however, after expressing their
                            regret at not having pleased everybody, said they bad endeavoured to do
                            their duty, and meant to go on. The Municipality, with a zeal
                            commendable when looked upon in the light of subsequent events, did not
                            lose more than two years before they asked the oelebreted Dr. Hoch of
                            Berlin to reoommend them a specialist to enlighten them on the
                            filtration question. He sent out Dr. Bitter, who, from the time be came
                            up to now, has not oeased to give the best ad vioe on the subject, and
                            to whom the successful solution of the filter question is largely due.
                            He was one of the first persona we expected to see at the inauguration,
                            but, as we said before, we are in Egypt The only advantage the Water
                            Company found with the new convention at the end ot the first year was a
                            net loss of £7,000, but very shortly after that their offioe windows
                            were broken by a ot of ruffians, soon after represented by a so called
                            Committee of Poblio Security, several hundreds of the company's water
                            meters were broken, and other damage done, and all this because they
                            were simply carrying out the right freely given them by the Qoreroment
                            and the Municipality to supply water by meter. After some discussion an
                            understanding was arrived at, bat in order to do so the oompany waived
                            their right of meter mnnlv to anartmentji althnnsK this one of the
                            privileges aooorded to them by the Municipality in exchange for the
                            sacrifices made by them in redaction of the price of water. Eight years
                            after the signing of the con- vention of 1894, when Mr. Graham was named
                            Administrator of the Municipality, to straighten ont the deplorable
                            state into whioh soma of the Municipal affairs had fallen daring the,
                            period whioh culminated in the withdrawal of Chakour Pasha, Mr. Graham
                            was also ap- pointed as Government representative on the Board of the
                            Water Company, and informed its directors that he was determined if pos-
                            sible daring his term of offioe, to see, at all events, a commencement
                            of the filtration scheme, as to which -nothing practical had been done
                            up to that time in the way of execution. We have read the convention of
                            1894 ; it seems exceedingly clear and simple, and if its provisions had
                            been carried ont within a year or two after its signature, as its
                            authors intended, it would have given rise to no difficulty of
                            interpretation, bnt in the eleven years whioh have been allowed by the
                            Municipality to elapse, oiroamstanoes have changed a good deal If there
                            was one oondition of the con- vention of 1894 clearer than any other, it
                            was the fixation of the Water Company’s subscription towards the oost of
                            the works at £10,COO, and yet afar a year’s hard work and the nse of
                            maoh tact in negotiation, Mr. Graham was unable to oonolnde the matter
                            until the Water Company rather generously undertook to increase their
                            contribution from £10,000 to £16,0C0. The new system has been made to
                            filter 36,000 onbio metres qf water per (fey of 24 hoars, and the
                            Municipality cannot be aoonsed of oarrying it ont on too large a scale,
                            for during this fir«t summer the supply has, we are informed, several
                            times reached 84,000 metres per day, and if it is to be able to ensure a
                            sufficient supply, it seems probable that the oompany will have to
                            increase it within an- other year, or two years at the latest The
                            prinoipal indnoement whioh Mr. fjraham offered the Water Company as a
                            setoff against their increased contribution, was that they should
                            themselves undertake the construction and responsibility of the works,
                            without their being underlet to sundry contractors. As these works might
                            interfere with the water supply to the town daring their exeontion, this
                            arrange- ment seemed only reasonable, and the feet that they were
                            finished to snoh an extent that the town has been supplied with well
                            filtered water three iqontha befqre the oontrqot time, and that the
                            works have been earned ont to the entire satisfaction of the
                            authorities, shows that the oonfidenoe placed in the Water Com- pany's
                            ability to oarry them ont has not been misplaoed. More than two yean
                            sinoe the redaction of prioe for the water-carrier's servioe reached its
                            lowest limit, and the loss of revenue to the oompany on this service,
                            due to the convention has been over £10,000 per annum. It was now be
                            said that the water is well filtered, that the poor of Alexandria pay
                            £10,000 a year la?s than they did before, for their share of it, and
                            that the prioe for the rest can compare favorably with that of many
                            European capitals. We think that the Municipality have got s very good
                            return for their £60,0J0, and that the Water Com pany whioh had aoquired
                            by purchase a prac- tical monopoly, and was not legally obliged to agree
                            to all these changes, has made some saorifioes towards the well being of
                            the oitisens, and has done all that ooald be rea- sonably expected of it
                            for their welfare.</p>

                            Railway Union has issued a significant circular to the railway men
                            saying that they must store their arms, and when the decisive mo- ment
                            comes rise as one man, and never lay them down until a complete victory
                            be won. The details of the horrors of the past ten days are gradually
                            leaking out. They surpass imagination. In one instance, at Minsk,
                            several detachments of troops poured a cross-fire into an unarmed crowd,
                            killing and wounding 400 in a few moments. It appears that 50,000 troops
                            with guns were landed by the warships at Helsingfors on the 3rd instaht.
                            The situation became most critical, when the Imperial manifesto arrived
                            and relieved the tension. (Reuter)</p>

                            and the occasion of the 64th birthday of King Edward VII. drew large
                            numbers of sightseers to this morning's review on Abdeen-sqaaro, Cairo,
                            and though, as a spectacle, the sight was perhaps not as impressive as
                            in 1904, owing to the reduction of the Army of Occupation, there was
                            still any amount of oolour and life in the scene, and the troops bore
                            themselves admirably. Comparisons are of course odious, and we have no
                            intention of attempting them. We need only say that the parade movements
                            were very good, the marching, dressing, wheeling, etc., being
                            excellently carried out, and that the physique of the men was admirable.
                            The British soldier in Egypt is a far more satisfac- tory sight than too
                            many of the rank and file of tbe line battalions that one sees at home,
                            and which often appear to be composed of weedy boys. The police were in
                            readiness before 9 a.m., and the square, which had been cleared of
                            vehicles and loiterers, awaited the coming of tbe troops. At the
                            entrances of the streets leading to the square, except those that had
                            been kept free for the troops to enter and to leave by, large crowds
                            gathered betimes, and the enclosures filled up rapidly. By a
                            quarter-past nine all the troops had moved into the square and taken up
                            their posi- tions, facing westward, the Rifles being on the left nearest
                            the Palace, the Inniakillings next, and the Royal Engineers, Mounted
                            Infantry, and Royal Garrison Artillery on the right. At 9.80 Lord Cromer
                            drove up, the troops saluting to the strains of "God save the King,”
                            while the Royal Standard was hoisted. The British Consul-General, after
                            a short oonversa tion with Brig-General Bullock, then drove along tbe
                            rank, the troops presenting arms as he passed. H.H. the Khedive
                            afterwards arrived, escort- ed by his Body Gaard, and mounted on a
                            magnificent white Arab, tire bands playing the Khedivial Anthem as his
                            Highneea took up his position close to the Royal Stan- dard. A general
                            salute followed, the national anthem being played again, and the troops
                            gave three cheers for H.M. the King with great heartiness, to the
                            accompaniment of the guns in the CitadeL The troops then marched past,
                            H.H. the Khedive taking the salute, after which came the interesting
                            ceremony of trooping the colour. The review closed with the Khedivial
                            salute, alter which officers and men returned to barracks. We understand
                            that the Khedive expressed his great satisfaction to General Bollock at
                            the fine appearance and admirable drill of the troops.</p>

                        <p>During the homeward voyage of the New castle steamer Aureole, from the
                            Black Sea to Shields, the crew came across a self-propelling floating
                            crane, supported by means of a pontoon about 100ft long, used for ship
                            repairing in rivers or harbors. It was in the direct route of steamers
                            bound from Cape Matapan to Cape Pasoaro. The Aoreole took the pontoon in
                            tow with three 7in. hawsers. For a time some of the sailors remained
                            aboard the deraliot to bale out the water, but it labored so heavily in
                            tbe heavy seas that they were obliged to come on board tbeir own vessel.
                            The pontoon crane which was worth £l 5,000, was bound for Port Said, but
                            nothing is known as to wbat has beoome of its crew or the tag which
                            presumably bad charge of it. </p>

                            of the Department of Antiquities. The most honest and hardest workers
                            have one after the other been caught in the very act, and in every case
                            the theft was done to the temptations put in the way of the workmen by
                            the dealers in antiquities, who offer the men very high prices. At

                            have been dis- patched from Cairo, and it is hoped that the outbreak
                            will be oonfined to the small area at present infected. We learn that

                            on cattle plague work in Egypt, are to be transferred for duty in the

                            altogether, the remaining bulls having been bled to death for serum. A
                            quantity of this rinderpest serum is now stored with the Nile Cold

                            pavement to tbe road. Out at Gherireh, or beyond Shocbra and Abbasaieb,
                            there is, no doubt, less to be urged against tbe habit, but it is no
                            joke to walk on the pavements of, say, Suleiman Pasha-street, or the
                            streets leading toward tbe Ministries, if one is constantly called upon
                            to get ont of the way by the bells of youthful bicyclists, many of whom
                            seem to steer so badly that one easily understands why they avoid the
                            neighbourhood of the arabiyas. Of course, if one refuses to move the
                            cyclists must avoid the pedestrian, bnt he often steers so badly that it

                            and serious damage has resulted in several places. Trains stopped
                            running from both ends between the 95th and 98th Ootober, when tbe line
                            was repaired and put in good order. Kaimakam Loogfield Bey, E.E.,

                            of the 98th ult on inspection duty and returned on the 80th, -after
                            having found everything in perfect working order. Mr. Thomas Purvis,

                            He will organise the Mondirieb medical staff and hospital then. Dr.

                            Sudan, and the benefits resulting from the opening of the new port, I
                            may mention the fact that Messrs. Loremato Bros., a large firm of
                            merchants, who have branches at almost every port in the Red Sea, have
                            already established themselves af Port Sedan. Both there and at Buskin,
                            they are largely patronised by English people. Their goods come chiefly
                            from England and are in price. Mr. George Lorenxtato is the general
                            manager, and all orders pass through his hands and receive his personal

                        <head>MYSORE CO. AND EGYPT.</head>
                        <p>In the report of tbe Mysore Reefs and General Exploration Company for the
                            year ended September 30, the directors propose another reconstruction.
                            Tbe present company was formed as recently as July, 1909, as a
                            reconstruction of tbe Mysore Reefs (Kangundy) Mining Company, but the
                            directors now explain that a large proportion of the capital is repre-
                            sented in the balance sheet by the property originally worked in India,
                            upon which opera- tions have been suspended, and they considsr that the
                            time has arrrived when this unproduc- tive expenditure should be dealt
                            with. They, therefore, propose to form "The Mysore Reefs and General
                            Explorers, limited," to take over the assets and liabilities of the
                            present company. The capital of the new company would be £50,000,
                            divided into 40,000 Preference and 160,000 Ordinary Shares of 6s each
                            thus providing for the allotment of one fully-paid Ordinary Share for
                            each old Ordinary Shan, and one fully-paid Preference Share for each old
                            Preference Share. Tbe existing shares are £l fully paid, and the
                            proposal is thus to write down the capital account by 76 per dent The
                            report shows a balance of profit for the year at £1,673.</p>
