                    <p>Oar oontemporary “A1 Lew*” states that
                        Ghari Mukhtar Pacha, on behalf of the Porte,
                        demands what praotioally amounts to the
                        oeision of the Sinai Feninsala and permisrion
                        to oonitrnot a railway from Akaba to Suez.
                        That such amazing demands should have been
                        made argues a remarkable lack of humour
                        on the part of the Ottoman Government,
                        whoee next demand, we suppose, will be for
                        the oession of Zsgasig, Ismailia, and -Bel be is.
                        Doee the Porte seriously believe that Egypt
                        can consent to the occupation of the Sinai—
                        the natnral buffer between Turkey and the

                        contemporary has been misinformed. It is true
                        that “Al Lewa” has always shown a remarkable
                        dexterity in misinterpreting motives - espe-
                        cially those cf the higher British offioials who
                        have done yeoman’s servioe to the Khedivial

                        As to the attitude of the Egyptian Press
                        we are glad to reoognise that the Bnropean
                        organs of Alexandria and Cairo have long
                        realised that the prinoiplea for whioh the
                        Rgyptian Government is contending in de-
                        manding the evaoaation of Tahah are
                        just and patriotic. Egypt cannot afford to
                        see the gap of desert that separates her from
                        her powerful neighboor bridged by Otto-
                        man military poets end strategical railways.
                        Her isolation has been one of the factors of
                        her prosperity. True, she owes mnoh to good
                        government, to the industry ot her peasantry,
                        and to the great public works that have
                        increased her resources and defy nature in
                        her most niggard yean; bat had she been
                        compelled to arm against powerful neighbours,
                        to guard all her frontiers against the
                        of invasion, to wateh with anxiety any distur-
                        bance in the political equilibrium of the
                        Levant, her progress, however exoellentber
                        goverument, mast have been terribly delayed.
                        Of our vernacular contemporaries, some realise
                        the danger, bat there ere others that hail it-
                        as a blessing. The Nationalist appreciations ot
                        the situation are an interesting study. They
                        demand constitutions and chambers of deputies
                        —enlarging at the asms time on the rights in
                        Egypt of the Saltan to whom such things era
                        anathema. They oomplain that British in-
                        flnenoe in Egypt is exercised with the sole
                        objeot cf keeping its people in snbjeetion, and
                        openly^invite the interference of a race that
                        regards the Egyptian with ill-oonooaled con-
                        tempt.
                        We might panne the contradictions that
                        are involved in the policy whioh they advocate
                        still farther. Euoagh that the Government
                        remains and will remain unmoved by their
                        criticisms, that it will continoe its policy of
                        opposition to Turkish olaims on the Eastern
                        frontier, and that its opposition will have the
                        support of Britain and the British Empire.
                        Whether the claims of the Ottoman Govern-
                        ment are likely to be supported by *Ly

                <p>An Unpleasant Incident.
                    We hear that an official belonging to the Ministry of Public Instruction has found himself obliged to choose one of two alternatives,
                    i.e, resigning his official position or standing his trial before the British Consular Court, on account of a dispute with a policeman on Hast el Nil Bridge,
                    Cairo, in which a technical assault appears to have been committed. It is felt in some quarters that the punishment is rather too severe for the crime, while,
                    on the other side, it is staled that the said official had already been Involved in similar incidents. The case is exciting considerable interest, especially 
                    among officials.

                <p>Man Cut in Two.
                    A fatal accident occurred at Round Point yesterday evening. As is usual on Shorn el Nessim,
                    the tramcars were largely patronised and considerable overcrowding took place. It is only surprising that
                    we have not more accidents to chronicle.	About 7 p.m., an
                    Armenian of 30 years, in the scramble to secure seats, attempted to pass from one oar to another and fell between the two,
                    the wheels of one passing over his body and cutting it in halves. It seems incredible, but we have it on good authority, that the
                    mutilated remains of the unfortunate man were left lying on the spot for-close on two hours before being removed by the police.

                    way between fortunes well won and ill won. No amount of charity in the spending of such fortunes could compensate, he said, for
                    the misconduct occasioned in the making of them. The taxation would be aimed merely at inheritances or the transmission in entirety

                <p>Nothing is known as to the farther progress of the negotiations between Egypt and Turkey on the frontier question. News from the "front” remains
                    unimportant. The "Diana,” whose officers and crew are beginning to find the gulf of Akaba a somewhat monotonous station, remains oft Akaba and part

                <p>The discovery of oysters is of interest in that it proves that the gulf of Akaba produces something, and should farther encourage the Ministry of Foreign
                    Affairs—if encouragement were needed—to insist on the Egyptian ownership of its western shore. Why abandon rich beds—the very existence of which will doubtless

                    public, the enclosure presenting a bright and animated appearance and the afternoon proving a most enjoyable one. The greatest interest was
                    taken in the racing, and the Pari Mutuel was largely patronised, the odds in many oases being very good, especially in the Regimental Cup, when 
                    the fortunate backers of Grey Dawn received P.T. 750 for their dollar. The coarse was in splendid condition and the racing was on the whole good.
                    The most exciting finish of the day was provided by the Regimental Cap, when Grey Dawn and Soliman came in neck and neck. An accident occurred in 
                    that race, when 8t. Patrick’s rider was thrown but, fortunately, received no serious injuries. The last race, the April Stakes, was a walk-over for
                    Roi de l’Air. The races were witnessed by large crowds of holiday-making spectators who occupied every point of vantage along the course.

                    superiority was never once challenged and he won a close race by a length.

                <head>"THE CRUCIFIXION."</head>
                <p>It was with pleasure both reverent and sincere that we listened to the performance of Dr. Stainer’s sacred cantata
                    "Crucifixion” in All Saints’ Church, Cairo, on Maundy Thursday. The work is an ambitious one, and is associated
                    with cathedral choirs of known ability and training. That a result so good should be arrived at shows great patience
                    and real love of the work, and Mr. Peacock deserves all commendation and praise. Thanks also are due to Mr.Gottlieb 
                    for his valuable help at the organ daring rehearsals. The tenor solos were sung by Mr. Roussain, whose sweet and cultivated
                    voice filled the church with thrilling sympathy. The choir might have attacked the chorus "Fling wide the Gates” with greater
                    force and more light and shade, but the following choruses were well presented. In ' The Appeal of the Crucifiad” the effect
                    was dramatic and intense, and the choir at its beat as it reached the climax shooting with startling accuracy "Crucify, Crucify.”
                    The bass solos were chiefly sustained by Captain Tucker. Unfortunately, he appeared to be suffering from cold, though there was 
                    no sign of it in the duet "Oh 'twas love" (Mrs. Roussin and Captain Tucker), which was beautifully rendered. We remember hearing
                    this work in All Sainta’ some year or two ago. It is invidious making comparisons but we may add that Mr. Peacock is to be warmly
                    congratulated on the efficiency of his choir.

                    Korea, China, the Philippines, and India. Mr. Bryan left Cairo for Luxor on Monday night and will return on Thursday,

                <p>Apropos of the visit of Sir Edward Clarke to Egypt and the simultaneous attack made upon him by the Protectionists in the City
                    of London because of his attitude respecting tariff reform, the "Westminster Gazette” prints a clever and very amusing cartoon
                    from the pencil of Mr. F. Carruthers Gould. Sir Edward, in full tourist costume, is pictured as seated on the back of a meek-looking donkey,
                    from which position he surveys the 8phinx, the latter bearing the features of Mr. Arthur Balfour, with the addition of the famous
                    monocle of the member for West Birmingham. Sir Edward is represented as making the following comment: "Dear me, so that’s the Sphinx.
                    It’s uncommonly like both of them. I suppose it must be the effect of the mirage.”
