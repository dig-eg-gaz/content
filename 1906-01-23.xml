                    <head>MOROCCO ANU ABYSSINIA</head>
                    <p> One of the many writers on Africa said some years ago, that throughout the
                        continent, from North to South, there exists some subtle climatic influence
                        which, acting on human nerves, tends to make the people very quarrel - soma
                        This is said to apply not Only to natives, but more particularly to
                        foreigners. It is, we thick, admitted that the experience of recent years
                        has quite justified this opinion, by along series of events still so freshly
                        before us that it is not necessary to recapitulate them. The disputed
                        question of most immediate importance is that of Morocco. This question has
                        loomed largely before os for many month', but it is. probably,, now only a
                        matter of days before some of the results of the Conference of Algesiras
                        will be known to the world. Already there rooms to be a general opinion that
                        although this question has given rise to a good deal of anxiety, an amicable
                        settlement will probably be arrived at We sincerely hope that this will be
                        so, sad we should have been still more pleased if we could have looked
                        forward to the future with a sigh of relief at . the idea that African
                        questions bad subsided fora while But,however s satisfactory may be the news
                        we all anxiously await from Algesiras. we regret to say that it may not be
                        long before another African question became* acute, and this time if will
                        interest Egypt more nearly than does the question of Morocco. We refer to
                        Abyssinia. For the last twelve years a question has been brewing there which
                        "promises to result in a very considerable crop of internatioral
                        difficulties It all began with what would appear at first sight to be almost
                        simple- matter, which, in view of the serious complications likely to arise
                        from it, merits some in 1893, some friends of the Emperor Menelik expressed
                        the wish to make a railway for him from the Red Sea to hit capital. Hitherto
                        most of the Abyssinian exports were taken in a clumsy sort of way by caravan
                        to the port of Zaila in British Somaliland, for our readers will remember
                        that one of the difficulties of Abyssinian development is that it has no
                        sea. coast of its own, and it results from many rather cunningly devised
                        international arrangements that Menelik has to pass through foreign
                        territory, either French, British, or Italian, before he can get to any
                        ports It might appear to some people that after the successful war which
                        England waged against Abyssinia some, forty years ago, the British
                        Government might have secured this exclusive advantage, for the expedition
                        had been a 'costly one ; bat so far as we can remember the principal result
                        has been that an English nobleman takes his title from the then capital of
                        Abyssinia. We cannot remember exactly what constituted the French title to
                        their part of Somaliland, but at all events they have it, and it includes
                        the port of Djibouti. In 1893 Menelik's friends were French or acting in
                        French interests, and it naturally occurred to them that it would be a good
                        thing to make a railway from Djibouti, and thus take away the trade, with
                        its large prospect of future development, from Zaila. The line would then
                        pass for a distance of about 50 miles through French territory. Although
                        this line was expressly intended to be a purely commercial undertaking, and
                        Menelik was naturally anxious to secure the advantages of development which
                        it would open out, he was still cautious enough stipulate that he would wait
                        and see how he got on with his new friends and their railway as far as
                        Harrar, or not quite half way from the sea to his capital, before he gave
                        them any permission to take their line on to Adis Abeba. Subsequent events
                        have shown that be was exceedingly well advised. It would take us much
                        beyond the limits of this article to trace the interesting development of
                        this railway question ; we intend to return to it again in a few days in
                        greater detoil. For the moment we will only summarise in a few words the
                        facts that, as is not unusual in similar undertakings, the railway company
                        got into financial difficulties, the line cost more than was expected it
                        always does,— the company being French, had naturally to appeal to the
                        French Government to get it out of its difficulties, .long negotiations
                        follow- el, ending in the whole thing being entirely converted from a
                        commercial into a political undertaking, and this, "mirabile dicta,".without
                        it being considered necessary to consult t Menelik about it in any way.
                        Later on the" somewhat meagre funds allotted by the French Government were
                        exhausted, and a New African Company and a New Egyptian Company had to be
                        called to the rescue. Still later Menelik became so disgusted with the
                        conduct of his. friends, that in May, 1905, he convened the representatives
                        of the four European Powers principally interested, and told them very
                        plainly what he thought about the action of the railway company, and added
                        that if be did not very shortly receive some much more reasonable proposals
                        he would make the line himself from Harrar on to hie capital at Adis Abeba'
                        a distance of about 300 miles. Although the "entente eordiale" 'between
                        England and France did not refer to Abyssiuis we still think that it- would
                        have been of much assistance in bringing matters to an understanding if the
                        question had been I ft to the only Governments much interested in it until
                        quite recently ; we mean those of France, England, and Italy, but
                        unfortunately Germany has now appeared on the scene, and after the not very
                        successful mission of Dr Rosen, is sending a Minister to the Court of the
                        Emperor Menelik, probably with the laudable wish of taking advantage of the
                        rivalries of the other nations. In spite of the rather cool reception he got
                        from. Menelik, Dr. Rosen is said to be determined to acquire commercial
                        equality in Abyssinia, and to assist in the establishment of trade
                        communi-cations between that country and the coast. He apparently does not
                        consider the fact that these communications must necessarily be made through
                        either French, British, or Italian territory to be of much importance. We
                        must say that we feel much sympathy with the Ethiopeans monarch in his
                        struggles with civilisation, and if he wishes to make his railway line
                        himself, vhy should he not be allowed to do so. if he cau And perhaps now
                        that fie has a Bank, he may be able- to raise the necessary funds. </p>

                        moudirs had tackled this complicated question without success, owing to the
                        many difficulties it presented. OurMoudrr, Mohamed Bey Moheb, is therefore
                        to be congratulated on his triumph, due exclusively to his dogged tenacity,
                        perseveranoe, and tact His expe­rience in municipal matters has also stood
                        him in good stead, for was it not he that created the Fayoum

                    <p>The elections took place on the 17th inst, commencing at 10 a.m sharp, and
                        closing at 2 p.m.The chosen members are the following:— Europeans : MM.
                        Sefth Berla, Janm Trian dafilou, Em. Calambokides, and Walter Berla. Natives
                        : Ismail Pacha Abaza, Amn Pacha Shamsy, Sid Ahmed Bay Dib, and Mahmoud Bey
                        Gamal.</p>
                    <p>Never had Zsgarg seen such a scene. Na­tives and Europeans intermingled in a

                        Nile Motor Boat Company should be as well patronised in the summer as in the
                        winter months.</p>
                    <p>The boats are very convenient in regard to size and especially suitable for
                        private parties. They are each 1 m. 80 cm. in breadth and 10 metres in
                        length. The space allotted to the passengers is four metres in extent The

                        the most pleasant circumstances. On arriving at the Barrage, the tables with
                        which each boat is fitted were brought ashore, and amidst the beautiful
                        sur­roundings of the Barrage gardens these were laid out with a plenteous
                        stock of champagne and sand wiches. The success of the company was drunk

                        to be of an improved design so as to be much more basily worked. The winches

                    <head>TO BE PARCELLED OUT IN LOTS.</head>
                    <p>We stated in our issue of last Saturday that a very important purchase of
                        agricultural land had been made by the Anglo-Egyptian Land Allotment Co. We
                        now learn that the property in question is situated at Baatara, near
                        Damanboor, and withirt 20 minutes carnage drive of that town. It consists of
                        1,500 feddaqs of the best land and was bought from Messrs. Emile and Jacques
                        Tabet at the prioe of LE. 100,000, payable on the transfer of the title
                        deeds. There are 5 or 6 wall populated villages on the estate. It is one of
                        the best laid out properties in that part of the country and has been under
                        the im mediate softer vision of one of the former owners during the 8 or 4
                        years the land has been in their possession. Two large cajals traverse the
                        property so that there is an ample supply of water, and what is of import
                        ance is the fact that so plentiful ie the supply no pumping machinery is
                        required to irrigate the land. Although it is already in a high state of
                        cultivation the estate is oapable of still farther development with a
                        judicious oat lay of a little more money.</p>
                    <p>We understand the oompany intends in all probability to parcel the property
                        into plots of different dimensions so as to meet the require­ments and
                        theaus of the small landowners and fellaheen, to whom it would be sold, in
                        that case, on the most favorable terms, the pay­ments being spread over a
                        number of years.</p>
                    <p>There ie a large brick factory adjoining one of the villages where bricks are
                        made for supplying the neighbourhood and the adjacent towns, and this
                        factory is considered a'vainable asset. </p>

                        judgement was given</p>
                    <p>A person is guilty of forgery who, without the knowledge or the consent of
                        the owner of a seal, affixes its impress upon a document purporting to be a
                        conveyance of land belong­ing to such owner and it is immaterial whether the
                        impress be affixed by means of a genuine or a spurious, seal. Consequently,
                        where such document bears the impress of a genuine seal thus fraudulently
                        affixed, a person who, know- ing it to be forged set, it up against the

                    <p>I. The right of pre emption does not arise from contract. Its nature is
                        similar to that of the right of expropriation Hence before the Decree 23
                        Maroh 1901 came into operation, the native do arts had jurisdiction to try a
                        presmption suit when the pre emptor and the fact that the vendor was an
                        alien and that the sale had been effected under the Mixed Bode </p>
                    <p>IL The obligation arising under the preemption decree to join the vendor as
                        party to the suit does not merely concern the pro- cedars but affects the
                        existence of 'the right to pre-empt. It has not consequently any
                        retrospective effect-!</p>

                    <p>The Army Council has at present under consideration a proposal respecting the
                        appoint­ment of certain qualified officers of the Auxiliary Forces as acting
                        adjutants of corps of Militia and Volunteer Artillery, in consequence of the
                        difficulty experienced in obtaining the services of officers of the Royal
                        Garrison Artillery. </p>
                    <p>Me. Arnold Forster's project of shifting the Royal Engineers from Chatham to
                        Salisbury Plain in order to hand over Chatham quarters to the Admiralty, has
                        been knocked on the head, and properly so. This wild-cat scheme would have
                        involved an enormous outlay, with no commensurate benefit to the army.</p>
                    <p>Sir John Fisher has found it necessary to issue a circular contradicting the
                        oft repeated assertion that radical changes in the garb of the handymen were
                        in contemplation. It appears that the changes are to be made in the kit, and
                        they will have the effect of redu­cing the ocst of that outfit</p>

                    <head>HIGHER PRICES FOR AMERICAN COTTON</head>
                    <p>The New Orleans cotton, at the final sitting last week, passed a resolution
                        adopting the committee's report flouring the selling of the balance of the
                        cotton crop at a minimum price of 15 cents a pound. TheConvention also
                        decided to recommend a 10 percent reduction in the acreage by
                        diversification of next years crops. This recommendation was forced upon the
                        Convention by the opposi­tion, who feared that over planting would be the
                        result of the 15 cent basis.</p>
                    <p>President Jordan, of the Southern Cotton Association, declared that this was
                        the first time in the history of the Sooth that the planters dominated the
                        situation. He be­lieved that the "bears" and spinners were now at the mercy
                        of the growers, and that the Northern exchanges had lost the power of making
                        a price which might bankrupt the planters. He stated that if the remainder
                        of the crop is sold at 15 cento it would not more than even up matters, as
                        the New York hears had beaten the price down formerly to below</p>
                    <p>10 cents a pound.</p>
                    <p>"The mills," said he, "will not suffer, as they demand cotton, and millions
                        of new spindles have been erected since last year By judicious planting and
                        careful holding the speculators might he out mar ceuvred. and the men who
                        produce the staple reap the proper reward for their labours.</p>

                    <head>THE STORY OF THE KHEDIVE'S SHARES</head>
                    <p>Mr. Frederick Greenwood writes to the "Times" : -</p>
                    <p>Sir,—In "The Times" of Friday week a short letter from Mr. Oppenheim broke
                        down Mr. Lucien Wolf's account of a con­versation which, he said, took place
                        between the first-named gentleman and myself in November. Mr. Wolf's report
                        of this con­versation appeared in a history of the purchase of the Khedive's
                        Suez. Canal shares. It was a very positive statement Set forth with the
                        particularity which is so alluring to belief, it had the farther advantage
                        of surprise for your readers were told that they, were misled if they ever
                        credited my account of the fortunate Egyptian <hi rend="italic">coup.</hi>
                        .He (Mr. Wolf) had a different story to tell; the tenth being— But his
                        meaning had better be stated as understood by others. Quite correctly, the
                        "Saturday Review" expressed it as follows Mr. Wolfs historiette "gives
                        credit for the idea that led to the transaction, not to Mr. Greenwood,.but
                        to Mr. Oppenheim. according to Mr. Wolf Mr, Greenwood did nothing</p>
                    <p>more than make practicable a suggestion thrown out by Mr. Oppenheim at a
                        dinner- table.''</p>
                    <p>Therefore, in a letter which you were good enough to print, I pointed out to
                        Mr. Wolf that, unless he was mistaken, I must have been gnilty of
                        pretensions meanly conceived and untruthfully asserted. Or, if not, guilty,
                        but yet unable aftter 80 years to meet his imputations with absolute
                        disproof, I must lie under lasting suspicion, as the least hurtful
                        consequence of Mr. wolfd error By good fortune, however, such means of
                        disproof were not lacking ; and, warning Mr. Wolf of this circumstance, I
                        was obliged to add that the conversation he reported so precisely never took
                        place. I</p>
                    <p>But he would not believe me, which was a pity. For, while he was writing to
                        yon a per sistent letter urging that he had a source of information
                        preferable to unneandoontra&lt;|iotory of it, correction of himself was On
                        the way to Printing-house sqnarefrom this identical source Reading Mr. Wolf
                        a story as other people did, Mr. Oppenheim wrote at once to reject it, and
                        his denial is decisive. only two persons now or at any time could speak to
                        the truth of the matter, and both repudiate Mr. Wolt's inferential
                        conversation, with the misrepresen tation of facts which it conveys.</p>
                    <p>It was not unlikely, I thought, that he would acknowledge so grave a mistake
                        when its character was shown to him He has not done so, however, and I pass
                        to, other matters—the least important first</p>
                    <p>There Was a warning in my previous letter that, in reading Mr. Wotfs history,
                        care should betaken against confusing the Canal, the property of a French
                        company, with the Khedive's boxes of Canal shares, which were a different
                        property with a different ownership The indebtedness of the French company,
                        the Various expedients of its president to raise money on the Canal itself,
                        were not to be con­founded with the Khedive's difficulties at an­other time
                        and the bargaining then for his infructuous shares. Such a walking may have
                        seemed unnecessary, but it was not so. Quite recently it was said in, a
                        journal of the highest rank that, when Sir Andrew Clarke recom­mended , his
                        Government to buy the Suez Canal, "he anticipated by five years the idea of
                        Lord Beaconsfield and Mr. Greenwood."</p>
                    <p>history seems to have put the same into many heads ; and his relation of M
                        de' Lerseps's financial troubles and ex pedients was certainly indentions.
                        He speaks of "the first chance of buying out the company'' —a chance which
                        if it means purchase of the French Canal by the Britannic Government, its
                        transfer to the British Crown as State property (and so this "first chanoe"
                        has been understood) was never offered and never possible. that it -was
                        never offered appears from Mr. Wolfs narrative, when it is not read at a
                        glance ; while it Was made impossible for anything but madness by an
                        interlocked combination of political and financial obstruction formidable in
                        both countries. There was a scheme for selling the Canal to "the maritime
                        Towers," but that was not selling to the British Govern ment There was a
                        proposal for making it the property of an English company, of which the same
                        thing most be said, though the descrip- tion of it here is "sale to Great
                        Britain." Other proposals were made, and, when they are all reconnected, all
                        are seen to have failed because from the nature of men and things they could
                        not succeed. Yet there is a common impression among Mr. .Wolfs readers at a
                        glance (he is lucky if they are Dot three out of four) that Lord Granville
                        might have bought the suezCanalfor his Government in 1871 ;that it very weak
                        of Him to reject the chance ; and that the Khedive's shares came into the
                        transaction. A more accurate and edifying suggestion would have been to
                        contrast the property in the Canal which we obtained ,in peace and have held
                        in quietness, with the French property—if we could have bought it from the
                        weakness and poverty of the France of that day. What would have been its
                        price, as compared with- the fonr millions paid to Ismail is What would it
                        have been as a commodity, and what its political value—its shares
                        distributed among a multitude cf French proprietors — compared with the
                        individual mass brought fronr the Khedive's Treasury to be all British and
                        all in the hands of the Government buying the Sure Canal A far better thing
                        was done in 1875.</p>
                    <p>But, according to Mr. wolf, the worse and the impossible thing was attempted
                        by Mr. ' Disraeli, in the spring of 1874. For reasons of great weight in
                        themselves, he commissioned</p>
                    <p>the late Baron Rothschild "to intimate con­</p>
                    <p>fidentially to M do bessops that the British Government were prepared to
                        purchase the Suez Canal outright if suitable terms could be arranged ;'' and
                        the present Lord rothsechild went to Paris at", once to submit this proposal
                        to the president of the Canal Company. To purchase the Canal outright. If so
                        (Mr. Wolf gives no authority for this statement), we have here the strongest
                        evidence of Disraeli's an* xiety to obtain a proprietary hold on the Canal,
                        but not of the sagacity which avoids all roads to foredoomed failure. cassio
                        might as well have sounded the moon upon the probabilities of a deal in
                        Desdemoha. It seem" that Mr Disraeli made this attempt in May, 1874. But in
                        April—only a month before (I follow Mt Wolfs narrative)—his Government had
                        ascet taiued through a conversation between Lord Derby and the French
                        Ambassador that the French Government would not listen to acquisition by '
                        the maritime Powers," let alone transference to England outright Unlike Mr.
                        Disraeli's proposal, Lord Derby's would have allowed France to remain in the
                        proprietary, 1st any rate ; but it was rejected with indiges tion.
                        Naturally. The continued ownership ef the Canal as theretofore held remained
                        a na­tional affair. A point of honour with the Government, it was at the
                        same time a rearoused demand of "Chauvinism," consequent upon an on appeased
                        Anglo Frenoh quarrel over the Canal tolls. In these conditions it was that
                        Mr. Disraeli's envoy, approaobed the Othello of the piece. And, "as soon as
                        his proposals were unfolded to M. de Lesseps, that gentle­man declared
                        emphatically that the sale of the Canal to any company, Power, or group of
                        Powers was totally out of the question."</p>
                    <p>A strange story The proved impossibilities of 1871 were yet more impossible
                        in 1874, and Mr. Disraeli did not know it! They had been added to remarkably
                        in the interval by open evideuoe of a Franco Russian arrangement for
                        "combined action io defence French interests in the Suez Canal": yet Mr.
                        Disraeli went on to receive the inevitable rebuff. 'Twas unlike him. Yet I
                        do not suggest that Mr. Wolf makes this statement without authority that
                        quite satisfies himself But, being concerned for a just understanding of the
                        matter, I am obliged to add that I have among my papers a memoran dum,
                        written in 1896, whih sets out a very d fforent aooount of Lord Rohschilds
                        visit to Paris in 1874 and the object of it, and that I believe the
                        authority for this different account as good as any that Mr. Wolf oan
                        show.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Wolf now goes on to say that, undis- oouraged by his failure to boy the
                        Canal outright., Mr." Disraeli "continued his confe rences with Baron
                        Rothschild io Piccadilly, seeking with him some other means" of modify­ing a
                        dangerous monopoly. Thera was still the expedient of a largo purchase of
                        share on the various Bourses, but still the difficulty also that before a
                        sufficient number could be bought in open market the price would become
                        prohi bitive and the object of the purchase would probably be detected No
                        way out of that difficulty could be found unless great blocks of shares
                        could be bought quietly here and there. "In this way"—and now we come to a
                        very interesting. point—"the idea of approaching the Khedive first arose . .
                        It was accord-</p>
                    <p>ingly resolved that overtures should be made to him, and Baron Rothschild
                        undertook on the part of his firm to conduct the delicate negotia­tion."</p>
                    <p>Now that statement, as will presently be seen, stands very much in need of
                        positive and precise authority. The days were moving on from May, 1874, when
                        Mr. Disraeli's proposal to the French was rejected, to and through the more
                        promising year 1875; for meanwhile the Khedive's debts were heaping up at a
                        tremendous rate, and the time was near when he could have no other or no
                        efficient asset than those unproductive shares. But though all through that
                        increasingly porten­tous interval Baron Rothsehild—but no, not all through,
                        but nearly. Although daring many months in 1874-5 Baron Rothschild repeated
                        his overtures to the Khedive,he did so in vain. it seemed as though the lost
                        opportunities of 1870 71 were final''—they were never to come again.</p>
                    <p>' This was in the late summer of 1875''- the late sommer; three months before

                        The shares would become French property in three months by an automatic

                    <p>Behold, then, the situation in the first week in November. But where is Mr.

                        the moat perfect for their purpose has arrived, after visibly rushing on for

                        do so ? Do they know anything about it An affirmative answer has never yet
                        been given.</p>
                    <p>If the well-in firmed English financier did repeat his endeavour to buy when
                        be saw that the Khedive's affairs must go to ruin in a few weeks without
                        some such relief as soiling (and being on the look-out so long, with a great
                        purpose in hand, Rothschild could not be unaware of that dilemma), or if he
                        again approached the Khedive later, when the Frenchmen round their way to
                        his Highness, some record of that last aud moat urgent attempt should appear
                        in a history like .Mr. Wolfs. But no such record stands there or anywhere
                        else. Or suppose that Baron Roth­sohild found that he could not prevail
                        against the French negotiators on this supreme occa­sion, would he not warn
                        his Government that the French were at work and likely to succeed I To do so
                        was In the duty which, according to Mr. Wolf, this most scrupulous man of
                        business and good Englishman had undertaken. And did he give any such
                        warning = Mr. Wolf does not say he did, and there is proof that he did
                        not</p>
                    <p>Yet another series of difficulties comes into view when we consider the
                        Khedive's part in the matter as here presented. Are we to believe that
                        Ismail, who had keen pressed by an English Rothschild to sell his shares,and
                        had heard the same persuasion "over and over again" down to the late summer
                        of 1875, forgot all about it in the desperate need of November "He did not
                        wish to sell." But Ismail was no dullard. A man of extremely quick and
                        penetrating mind, he could see as plainly as the draftsman of the French
                        proposals that he was to sign a loan arrangement tint was purchase in
                        effect, attended by long lasting and extortion­ate claims for interest such
                        as Baron R .th- schild would never dream of contending for. Yet, with the
                        Rothschild offer still open, still urged upon him as we are to under­stand,
                        he never turned from the French syn­dicates to see what he could make of it
                        Even as a means of putting up his price he gave it no attention. .Incredible
                        But what if, giving up all hope just when an unsur­passable opportunity
                        presented itself, Baron Rothschild had turned his back on the whole business
                        and would do no more in it That might explain the Khedive's conduct of the
                        affair; but what is to explain the supposed conduct of Mr. Disraeli's friend
                        and agent in a matter of inch immense importance We are here in presence of
                        the most extravagant suggestion of all. As for Ismail's refusal to sell, we
                        know that he did sell to the English as soon as another agent of Mr.
                        Disraeli's offered to buy. And yet the head of the house of Rothsohild could
                        not have been thought an in- sufficiently responsible negotiator.</p>
                    <p>What, then, is to be made of all this 7 Its immediate suggestion is that
                        Baron Rothschild coaid not have been engaged in buying the Khedive's shares.
                        I have my own opinion and my reasons for it, but at the moment only say that
                        no friend of the Rothschilds can believe that he was, upon Mr. Wolf's
                        account of the matter. better that he should never have taken it up than
                        that he shoud drop it at the critical time ; critical, but, as the event
                        proved, not hopelss, though the Government was left in the dark and without
                        help till the last hour of a great and final opportunity was running out.
                        When was his olient, Mr. Disraeli.apprised of the opportunity Not till this
                        last hour, and not then by Baron Rothschild. Yet both of them had been
                        eagerly looking for it for many months, and it had been glaring at them for
                        almost as many weeks! The tale is all wrong somewhere. I can not and do not
                        say that Mr. Wolf is still without authority for his suggestive assertions,
                        his assertive suggestions, on this which is a special part of his subject.
                        Bat they greatly need good authority ; he offers none, and the
                        considerations above recited forbid belief that he can adduce corroboration
                        of the necessary kind. It is more probable that his account of the
                        Rothschild endeavour to buy the Khedive's shares is inferential, as was his
                        figmentary and injurious report of a dinner-table conversation. Mark that,
                        at the best this endeavour, if ever made, was abortive. It failed in the
                        hands of Mr. Disraeli and Baron Rothschild When the Khedive's shares were
                        actually passing into the possession of the French, neither of them was
                        aware of the transaction. And whit would "the dangerous monopoly" have been
                        if that "transaction" had been completed </p>

                        that the news of his untimely end will bring sadness to the thou sands of
                        artisans and others whom he had addressed during the last few years. I think
                        I may say he was the most successful lecturer of the day, if:the number of
                        engagements be a criterion. Last season the amount of his travelling
                        approximated, to 16,000 miles ; he was delivering a lecture practically
                        every day, and occasionally he gave two on one day. The Welsh miners seemed
                        to appreciate his work to the full. Prom down in the Rhondda Valley demands

                        dates for the number of places anxious to have him. The secret of his
                        success was his graphic description manner, his enthusiastic devotion to his
                        subject, and the overflow­ing bonhomie of the man. There are those who can
                        speak with intimate knowledge of his goodness of heart, of bis kindly

                        envy. He never took exception to criticism himself, and I do not remember

                    <p>Mr. Haskett Smith was a Wrangler and a Scholar of Christ's College,
                        Cambridge. Ha travelled much in Oriental lands and edited Murray's "Handbook

                        many journeys, but it may he interesting to relate that he first visited
                        Palestine at Invitation of his intimate friend laurence Oliphant, and that
                        he lived on Mount Carmel tor several years. Mr. Haskett Smith also made

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>

                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis” to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at
                        Salsomaggiore.</p>

                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San

                    <p>LOCARNO, may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty

                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt,” by Bramantion.</p>

                        Pilatus, Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other
                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of

                        Railway, with delightful scenery en route. The ascent of Titlis, is made
                        from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps is grand; extending from Monte
                        Rosa to the Black Forest, and from the Santis to the Matterhorn.</p>
