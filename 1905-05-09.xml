                        REPRESENTATIONS. FRENCH OFFICIAL DENIAL.</head>
                    <p>Tokio, May 5. A section of the Japanese Press is urging the Government to
                        take the strongest measures in consequence of the stay of the Baltic Fleet
                        Even responsible organs are calling for prompt and independent action.
                        (Reuter.)</p>
                    <p>London, May 8. The "Times" reports from Tokio that the indignation in Japan
                        is increasing. Even the soberest journals declare that France has vir-
                        tually taken up arms against Japan and plainly state England's duty to
                        prevent the interference of third parties.</p>
                    <p>The “Times," in a significant article, states that no more deplorable error
                        can be com- milted by France than to suppose that the complaints of Japan
                        will be treated lightly. While everything is done to provent the rup- ture
                        of the “entente," France must remember that England will have no choice but
                        to comply if the facts alleged by the Japanese are estab- lishedand Japan
                        asks us to fulfil the obligations of the alliance. (Reuter.)</p>
                    <p>London, May 8 The Markets are weak on account of the international situation
                        and the article in the “Times."</p>
                    <p>It is understood that Lord Lansdowne has made earnest representations to
                        France with reference to the necessity of a strict observance of
                        neutrality.</p>
                    <p>Reuter’s Agent learns from Tokio that the Japanese complaints are mainly
                        directed against the provisioning and equipping of the Baltic Fleet from
                        neutral shores. (Reuter.)</p>
                    <p>Paris, May 8. The official statement of the Government says that not only
                        have the most positive instructions been sent to the authorities in Indo
                        China to enforce the neutrality regula- tions, but that it has unremittingly
                        seen to the execution of these instructions. (Reuter.</p>

                    <p>Paris, May 8. A note of the Havas Agency denies the allegations contained in
                        a telegram from Hong Kong, according to which France had com- mitted a
                        breach of the neutrality roles. (H.)</p>

                            excitement this morning. A mad Arab, who is a well-known character at
                            Minet-el Bassal, entered the bank and went up to one of the cashiers
                            demanding that his wages should be paid. The cashier replied that
                            nothing was owing to him and that he was not in the employment of the
                            bank. The mad man retaliated by drawing a double barrelled pistol and
                            discharging the contents of both barrells at the cashier. An exciting
                            scene ensued. The bank, as usual, was crowded with customers and the
                            unwonted discharge of fire- arms caused considerable confusion.

                        consequence was that a large carbuncle formed in the back of his neck, and
                        an opera- tion under chloroform was found necessary. When I visited him
                        yesterday he was better and out of danger. He could not, however, leave for
                        Cairo, as the Bishmo case was a source of great anxiety to him.</p>
                    <p>Major Elgood informed me that six of the band of desperadoes had already been
                        placed under arrest, and that one of them had con- fessed his guilt. He has
                        sent the Moudir to the Ghizeh province and the commandant of police to
                        Mehatela village to arrest the remainder of the band and its leader.</p>
                    <p>I have been informed that the leader of the brigand is Abbass Ezomer, a
                        celebrated brigand from Ghizeh province.</p>
                    <p>Much credit is due to Major Elgood and his men for their prompt discovery and
                        arrest of the members of this terrible gang, whose depredations are
                        well-known to the inhabitants of the three provinces.</p>

                    <p>The tradespeople in Cairo are watching with great interest the proceedings in
                        the case of the firm of Dick&amp;Co, Sharia Kasr el Nil, French subjects, a
                        commercial judg- ment having been given on 29th April last declaring this
                        firm bankrupt. The interest is partly extrinsic, in view of the extraor-
                        dinary proceedings which obtained in the case of the Hamilton bankruptcy,
                        for it has been alleged that if Hamilton had not been a British subject, he
                        would have received far different treatment. M. P. Caloyanni, who was the
                        official receiver in the Hamilton bankruptcy, has been appointed to that
                        posi- tion in the present case, whilst Judge Tuck, who presided in the first
                        case, will also adjudi- cate in the instance of M. Dick&amp;Co.</p>

                    <p>The member of the Alexandria City Police force, who is accused of having
                        committed an assault in Cherif Pasha-street on the morning of H.H. the
                        Khedive’s arrival at Alexandria, has been reduced in rank and fined, and
                        will be tried for assault</p>
                    <p>Our local confrères appear to labour under the impression that the policeman
                        exercised his authority on that occasion in order to keep the street clear
                        of traffic for the Khedivial cortège. This is not the case. The policeman
                        stopped the hand cart belonging to M. Schuler in accordance with the terms
                        of a local by-law prohibiting the passage of hand-carts through Cherif
                        Pasha-street. It is presumed that the Berberee servant of Mr. Schuler, who
                        was trundling the handcart did not make it clear to the policeman that he
                        was merely going to a shop in the street itself, and the policeman therefore
                        naturally concluded that the man wanted to push the hand-cart through Cherif
                        Pasha-street and consequently forbade him, -rather forcibly, it must be
                        admitted.</p>

                    <p>The Foreign Office and Lord Cromer have withdrawn their prohibition of the
                        landing in England of the pigmies brought by Colonel Harrison from the Ituri

                    <p>It is the intention of Colonel Harrison to have the dwarfs conveyed to his
                        home, at Brandesburton Hull, near Hull. They will also go to Londesborough
                        Park, the country seat of the Earl and Countess of Londesbo- rough, and will
                        visit London and the principal provincial towns. Colonel Harrison has
                        promis- ed to take them back to their own country at the end of the summer.
                        He does not anticipate any difficulty with regard to their food. They have

                    <p>It is somewhat singular to hear at the same time that we receive the news
                        that all objection is withdrawn to the sending of Colonel Harrison's pigmies
                        to London, that the impresario of the miniature man who has been on

                        remove his charge from this country. The party were to have sailed on
                        Wednesday last; all was in order, passages booked to Syria, and passports
                        obtain- ed, when the Russian Consul intervened by direction of the Russian
                        Ambassador in Paris, and prevented the Prince from going.</p>
                    <p>Probably the intervention is on account of the little man being of Finnish
                        birth, but as he has been in the care of his present foster-mother for some
                        eleven years, during which time he has freely moved about the world,
                        probably there is some reason for the procedure which does not appear on the
                        surface.</p>
                    <p>The intervention of the British Consul has been sought, and for the present

                    <p>A grand vocal and instrumental concert was given by Professor Calise at the
                        New Khedivial Hotel on Sunday afternoon, and was attended by a large
                        audience which quite filled the room. The concert commenced with a Menuet du
                        XVIII. Siecle performed on two pianofortes by four players, Miles A. Boccia,
                        G. Dedes, B. Boccia, and G. Boccia. The performance was given with great
                        spirit and in excellent time. A tenor solo Mallinata, by Leoncavallo,
                        followed, sung by Mr. J. Calleja, whose powerful voice required a larger
                        space in which to give it full effect, its musical qualities quite failing
                        to show in this piece. Mme P. Calzetti sang the Cavatina I due Foscari by
                        Verdi and Gioconda (Suicidio) by Ponchinelli. In both these pieces her
                        flexible voice was heard to great advantage. She also sang the duet in the
                        grand finale to the second act of Verdi’s Aida with Mr. J. Calleja, a long
                        and trying performance that severely tested both of the voices, and in which
                        that of the tenor showed to greater advantage than in his solo (for which,
                        however, we omitted to say he received an encore). Mile G. Capozzi sang a
                        soprano air from Cavalleria Rusticana with great effect and an air from
                        Tosca by Puccini (Vissi d'arte). She has a sympathetic voice of great
                        freshness. Mr. J. Guittieres Pegna sang 2da da Mattinata by Tosti and Mr. L.
                        Bracha Tardi (mélodie) by Densa.</p>
                    <p>The instrumental part of the concert was greatly appreciated. In addition to
                        the double pianoforte duet which opened the concert and to which we have
                        alluded. M. A. Tempe- rino and Mlle Bonomi played two duets, for violin and
                        pianoforte one a Sympho- nic concertante by Mozart, the other Con- oerto No.
                        1 op. 16 by Beriot. Both pieces were well executed and were greatly
                        applauded. The second encore of the afternoon was gained by a brilliant
                        pianoforte solo, Scherzo, by Chopin, executed by Mlle M. Gianny. The concert
                        was a great and deserved success, reflecting the highest credit upon
                        Professor Calise.</p>

                    <p>L’Affaire Stagni-Salinas</p>
                    <p>(Arret du S mai. — Suite et fin)</p>
                    <p>Il est nécessaire de distinguer (Allig. Les bourses de valeurs) entre les
                        bourses oh les in- térêts des valeurs sont cotés en dedans et celles où ils
                        sont comptés en dehors ou à part.</p>
                    <p>Dans lea premières (Paris, Londres, Rome, Genève, Lisbonne, Milan, Gênes,
                        Alexan- drie etc.) les intérêts courus sont compris dans les cours. Ainsi la
                        personne qui schète comp- tant des titres de rente française 3% au début de
                        Mars, c.a.d. un mois avant l’échéance du coupon trimestriel d’Avril, n’a
                        pas, en plus du prix payé, à rembourser l’intérêt couru en janvier et en
                        février. Il en a été tenu compte dans la fixation des cours. On peut
                        conclure que toutes choses égales d’ailleurs et toute autre influence
                        cessant de s’exercer sur la fixation des cours, le prix d’une valeur, au
                        moment de l’échéance, devra être supérieur du montant du coupon, au cours de
                        cette valeur au lendemain de l’é- chéance précédente.</p>
                    <p>Dans les bourses germaniques, aux usages desquelles Stagni figli voudraient
                        soumettre l’opération dont s’agit, les explications précé- dentes ne
                        a’appliquent point. A Berlin, les in- térêts sont calculés en dehors,
                        e’est-a-dire que la valour du coupon courant n'entre pas dans la fixation du
                        cours. L'acheteur en rembourse, à part, la valeur qu’il atteint au jour de
                        la livraison.</p>
                    <p>Attendu cependant qu'il s’agit d’une vente de titres d’une société Egyptienne
                        dont le siège est au Caire, d’une affaire traitée en Egypte, puer i
                        tatremise d’un courtier de ls place d’Alex- andrie, paiement en Egypte,
                        livraison en Egypte de titres régulièrement cotés en Egypte (quoi- qu’en
                        pu?sent dire Stagni figli) comme il est établi psr les 17 bulletins
                        hebdomadaires de /?/iation des courtiers on valeurs d'Alex- ndrie, produits
                        par les parties ;</p>
                    <p>Que dans ces conditions on ne saurait ad- mettre que, par le seul fait que
                        l’émission des obligations Kéneh-Assouan a été faite à Berlin, et parce que
                        les titres vendus se trouvaient à Berlin, l’opération dont s'agit dût être
                        sou- mise aux usages et aux règles de la Bourse de Berlin, sans une
                        déclaration formelle de la part des vendeurs; </p>
                    <p>Que d’ailleurs ces titres sont vendus à la Bourse d‘Alexandrie d’après les
                        usages, cou- pons compris. Il résulte d’une lettre du Prési- dent de
                        l’association des courtiers que le 23 novembre 1902 il a été vendu £ 1000
                        obliga- tions Kéneh à 95 3/4 coup. n° 17 attaché, jouissance ler juillet
                        1902 ; et d’une déclara- tion de l'Anglo-Egyptian Bank, qu’à la date du 25
                        novembre 1903, la même Banque a vendu, par l’entremise de la maison de
                        courtage Reid &amp;Barnard des obligations Kéneh à 95 3/4, coupon du ler
                        janvier attaché.</p>
                    <p>Que l’on s'expliquerait encore l'insistance de la part de Stagni figli
                        d’invoquer les usages et les règles de Berlin, si l’on prouvait en même
                        temps que le prix convenu de 97 % repré sentait le cours à Berlin au moment
                        de l’opéra- tion et que c’était, par conséquent, ce cours qui aurait
                        déterminé les parties à fixer leur prix; mais que tel n’est pas le cas,
                        puisqu’il résulte de la seu e production faite par Stagni figli,
                        relativement aux cours de Berlin, que les oblige- ions Kéneh-Assouan n’ont
                        pas été cotées du tout à Berlin pendant tout le mois de juin 1903, et
                        qu’elles ont atteint le cours de 96 au 9 juillet, cours qui pourrait
                        s’expliquer peut- être par la vente Stagni, laquelle comprenait a moitié
                        environ de toute l’émission, qui était ainsi enlevée à la place de
                        Berlin.</p>
                    <p>Qu’il n’est pas établi que les titres en ques- tion aient jamais attaint, à
                        Berlin, le cours de 97 ex.</p>
                    <p>Que si, par conséquent, le prix de 97 était indépendant de tout cours coté à
                        Berlin, "et ne répondait à aucun cours de Bourse, mais était exigé par
                        Stagni figli d’après des consi- dérations personnelles et des exigences pro-
                        pres", comme ils allèguent, les usages de Berlin n’avaient que fairs dans la
                        décision de l’affaire, et la nécessité de s’expliquer sur le coupon
                        s'imposait davantage, alors surtout que la cote de la place d’Alexandrie
                        n’était que de 95, d'après le bulletin hebdomadaire de l'as- sociation des
                        courtiers du 26 join 1903, soit de 4 jours avant l’opération.</p>
                    <p>Attendu que Stagni figli soutiennent qu’en tous cas les tratelli Salinas
                        savaient qu'ils ne voulaient pas vendre au-dessous de 97 ex, puisqn’à deux
                        reprises ils s’étaient chargés de la vente de ces titres, et que le fait
                        bien signi- ficatif qu’à toute époque de l’année le prix était toujours le
                        même de 97, démontrerait clairement que le coupon était toujours exclu;</p>
                    <p>Qu’il est à remarquer que des pourparlers avaient eu lieu en novembre 1902,
                        alors que l’échéance du coupon approchait et que le prix à Alexandrie était
                        de 95 3/4 et à Berlin de 94,90 ce qui résulte d’une lettre en date du 21
                        novembre 1902 de Robert Warshauer &amp;Cie, banquiers à Berlin, qui ont fait
                        partie du syndicat du chemin de fer Kéneh-Assouan, lesquels expliquent que
                        ces obligations étaient traitées à 94 et qu'elles avaient atteint le cours
                        de 94,90 à cause d'un petit achat, mais que ces cours s’entendaient pour das
                        titres livrables à Berlin, et munis du timbre alle- mand; que dans ces
                        conditions il est difficile d'admettre que le prix de 97 fut ex-coupon. que
                        l’autre tentative de vente avait eu lieu en été 1901, expression assez
                        vague, qui permet de supposer que l’on traitait avant l’échéance du coupon
                        du ler juillet 1901; qu’en tous cas on ignore les cours avant et après le
                        détache- ment du coupon.</p>
                    <p>Attendu, d’autre part, que, quand mâme Stagni figli auraient déclaré à
                        Salinas qu'ils ne voulaient pas vendre au-dessons du prix de revient — 96
                        8/4 — il aurait fallu que Salinas aient eu aussi connaissance de la data
                        d’acqni- sition dee titres, des conditions établies quans au coupon et au
                        taux d’émission, et /?/</p>
