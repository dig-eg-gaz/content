                    <p>ENGLAND AND GERMANY.</p>
                    <p>The report of Prince von Bulow's speech in the Reichstag last week, which has
                        arrived by the last mail, shows that it was as significant as that delivered
                        by the Kaiser a few days previously. The German Chancellow professes to
                        desire "a return to that unhappily interrupted reciprocal understanding on
                        the part of the two great nations of kindred civilisation." And in the same
                        breath he complains of the existence in England of a "profound dislike"
                        towards Germany "which characterises public opinion." Substituting the word
                        "distinct" for the word "dislike," we are afraid that the truth of the
                        impeachment must be admitted. And we have no hesitation in saying that the
                        responsibility for it rests in a very large degree upon the shoulders of
                        Prince von Bulow himself. If a collection of his official speeches were
                        made, it would be impossible, we believe, to extract from them a single
                        passage which was friendly or sympathetic to our country, while the bitter,
                        mordant sayings in which the Chancellor has permitted himself to indulge
                        have done much to estrange the two nations and exacerbate whatever hostile
                        feeling might be latent. Every country has it ows standard of Parliamentary
                        manners and customs, and it is conceivable to imagine an English Premier or
                        Secretary for Foreign Affairs making such references to a friendly Power as
                        Prince von Bulow has accustomed us to. Nor is the matter improved by the
                        child-like transparency of the speaker's motive. Germany has got to be
                        goaded into the creation of an enormous Navy, as to the future use of which
                        there is very little disguise. To make public opinion tolerant of the
                        sacrifice which this expenditure entails it is necessary that a bugbear
                        should be created in chape of an England, hostile and aggressive, which is
                        longing forcibly to stifle the maritime ambitions of Germany and rob her of
                        her colonies. The picture is so utterly ludicrous to all Englishmen that it
                        is almost impossible to believe that in an educated and cultivated country
                        like Germany it is universally accepted. But there can, unhappily, be no
                        dispute as to the truth of the fact. Individual Germans who have lived in
                        England may admit that our foreign policy is guided by principles which
                        trench pusillanimity where the Great Powers are concerned, and that no
                        responsible British statesman would desire or even dare to initiate an
                        aggressive policy in foreign affairs. But the citizens of Germany, from the
                        highest to the lowest, have been taught otherwise, and it seems impossible
                        to disabuse them.</p>
                    <p>For the continuance of this feeling Prince von Bulow, we must repeat, is
                        largely responsible. It is only too true that the Kaiser himself from the
                        days of the Kruger telegram downwards, has been the source of intermittent
                        outbursts of German Chauvinism directed against us. But the Kaiser's
                        ebullitions stand on a different footing from the calculated, deliberate
                        utterances of his Chancellor. The Emperor William is a born rhetorician, who
                        can never realise that Soverreigns live in a whispering gallery. In
                        addressing his troops, in presiding at festal gatherings, or at the
                        unveiling of national monuments, he is apt to deliver himself in a strain of
                        ardent patriotism which may be suitable enough for the time and place, but
                        which wears a very different aspect when it appears in black and white the
                        next day. If only His Imperial Majesty could be induced to follow the
                        example of his uncle, King Edward, the prospects of a restored good feeling
                        between the two Empires would be appreciably increased. It is, indeed, very
                        difficult, if not impossible, to discover where the Germans find the
                        provocation against ourselves which makes an attack upon Great Britain the
                        most popular of all subjects in the Fatherland. We are fully aware that our
                        manners are not ingratiating, and that when abroad we do not always endear
                        ourselves to our involuntary hosts. But this is hardly sufficient to account
                        for the outburst of malignant hatred to which the almost universal voice of
                        Germany gave vent during the South African war. As a nation we would gladly
                        be on the best of terms with what is undoubtedly the greatest Power on the
                        Continent of Europe to-day ; nor need our commercial and colonial rivalry be
                        any bar. But there must be some reciprocity, and so long as the sixty
                        millions who populate Germany are indoctrinated by their statesmen and by
                        their intellectual and religious teachers with an utterly erroneous
                        impression of British lesigns and British conduct, we are afraid that
                        "misunderstandings" will continue to flourish.</p>
                    <p>Nor can it be said that the latest German shipbuilding programme has done
                        anything to restore confidence between us. In the statement of British
                        Admiralty policy issued a few days ago the reduction in our Naval Estimates
                        for the coming year was made contingent on the abstention of foreign Powers
                        from making unforeseen developments in their shipbuilding programmes. We
                        have carefully Prince von Bulow's speech for any reference to this new
                        departure, and we have searched in vain. Had there been any genuine desire
                        on the part of the German Government to limit their naval expenditure to the
                        necessities of national defence and colonial policy, the olive branch would
                        at least have received some notice. But the men who guide the destinies of
                        Germany are tenacious and ambitious. They do not intend to rest until they
                        have created a Navy which, in their judgement, will be a rival for the
                        British Fleet. They will not be deflected a single inch from their path, and
                        the suggestions to come to some sort of mutual agreement over naval
                        expenditure is contemptuously rejected ; a fact of which we trust that our
                        Admiralty will take careful note. The Admiral of the Atlantic has not abated
                        a job of his ambitions, even though the Navies of his cousin, the Admiral of
                        the Pacific, are "sunk beneath the watery floor." There is no need to ask
                        ourselves against whom the German Fleet is intended ; the Germans themselves
                        make no secret of it, and those who would attempt to blind public opinion in
                        England are only playing into the hands of a Power to whose rulers scruples
                        in matter of international policy are unknown.</p>

                    <p>Berlin, December 14.</p>
                    <p>Replying to Herr Babel in the Reichstag, Prince von Bulow accused the
                        democratic Socialists of stirring up English distrust. He denied that
                        Germany had resolved in 1905 to declare war against England. Germany only
                        wants the same rights of commerce and of navigation as other nations.</p>

                    <p>The Yellow Book referring to Morocco bears out the critical position which
                        existed last June when France was hesitating to agree to the Conference.
                        Count von Bulow, speaking to the French Ambassador, deprecated delay, urging
                        him not to linger on the brink of a precipice, if not an abyss. The
                        remainder of the Yellow Book records difficult negotiations culminating in
                        the formation of the programme for the Conference.</p>

                    <head>M. LOREDAN'S PIANO RECITAL</head>
                    <p>A Cairo correspondent writes : — M. Pierre Loredan is, on the whole, to be
                        congratulated on the success of his recital, for the odds were against him.
                        He was provided with an exceedingly bad piano, the treble of which had no
                        tone at all, and the attendance was sparse, and inclined to be talkative. I
                        may mention as glaring examples of this vice three ladies in the sixth, row
                        on the right and two ladies in the third row on the left (neither group
                        English or French). who, by incessant conversation, did their best to draw
                        public attention from the pianist to themselves. They could not have
                        achieved this result by other means. I hope they will read these lines. The
                        upper half of the programme was, as will be seen, of a very high standard ;
                        but, like Nebuchadnezzar's image, it degenerated into brass, iron, and
                        common clay. M. Loredan has a fine technique, and shows to most advantage in
                        the more complicated and difficult passages ; his touch is at times a little
                        unsympathetic, but much may be excused one whose instrument is inexcusable.
                        While his rendering of Beethoven left me cold, I cannot but admire most
                        heartily 8carlatti’s Pastoral, as treated by him and the three choices from
                        Chopin, though well worn, were hardly less enjoyable. The Sinding Printemps,
                        a piece which should be reserved for great growing girls, was a failure, La
                        Filense, pretty and delicately rendered. Il Tremolo is nothing more or leas
                        than a cake-walk time, technically difficult but musically impossible; it is
                        a pity that such fire works should be included in any programme. I trust M.
                        Pierre Loredan will see his way to giving another recital under less adverse
                        circumstances: so accomplished a pianist deserves more encouragement than he
                        has, so far, met with.</p>

                        <p>A circular has been issued by the chairman and hon. secretary of the new
                            British Club at Alexandria stating that the committee. having carefully
                            examined the estimates for fitting up the club, finds the funds now
                            available are not sufficient to furnish the place as comfortably as
                            could be desired. In fact, unless more money is forthcoming (they say)
                            two nr three rooms must be left unfurnished. A further sum of £250 is
                            required, and the oommittee feels justified, in view of the low figure
                            at which the annual subscription has been fixed, in appealing to members
                            for donations to the capital fund, and is confident that this appeal
                            will meet with a generous response. Donations can be sent to the hon.
                            sec., to the hon. treas., Mr. P. W. Carver, or to any member of the

                    <head>THE RECENT DISTURBANCES. ATTITUDE OF NATIVES.</head>
                    <p>Alexandria has not been troubled by any fresh disorders, and the attitude of
                        the native population is officially declared to be very tranquil.</p>
                    <p>The upper-class natives have expressed a keen desire to assist the
                        authorities in preventing an outbreak on the part of the populace. Many of
                        them have been voluntarily enrolled as special constables, and have
                        under-taken that, if any outburst of disorder should break out in' their
                        quarters of the city, they will exert themselves to the utmost to check
                        it.</p>
                    <p>The Alexandria City Police have not discovered that the riot on Sunday is in
                        any way to be attributed to premeditation. It is considered that had not the
                        Greek shot the Arab no disturbance would have broken out on that day.</p>
                    <p>Every precaution has been taken by the authorities in case of a future
                        outbreak.</p>
                    <p>All the gunsmith's shops still remain closed.</p>
                    <p>The Greeks who have been arrested in connection with the riot are local
                        subjects and will therefore be dealt with by the Egyptian authorities.</p>
                    <p>The general opinion in official circles is that the Capitulations ware a
                        powerful contributory cause, for the natives recognise that there is one law
                        for the Europeans and another for the Egyptians, and so wherever a native is
                        injured there is always a predisposition for his compatriots to taka up his
                        cause on the spot. Egyptians generally appear to regard the special
                        privileges accorded to Europeans with a growing disfavor, which is often
                        justifiable.</p>
                    <p>It is pointed out that the ferocity of the mob on Sunday has been much
                        exaggerated by timorous Europeans, for, if the crowd had been as evilly
                        disposed as has been made out, how is it that not a single European was
                        killed outright during the disturbance?.</p>
                    <p>COMPENSATION CLAIMS.</p>
                    <p>The estimate of the damage done to the property of Hellenic subjects during
                        the disturbance has been sent in to the authorities of the Alexandria
                        Gouvernorat by M. Scotidis, the Hellenic Consul General. It amounts to
                        £2,000.</p>
                    <p>The official valuation of the damages, which was undertaken by an engineer of
                        the Alexandria Gouvernorat by order of the Parquet, amounts to the total sum
                        of £50. The discrepancy is significant.</p>
                    <p>DEMONSTRATION STOPPED.</p>
                    <p>A number of Europeans had intended to organise a procession through the city
                        on Sunday next, headed by a band, as a demonstration against the natives. As
                        this would have been a most likely way to provoke another outburst the
                        police authorities wisely decided not to allow such a foolish proceeding,
                        and strict orders have been issued that no such procession is to take place.
                        Any similar demonstration will also be prevented by the police in the
                        interest of public security.</p>

                    <head>‘‘TOSCA” AT THE ZIZINIA. A SPLENDID PERFORMANCE.</head>
                    <p>In pronouncing last night’s performance of La Tosca as one of the best
                        productions ever staged at this theatre, we believe we are voicing the
                        unanimous verdict of a warm and crowded house. The intense and harrowing
                        pathos which pervades Sardon's drama and, in sparcely less degree, Puccini's
                        opera, was carried home to yesterday’s audience in a combination of
                        rapturous music and tragic. acting, rising at its climax in the second act
                        to heart-rending and tear-starting emotion. The first act was very well
                        executed so far as the leading parts were concerned. Signa.Bellincioni, in
                        the title ro1e. was in her best voice. The first solo of Sig. José Palest,
                        as the artist Cava-radossi, and his subsequent duet with the diva, were
                        cordially received, and with good reason. Sig. Giovanni Polese made at once
                        a telling impression in his impersonation of Scarpia, the gentlemanly
                        villain par excellence. Sig. G. E. Gianoli put in useful work as the
                        Sagrestano. The boys’ chorus was too hurried and confused, but Sig. Zuccani
                        eventually brought them well together.</p>
                    <p>To Act II. enough admiration cannot be given; suffice it to say that from
                        beginning to end it was perfect Sig. Polese’s 8carpia was as active as it
                        was dignified ; he used his voice with much fluency, keeping well within its
                        limitations. Sig. Palet’s small share in this act was skilfully and
                        fervently executed. But the honours, of course, go to Signa. Bellincioni,
                        who, has seldom displayed the wealth of her resources to better advantage.
                        Hsr sweet, flex-ible voice, her gracefulness. her striking beauty, and her
                        magnificent dramatic powers must have stamped an indelible image on the
                        memories of her many admirers, who were roused to tumultuous enthusiasm. The
                        sustained and powerful passages with Scarpia. the charmingly plaintive solo,
                        and the tragic finale were truly great moments than which we do not wish to
                        see anything finer. 8mall wonder that the house rose at her and demanded
                        calls innumerable, both of her, Sig. Polese, and Maestro Zuccani. Signa.
                        Bellincioni followed up her triumph throughout Act III., and Sig. Palet's
                        rendering of the famous aria marked a culminating point of excellence.
                        Moreover, the orchestre in this, as in the preceding sets, showed a fine
                        feeling of ensemble, so that the whole performance leaves ns in a spirit of
                        gratitude with a "lively sense of pleasures to come."</p>

                        by which the old pupils of the School of Law have just sought to perpetuate
                        the memory of their old Principal, M. Testoud. It appears that in response
                        to a general feeling among the old students that some permanent memorial of
                        the late Principal was desirable, a committee was formed and subscriptions
                        were collected. It was decided that the memorial should take the form of a
                        life-sized photograph, handsomely framed, to be offered to the Ministry for
                        exhibition in the school. Tbe work hss been executed and was handed over to

                        Bey Sarwat, and Mo-hamed Bey Delavor, as delegates of the old scholars. His

                        of the motives which had prompted it, and has given orders for the portrait
                        to be placed in the salle de reunion of the School.</p>
                    <p>The portrait is about life size and is a good likeness of the deceased
                        jurist. It is mounted in a massive and handsome mahogany frame, fixed on an

                        creditable to its executant, Mohamed Saleh Suleiman. The frame and easel are
                        mounted with arabesques in silver, and on the ledge of the easel is
                        inscribed in silver fret-work the quotation from the Koran "Iuna hâzihi

                    <p>(From our Beyrout Correspondent.)</p>
                    <p>*II.</p>
                    <p>At Caiffa the stone pier is built with fair rapidity. The ultimate length of
                        the pier is to be 800 metres, and it is said that the sea bed is to be
                        dredged so as to allow of steamers coming alongside to discharge right on
                        the quay. The economy resulting therefrom would be very considerable as all
                        future shipments of material-and there remain about two-thirds to be
                        constructed of the grand line to Mecca-will be transported from Caiffa by
                        the railway's own trains, instead of, as heretofore, from Beyrout by the
                        French line, which has already made no small profit on the transport of
                        material from Beyrout to Damascus. In other words, the grand line is
                        destined soon to become self-supporting. In the meantime, and until the pier
                        is completed and ready to receive the material direct from steamer's tackle,
                        large lights of considerable capacity, that have lately been constructed
                        here, will enable the Commission at Caiffa to receive the materal fairly
                        expeditiously, and I have heard that a steam tug is already in use there.
                        These facilities of discharge will induce shipowners to charge lower
                        freights, and there is no little economy in that, considering the nature of
                        the cargo. But the Sultan's vigilance is manifesting itself in every
                        direction. Turkish steamers of the State-subsidised Makhsoussé Line are said
                        to be now transporting part of the railway material, and I saw one the other
                        day discharging a fairly large quantity at Beyrout.</p>
                    <p>After the building of the pier the sea retreated and is still doing so, and
                        about 25 metres have thus been gained. The pier consists at present of large
                        unhewn boulders which are being fast brought down by the railway from a
                        quarry near by. Later on no doubt masonry work will be introduced to finish
                        up the pier destined to shelter a harbour, to which the natural
                        configuration of the coast gives such a valuable character, and to serve as
                        a quay for loading and discharging. </p>
                    <p>The Hamidieh-Hedjaz Railway is of the narrow gauge type. It consists of the
                        grand line, which starts from Damascus and is to end at Mecca, and of the
                        Caiffa Dera branch. The latter in now completed. In fact it was to be
                        inaugurated on the anniversary of the Sultan's accession, but the
                        construction of some of the larger bridges on the Yermook having been
                        retarded, through the strength of the current sweeping away part of the
                        initial foundation work that seems to have been not very solidly made, and
                        thus necessitating the renewal of the work amidst great difficulties, the
                        principal of which is fever, which is so rife in those parts in summer, and
                        leads to such a dearth of manual labour,-the inauguration was postponed till
                        His Majesty's birthday in November.</p>
                    <p>The Caiffa-Dera branch is x66 kilometres long. The Hedjaz Railway has bought
                        up from the English company about 8 kilometres of rail already laid, and a
                        few kilometres also of embankment, together with some accessory material.
                        The Caiffa-Dera line crosses a great part of the fertile plain of Ma j
                        Ibn'Amir (Plain of Jezreol), then turns northwards across the Jordan valley,
                        towards Lake Tiberias (Bahr Tabaraya) close to the southern border of which
                        it crosses the sinuosities of the Yermok, follows to a certain extent the
                        direction of that river, then stretches southwards to Dera. The stations
                        between Halffa and Dera number thirteen and are the following :--Shumariyeh,
                        scarcely a hamlet of a few poor huts Tel Esh Shemam, Afoulé, Shutta (Beth
                        Shitta), Beysan (Scythopolis, Bethshean), Jisr El Mejameh Semakh (Hippos),
                        near the southern bank of the lake, El Hammi, on the Yermuk, El Konayé, Wady
                        El Kelayt, Way Esh Shellaré, Zeizun, El Mezeirib, and finally Dera (Edrei or
                        Adraa). The Caiffa or Haiffa-Dera branch comprises several stone bridges
                        some of which rest on five or six arches of heavy masonry, and of six iron
                        bridges six of which cross the sinuosities of the Yermuk three times within
                        three kilometres. Four of those iron bridges are 110 metres long each, and
                        two are 50 metres long each.</p>
                    <p>Of the above mentioned stations Beysan is the most important, while several
                        of the rest, such as Shumariyeh, Tel Esh Shemam, and Jisr El Mejameh, lie in
                        spots where there are hardly any dwellings, although Jisr El Mejameh is a
                        rather important grain centre, or rather fair.</p>
                    <p>It is said that a French director has lately been appointed for the
                        exploitation of the Haiffa-Deffa section, and this augurs well for the
                        railway, for the transport will certainly be cheap, and what is needed only
                        is adequate management that will inspire public confidence. A provincial
                        tariff has already been established at 20 paras per ton per kilometre and it
                        is said that it is to be ultimately reduced to even 10 paras. The
                        first-class carriages are said to be very well fitted up and quite
                        comfortable. In both Haiffa and Dera two important workshops have been
                        established with full mechanical installation, and two large sheds for
                        locomotives, etc., close to the stations, which are fairly large. Moreover
                        two large buildings have been raised to provide lodging for the permanent
                        workmen and employés, besides a large warehouse and an open enclosure of no
                        small dimensions, for the reception and temporary storing of goods.</p>
                    <p>Of the grand line-the Arabic term for the trunk line-523 kilometres have
                        already been completed, so that with the Haiffa-Dera branch, we have already
                        689 kilometres of railroad practically ready for traffic. The railroad
                        actually lies beyond Maan at Batn El Ghout, a place of forbidding natural
                        features, meriting well the apt Arabic appellation which means the Belly of
                        the Ghoul or Monster. From Batn El Ghoul embankment works have been pushed
                        as far as Kelaat El Medawara, constituting a length of about 45 kilometres,
                        while the survey of the further stretch from Kelaat El Medawara to Dhat El
                        Haj has been entrusted to two engineering corps called the 17th and 18th, at
                        whose disposal a sufficient number of soldiers has been put both for
                        watching the survey corps and holping in the earthworks. This distance
                        between Kelaat El Medawara and Dhat El Haj is about 33 kilometres. It is
                        expected that after the erection of the bridges in Batn El Ghoul, the train
                        will be able, in less than a month, to run to Kelat El Medawara and
                        back.</p>
                    <p>The length of the line between Damascus and Dera is 116 kilometres, with ten
                        intermediate stations, yiz., Khadem Esh Sherif, El Kisweh, Deir Ali, El
                        Mismiyeh, Jehab, Khubeb, Mahje, Shakra, Ezra (Zoroa), Kharbet El Karaly. It
                        almost touches the French line at Kisweh, and then runs in an irregular
                        parallel alongside the latter until it joins the Haiffa branch at Dera.
                        Curously enough the French line is almost identical with Derb El Jaj, the
                        old pilgrim route, and already comprises the following fourteen stations :
                        Nassib, Mifraka (Kelaat El Mefraak), Kharbet Es Samra, Zerka (Kelaat Ez
                        Zarka), Amman (Rabbath Ammon Philadelphia), Kasr (Kasr El Ala), Leben,
                        Djira, Dekaa, Ez Zebib, Katraneh, El Khassa (Kalat El Hassi), Jeroof Ed
                        Derwish, Aneiza.</p>
                    <p>I have already said that the work of survey and embankment from Kelaat El
                        Medawara to Dhat El Haj has already been taken in hand and after its
                        completion the Arabian line proper may be said to have begun for Dhat El Haj
                        lies at the extremity of Al Hisma, near the northern limit of Al Hedjaz. In
                        fact the third of the grand line is practically achieved, and there is every
                        reason to believe that the consummation of this grandiose project is not
                        afar off. While the Sultan is there to direct and watch, the work will
                        progress and continue. What has already been accomplished may be considered
                        as an earnest of the crowning of the gigantic enterprise. On the Haiffa-Dera
                        branch, and that part of the grand line already completed, there are not
                        less than 1,965 bridges and culverts, large and small, and as already
                        mentioned, out of those bridges there are six iron ones, four of which are
                        110 metres long each and two of 50 metres length each, while on the grand
                        line there is so far only one iron bridge 15 metres long. But on the grand
                        line there are 8 tunnels the length of which varies between 40 and 227
                        metres each. Such is the scheme that has ben so diligently and artfully
                        elaborated by the Sultan Abdul Hamid, to be at the same time the eblem and
                        the link of Pan-Islamism. The line is not yet halfway from the sacred towns
                        and behold it has already drawn together in spirit the Moslem world. Nubians
                        and Somali, Moors and Egyptians, and indeed the larger and most populated
                        half of Africa, Arabia, Persia, and Turkey, and the Moslems of India that
                        are scattered all over the great Empire, and represent the most advanced and
                        intellectual portion of its population, Moslems from Southern and Central
                        China, from Sumatra, Borneo and Celebes, and the smaller Malay group,
                        Bashores from the North East of European Russia, Kirghiz, Turcomans and
                        Tartars-all those people illumined by the monotheistic creed, but who have
                        hitherto existed as scattered units of potential force, have been brought
                        together by the Sultan Abdul Hamid into one homogeneous mass of spiritual
                        force ; and now the greatest of European Powers, in its dreams of future
                        conquests, will have to reckon with this immense and new solidarity of Islam
                        as one of the deadliest weapons of the Sultan of Turkey, who seems likely to
                        remain, while Islam, exists, the temporal and spiritual head thereof.</p>

                    <head>EGYPT'S PROSPERITY IRRIGATION AND RENTAL VALUES</head>
                    <p>It is confidently expected that for an expenditure of some 6 1/2 millions
                        (including the cost of the reservoir works), by the end of the year 1908,
                        the annual rental value of the lands affected in Middle Egypt should be
                        increased by L.E. 2,637,000, and its sale value by L.E. 26,570,000. In
                        addition, the Government will gain, in the shape of increased revenue from
                        the converted lands, an annual sum of L.E. 226,500, and also largely, though
                        indirectly, by the increased wealth of the country, and the consequent
                        increase in the Railway and Customs receipt. It must be admitted that these
                        results, if realised, will be remarkables and there is every reason to be
                        confident that they will be realised in full. Everything seems to promise
                        that, in the course of the next decade, Middle Egypt will approach the
                        conditions of an agricultural paradise, more nearly than any other spot upon
                        the world's surface.</p>
                    <p>As an example of the enormous benefits derived from the Middle Egypt
                        Conversion Works, the cotton crop alone of the Minieh basins may be taken.
                        Out of a total converted area of 100,000 feddans, an area of 49,700 was
                        planted with cotton : this must have been worth from L.E. 600,000 to L.E.
                        700,000 or practically the total cost of the works at L.E. 7 per feddan
                        converted.</p>
                    <p>Up to the end of last year 205,000 feddans have been converted at a cost of
                        L.E. 1,292,770, or adding for land not paid for and other contingencies,
                        L.E. 1,400,000.</p>

                    <p>In 1901 Birch Pasha commenced his energetic measure for the improvement of
                        the estates and continued them in 1902 and 1903, spending altogether a sum
                        of L.E. 52,829. In 1902 the Assiout Barrage was completed and used for the
                        first time during the flood of that year. The result has been an increase of
                        95% in the annual rental, and a profit of L.E. 882,996 in the past four
                        years in comparison with the year 1901. It is interesting to note that,
                        notwithstanding this very high increase in rents, the arrears due from the
                        tenants have decreased from L.E. 13,216 in 1899 to L.E. 898 in 1903, showing
                        that the tenants can well afford to pay the enhanced rents.</p>

                    <p>In Lower Egypt great benefits have resulted in addition to the above, but it

                        place at Brookwood cemetery on Tuesday, last week. The proceedings were of a
                        simple character and were attended only by relatives of the deceased and two
                        or three intimate friends, but a service held earlier in the day at St.

                        memory. The funeral cortège started from Sir Clinton's residence in Queen
                        Anne's-gate, shortly after ten o'clock. The oaken coffin, covered with
                        floral emblems, bore the simple inscription: "Clinton Edward Dawkins. Born
                        Nov. 2, 1859. Died Dec. 2, 1905."</p>

                    <head>EGYPT EXPLORATION FUND</head>
                    <p>The "Atheneum" remarks:-- "The general meeting of the Egypt Exploration Fund
                        last month did not pass off without some significant incidents. Although the
                        Chairman, Sir John Evans, hoped in his address that the separation from
                        Prof. Petrie was only temporary, and that the Fund would soon find itself
                        again in a position to retain his services, Prof. Petrie himself seemed to
                        insist on regarding it as permanent, and symbolically left the platform to
                        seat himself among the audience. Before the meeting was over, also, a
                        telegram from the American Committee was received, to the effect that they
                        resigned in a body-a move which is perhaps explained by an article in the
                        current "Biblia" in which Dr. Winslow, the former secretary of the Fund in
                        America calls upon all true Americans, until they can start an Exploration
                        society on their own account to subscribe to Prof. Petrie's new venture, the
                        Egyptian Research Account, rather than to the Fund over which Sir John Evans
                        has hitherto presided. The folly of crying peace when there is no peace was
                        never more dramatically illustrated.</p>
                    <p>Apart from this, however, the Fund's accounts show that its affairs are by no
                        means in a flourishing condition, and the successor of Sir John Evans-whose
                        retirement from the presidency on account of age is a real loss-will have to
                        be a strong man if matters are not to grow worse. There is again a large
                        increase of expenditure in excess of income, and although the English
                        subscriptions keep up fairly, the American, which four years ago exceeded
                        them in amount, may henceforth be taken as a negligible quantity. Moreover,
                        the accounts show that, while one of the excavators employed by the Fund was
                        in receipt of a regular salary, the others were content with their expenses
                        only ; and it is at least doubtful whether explorers at once so zealous and
                        so disinterested will be found in future. The fact is that the Fund has been
                        suffering for some time past at once from divided counsels and from the
                        frame of mind which the Scotch call "sinning one's mercies." The recent
                        expeditions to Ahnas and Sinai have produced, in spite of much blowing of
                        trumpets, no results at all commensurate with the money expended on them,
                        while more solid work has been neglected, and the unexampled opportunity
                        afforded by the large American subscriptions and the simultaneous windfalls
                        of special donations from England has been allowed to let slip. Yet it would
                        be a national calamity if the Fund's long and, on the whole, brilliant
                        career of work were now to be closed ; and it is to be hoped that the
                        subscribers will insist, first, on a thorough reorganisation of the
                        management, and, next, on a consistent and straightforward policy being laid
                        down and adhered to in future."</p>

                        under most of them, which are of great importance in a vocabulary, are often
                        more than doubled. There is no doubt that this edition will meet with more
                        favor than its predecessor and prove indispensable to officials, students,
                        residents and others who desire to acquire a perfect knowledge of modern and

                        examination a question of deep importance, is now before the Paris courts. A
                        Paris newspaper recently related a certain adventure of gallantry, the
                        central figure of which was stated to be a parish priest of the capital,
                        who, however, was not named. All the 66 parish priests of the city have now
                        instituted a common slander action, each with the object of vindicating
                        himself. Each claims £40 damages. The defendant raised the technical
                        objections on Thursday, but these were overruled, and the case is to be
                        tried on its merits on January 10.</p>

                        announced the early extension of the Somaliland railway system to the

                        the enterprise as a patriotic legacy to its successor. Patriotic it is, as
                        well as Imperialist in the highest and best sense of the term. The

                        recognise the application of "railway penetration" to the problem. But
                        Germany, Italy, and even Russia have latterly become our rivals to some
                        extent, and it would only be a shred of Abyssinian trade that would be left
                        for John Bull unless he took pattern from French enterprise. Happily, no
                        serious engineering difficulties present themselves between Berbera and Adis
                        Abeba. The intervening country is, for the most part, almost level, and
                        although it is considerably broken by water-courses, thee can be quickly
                        bridged during the dry season, when they are empty. As regards the
                        willingness of the Abyssinians to embark in the foreign commerce, the Negua
                        has afforded frequent avidence that he considers it would be of high
                        advantage to his country to join the comity of nations in that peaceful
                        manner.</p>

                        correspondents, but we wish, in a spirit of fair play to all, to

                   <div type="item"> <head>ALEXANDRIA SEA FRONTAGE.</head>
                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                    <p>Sir,-About a week since you published a letter from one of your
                        correspondents, in which after a certain amount of abuse of his
                        fellow-citizens, he changes the subject by calling attention to the sea
                        frontage on our new quay round the eastern harbour. Although his suggestions
                        do not seem to me very practical, the subject is one worthy of the careful
                        attention of our Municipality. There will soon be an opportunity of
                        beautifying our town, which if once lost will never be regained. We may hope
                        that the Government and the Municipality will be worthily represented in
                        this sea front by at least two imposing buildings, the Governor's and the
                        Municipal Palaces ; these and the new French Consulate will make a good
                        commencement, and I trust that some of our wealthy citizens will follow with
                        buildings worthy of so grand a site.</p>
                    <p>Your correspondent mentions the Pharos Fort or Fort Kaid Bey ; it stands in
                        commanding a position, that the sea frontage can never be complete until
                        some prominent object is erected on it. Unfortunately it can no more be the
                        Pharos ; the Eastern Harbour is a misnomer, it harbours nothing, except
                        perhaps the lobsters which one of your correspondents refers to ; and that
                        apparently in only a very insightly fashion. There is not even a much
                        required shelter for fishing craft.</p>
                    <p>There is, however, an object for which the Pharos Fort is admirably fitted,
                        and that is as a station for wireless telegraphy, an object which forms part
                        of the equipment of every modern port. The situation for this purpose is an
                        ideal one, and it is capable of combining the useful with the beautiful in
                        an exceptional manner. The signals for wireless telegraphy require to be
                        supported at a considerable height: this could be done on a handsome
                        crenelated tower about 150 feet high, with a projecting platform suitable
                        for the reception of all the telegraphic apparatus. A few years since the
                        citizens of Milan wished to erect a monument in memory of King Humbert, and
                        they decided, in stead of a statue, to revuild an ancient Lombard tower
                        forming part of the castle ; the tower was finished this year and has made a
                        noble ornament to the city. I do not suggest making a servile copy of it,
                        but something of the sort would be eminently suited to the purpose, and
                        would at the same time be a reminder of the ancient fort, whose wite it
                        would occupy.</p>
                    <p>I hope that this suggestion may be favorably received not only by many of my
                        fellow citizens, but also by the Government and Municipal authorities. I not
                        only put my idea at your disposal, pro bono publico, but if you think it
                        would further the object of this letter I will prepare a sketch of the tower
                        I would suggest, and will do this free, gratis, and for nothing, and without
                        any intention of making any claim, a la Cope Whitehouse, either
                        diplomatically or otherwise, whether my suggestion be carried out or not.-I
                        remain, Sir, etc.</p>

                    <p>The Fayoum Light Railway Company was taken over this year by Belgian
                        capitalists from the Fayoum Light Railway Company, the only native Egyptian
                        limited liability company. The report on the last year's working of this
                        company by Mr. Gunn, some extracts from which appeared in our issue
                        yesterday, contained some strong criticism on this company, which has been
                        endorsed by Sir William Garstin in his introduction to the recently issued
                        report of the Public Works Department. Sir William remarks :--</p>
                    <p>"It is very regrettable that this, the only purely Egyptian industrial
                        enterprise in Egypt, should give cause to such strictures. It is to be
                        feared that-in the interests of public safety-the Government will ere long
                        be obliged to intervene. No railway can be safely run in the manner that Mr.
                        Gunn reports this one to be run, and unless the company takes heed to its
                        way, and appoints a competent and sufficient working staff-at the same time
                        maintaining its rolling stock and permanent way in an efficient
                        state-dangerous accidents are almost certain to occur. The company has been
                        warned more than once, and I repeat that-unless the necessary changes are
                        carried out in the near future-the Government will be forced to intervene,
                        however reluctant it may be to take such a step."</p>

                    <p>The report upon the working of the Alexandria Market Company for the year
                        ended 31st October last shows that the gross revenue for the year amounted
                        to P.T. 249,774.4, as against P.T. 230,154.2 last year, an increase of P.T.
                        19,620.2. As to the expenditure, it has amounted to P.T. 73,178.3, as
                        against P.T. 95,652.8 last year, a reduction of P.T. 22,474.5. From the net
                        profit of the year under review, which is P.T. 176,713.6, the directors
                        propose to pay a dividend of 5%, which will absorb P.T. 146,250, to pay off
                        P.T. 3,035 for bad debts, and to pass the balance of P.T. 27,428.6 to
                        reserve account towards reduction of the construction account. The directors
                        place on record their sense of deep regret at the loss they have sustained
                        by the death of their colleague, Mr. Anton Orel, who had been a director of
                        the company for the last fourteen years. The directors propose to write off
                        the unclaimed dividend No. 25 = P.T. 117.1, which in terms of Par. 81 of the
                        artieles of association is forfeited for the benefit of the company.</p>

                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe. This
                        depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in January
                        may be a little warmer than Riviera, and possibly not so warm as Sicily, but
                        in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm than many
                        other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in the year,
                        for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to
                        go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily. Some will want to take into consideration
                        the number of days to be spent at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list
                        showing the time occupied on each of the various routes between Egypt and
                        the Continent of Europe. </p>
                    <p>They are as follows:--</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes--from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southampton,
                        London or Liverpool--occupy about 14 days. The short ones are as follows
                        :--</p>
                    <p>Port Said or Alexandria to Brindisi : 3 days</p>
                    <p>Alexandria to Messina : 3 days</p>
                    <p>Port Said or Alexandria to Marseilles : 5 days</p>
                    <p>Alexandria to Venice and Trieste : 4 days</p>
                    <p>Alexandria to Naples : 3 days</p>
                    <p>Port Said to Genoa : 5 days</p>
                    <p>Port Said to Naples : 4 days</p>
                    <p>Alexandria to Constantinople : 4 days</p>
                    <p>Alexandria to Piraeus : 2 days</p>
                    <p>Port Said to Gibraltar : 7 days</p>
                    <p>The steamers, of the P. and O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageries
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg</p>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P. and O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste-Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves Port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian mails from
                        the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry boats," having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMINA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour.In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain - his
                        tomb is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO,
                        with about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of S. Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque
                        cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal
                        Park are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay--Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cogwheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made, in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient halfway
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba)--The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature--warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn to Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Nilan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Dorino and in half an hour you are at

                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage, or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other seaport.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going nothwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot ; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two and three quarter hours.</p>

                    <p>Switzerland, the heart of Europe, has been described as "A cluster of
                        delights and grandeurs."</p>
                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one and a half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M. de Caprino and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town, situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate, and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and "The Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>
                    <p>LUCERNE--A striking picture on the Lake of Lucerne facing the Rigi and
                        Pilatus and the snow-clad Alps.</p>
                    <p>In and around the town the walks are charming, and the excursions to be made
                        from Lucerne by boat, rail, etc. are very numerous.</p>
                    <p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful excursions, those to the Rigi,
                        Pilatus, Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other
                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of
                        Lucerne, commands magnificent views of lake and mountain scenery. Along the
                        Lake of Uri from Brunnen to Fluelen runs the famous Axentrasse.</p>
                    <p>A delightful excursion from Lucerne is that to ENGELBERG. Take boat to
                        Stansstad and from Stansstad it is about 1 hour and 40 min. by Electric
                        Railway, with delightful scenery en route. The ascent of Titlis, is made
                        from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps is grand ; extending from
                        Monte Rosa to the Black Forest, and from the Santis to the Matterhosn.</p>

                        avenue of walnut trees the chief resort of visitors. Interlaken is also not
                        far from the famous waterfalls, Giessbach, Trummelbach, and Staubbach. Then
                        also the glaciers of the Grindelwald and view from Murren and the Schynige

                    <p>Many people visit Greece after wintering in Egypt, as it is so easily reached
                        from Alexandria ; the climate in April is charming. The best steamers are
                        those of he Khedivial Mail Co. and the Russian Steam Navigation Co.</p>
                    <p>If possible tourists should arrange to be in Athens for the Orthodox Easter
                        in order to witness the Good Friday and Easter Eve ceremonies, and to be
                        present at the dancing on the Easter Tuesday festival held at Megara for
                        which a special train is run from Athens.</p>
                    <p>It is worth while to spend a few days in CORFU on account of the beauty of
                        the scenery. There is also good snipe and quail shooting to be had.</p>
