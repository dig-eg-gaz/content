                    <head>THE ELECTION.</head>
                    <p>The extraordinary defeat of the ex-Prime Minister at Manchester and the
                        recent great Liberal gains look as though the polling is going strong
                        against the Unionists. But it must be remembered that the Liberal- Labour
                        party has a great many victories yet to win, for in order to gain a majority
                        of fifty over Unionists and Nationalists, the party must perform the almost
                        superhuman feat of capturing no fewer than 172 seats, counting 341 votes on
                        a division. This, extravagant as it appears, is actually forty votes lower
                        than the forecast of Mr. W. T. Stead, who predicted a turnover of 192 seats,
                        counting 384 on a division. We now trace the fl act nation in the voting
                        since the General Election of 1895 :</p>
                    <p>In 1895 Unionist polling was 12 percent higher than Anti Unionist.</p>
                    <p>In 1895-1909 Unionist polling was 3-1/2 percent. lower than
                        Anti-Unionist.</p>
                    <p>In 1900 Unionist polling was 12 percent. higher than Anti-Unionist.</p>
                    <p>In 1903-1905 Unionist polling was 12 percent lower than Anti-Unionist From
                        this table it is dear that if by-polling were a direct index to General
                        Election polling —and this is the assumption upon which the hopes of a
                        Liberal-Labour majority have admittedly been founded—the Unionist Government
                        would have been beaten in 1900 by a 3-1/2 percent majority of the
                        electorate. As it was, the 3-1/2 percent, minority was converted into a 12
                        percent majority—a turnover of 15-1/2 percent, in all. This 15-1/2 percent,
                        in fact, is the figure of discount to be allowed for anti- Ministerial bias.
                        If events follow in 1906 the fairly regular course they have taken since
                        1895—and there is nothing to show that they will not do so—the 12 per cent
                        by election Unionist minority will be converted into a 8-1/2 percent.
                        General Election Unionist majority. This would give the Unionist party a
                        small majority of perhaps thirty seats in Great Britain only. Assuming that
                        Ireland returns eighty-two Nationalist and twenty-one Unionist members, the
                        Unionist party would be left in a minority in the House of Commons of
                        thirty- one—the Government majority being composed of Liberal, Labour, and
                        Nationalist members.</p>
                    <p>This calculation opens the way to a number of possibilities, all of uncommon
                        interest. In the first place, the majority of (approximately) thirty-one is
                        the highest majority which Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman can hope for, as
                        attested by Liberal statistics — unless the course of political feeling in
                        the country is to be completely diverted from its accustomed channel. If the
                        Prime Minister can perform -this feat, he may obtain a majority of perhaps
                        sixty members. Will he do so 1 In the light of the events of the last few
                        days there is no warrant for supposing that it is impossible.</p>

                    <head>REPORTED FUSION OF HAMBURG-AMERIKA AND N.D.L.S.CO</head>
                    <p>A report is current in Berlin financial circles which ought to be well
                        informed that further negotiations between the Hamburg- Amerika and North
                        German Lloyd Steamship Companies have brought a fusion of the two
                        undertakings considerably nearer realization. Although the dispute was
                        settled a fortnight ago, further conferences between Herr Ballin and Herr
                        Wiegand took place towards the end of last week, and it is said that the
                        question of amalgamation was discussed in detail. </p>
                    <p>It is further stated that these two gentlemen drew np the outlines of a
                        definite schema for presentation to the general meeting of their respective
                        companies. It is impossible to obtain definite particulars of what has
                        passed, owing to the fact that both companies persistently refuse all
                        information. It is certain, however, that one or two of the leading
                        financial houses in Berlin have made extensive purchases of the shares of
                        both the Hamburg and the Bremen companies in anticipation of amalgamation,
                        which would probably result in considerable financial gain to the
                        shareholders of both. </p>
                    <p>It is also stated the contracts which the North German Lloyd recently
                        concluded with the Russian Government for the transport of troops from
                        Vladivostok to Odessa contained a clause providing for the possibility of
                        fusion. </p>

                    <head>NEW EGYPT</head>
                    <p>INTERESTING EXTRACTS</p>
                    <p>A few days ago we reviewed M. A. de Guerrilla's recently published work "New
                        Egypt." This lively book lends itself to some extracts, which will give our
                        readers some idea of the excellence of its contents. Here is a description
                        of some aspects of Cairo in the season, which in some persons' opinion may
                        justify the appellation of "Grave of the Soul" which has been bestowed on
                        the gay capital of Egypt There is something in the air of Egypt, a something
                        which seems to excite every one, more or less, which almost maddens certain
                        natures, especially of the weaker sex, and which seems to drive them to a
                        continuous pursuit of all the pleasures of the senses. The result is that
                        all the world flirts, and the most extraordinary stories ran the round of
                        the hotels. Young girls seem to have a very pronounced weakness for the
                        Egyptian, a weakness which sometimes seems to lead to an entire absence of
                        any idea of “les convenances.” A young Egyptian glib of tongue and an
                        excellent dancer once said to me : "I assure you I could write a volume of
                        adventures which come the way of us young Egyptians in winter, and the way
                        in which these young girls throw themselves at our. beads would astonish the
                        world. Several of us, for sport, formed a society which we called the
                        'terras siers,’ because we ‘did’ the terraces of the various hotels, but it
                        was no use, we had to give it up ; no constitution could stand the success
                        which covered our efforts." But the adventures of these young blades pale
                        before those of the dragomans, these splendid men, built like Hercules,
                        strong as horses, and so picturesque in their native costume. Their duty is
                        to serve as guide and interpreter, to organize everything for their masters,
                        excursions and parties of all sorts. Like the Arabs, the Egyptians and all
                        the Orientals from the lowest to the highest, the dragomans are mad where a
                        European or an American woman is concerned. For them they represent the acme
                        of sexual attraction, and at least, for the lowest class, age and looks are
                        quite unimportant. One can then perhaps understand, if not forgive, the
                        woman whose looks have suffered from the passing of the years, or who, born
                        with a lack of the fatal gift, bas lingered long in the cold shades of
                        neglect, seizing eagerly the opportunity of becoming an object or adoration,
                        in engaging an Egyptian dragoman. Than follow some curious stories. The tale
                        of the young American girl and the "moustiquaire" is in fact far too risqué
                        for our chaste columns. </p>
                    <p>The Cairo Season.</p>
                    <p>Elsewhere the author remarks :— "In this continual round of fetes and
                        pleasures of dinners, balls, and suppers, all the world of Cairo and his
                        wife amuse themselves and flirt as to this flirtation, I am convinced that
                        in no other city in the world does it play so large a part; and yet it,
                        seems, I was not there at the proper time. I left too soon. Winter, it
                        seems, is nothing coppered with spring, when, as we know, a young man’s
                        fancy lightly turns.... “I am leaving Cairo,” a friend of mine wrote me in
                        April, a lady whom one could not describe as a prude, "I am leaving Cairo,
                        for I can not stand any longer the sight of these couples, who, now that the
                        hot weather has come, seem to have lost all notion of les convenances."
                        Well, chère amie, we must not be too hard on poor Cairo. Spring is the great
                        sinner in all lands; and if he seems somewhat more alive there than
                        elsewhere, is it his fault, is it not rather the fault of the climate and
                        sun </p>
                    <p>Society In Cairo.</p>
                    <p>Apropos of the wealthy European and Levantine Society in Cairo, our author
                        says:- The origin of many of their fortunes, though not unknown or even
                        forgotten, is wisely bidden by a thick veil, which old residents
                        occasionally amuse themselves by lifting for the entertainment of curious
                        persons like myself. Then it is that they tickle your ears with stories of
                        which the heroes, bearers of names well known and respected, proud of their
                        titles and decorations, strong in their relationships and friends, appear in
                        the early stages of their careers as nothing more or less than robbers,
                        smugglers, and coiners. But after all, what does it matter? The elders,
                        those who have struggled and suc- ceded at a time when every one robbed more
                        or lets, are to-day very old. Tomorrow they will have gone, and another
                        generation, well brought op, highly educated, elegant, fashionable to the
                        tips of their fingers, will not be responsible for the kind of money which
                        their fathers used. Do not let us dig too deep. Out of a dunghill a rose may
                        grow and many another beautiful thing. And besides, as every one knows,
                        money has no smell, and less even in Egypt than elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>The Alexandrian</p>
                    <p>Here is his description of the typical Alexandrian:— For several years the
                        mania for speculation seems to have attacked the whole population, and the
                        stock exchange at Alexandria is, as it were, the heart of the body politic,
                        full of life, of hopes and fears,where every one, large and small, rich or
                        poor, strong or weak, meets on common ground. Cotton, its rise or fall, that
                        is the predominant thought in the minds of all those men amongst whom are so
                        many familiar faces. Indeed, after nine months' scraping and hoarding, these
                        good Alexandrians troop across to Paris and the best known watering-places
                        on the continent, to disgorge in the remaining three months their
                        accumulated gains. All have the look of men well pleased with the world, and
                        all explain themselves thus, "My dear fellow, business is A.I Egypt has
                        entered on an era of prosperity hardly credible. We are making money hand
                        over fist, every one is in the swim. You will see for yourself, from one end
                        of Egypt to the other you will hear the same story. The Government has been
                        able to reduce taxation and increase the salaries of its employees, big and
                        little. The golden age has arrived !" Can this be possible can it be that,
                        whilst in Europe and America every one cries poverty, there is only
                        prosperity here in this land of Egypt, which scarcely twenty years ago was
                        in a state of bankruptcy and, strange as it may seem, not one of these men
                        will speak to you of Egypt, of its history, of its artistic treasures, not
                        one of them will advise you to visit a museum, a monument or a park. The
                        Stock Exchange and cotton, these are the be-all and end-all of existence. If
                        by chance they do advise you to go the theatre, it will not be because there
                        is something particularly good to be seen, but simply because ‘ X receives
                        £1,000 for three performances, and that the stones and jewels in the hair or
                        round the necks of the elegant represent a sum of £10,000,000 sterling !"
                        When he talks cotton or diamonds, your Alexandrian is a bit of a braggart.
                        In a word, his head is a money-box, and his heart a purse, and they are loth
                        crammed to repletion with banknotes. All the same he is a good fellow,
                        pleasant, hospitable and generous. If he has the faults of the confirmed
                        gambler he has also his good qualities. As to his better-half, it is
                        difficult to judge. Admiration has perhaps blinded me, for the
                        ‘'Alexandrine" is so pretty, so elegant, and so chic, that criticism is
                        quite disarmed. One would have to travel far to find a town where there are
                        so many young women whore good looks and perfect elegance continually charm
                        the eye. It may be said, of course, that they are shallow, that their
                        dresses, their jewels, and especially their flirtations are of more interest
                        to them than the graver questions of life; but what does that matter when
                        they are so charming, and so deliciously feminine? Certainly, we are far
                        from the time when in Alexandria there was a famine of femininity either
                        d'un monde ou de l'aotre. </p>

                        teams hold a good reputation. It will be remembered F. Company secured a
                        runners-up position in the football tournament They possess the proud record
                        of having beaten the regimental team at one time in India. Both elevens have

                        the ropes at the appointed time for starting. The ground was well packed.
                        There were about 1,600 spectators present when the referee's whistle
                        announced time for hostilities to commence. Appended are the teams : F.

                    <p>THE GAME.</p>
                    <p>F. Company started minus Templeton, who was on the side list, Tracey filling
                        the vacancy. Collins started the ball a-rolling and play was at once taken
                        towards McCaffery, but Both well cleared at a critical moment. Not to be
                        denied the Greens still pressed but the ball found touch four times in
                        succession. A near goal ended in a corner which proved unproductive. G
                        Company now found their feet, Greer making good headway, but Duffy came to
                        the rescue and play was in a trice transferred towards McCaffery when Percy
                        had hard lines, his final shot missing the post by a hair's-breadth. On the
                        kick-off Lyons got possession and gave to Dutton, but the latter dallied on
                        the ball too long and a chance was lost Midfield play now followed and a
                        free kick relieved matters. This let G Company away, Higginson showing fine
                        form and giving his wing men some splendid opportunities, but Duffy and
                        Company were in splendid form and repelled all attacks. At this stage the
                        excitement was intense, each team doing their utmost. F Company now took
                        play in hand and Walker was seen to advantage The new recruit slipped in a
                        daisy cutter and McCaffery just managed to save the ball finding touch. Play
                        became faster and Walker in attempting to score struck the crossbar which
                        shook the ball, rebounding on to the toe of one of the Greens, who sent in a
                        fast shot, McCaffery saving weakly, with the result that Percy walked the
                        ball clean into the net for the Greenshirts after twenty minutes’ play, amid
                        tremendous cheers. On resuming, G Company got away in fine style but Page
                        outwitted Garret and sent strongly up the field, where Tracey got the ball,
                        but Patterson robbed and play was transferred, when Collins came in for a
                        lively time He however saved marvelously but had to acknowledge defeat at
                        the hands of Higginson. Amidst deafening cheers midfield play now followed,
                        but nothing of importance occurred up to half-time the score standing : F.
                        Company, 1 goal, G Company, 1 goal.</p>
                    <p>SECOND HALF</p>
                    <p>The second moiety was resumed and the green shirts got going in fine style
                        until a free kick against Tracey spoilt a golden opportunity. Play however
                        remained in midfield, where Collins appealed to the referee for being fouled
                        twice in succession, but no notice was taken. Garret and Dutton were
                        combining well and the latter centered well. Mitchell receiving sent
                        strongly in to Collins, who saved in a brilliant manner. Still the stripes
                        hovered around Collins, but all to no purpose as that custodian was in fine
                        form. Good play by Smyth resulted in Armstrong getting on a single-handed
                        run, but his shot went behind. Neither team could claim any advantage, each
                        goal being visited in turn, and the backs on each side being very stubborn.
                        Tracey now got a good chance to add to the score, but he fell in attempting
                        to shoot Both sets of forwards were showing good form. F Company now got
                        down per Peroy, who sent well in, but Millar relieved, the ball finding
                        touch. The referee’s ruling of the game seemed most unfair to both teams.
                        The game was rough for a while and G Company's goal bad a very narrow
                        escape, splendid play by Millar averting disaster. The pace was now very
                        fast, and each goal was visited without result Duffy received a great cheer
                        for taking the ball from the toe of Dugan and punting well down the field,
                        where some exciting play took place around McCaffery, who saved at the
                        expense of a corner. This was wall taken by Armstrong, but Lyons relieved
                        and G Company were seen to advantage, Greer getting away on a good run, but
                        be sent behind. On resuming Collins and Bradshaw combining well got close to
                        McCaffery, but Bothwell robbed Collins when in the act of shooting, the ball
                        finding touch. From the throw in Armstrong got on a singlehanded run and
                        dodging a couple of opponents sent in a low, swift shot which struck the
                        side of the post and rebounded into the net but to the dissatisfied
                        supporters of F Company the referee disallowed the goal and gave a corner.
                        Tbiss was cleared by Millar and G Company's forwards got a-going, but Page
                        robbed in the nick of time. Play from this to the end was very exciting, but
                        neither team could add to their score, and the long whistle sounded shortly
                        after for full time, leaving the game a draw and to be replayed at a future
                        date :— F Company .... 1 goal G Company .... 1 goal.</p>

                    <head>FOOTBALL AT PORT SAID</head>
                    <p>(From Our Correspondent)</p>
                    <p>Port Said, Friday. This afternoon the Port 8aid Football Club played a return
                        match with a team from the H. M. S Diana, now stationed at Port Said. From
                        the start the Diana forwards showed their superiority over our forwards in
                        passing and quickness and found our weakest spot, namely, our halves. In the
                        first half the "boys in blue" had most of the attacking to do, and it was
                        only the wonderful play of Williams at toll back which kept the ball from
                        the net However, just before half time the Diana scored a goal, which was
                        well deserved, after some very good play. Soon after the restart half time
                        was scored. Up to now the home halves had been giving a very poor account of
                        themselves and everybody was disappointed in the forwards, with the
                        exception of Gunnery, who was playing a really splendid game. Id the second
                        half things were a little more even, but still the Diana had the best of the
                        game and more than once just missed the goal From a corner for the Diana,
                        Gunnery got away, and passed man after man on his own, and after running the
                        length of the field scored a goal with a wonderfully good shot This was
                        without doubt the run of the game and Mr. Gunnery is to be congratulated on
                        his fine run. It is hardly worth while saying anything about the remainder
                        of the game as it consisted mainly of fouls, although the Diana scored
                        another goal, and thereby won the match by 3 to 1.</p>

                    <p>As the outcome of the accident on the Great Eastern Railway (England), on 1st
                        September last, in which it will be remembered ten people were killed and
                        about twenty injured, and in which a carriage lighted by gas took fire
                        immediately after the accident, the Great Eastern Railway Company have
                        decided, we are informed, to equip all their new main line rolling stock in
                        the future with Stone’s System of Electric Lighting instead of gas as

                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe. This
                        depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in January
                        may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as Sicily,
                        but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm than many
                        other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt fur too early in the year,
                        for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to
                        go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily. Some will want to take into consideration
                        the number of days to be spent at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list
                        showing the time occupied on each of the various routes between Egypt and
                        the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <p>They are as follows The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to
                        Plymouth, Southampton, London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short
                        ones ore us follows;— Port Said or Alexandria to Brindisi 3 days Alexandria
                        to Messina 3 „ Port Said or Alexandria to Marseilles 5 „ Alexandria to
                        Venice and Trieste... 4 „ Alexandria to Naples 3 „ Port Said to Genoa 5 „
                        Port Said to Naples 4 „ Alexandria to Constantinople ... 4 „ Alexandria to
                        l’ineus 2 „ Port Said to Gibraltar 7 „</p>
                    <p>The steamers, of the P. and 0. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageries
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt. As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to
                        Alexandria, without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made
                        without change in 4 1/2 hours. The least expensive way to England is by the
                        Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to
                        Liverpool. The German Levant line has also good steamers from Alexandria to
                        Hamburg.</p>

                    <p>mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay. These small but comfortable
                        ships have enormously powerful engines, and attain a very high rate of
                        speed. They are called the “Perry boats,” having been specially built to
                        carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi. If you are going straight
                        through to England you will find the train waiting at .Brindisi which will
                        take you to Calais without changing. It has complete arrangements for j
                        sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in London on the fifth
                        day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMINA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is thc
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Beale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovanni degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a visit.

                        1 during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 8 days. NAPLES is also
                        reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers,
                        which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without wishing to
                        explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri. From Naples to ROME is a
                        train journey of but five hours. All who can will devote at least one week
                        to visiting the many historical and interesting portions of the Eternal
                        City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known to need comment hero.
                        Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers arid its surrounding country. In Florence itself the !
                        churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local
                        promenades and excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most
                        attractive and fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei
                        Colli, one of the finest walks m Europe, opened 85 years ago, goes winding
                        up through the hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion
                        outside Florence is that te Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above
                        the sea level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St.
                        Ellero, thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of
                        oaks takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view. PISA
                        is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ;here there is a fine
                        Cathedral jand the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should If
                        possible be made, in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at sunset.
                        VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near
                        Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient
                        half-way house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable ;
                        and the air and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most I picturesque and interesting city in Italy,
                        with the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European
                        cities and a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously
                        cool breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in
                        summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travelers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail. MILAN is a good
                        centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the. Lakes. The
                        Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit. Between Bologna and Milan and only an j

                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea-port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above the
                        horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage out
                        of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian lakes.
                        COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza : Boats leave Como frequently for the other
                        towns on the lake, which is very beautiful, and the scenery on either side
                        going up the lakeis most enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come
                        Tremzzp, Cadenabbia, and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of
                        Bellaggio opposite. The walk from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to
                        Menaggio is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on
                        Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in
                        two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                        charmingly situated on the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery.
                        Around it rise M. San Salvatore, M. de Caprino and M. Generoso. LOCARNO may
                        be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty town,
                        situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate, and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Basso, situated above the

                        by Ciseri, and "The Flight into Egypt.” by Bramantion. LUCERNE.—A striking

                        Alps. In and around the town the walks are charming, and the excursions to
                        be made from Lucerne by boat, rail, etc., are very numerous. The Lite of

                        from Lucerns to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of nature.
                        BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of
                        Lucerne, commands magnificent views of lake and mountain scenery. Along the

                    <p>Many people visit Greece after wintering in Egypt, as it is so easily reached
                        from Alexandria ; the climate in April is charming. The best steamers are
                        those of the Khedivial Mail Co. and the Russian Steam Navigation Co. If
                        possible tourists should arrange to be in Athens for the Orthodox Easter in
                        order to witness the Good Friday and Easter Eve ceremonies, and to be
                        present at the dancing on the Easter Tuesday festival held at Megara for
                        which a special train is run from Athens. It is worth while to spend a few
                        days in CORFU on account of the beauty of the scenery. There is also good
                        snipe and quail shooting to be had.</p>
