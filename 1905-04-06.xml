                    <head>Local theatre fire</head>
                    <p>The Abbas Ilelrny Theatre at Alexandria was destroyed by fire at an early
                        hour this morning. Yesterday evoning, the usual performance was given by
                        Gatti’s circus troupe,which ended at a quarter past midnight. At 12.20 a.m.
                        the dynamo which supplies the electric light for tho theatre was stupped,
                        and by 12.40 a.m. everyone connected with the theatre had left the building,
                        nothing untoward having hap- pened. At half-past one in the morning,
                        however, the alarm was Jgiven to the Fire Brigade that the “Abbas” was on
                        fire, and on arriving on the spot a few minutes afterwards they found the
                        large building in flames. The fire, which had apparently originated under
                        the stage, had Spread with 'alarming rapidity to the auditorium and boxes,
                        and in a short time the theatre resembled one vast roaring luruace.
                        'Fortunately, no one was in the building at the time; aud there was. no loss
                        of life. 'The horses belonging to the circus troupe were, however, stabled
                        under the stage and efforts were at once directed to saving the, animals.
                        This was done, though three of the horses unfortunately were charred by the
                        flames before they could be got out. v Little or none of the belongings of
                        the unfortunate artistes belonging to the circus troupe cou.d be saved, as
                        the conflagration had got a strong hold of the building. The efforts of the
                        Fire Brigade were mainly directed to saving the walls of the theatre and the
                        sur- rounding buildings, and it reflects great credit ou them that the lire
                        was so successfufly kept wiihiu hounds, none of the adjacent buildings being
                        affected. Bhortly after the outbreak the toot of the building collapsed with
                        a tremen- dous crash, aud now nothing remains of the theatre but ‘the four
                        walls, the whole place being entirely gutted. By 5 o’clock tms morning the
                        fire was thoroughly mastered by tne Brigade, but the hremeh are still
                        engaged in pumping water ou the smouldering mass ol charred wood- work and
                        distorted iron pillars. The cause of the outbreak has not as yet been
                        ascertained, and the sympathies of all .will be with the proprietors,

                        by insurance. Thp theatre was built in 1834 aud was valued at something like
                        £16,0011.</p>

                    <p>The Procnreur General thus oonolndes his review of crime:— That the inorease
                        in orime, properly so called,' is less by half in 1904 than in; 1903, while
                        criminal robbery has not risen (it has in fact fallen by 20)—that the rise
                        in dMits is small in comparison with that of tbe last years, and no more
                        than what might be fairly expected ; that such increase as there is
                        accounted for by petty oases of assault and by a more -exacting standard in
                        the Matter of false accusations while theft and crop-destroying have
                        decreased, and cattle-poisoning not in- creased ; all this, while it oannot
                        be oalled a brilliant result, at least indicates a less marked tendency of
                        serious orime to remain on the increase, and is, so far, a matter for

                    <p>The state of things, at present, is far from encouraging, and it is not
                        astonishing that native reformers should be at length awaken- ing to the
                        urgent necessity of serious re- forms in these Courts. Notably, in suits
                        concerning private Wakfs, scarcely a week passes without some more or less
                        serious com- plaint being received at this Ministry. The majority ol these
                        private Wakf suits are pure questions of property and private rights and do
                        not in any way affeot the religion of the people. Some of the more
                        enlightened among native reformers therefore consider that the wisest and
                        most satisfactory solution for all concerned would be for the Mehkamehs to

                        Khairy) which, being, of a more spiritual nature, fall mbre properly within
                        the jurisdiction of religious Courts. This would certainly be a solution of
                        the difficulty and itt> leasibihty is under the consideration of the
                        Government. r </p>
                    <p>There has been some attempt, in quarters hostile to the project* _ to make
                        capital out of the case of Mr. 'Beck and the stinHulus which that deplorable
                        affair has given in England to a revival ol the agitation for a Court of
                        Criminal Appeal. It may therefore perhaps be desirable to say a lew words on
                        this subject. The suggestion is, of course, that the Egyp- tian'Goverument
                        is proposing to abolish tlyi very safeguard which that case has shown to‘be
                        imperatively necessary. Two considerations suffice to demonstrate -the
                        fallacy iff this con- tention. The .first is that there is no real analogy
                        between the functions of the Egyptian Court of Criminal Appeal—which it is
                        proposed to suppress -here^—and those of the English Court ot Criminal
                        Appeal—which it is desired to introduce at home. The one reviews, on the
                        papers, jthe findings of (act of Tribunals which have heard the witnesses;
                        the other would eitheT rehear the case de novo, witnesses and all, or else
                        order anew trial at which the witnesses would be reheard. Whatever ad-
                        vantages, therelore, might attach to the latter sj8tem—>they are highly
                        problematical, the question being, as is generally admitted, an exceedingly
                        controversial one—they are clearly not poMeased by the Egyptian institution
                        which only exceptionally hears the witnesses. The secoud consideration is
                        that the learned Commissioners appointed to iuquire into the Beck case, and
                        report thereon to-the Home Becretary, have not, as a matter of fact, seeu
                        fit to recommend the institution of a Court of Criminal Appeal, which they
                        apparently regard —aud, it is submitted, rightly (1)—as calculat- ed to
                        impair the dignity aud finality of the stti unices of the existing Criminal
                        Courts. They content themselves with reoommending that some machinery should
                        be provided for secur* ing the possible oousidcration, by a superior Court,
                        of crucial poiuts of law decided by the judge at the trial. Such machinery
                        already exists, in the Egyptian system, in the powers of the Court of
                        Cassation, before which any oonvicted person has the faculty of showiug that
                        a point of law bas beeu erroneously decided, to his disadvantage, and that
                        he has consequently not had a fair trial, or that his oonviction is bad in
                        law. If he suoceeds, the Court of Cassation either quashes the conviction or
                        orders a new trial. We may, therefore, dismiss the idea that, the Beck case
                        has any real bearing on the question of Assize Courts for Egypt. The qnes
                        tiou remains yrhether, in any other respect, the situation has undergone any
                        change since last year. Unfortunately it would appear that, it there has
                        been any change, it has been tor the worse, crime having again increased, as
                        may be seen from the report of the Procnreur General, though not, I am glad
                        to say, in the same ratio as in the preceding year.</p>

                    <p>After citing various oases to prove the defective drafting o * the Egyptian
                        Civil Code, the Judioial Advisei remarks :— But it is not only in the
                        drafting that Egyp- tian legislation is defective but also in the total
                        omission of a number of important subjects and the locume and obscurities in
                        the provisions regarding others. Thus Egyptian legislation contains no law
                        of copyright, no law ef patents, no )»w of trade mark* and Egypt has
                        conssqueitly been unable to adhere to the various International Conventions
                        relat- ing to these most important subjects. There are constant compla inta
                        from the commercial communities as to he loss and inoonvenienoe caused to
                        them by tbe absence of a satisfactory law on these questions of every-day
                        applica- tion. Again, the lan i law is very defective. The law of easements
                        {servitudes) is so brief and incomplete as to givi i rise to constant
                        difficulties. Wakfs aqd contracts of a similar nature are governed
                        exolusivsly by Mohamedan law, which varies according to the different rite*
                        not to mention the divergences in the views of the various authorities of
                        the same rite. Obviously the only remedy for a body of legis- lation so
                        radically defeotive is to simplify the modus legiferendi in Egypt. That the
                        Egyptian Government should be oompelled to apply to fourteen Powers whenever
                        it is desired- to efieot an improvement in Codes of the oalibre above
                        described or to provide legislation cm subjects of the importance above
                        referred to is obviously absurd</p>

                    <p>In regard to the provisions of the above project, the Judicial Adviser
                        remarks: “It would undoubtedly effect a very considerable change in the
                        existing system and there can be very little doubt that the change would
                        prove beneficial to the community at large. Indeed the defects of the
                        present system are almost universally recognised and its continued existence
                        is mainly due to the circumstance that it has hitherto proved impossible to
                        formulate an acceptable’ scheme ’ to take its place. Now, howeve^ that such
                        a scheme Jras been voted by a majority of the technical delegates, it is
                        greatly to be hoped that political considerations may not induce the Powers
                        to vhto the projeot and deprive Egypt of the benefits of a reform for whioh
                        she has been struggling for so many years.</p>

                        Hawker, Coldstream Guard* commanding the Camel Corps of the Egyptian Army,
                        has just been promoted to field rank in the Guards. Major Hawker entered the
                        Guards close on fifteen years ago, the last six of which hare been spent in
                        the Khedivefa service. He earned' tile Egyptian medal with clasps for the
                        operations against tbe Khalifa in 1899, shortly after he joined the Egyptian
                        Army. .A Captain S. J. Somerville, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, attached
                        lately to the Indian Army, has been restored to the establishment of the

                        Battalion. A feeling has been created that the War Office is trying to
                        conceal the names of the fraudulent contractors in connection with the Cape
                        Stores scandal. On the other hand, Mr. Arnold-Forster has given all the
                        knowledge he possessed on the matter. There is every reason to believe that
                        every difficulty was put in the way of his doing so. The battleship "London”
                        (Captain Philip F. Tillard), which was commissioned at Ports- mouth on the

                    <p>The recent Japanese successes in the field hate been followed by a wonderfal
                        triumph in the financial world. The fact that as the war wanton the Japanese
                        were able to get better terms, and had the shrewdness to take ad- vantage of
                        them, will always be reoognised as an additional feather in their cap. By
                        how many unnecessary millions they have secured this bloodless viotory, is
                        the question everyone is asking tb-day. Some say it beats all records,
                        excepting only that notable one—the Trans- vaal War Loan, of a similar
                        amount This was subscribed 39 times over and serves still to remind the
                        world what the United.Kingdom can do in times of stress, as compared with
                        disunited Russia.</p>
                    <p>Naturally these large applications, coming in conjunction with'the Stock
                        Exchange settle- ment, have caused a shortage of ready money, but too much
                        attention need not be given to this, as when the money is released, which is
                        promised at an early date, there is every like- lihood-of continued ease. In
                        fact, these efforts on the part of the public to collect money, and grasp a
                        profit^ to be had for the asking often, have the effect of increasing the
                        floating supply of capital Nevertheless, oven after a period of comparative
                        freedom from new issues for several years, it is not advisable to overdo the
                        calls on the publio, and this is realised by the leading financial houses,
                        who. are quite alive to the situation.</p>
                    <p>Generally speaking, stock markets are in- ; active this week, and the
                        arrangement of the ! Account has occupied dealers, to the exclusion Of fresh
                        business. The large number of new issues now on the market—particularly t^e
                        new Japanese 4} per cent, stock referred to Move—have kept the public out a
                        good deal, 1 find have, moreover, caused a distinct scarcity of money in the
                        settlement. There is a decided feeling that the rush of new issues has been
                        Sufficient, and that it has, for the time being, I put a check on the
                        activity that was bo marked i _ in the investment stocks during the early
                        part ] of the month.</p>
                    <p>Egyptian stocks, after starting the week dull, have rallied sharply during
                        the past two days, 1 led by Agricultural Banks, which have been I bought
                        largely for Continental account— i especially from Paris. The price has come
                        up I over £2 to 12f; It is rumoured that a further 1 issue, both of Ordinary
                        and Debentures, is in preparation, and' the present upward move is very
                        likely "paving the way” for this. National Banks are a good market at 21 J,
                        whilst other shares are steady, nth' little change. Salt &amp; Sodas are a
                        dull point .at If on the new issue. Amongst the new companies, Corporation
                        of -Western Egypt have risen to $, on forced buying. The mining section has
                        sagged off somewhat again, and prices show a distinct set-back from last
                        week’s-account, but the 1 market is not a bad one by any means, and ! ought
                        to be worth attention at present prices, lor the drop is oertainly only a

                        is called in .the inscriptions “the northern oasis of Amon-hotep,” implying

                        reign of Shishak IV; (about 850- B.C.), which were obtained by Capt. Ly6ns
                        from the neighbourhood of Mat. They are written in oursive characters, and
                        the larger of the two relates to a disputed claim as to the proprietorship
                        of a particular spring. The case was brought before the Egyptian governor
                        upon bis arrival in the oasis, but after a delay of several years was
                        decided, not by, him,. but by an oracle of the god of the place. Both the
                        governor and several-of the other officials mentioned on the two monuments
                        bear Libyan names, and it is clear that the oasis was inhabited at the time

                        cated in it the answer of the governor of the .’ province, admitting the
                        validity of the com- ’ plaints, forbidding future extortion nnder se- vere
                        penslties, and ordering the restitution of all illegally exacted monies.
                        Another inscrip- tion iu tho same place, but of earlier dat, contains a
                        decree forbidding soldiers and oth r publio servants to exact food or
                        lodging with- out payment when travelling though "the nome." Any snob
                        exaction wu to be punished bya fine to “ten timesthe amount of what had bon
                        exaoted," while the inforaer was to receive "a fonr-fold portion" as his
                        reward. And it was further enacted that “tho royal scribes, the village
                        clerks and the clerks of the dis- tricts it) o.-v-li nnme, sliall keep a
                        register of all that L expended by tho nome upon any- ono ; so that if any
                        irregularity has been com- mitted, it may be recorded and sixty-fold
                        repayment made."</p>
                    <p>Temples wore erected in the oasis ol el- Kharga by- Donation and Trajan (at
                        Dush), Antoninus Pius (at Qasr Ain ez-ZayAn), and Hadrian (at NAduraJ; and
                        in that of Dakhla by Vespasian and his bodb (at DCr el-Hagar). Extensive
                        cemeteries of the Roman age have also been, discovered, containing
                        mummy-cases on which a portrait of the deceased has been sometimes moulded
                        in stucco, sometimes paint- ed in oils upon wood. But the most remarkable
                        monuments of the Roman age a\e the subterra- nean aquemiota of el-BAhariya.
                        Here numerous channels have been out through the rock at a considerable
                        depth, below the surface of the ground, tapped-.by shafts from above and
                        intended to condaot the water into largo underground reservoirs. ’ Tho
                        aqueduote are now for the most part choked with earth or rubbish, but they
                        need only to be cleared for the oasis to become once more one of the most
                        fertile of lands.</p>
                    <p>Oiympiodorus, who’was born in the Thebaid in the tourth century, and
                        therelore spoke with authority, describes the Egyptian oases as specially
                        celebrated for their fertility and healthiness. The trees, he deolares,."are
                        constantly loaded with fruit, the corn growu iu them being more excellent
                        than any other command whiter than Bnow. Barley is some- times grown.twioe a
                        year, and millet almost always three times a year.” The system ol irrigation
                        was very perfect: “well*, sunk to a depth of two or three hundred or even
                        live hundred cubits, pour streams of water from their mouths,” while the
                        peasants wero in the habit of watering "their little enclosures every third
                        day iu summer aud every sixth day iu' winter, which is the cause ol the
                        great fertility of the land, though the sky is always cloudless,”
                        Oiympiodorus further noticed that "the rocks of the mountain' which extends
                        from the Thebaid into the oasis" were full. of “marine shells aud oysters,”
                        and drew the conclusion that the oases had once been islands. * .In spile of
                        the .raids of the Nubians, whom Diocletian endeavoured to buy off by baudmg
                        over to them the district betweeu the First aud Second Cataracts, the
                        prosperity oi the oases continued iuto Coptio times, as is attested by the
                        ruined monasteries and Christian cemeteries which are scattered over them.
                        With the' withdrawal of the Roman garrisons, ’ however, . aud the. Mobamedou
                        conquest of Egypt their decay set iu; the aqueducts were choked, the fields
                        neglected, andmtlarial fever invaded a district which had once been regarded
                        as a health resort.</p>

                    <p>This Company is formed for the purpose of carrying on the business ot an
                        Investment,Exploration^! Development Company, especially in Egypt and the
                        8oudan. ^ For some years private Syndicates have been exploring oonoesffons
                        granted by the Egyptian and Soudan Governments with tery satisfactory
                        results; districts previously unexplored have been opened up, aud laud
                        hitherto of little value is now steadily improving in price, and is in great
                        demand. The irrigation and reclamation schemes projected are likely to still
                        farther increase the investment demand for laud In view of the above, it ia
                        proposed that this Company shall pay epeoial attention to business connected
                        with land development irrigation schemes, aud reclamation works. It is
                        generally admitted that the many industries of Egypt, unler the careful
                        supervision of the Government, are now malting stead, progress. It is -
                        intended to act as financial- agents in JJoodoi^ Fans and elsewhere for laud
                        development, mining and other oompanies, and i. is anticipated that
                        considerable profit will result from this source. In view of the increasing
                        interest of Freooh Investors in Bgyptian Securities, it is proposed to open
                        a Branch Offise ia Paris at a.: early date. As the suooess of Company of
                        this nature is to a large extent dependent upon a thorough knowledge of
                        looal conditions, it is extrem ely satisfactory to have secured the
                        servioes, as Director and Agent-General in Egypt, of Mr. Hooker, late
                        Geueral Manager of the Bgyptian Salt and Soda Company, formerly
                        Direotor-Ueneral of the Egyptian Government Salt Department in Egypt ;his
                        knowledge of the oonatry and local business conditions is probably
                        unequalled. Mr. Hooker has consented to act tor a period of three years, at
                        a salary of £1,000 per anuum, with a farther remuneration equal to 5 per
                        cent, of the net profits in eaoh year available for distribution among the
                        shareholders ^whether distributed or not) in excess of an amount equal to
                        £10 per cent, on the capital paid up on the Sharee of the Company for the
                        time being issued. 100,000 shares forming part of the present issue have
                        been underwritten at a commission of 3 per cent, with an over-riding
                        commission of 1 per oent which will be paid by the Company. 'Hie Directors
                        are interested as sub-underwriters, and each will receive the 4 per oent on
