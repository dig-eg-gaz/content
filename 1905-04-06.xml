                        <head>Local theatre fire</head>
                        <p>The Abbas Ilelrny Theatre at Alexandria was destroyed by fire at an early
                            hour this morning. Yesterday evoning, the usual performance was given by
                            Gatti’s circus troupe,which ended at a quarter past midnight. At 12.20
                            a.m. the dynamo which supplies the electric light for tho theatre was
                            stupped, and by 12.40 a.m. everyone connected with the theatre had left
                            the building, nothing untoward having hap- pened. At half-past one in
                            the morning, however, the alarm was Jgiven to the Fire Brigade that the
                            “Abbas” was on fire, and on arriving on the spot a few minutes
                            afterwards they found the large building in flames. The fire, which had
                            apparently originated under the stage, had Spread with 'alarming
                            rapidity to the auditorium and boxes, and in a short time the theatre
                            resembled one vast roaring luruace. 'Fortunately, no one was in the
                            building at the time; aud there was. no loss of life. 'The horses
                            belonging to the circus troupe were, however, stabled under the stage
                            and efforts were at once directed to saving the, animals. This was done,
                            though three of the horses unfortunately were charred by the flames
                            before they could be got out. v Little or none of the belongings of the
                            unfortunate artistes belonging to the circus troupe cou.d be saved, as
                            the conflagration had got a strong hold of the building. The efforts of
                            the Fire Brigade were mainly directed to saving the walls of the theatre
                            and the sur- rounding buildings, and it reflects great credit ou them
                            that the lire was so successfufly kept wiihiu hounds, none of the
                            adjacent buildings being affected. Bhortly after the outbreak the toot
                            of the building collapsed with a tremen- dous crash, aud now nothing
                            remains of the theatre but ‘the four walls, the whole place being
                            entirely gutted. By 5 o’clock tms morning the fire was thoroughly
                            mastered by tne Brigade, but the hremeh are still engaged in pumping
                            water ou the smouldering mass ol charred wood- work and distorted iron
                            pillars. The cause of the outbreak has not as yet been ascertained, and
                            the sympathies of all .will be with the proprietors, Aiessjs. A.G.

                            insurance. Thp theatre was built in 1834 aud was valued at something
                            like £16,0011.</p>

                            more -exacting standard in the Matter of false accusations while theft
                            and crop-destroying have decreased, and cattle-poisoning not in- creased
                            ; all this, while it oannot be oalled a brilliant result, at least
                            indicates a less marked tendency of serious orime to remain on the
                            increase, and is, so far, a matter for satisfaction.</p>

                        <p>The state of things, at present, is far from encouraging, and it is not
                            astonishing that native reformers should be at length awaken- ing to the
                            urgent necessity of serious re- forms in these Courts. Notably, in suits
                            concerning private Wakfs, scarcely a week passes without some more or
                            less serious com- plaint being received at this Ministry. The majority
                            ol these private Wakf suits are pure questions of property and private
                            rights and do not in any way affeot the religion of the people. Some of
                            the more enlightened among native reformers therefore consider that the
                            wisest and most satisfactory solution for all concerned would be for the
                            Mehkamehs to hand overfall that relates to private Wakfs (Wakfs Ahly) to
                            the Native Tribunals, retain- ing their competence in charitable Wakfs
                            only (Wakts Khairy) which, being, of a more spiritual nature, fall mbre
                            properly within the jurisdiction of religious Courts. This would
                            certainly be a solution of the difficulty and itt> leasibihty is under
                            the consideration of the Government. r </p>
                        <p>There has been some attempt, in quarters hostile to the project* _ to
                            make capital out of the case of Mr. 'Beck and the stinHulus which that
                            deplorable affair has given in England to a revival ol the agitation for
                            a Court of Criminal Appeal. It may therefore perhaps be desirable to say
                            a lew words on this subject. The suggestion is, of course, that the
                            Egyp- tian'Goverument is proposing to abolish tlyi very safeguard which
                            that case has shown to‘be imperatively necessary. Two considerations
                            suffice to demonstrate -the fallacy iff this con- tention. The .first is
                            that there is no real analogy between the functions of the Egyptian
                            Court of Criminal Appeal—which it is proposed to suppress -here^—and
                            those of the English Court ot Criminal Appeal—which it is desired to
                            introduce at home. The one reviews, on the papers, jthe findings of (act
                            of Tribunals which have heard the witnesses; the other would eitheT
                            rehear the case de novo, witnesses and all, or else order anew trial at
                            which the witnesses would be reheard. Whatever ad- vantages, therelore,
                            might attach to the latter sj8tem—>they are highly problematical, the
                            question being, as is generally admitted, an exceedingly controversial
                            one—they are clearly not poMeased by the Egyptian institution which only
                            exceptionally hears the witnesses. The secoud consideration is that the
                            learned Commissioners appointed to iuquire into the Beck case, and
                            report thereon to-the Home Becretary, have not, as a matter of fact,
                            seeu fit to recommend the institution of a Court of Criminal Appeal,
                            which they apparently regard —aud, it is submitted, rightly (1)—as
                            calculat- ed to impair the dignity aud finality of the stti unices of
                            the existing Criminal Courts. They content themselves with reoommending
                            that some machinery should be provided for secur* ing the possible
                            oousidcration, by a superior Court, of crucial poiuts of law decided by
                            the judge at the trial. Such machinery already exists, in the Egyptian
                            system, in the powers of the Court of Cassation, before which any
                            oonvicted person has the faculty of showiug that a point of law bas beeu
                            erroneously decided, to his disadvantage, and that he has consequently
                            not had a fair trial, or that his oonviction is bad in law. If he
                            suoceeds, the Court of Cassation either quashes the conviction or orders
                            a new trial. We may, therefore, dismiss the idea that, the Beck case has
                            any real bearing on the question of Assize Courts for Egypt. The qnes
                            tiou remains yrhether, in any other respect, the situation has undergone
                            any change since last year. Unfortunately it would appear that, it there
                            has been any change, it has been tor the worse, crime having again
                            increased, as may be seen from the report of the Procnreur General,
                            though not, I am glad to say, in the same ratio as in the preceding
                            year.</p>

                        <p>After citing various oases to prove the defective drafting o * the
                            Egyptian Civil Code, the Judioial Advisei remarks :— But it is not only
                            in the drafting that Egyp- tian legislation is defective but also in the
                            total omission of a number of important subjects and the locume and
                            obscurities in the provisions regarding others. Thus Egyptian
                            legislation contains no law of copyright, no law ef patents, no )»w of
                            trade mark* and Egypt has conssqueitly been unable to adhere to the
                            various International Conventions relat- ing to these most important
                            subjects. There are constant compla inta from the commercial communities
                            as to he loss and inoonvenienoe caused to them by the absence of a
                            satisfactory law on these questions of every-day applica- tion. Again,
                            the lan i law is very defective. The law of easements {servitudes) is so
                            brief and incomplete as to givi i rise to constant difficulties. Wakfs
                            aqd contracts of a similar nature are governed exolusivsly by Mohamedan
                            law, which varies according to the different rite* not to mention the
                            divergences in the views of the various authorities of the same rite.
                            Obviously the only remedy for a body of legis- lation so radically
                            defeotive is to simplify the modus legiferendi in Egypt. That the
                            Egyptian Government should be oompelled to apply to fourteen Powers
                            whenever it is desired- to efieot an improvement in Codes of the oalibre
                            above described or to provide legislation cm subjects of the importance
                            above referred to is obviously absurd</p>

                        <p>In regard to the provisions of the above project, the Judicial Adviser
                            remarks: “It would undoubtedly effect a very considerable change in the
                            existing system and there can be very little doubt that the change would
                            prove beneficial to the community at large. Indeed the defects of the
                            present system are almost universally recognised and its continued
                            existence is mainly due to the circumstance that it has hitherto proved
                            impossible to formulate an acceptable’ scheme ’ to take its place. Now,
                            howeve^ that such a scheme Jras been voted by a majority of the
                            technical delegates, it is greatly to be hoped that political
                            considerations may not induce the Powers to vhto the projeot and deprive
                            Egypt of the benefits of a reform for whioh she has been struggling for
                            so many years.</p>

                            Royal Rifle Corps, who joins the 1st Battalion at Cairo. The “Dilwara”
                            is due at Malta on the 2nd April and at Southampton on the 11th follow-
                            ing. Her return will dose the trooping season of 1904-03. Captain Claude

                            Army, has just been promoted to field rank in the Guards. Major Hawker
                            entered the Guards close on fifteen years ago, the last six of which
                            hare been spent in the Khedivefa service. He earned' tile Egyptian medal
                            with clasps for the operations against the Khalifa in 1899, shortly
                            after he joined the Egyptian Army. .A Captain S. J. Somerville, Royal
                            Inniskilling Fusiliers, attached lately to the Indian Army, has been
                            restored to the establishment of the inniskillings vice Captain R. C.

                            created that the War Office is trying to conceal the names of the
                            fraudulent contractors in connection with the Cape Stores scandal. On
                            the other hand, Mr. Arnold-Forster has given all the knowledge he
                            possessed on the matter. There is every reason to believe that every
                            difficulty was put in the way of his doing so. The battleship "London”
                            (Captain Philip F. Tillard), which was commissioned at Ports- mouth on
                            the 7th Juu* 1902, for service with the Mediterranean Fleet; will return
                            home from that station on 24th prox. She will pay off the following day
                            at Portsmouth, and will be recommissioned for another tour of service in

                    <p>The recent Japanese successes in the field hate been followed by a wonderfal
                        triumph in the financial world. The fact that as the war wanton the Japanese
                        were able to get better terms, and had the shrewdness to take ad- vantage of
                        them, will always be reoognised as an additional feather in their cap. By
                        how many unnecessary millions they have secured this bloodless viotory, is
                        the question everyone is asking tb-day. Some say it beats all records,
                        excepting only that notable one—the Trans- vaal War Loan, of a similar
                        amount This was subscribed 39 times over and serves still to remind the
                        world what the United.Kingdom can do in times of stress, as compared with
                        disunited Russia.</p>
                    <p>Naturally these large applications, coming in conjunction with'the Stock
                        Exchange settle- ment, have caused a shortage of ready money, but too much
                        attention need not be given to this, as when the money is released, which is
                        promised at an early date, there is every like- lihood-of continued ease. In
                        fact, these efforts on the part of the public to collect money, and grasp a
                        profit^ to be had for the asking often, have the effect of increasing the
                        floating supply of capital Nevertheless, oven after a period of comparative
                        freedom from new issues for several years, it is not advisable to overdo the
                        calls on the publio, and this is realised by the leading financial houses,
                        who. are quite alive to the situation.</p>
                    <p>Generally speaking, stock markets are in- ; active this week, and the
                        arrangement of the ! Account has occupied dealers, to the exclusion Of fresh
                        business. The large number of new issues now on the market—particularly t^e
                        new Japanese 4} per cent, stock referred to Move—have kept the public out a
                        good deal, 1 find have, moreover, caused a distinct scarcity of money in the
                        settlement. There is a decided feeling that the rush of new issues has been
                        Sufficient, and that it has, for the time being, I put a check on the
                        activity that was bo marked i _ in the investment stocks during the early

                    <p>Egyptian stocks, after starting the week dull, have rallied sharply during
                        the past two days, 1 led by Agricultural Banks, which have been I bought
                        largely for Continental account— i especially from Paris. The price has come
                        up I over £2 to 12f; It is rumoured that a further 1 issue, both of Ordinary
                        and Debentures, is in preparation, and' the present upward move is very
                        likely "paving the way” for this. National Banks are a good market at 21 J,
                        whilst other shares are steady, nth' little change. Salt &amp; Sodas are a
                        dull point .at If on the new issue. Amongst the new companies, Corporation
                        of -Western Egypt have risen to $, on forced buying. The mining section has
                        sagged off somewhat again, and prices show a distinct set-back from last

                        only £35,000, of which £10,000 will be allotted as fully paid to the
                        Egyptian and Sudan Mining Syndicate, Ltd. The concession is that granted
                        originally to Mr.' George Ogilvy Haig.The area of the oonoesston excludes
                        that known he the "Dareheib mines," comprising 2,560 acres, but with this
                        exception, it extends over some 18,000 square miles. Messrs. John Taylor

                        undertone in the South African market and those who ought to know predict
                        higher prices, especially in Rhodesians. The rise in Chartered is partly
                        traceable to shortness of shares whioh are very scaroe and recent
                        developments are very encouraging in Copper Gold.</p>

                        of a particular spring. The case was brought before the Egyptian governor
                        upon bis arrival in the oasis, but after a delay of several years was
                        decided, not by, him,. but by an oracle of the god of the place. Both the
                        governor and several-of the other officials mentioned on the two monuments
                        bear Libyan names, and it is clear that the oasis was inhabited at the time
                        mainly by Libyans.</p>
                    <p>Beyond a tomb belonging to the age of the nineteenth dynasty and tho
                        fragments of two temples of the twenty-sixth dynasty (B.C. 550) which exist
                        in the oajusofel-BilhariBga,nothing more has been met with in any of the
                        oases which is earlier than the Persian epoch. The great temple of el-Kharga
                        was either founded or rebuilt by Darius in honor of Ammon-R-i, andthekiugis
                        described as having erected it of "good white stono" and as having covered
                        its.doors with bronze from Asia. There is a long list of the offerings
                        presented to the go.l which begins with "the wine of the Oasis,” as well as
                        a hymn of praise to the Sun-god, -The tompli was afterwards enlarged by
                        Nektanebo .1. Not far to the. south, near Geand, is an- other temple which
                        dates from the time of the Ptolemies.</p>
                    <p>It was under tho Romans that the oases seem to have attained
                        theirohiefimportance.Thiswas the poriod to which most of the ruined temples,
                        forts, towns, and aquoducts owe their origiu, though it is,very.possiblo
                        that the Romans mere- ly restored or improved earlier constructions. Both
                        the "Greater" and "Lesser Oasis,”—the modern el-Kharga and el-Dakhla,—as
                        wellas the “Email Oasis," or el-Bdbariya, were thoroughly cultivated and
                        strongly garrisoned ; a brisk trade was carried on in yriue, and the oases
                        were used as places of exile as, it would appear, had already been the case
                        under the Pharaohs. Among the distinguished individuals who were banished to
                        them was Nestorius ; Juvenal; is said to have been anothor.</p>
                    <p>That a considerable amount of taxation was raised from them may . bo
                        concluded from an j inscription on one of the outer walls of’the temple of
                        el-Kharga which is dated ip the 2nd year of the Emperor Galba (a.d. 69).
                        The' inhabitants of the Thebaid had complained of extortion on the part of
                        the tax-oollectors, and tbe’prefect of the Oasis aicordingly commijni-j
                        cated in it the answer of the governor of the .’ province, admitting the
                        validity of the com- ’ plaints, forbidding future extortion nnder se- vere
                        penslties, and ordering the restitution of all illegally exacted monies.
                        Another inscrip- tion iu tho same place, but of earlier dat, contains a
                        decree forbidding soldiers and oth r publio servants to exact food or
                        lodging with- out payment when travelling though "the nome." Any snob
                        exaction wu to be punished bya fine to “ten timesthe amount of what had bon
                        exaoted," while the inforaer was to receive "a fonr-fold portion" as his
                        reward. And it was further enacted that “tho royal scribes, the village
                        clerks and the clerks of the dis- tricts it) o.-v-li nnme, sliall keep a
                        register of all that L expended by tho nome upon any- ono ; so that if any
                        irregularity has been com- mitted, it may be recorded and sixty-fold
                        repayment made."</p>
                    <p>Temples wore erected in the oasis ol el- Kharga by- Donation and Trajan (at
                        Dush), Antoninus Pius (at Qasr Ain ez-ZayAn), and Hadrian (at NAduraJ; and
                        in that of Dakhla by Vespasian and his bodb (at DCr el-Hagar). Extensive
                        cemeteries of the Roman age have also been, discovered, containing
                        mummy-cases on which a portrait of the deceased has been sometimes moulded
                        in stucco, sometimes paint- ed in oils upon wood. But the most remarkable
                        monuments of the Roman age a\e the subterra- nean aquemiota of el-BAhariya.
                        Here numerous channels have been out through the rock at a considerable
                        depth, below the surface of the ground, tapped-.by shafts from above and
                        intended to condaot the water into largo underground reservoirs. ’ Tho
                        aqueduote are now for the most part choked with earth or rubbish, but they
                        need only to be cleared for the oasis to become once more one of the most
                        fertile of lands.</p>
                    <p>Oiympiodorus, who’was born in the Thebaid in the tourth century, and
                        therelore spoke with authority, describes the Egyptian oases as specially
                        celebrated for their fertility and healthiness. The trees, he deolares,."are
                        constantly loaded with fruit, the corn growu iu them being more excellent
                        than any other command whiter than Bnow. Barley is some- times grown.twioe a
                        year, and millet almost always three times a year.” The system ol irrigation
                        was very perfect: “well*, sunk to a depth of two or three hundred or even
                        live hundred cubits, pour streams of water from their mouths,” while the
                        peasants wero in the habit of watering "their little enclosures every third
                        day iu summer aud every sixth day iu' winter, which is the cause ol the
                        great fertility of the land, though the sky is always cloudless,”
                        Oiympiodorus further noticed that "the rocks of the mountain' which extends
                        from the Thebaid into the oasis" were full. of “marine shells aud oysters,”
                        and drew the conclusion that the oases had once been islands. * .In spile of
                        the .raids of the Nubians, whom Diocletian endeavoured to buy off by baudmg
                        over to them the district betweeu the First aud Second Cataracts, the
                        prosperity of the oases continued iuto Coptio times, as is attested by the
                        ruined monasteries and Christian cemeteries which are scattered over them.
                        With the' withdrawal of the Roman garrisons, ’ however, . aud the. Mobamedou
                        conquest of Egypt their decay set iu; the aqueducts were choked, the fields
                        neglected, andmtlarial fever invaded a district which had once been regarded
                        as a health resort.</p>

                        Investment,Exploration^! Development Company, especially in Egypt and the
                        8oudan. ^ For some years private Syndicates have been exploring oonoesffons
                        granted by the Egyptian and Soudan Governments with tery satisfactory
                        results; districts previously unexplored have been opened up, aud laud
                        hitherto of little value is now steadily improving in price, and is in great
                        demand. The irrigation and reclamation schemes projected are likely to still
                        farther increase the investment demand for laud In view of the above, it ia
                        proposed that this Company shall pay epeoial attention to business connected
                        with land development irrigation schemes, aud reclamation works. It is
                        generally admitted that the many industries of Egypt, unler the careful
                        supervision of the Government, are now malting stead, progress. It is -
                        intended to act as financial- agents in JJoodoi^ Fans and elsewhere for laud
                        development, mining and other oompanies, and i. is anticipated that
                        considerable profit will result from this source. In view of the increasing
                        interest of Freooh Investors in Bgyptian Securities, it is proposed to open
                        a Branch Offise ia Paris at a.: early date. As the success of Company of
                        this nature is to a large extent dependent upon a thorough knowledge of
                        looal conditions, it is extrem ely satisfactory to have secured the
                        servioes, as Director and Agent-General in Egypt, of Mr. Hooker, late
                        Geueral Manager of the Bgyptian Salt and Soda Company, formerly

                        knowledge of the oonatry and local business conditions is probably
                        unequalled. Mr. Hooker has consented to act tor a period of three years, at
                        a salary of £1,000 per anuum, with a farther remuneration equal to 5 per
                        cent, of the net profits in eaoh year available for distribution among the
                        shareholders ^whether distributed or not) in excess of an amount equal to
                        £10 per cent, on the capital paid up on the Sharee of the Company for the
                        time being issued. 100,000 shares forming part of the present issue have
                        been underwritten at a commission of 3 per cent, with an over-riding
                        commission of 1 per oent which will be paid by the Company. 'Hie Directors
                        are interested as sub-underwriters, and each will receive the 4 per oent on
