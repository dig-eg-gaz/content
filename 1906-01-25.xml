                    <p>The city of Alexandria has many wants. Two of these readily ooze to our mind,

                        permitted. They are—a Public Library and a Clock Tower. Alexandria once
                        possessed a great and world famed library ; its treasures, which would be of
                        incalculable value to savants were they now available, .perished by fire.
                        What more fitting monument ti Mohamed Aly than the eruption of a building on
                        one of the fine sites available on the now quay, which shall be as worthy of
                        modern Alexandria as the old one was of the ancient city 1 8towed away
                        somewhere in the rear of the Municipal Buildings in Rosetta-street, and
                        approached by a narrow path running along tile side, are, we believe, some 2
                        >.000 volumes that, properly arranged and catalogued in a suitable building,
                        should be available for reference by the many who at present have no idea of
                        their existence, as well as by the few who, knowing where to go, do use this
                        hidden library when erosion requires. Just now a notice hung on the door
                        informs an that for the present the library is dosed, no intimation being

                    <p>Saakin has long been considered a por.t of dangerous apprcaoh by navigators.
                        A loBg, forty-mile channel leads to it, fall of awkward coral. At the
                        present time there are several fine steamers come to grief near it, and
                        standings have been of too frequent occurrence. Indeed, so frequent, that
                        there are plaoes in the channel where, when a steamer gronnda, the danger is
                        minimised by the fact that other vessels have been there before her, and
                        have made the berth an easy one. Bnt for some time, past the Government has
                        been pnshiDg forward the ooDfttrnotion of the Sadan-Berbera'Railway, which
                        rons down to 8aakint and the consequently heavy shipments to the latter
                        port, and ensuing groundings, opened the eyes of the authorities to the fact
                        that when the Sudau was aotually a territory of commMoial importance Suakin
                        would be no plaoe to deal with the produce on the seaboard. It%
                        accommodation was too bad.</p>
                    <p>Description of Port.</p>
                    <p>In Jinnary la^t year his Majesty's ship Sealark was sent to. survey the whole
                        ooast, and to report on possible sites with a view to a port which oould
                        replace and better Saakin. In the same month Sir William Garstin visited
                        8heikh Bargont, and his advice ied to that site being decided npon to make a
                        new plaoe on the map. Portftadan is about s:x hundred and eighty miles snath
                        of Saez, and is capable of holding a dozen vessels of moderate size. The
                        entranoe is six hundred feet across, and divides into two ohannels of good
                        depth. The land ronnd it is aboat sis feet above sea level— quite a
                        considerable elevation for that flat seaboard—and forming an admirable base
                        * for wharves. Moreover, it* is sure to be in the very near futire (cotton
                        or none) a ooaling station of considerable importation and one now greatly
                        needed, for at present there is .none b tween Perim and Suez, a distance of
                        thirteen handred mile'.. Brit beyond all its advantages it has a good supply
                        of fresh w&amp;tsr, Th1 supply at Suakin Unit only small bit bad.</p>
                    <p>Already the plaoe bears the appearance from seaward of being a station of
                        considerable substance. It is true tfiat in England none but a few officials
                        would know how to find Port Sadan on the chart, but the intentions of the
                        Government no sooner leaked^nV than an army of pioneers personally found the
                        spot very quickly, and the mushroom station was over, ran With Italians,
                        Greeks, Arabs, etc. They went with all they owned, mainly a tent, an iron
                        pot, and a frying-pan, and the desert strand whispered prosperity a few
                        months after 8ir William Garstin's favourable report. Others, with more
                        forethought, knowing the timborless oonntry to which they were going, took a
                        little wood with them, whioh, with mats and bamboos- soon gave a few
                        straggling streets to Port Sadani</p>
                    <p>Signs of Activity,</p>
                    <p>The Sadan Government haa bnilt substantial w rehouses, a quarantine station,
                        a hospital, and a number of offitts, so that approaohing the new harbonr
                        from seaward it already bears the appearance of a place of activity and
                        trade. As evidenoe that the Government expect great things of the Sadnn,
                        when the railway is completed, and the plant i- fciona have proceeded beyond
                        the experimental stage, it should be noted that last May tenders were
                        invited for a powerfal light to be oor- straoted at Port Sadan, whioh should
                        show an ooonlting beam for a distanoe or twenty-dour miles. It is being
                        e/eoted oq Sanganeb Reef, which is e&amp;at of the' port by thirteen miles,
                        and near it will be located &amp; pilot station. Farther, the. Sadan </p>

                    <p>The Infant Moralist. By Mrs. Arthur Jacob anti Lady Helena Carnegie.
                        Edinburgh: 'R.Cimnt and Son, 10?. Princes-street; Lolidon: R. Brimlev
                        Johnson.- Verses. By. Violet Jacob (Mrs. Arthur Jacob). London r.Willianr
                        Heifiemann.</p>
                    <p>These books will commend themselves more especially to those who knew the
                        authoress while sh9 was in Egypt in 1903 and 1904 ; bat they are well worth
                        consideration on' every other coant. Let ns take first 1 he "Infant
                        Moralist," a series of poems with pictures that would have appealed in all
                        seriousness to dor greatgrandfathers. Imagine Jane and Ann Taylor, pins Dr.
                        Watts, pins the Fairchild Family the whole tinged with the sobtleet possible
                        19th-centnry honour, jost that_ pumour, so nearly -imperceptible,which can
                        torn an ohvioos "moral tale" into a treasure and a joy for ever. It is
                        better to quote a few lines, and let readers jpdge for then selves. We have,
                        in one poem, on "Profanity," 'certain lines apropbs of Para: ^keets (observe
                        the antique flavour of "Parakeets" instead of parroqaeta or other snoh
                        Dames)</p>
                    <p>"How Btrnngo a sight in distant, lauds Where wonders meet the eye,</p>
                    <p>To see the works of nature's hands , From every tree-top fly.I"</p>
                    <p>We have again, from "Heartless Folly," the awful story of the shameless youth
                        who tripped up the benevolent Admiral, and made a mook</p>
                    <p>of him..</p>
                    <p>What should you feel if Admiral Bligh Were taken from us to tho sky,</p>
                    <p>And you should bo'tho cause ? .</p>
                    <p>Oh, wretched boy, Elisha's bears May even now be on the stairs Your
                        punishment to give:</p>
                    <p>For those the Aged^who'oflend, .</p>
                    <p>Are like to come to fearful end Or else in chains to live."</p>
                    <p>We could qaote many more lines : indeed we oannot refrain from two :—</p>
                    <p>"Where heathons'roam in impious bands,</p>
                    <p>And feast upon their. f.oes."</p>
                    <p>The delightfal accuracy, of the 1820 1630 touch in. every other word, gives
                        to these poems a certain savour, as of caviar, to modern readers. 'We will
                        say no more^ except to counsel all who possess a sense of humour—happily ,
                        almost auiversal in these days—to procure the book ; for it is a book to
                        have and to keep, and only to lend—against receipt—to those ohosen spirits
                        who appreciate—and return— such works.</p>
                    <p>"Verses," by Violet Jacob, are the serious side of an authoress whose very
                        sense of humour should make her serious work the more notable. The two
                        points of view must always be combined, to attain to insight and
                        understanding. We might quote Mr. Caine and Miss Corelli in support of our
                        contention: eaffice it to say that these veree3 are the work of one who can
                        see and appreciate both sides . of life. Technically speaking, as verse,
                        they are of a high order : the subjects and the . thought are by no means
                        common place, but the chief interest in them' is a certain regret, a keen
                        and pitiful observation of fife, oonjoint with an acute and compensating
                        Jove of nature —nature which always remains, impassive, hated perhaps in
                        some moment ef pain, but gradually, by her eternal presence, healing
                        sufferer* to forgetfulness. Even one er two stray phrases in a book,
                        suggesting this, are of valne, and in these verses there ar9 many snob.
                        These are lines that stand out :</p>
                    <p>"I have a little poison flower *</p>
                    <p>I gathered there : arid, though I would forget,</p>
                    <p>/ take it out in some friend-haunted hour Tufind it living,yet."</p>
                    <p>V And agaiD, of a faneral in the East, one of those funerals we all know
                        here, sndden, unexpected, moving us in cur daily work, and— soon forgotten:
                        —</p>
                    <p>"Forward the dead march rolls : ></p>
                    <p>K6ep we our souls</p>
                    <p>Strong for the last that love can do for hfm."</p>
                    <p>Bat that whole poem is worth reading, and remembering yet another poem has at
                        least a touch of the greater magic, "The Call," especially in the second
                        part : —</p>
                    <p>I wifi arise and'-steal upon the stair,</p>
                    <p>Whore the tall clock counts up Timo's gathered</p>
                    <p>[hoard</p>
                    <p>Telling its numbers to the empty air."</p>
                    <p>All this may seem to be undoly high praise for a slight book of verse ; yet
                        sorely all praise is dae to words and lines that oan touch us intimately. We
                        may treasure the intensity of Browning, or shiver at the sensuous sweep of
                        Swinburne : we may marvel a moment at the far-off ring and clash of the '
                        Recessional " (that last, however, we coqld put aside not withoat a feeling
                        of ease that it has been said for ns, sparing us fortber thought upon the
                        subject); but there are times, when -some quieter line comes hack,haunting
                        and consoliDg, very near to something we know. Snoh a line 18 a possession,
                        and in its hour, when the greater poets are pet aside, we valne it even
                        above thofe of high and approved geninses, whose thoughts are not ours,and
                        cannot speak to us in that hour.</p>

                        misnomer.</p>
                    <p>It was used for Parliamentary and popular purposes, but the London "Times"
                        ounce led several months ago that no such continuous all-rail route would
                        ever be constructed. Ismail Paoha spent over $ 1,500 000 in surveys and
                        explorations, chiefly under the direction of American officers. They were
                        "Englished" as the work of Sir John Fowlor, and credit given him on- the map
                        of the British War Office, printed in 1882. But it was the General Staff,
                        from 1870 to 1878, under Lieut. Gen. Stone Pacha, which did the work.</p>
                    <p>It would be interesting if the "Times" would publish, a brief sketch of the
                        Assouan Reservoir, based on the artiole in'the engineering supplement of the

                    <p>EGYPT AS THE WORLD'S GRANARY.</p>
                    <p>Before the Royal Geographical Sooiety last week Major A. St. Hill Gibbons
                        read an interesting paper on " British East African plateau land and its
                        eoonomio conditions," in the course of which he stated that two essential
                        conditions to progress were the existence Of markets and lines of
                        communications; but by the time a colony reached even the early stage of
                        development, of which East Africa was at present an example, a local market
                        already existed capable of purchasing on good terms all that eariy industry
                        could produce. Step by step, as settlers poured in and industry expanded,
                        little markets and lines of communication were developed. The Nile was the
                        natural outlet of Uganda and North-western" British East Africa, and, with
                        engineering enterprise and expense quite trivial as oompared with wbat had
                        already been done in Egypt, could be made navigable from Lake Albert to
                        Upper Egypt. Indirectly and directly Sir W. Garatin's great ecbeme Tor the
                        canalisation of the Nile from Bor to Fasboda should do much for these
                        protectorates. The gTeat work would, so .vastly widen the area of
                        cultivation as to Te-establish Egypt as one cf the world's greatest
                        granaries. With the establishment of this now era and with a navigable
                        waterway through the cataract district to the Mediterranean, the
                        Mediteranean sea freights would become proportionate to those on the
                        Atlantic, and Uganda would share the advantage with Upper Egypt—for a few
                        days longer in a Nile barge would not materially add to expense in
                        transit.</p>

                    <dateline>London, January 19.</dateline>
                    <p>To all intents and purposes the elections are over, and it is wonderful how
                        calmly the City takes the situation. It is realised that the larger the
                        majority the Liberals get ro much the larger is the number of votes polled
                        for them by former Conservatives. No one believes that the latter have so
                        changed their views as to instantly become men of another class, and as the
                        stability of the Government will depend upon the support of this lairge.
                        section of the community, it is obvious that the Liberals cannot afford to
                        take any vital step calculated to reduce the strength or impair the
                        integrity of the Empire. In other words, the larger the majority the greater
                        the security for moderate measures. Even the rankest Conservative would not
                        have been oontent for the entire old team to be re-harnessed again. It is
                        evident that a fatal mistake was made by Mr. Balfour in not dissolving
                        Parliament upon some definite issue of redistribution,for example, and thus
                        enabling the election to be fought out on a particular question rather thau
                        on the candidates themselves. No one olaims that the fiscal or any other
                        question has been settled by this election, as the evident desire to give
                        the other side a turn has been the main cause ot the great change that has
                        taken place. From the City's point of view there are many things that oould
                        be better managed than they were managed during the last regime. The late
                        Chancellor of the Exchequer was considered a weak man in his Treasury
                        dealings with the City,, which has freely complained of being "messed aboot"
                        inthis respect.</p>
                    <p>There, is hope, therefore, for a stronger and a better hand both to deal with
                        Treasury business and also to effeot economies and reductions in taxation,
                        which it is felt can well be oarried ont without impairing the efficiency of
                        any part of his Majesty's services.</p>
                    <p>While the City has proclaimed itself a supporter of Mr. Chamberlain in the
                        matter of fisoal reform; no one is sorry to see the question postponed, as
                        the trade of the country shows a new prosperity, which it would perhaps be
                        well to leave alone for the time being. Tho Money Position.</p>
                    <p>Money is still tight, notwithstanding the very favourable Bank return, which
                        shows a proportion of reserve to liabilities of 42.89% against 33.50%
                        lastweek.The most Conservative disponntand banking institutions have thought
                        it Well to prepare for the worst arising out of the Moroooo Conference.
                        Although the "probability ot any trouble oooarring has now passed away, as
                        long as the possibility exists the same ultra cautions attitudo will be
                        assumed. As soon, however, aa the conference is satisfactorily ended there
                        is every prospect of greater ease in the money market, in addition to whioh
                        large sums have still to borne baok from the provinces, and these will
                        strengthen the reserve of the Bank of England still further. Con a oi/o.</p>
                    <p>The future of Consols is now thought to be bettor than at any time ainoe the
                        beginning of tho war. The Atorm olonds are now rapidly disappearing from the
                        political horizon. Yesterday the price of Consols rose to 90 , and they

                        sharp fluctuations ; a decline of 6 @ 8 points was followed by an advance of

                    <p>l'affaire de preemption Hadji Bazilion oon- treBacbrDaner a dtd plaidds mardi
                        par devanl ia 2me Chambre civile da Tribunal mixte du Caire.</p>
                    <p>Le miniature' public, par l'organe de Beyram bey, a dtabli le point 'de droit
                        de preemption par ses conclusions, desqqelles nous avons pn retenir lea-
                        passages principaux :</p>
                    <p>" Notre mission, dit M. le sabstitat B yram -bey, do oonsiste pas k appliquer
                        litteralement la loi, mais elle oonsiste sartont k approprier son
                        application aux circonstances, k l'fcarmori- sdr avec les evenements, tonten
                        la maintenant intaote dans son esprit,</p>
                    <p>"Par suite de la pro'ipdritd progressante do payB, par suite de mille
                        oiroonstanoes va- riee8, dont.la speculation tient une large part, nous
                        avons vu C38 derniers mois, les prix des terrains changer de oouw, non
                        seulement dn jour an lendemain, mais dans la mdme journee, do matin an
                        soir.</p>
                    <p>11 Dans ces conditions le preempteur, qui selon l'esprit de la loi, ne
                        devrait prendre que le lieu et place de 1'aeheteur, et non plus, par ce fait
                        senl'qa'il preempte -qainze jours aprds l'achat realise un benefice
                        appreciable et il se place 8ur une position beaucoup plus avanta- gease que
                        oelle de I'acheteur qui pour arriver a oonclure l'aohat aura deponed son
                        temps, son activite et parfois aura compromis ses interns en maDqnant de
                        faire une autre affaire.</p>
                    <p>" fiat-il juste, est il equitable dks lors, d'ac- cueillir k bras ouverts le
                        prdempteur ? On me dira peat6tre : dura lex sed lex; je repondrai, oui, la
                        loi accorde la preemption utile et dcono- mique, mais elle n'a jamais
                        entendu rendte la preemption un instrument dangereux, en faire un levier
                        puissant k la speculation. II faut ad- mettre le preempteur mais avec
                        beaucoup de reserves."</p>
                    <p>Beyram bey cite alors les avis des jaris- consaltes masulmans pour etablir
                        que selon le droit masulman, source de la prdemptioD, ce droit est consider
                        comme un droit faible.</p>
                    <p>" La jurisprudence mixte, dit M. le substitute a essayd autant qa'elle a pu
                        de restrain- dre ce droit. C'est ainsi qa'elle a decide que le droit de
                        preemption n'existe pas pour les tar- rains lotisds et ofiertaktouB ceuxqui
                        voulaient les acbeter.</p>
                    <p>C'est ainsi qu'elie ajugeque d'aprks une coutume locale k laquelle les Codes
                        mixtes n'ont pas ddrogd, le droit de preemption s'eteint par la mort du
                        preempteur.</p>
                    <p>"Or, ajoute Beyram bey, si la jurisprudence d'il y a qde!que8, anndes, a
                        admis oes justes restrictions, les conditions actaelles de la haasse noas
                        font an devoir imperieox de la restreindre encore toutes les fois que nous
                        en avons I'occasion. Le procks aotuel, .dit M. le sabstitat, noas fournit
                        oette occasion. II s'agit de savoir, et c'est le point de droit qui a pose
                        dans oette ffaire, ei le prdempteur peat, ldgaleraent, readier l'acte
                        d'achat de i'acbetear, uniqaement parce que cet acte ne ports pas date
                        oertaine: en d'aatres termes. le prdempteur eat-il un tiers au sens de Tart.
                        293 du Code oivil.</p>
                    <p>La loi n'a voulu ddfendre par cat article, dit M. le substitute que les ayant
                        cause des parties oontraotantes, elle D'a pas voula ddfendre tons les tiers,
                        suitoat oeax qai n'ont qu'un droit faible, tel que le droit de preemption.
                        Or un droit, qui ne passe pas aox hdri tiers est un droit fragile, que la
                        loi n'a pu mettre sur le mdme plan qa'un droit entier, forme, un droit
                        proprement dit</p>
                    <p>A l'appui de catte tbkse, M. Beyram bey cite l'opinion de M. le professeur
                        Planial, de la Faoultd de droit de Paris, et il oonolat au ddboutement de
                        Hadji Baziiiou parce que celoi-ci n'a achetd son terrain qa'un mois aprks

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis” to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY</head>
                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at
                        Salsomaggiore.</p>

                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San

                    <p>LOCARNO, may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty

                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt,” by Bramantion.</p>

                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
