                        official recep tion this morning which was more largely attended than on any
                        former occasion. The (Governor of Alexandria, Mustapha Pasha Ibadi, was an
                        early visitor, and the members of the consular corps attended in full force.

                        grounds, trooped the colour, and fired a feu de joie, and at midday the

                    <head>COTTON TRADE BOOM. </head>
                    <p>At no time within recent years has the cotton industry been so prosperous as
                        of late. Various causes have combined to bring this about. Among these may
                        be mentioned, as a cotton expert recently pointed out to a representative of
                        the "Tribune, 'the fact that within the last two or three years .conditions
                        of peace have prevailed in the world which have given | an enormous impetus
                        to British trade. And in regard to the cotton industry in particular, also,
                        the efforts of the International Cotton Congress are already bearing fruit.
                        After years of scarcity of raw material, high prices, and the evil results
                        of operations of speculators in the cotton market, which caused violent and
                        disastrous fluctuations, and more stable condition of things now obtains.
                        The result is an immensely increased output from the Lancashire mills. The
                        demands of India and China are stated to be unusually heavy, and to meet the
                        calls upon it all sections of the trade are putting forth increased energy.
                        An unmistakable evidence of this is seen in the building of new mills. In
                        the cotton manufacturing districts of Lancashire these are going up on every
                        hand, and the makers of textile machinery have orders booked far ahead. In a
                        list of over a hundred mills in the Oldham district, in which dividends have
                        recently been annonneed, one concern is returned as paying 40 per cent., one
                        35, one 30, one 26 23, three 25 and the majority of the remainder range
                        downwards to 10 per cent. There are but three or four paying between 9 and 6
                        per cent, and one o ly which pays no dividend. In addition to the dividend
                        several concerns pay a bonus this year of from 58. to 108. a share. The
                        Lancashire cotton spinners, both employer and employed , however, have bad
                        bitter experience of bad times, and while substantial profits are being
                        distributed, efforts are ne glected to provide for prospective lean years."
                        In August, 1906, the consumption of cotton in Great Britain was 3,358,708
                        bales of which a 2,815,331 were American cotton. In August ofte the present
                        year the consumption had increased to 3,462,823 bales, of which 2,989,389
                        consisted of American cotton. The estimated number of spindles in Great
                        Britain is, according to the latest returns, more than fifty and a half
                        millions, and it is anticipated that during 1908 this vast number will be
                        increased by at least two millions and a quarter. </p>

                    <p>SO Writing to the Washington Bureau of Manufactures with regard to the
                        present unprogressive state of Egyptian cotton milling, et Mr W. A. Graham
                        Clark, a United States en special agent, says : na "The sole representative
                        in Egypt of the e, world's greatest industry has 20,00 spindles and 500
                        looms, and is located at Alexandria. In the last years of the nineteenth
                        century more determined efforts were made to bring the ontton mills to the
                        cotton fields of Egypt, but once again there has been failure, so that now
                        only one mill survivas. "One adverse factor is that the English Government,
                        while very friendly to cotton raising in her possessions and countries where
                        her influence is paramount, is unfriendly to cotton manufaeturing in those
                        lands. Local cotton factories would, other things being eqnal, have quite an
                        advantage over Lancashire by having no freight and no duty to pay, and to
                        counter-balance this the English, Government, through the influence of
                        Lancashire, placed an excise tax, equal to the daty, on the production of
                        all cotton mills in such countries. The Indian mills, theretore, pay 84 per
                        cent. excise tax on all goods manufactured, but the Egyptian handicap is
                        much greater, as the duty is 8 per cent., and an equivalent special tax is a
                        great drawback to cotton manufacturing. The insufficienoy of efficient help
                        available, however, has probably had the largest effect in retarding the
                        industry. The elimate also is unsuitable for cotton manufac . - - - taring."

                    <p>Sir, -I fully endorse the remarks of your correspondent upon the necessity of
                        making provision for the prevention of unnecessary crowding at the letter
                        distribution windows of the Post Office. It is of conrse not the fault of
                        the Pustal authorities that the insane desire for precedence exists, but one
                        of the peculiari. ties of human nature, and the only solution appears to be
                        adequate arrangements which will necessitate each individual quietly
                        awaiting this or her turn according to precedence of arrival. This question
                        reminds me, too, of the uncertainty which appears to exist in the opening of
                        the windows at a specified time. | More often than not one has to wait some
                        considerable time after the notice hour, due to some extent perhaps to the
                        amount of sorting eto, required, or the late arrival of a post, but one
                        would think that sufficient experisnce had now been gained by the
                        authorities to more accurately stipulate a definite time, and adhere to

                    <p>A correspondent writes from Cairo : Lord Cromer's speech, the full text of
                        which you published yesterday, has been been received with eulogy by the
                        home press, Conservative and Liberal slike, and it must be a somewhat
                        paintul blow to those of your contemporaries in Egypt, who have so
                        persistently striven to delude the native into the belief - that their own
                        views as regarding Lord Cro mer's policy, was shared by the great Liberal
                        party in England, to find even the Radical organs bestowing onmeasured
                        praise apon the Administrative powers of the man who had devoted the best
                        years of his life to the regen eration of this country, The tabular form
                        which you published from the "Times" amply demonstrates the gigantic strides
                        which Egypt has taken in her coinmercial undertakings under the guidance of
                        her late Consul General, and is a sufficient refutation of the absurd
                        arguments which havo been recently brought forward in the attempt to prove
                        that Lord Cromer's tenure had been productive of oppression and tyranny,
                        without being of real benefit to the country at all In as far as the
                        educated classes of Egypt are concerned such futile arguments have long
                        ceased to hold any weight, but the policy of lies has been continued in a
                        mad attempt to foster dissatisfaction in the country, and there are
                        doubtless a large number of the uneducated people who have been deluded into
                        believ. ing what they have so repeatedly been called i upon to bear; that
                        the English are in no real sympathy with the Egyptians and are actuated | by
                        no genuine desire to benefit them. However, the perspicacity of the native
                        increasing with the growth of education, this section of fevered agitators
                        seems destined to die a natural death, and there is no reason to suppose
                        that there will be any necessity for the application of "the heavy hand"

                        limits of the law. Egypt bas profited to too great extent by the British
                        oceupation for there to be any danger of the thinking portion of the

                    <head>DISCOVERIES AT ELEPHANTINE </head>
                    <p>PROFESSOR PETRIE'S OPINION. </p>
                    <p>There appears to be some diversity of opinion among Egyptologists in London
                        as to the value of the discoveries recently made at Elephantine by Professor
                        Clermont Banneau. Some are sceptical of there being any possibility of a
                        large Jewish settlement at the supposed date in Elephantine. Professor
                        Flinders Petrie, on the other hand, considers the discoveries of great
                        interest. "It," said Professor Petrie, in an interview with the "Standard"
                        "the facts are as relir ported-and there is no reason to doubt their of
                        truth-we have indisputable evidence that the Jews were in Egypt far earlier
                        than has commonly been supposed. The temple must have been standing
                        certainly during the period of the Babylonian captivity, and very possibly I
                        tb before the time of Nebuchadnezzar." The recent discoveries at Elephantine
                        are a later instalment of the papyriwhich were edited some two years ago by
                        Professor Sayon, the originals of which are in the museum at fi Cairo. These
                        were valuable as showing that ne the Jews were present at Elephantine, but
                        the fact of their not being dated considerably discounted their value. There
                        is reason to hope that further research will bring to light and number of
                        other valuable Jewish documents, while the discovery to which everyone is
                        looking forward is the appearance of docu-te ments to show that the Jews
                        were present at Elephantine before the destruction of Jerasalem. "That this
                        was the case seems probable," contended Professor Petrie. "The Darius
                        referred to is Darius II.: and his 17th year would be 407 B.O., which would
                        harmonise perfectly with the mention that is made of the son of sanballat.
                        Now the temple of Jerusalem was destroyed about 180 years before this timo,
                        and this is not a very long time for a large and wealthy temple to be built,
                        to be destroyed, 1 and for a petition for its rebuilding to be sent up to
                        headquarters, though, of course, there is time for it to have occurred. If
                        it could be definitely determined, it would be a matter of quite outstanding
                        interest and historical importance." The celebrated verse 19 in the 19th
                        chapter of Isaiah almost certainly deals with the temple of which evidence
                        has now been brought to light. The text of it runs as follows : "In that day
                        shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a
                        pillar at the border thereof to the Lord." The papyrus would appear to show
                        that the temple and pillar referred to were at Elephantine and not a Syene,
                        as has hitherto for the ho most part been considered more probable. It is
                        only recently that the British School of Archeology confirmed a much
                        disputed paesage En Josephus by the discovery of the temple which was built
                        by the High Priest Onins, when the Jews fled from Antiochus Epiphanes into

                    <p>Sir,--I am glad to see such a keen interest being taken in Egypt in
                        horticulture, and though unable to be setively interested myself I have a
                        great love for flowers and especially for a garden worthy of its name. To me
                        the pleasure to be derived from a well-designed garden is infinitely greater
                        than from a collection of plants, and should the Alexandris Horticultural
                        Society accept the suggestion of your earlier correspondent I feel sure that
                        it would greatly promote the object for which it was formed. The work the
                        society has done at is worthy of all praise and so zealous have its active
                        members shows themselves that the sug- S. gestion of garden competition is
                        sure to A receive the consideration which it deinsnds. I would merely add
                        that the pros bave been brought before us; if there are any cons 1 sh bope

                    <p>POLITICS IN SCHOOLS.</p>
                    <p>"We are going from bad to worse, not only in regard to criminal
                        occurrencies, but also in matters political says "Al Watan. We talk about
                        the disquieting increase in felonious practices and suggest remedies, but no
                        sound action has been taken in that way. Such is the case again in the
                        question of political parties, for we talk and point out faets and wat
                        against dangers; yet the agitation never abates or censes and the agitators,
                        like their con temporaries of the criminal variety, carry on their work with
                        impunity and extend the scope of their activities from day to day.</p>
                    <p>"The last development of this Nationalist agitation ought to bring our
                        authorities to a keener sense of their duties, for the agitators are
                        educating the coming generation ou the principle of hatred and contempt of
                        England. They are sowing the seeds of mutinous disaffeetion in youthful
                        breasts and creating danger of the most serious nature, for it cannot be
                        doubted that all students in our public schools almost without a single
                        exeeption, are hotheaded Kamelites dancing to the tune of "AlLewa" and
                        professing the theories of Mastapha Kamel. Let these youths become the men
                        of Egypt one day and England will find that this nation cannot be ruled by
                        prestige and a few thousand red coats as is now the case.</p>
                    <p>We cannot say that party polities are alien to public schools.everywhere,
                        but we can see very clearly that the new phase in the bistory of Egyptian
                        parties is an omen of evil portent. Mustafa Pasha Kamel has been taking full
                        advantage of this ill-advised inaction on the part of our ralers to
                        inculcate his revolutionary ideas among the coming manhood of Egypt. He has
                        scattered his last circular broadcast in the public schools calling upon
                        every student to register his name in the lists of the Nationalist party-and
                        also to pay as much as possible to the party funds. He has imbued the young
                        men selected for instraction in England with his views and the result was
                        not late in coming out. That result has partly appeared in the action of two
                        students who deserted their vollege recently and wrote "Al Lewa" the most
                        insolent document on record. It has alss appeared in the open avowal of
                        Nationalist principles by week-minded pupils who are sure to cause their
                        Government serious trouble in future days because that Government was guilty
                        of the crime of inaction when Mustapha Kamel was preaching his revolutionary

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE"</p>
                        <p>Sir, I have just read two books by Mr. W. S. Blunt, "Atrocities of
                            Justice in Egypt," and "Secret History of the English Occupation of
                            Egypt." These two books have produced on me a very painful impression;
                            they contain so many fallacies and such a distorted way of drawing
                            conclusions, that they might do much harm.</p>
                        <p>As I lived in Egypt during the years which preceded and followed the
                            bombardment at Alexandria, and had good reason for keeping a vivid
                            recollection of the events which occurred at that time, and was moreover
                            brought into contact with nearly all the principal merito whom Mr. Blunt
                            refers, I think I am in a | better position than most people, to give
                            your readers a word of warning, as to how they should allow themselves
                            to be influenced by Mr. Blunts' opinions.</p>
                        <p>I never had the honour of making Mr. | Blunt's personal acquaintance nor
                            had I ever the slightest wish to do so Judging from his writings and
                            actions during the period above referred to, in common I believe with
                            most people then resident in Egypt, I made the great mistake of looking
                            upon Mr. Blant as a harmless lunatic; in this we committed an error of
                            judgement, which I, and others have long since regretted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Blunt posse sed a good deal of information, which though obtained
                            from probably unreliable sources, could not fail to be of interest in
                            such times; it was therefore not extraordinary that he should be
                            listened to by men in the position of our Consul General and some of
                            H.B.M.'s Ministers, but I can never believe that Mr. Blunt's opinions
                            had any more effect an any of these gentlemen, than if they had been
                            dated from some well known asylum.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Blunt has the pen of a ready writer, a fact in my opinion, much to
                            be regretted, for be has made use of it to endeavour to vilify and bring
                            into conterupt the noble work of a series of men of whom their country
                            may well be proud, of men whose shoe strings Mr. Blunt is not worthy to
                            tie up.</p>
                        <p>Within the limits of our page of "The Secret History" Mr. Blunt
                            qualifies the members of Mr. Gladstone's Ministry of 1881 as
                            "ineptitndes," except Hartington whom he describes as a second rate man;
                            and alludes to Gordon as a lunatic. If Hartington was a second-rate man
                            and Gordon a lunatic, where would Mr. Blunt come in !!</p>
                        <p>Mr. Blant describes Sir E. Malet and Sir C. Rivers Wilson as his
                            friends, and then he proceeds to use the information they gave him, no
                            doubt in confidence, to damage their character and belittle their work;
                            they might well say,--save us from our frievds, if they had others like
                            M. Blunt. I had the pleasure of meeting both these gentlemen at times of
                            s vere trial. I once travelled with the former when he was Secretary of
                            Embassy at Constantinople, when from a high sense of duty he carried Jo
                            tan object he had in view,at imminent risk of his life, although it was
                            not in time of war, ani both then and during the events of 1882 I never
                            knew a man who had a higher sense of duty. I saw him frequently when he
                            was ill on board ship in Alexandria before the bombardment, and althongh
                            he was suffering | severely he insisted in going on with his work</p>
                        <p>in spite of his doctor's advice, and it was only | when he was told it
                            would have been fatal for i him to remain, that he consented to leave
                            the ti country. I never read a more garbled distortion of facts, than
                            Mr. Blant's account of Sir E. b Malet's action and his relations with
                            his Government at that time, and I was glad to see it refuted by himself
                            in a recent letter toi the "Times," backed up by a more strongly in
                            worded letter from the "Times" Egyptian war correspondent of 1882; the
                            latter draws an | amusing parallel between Lord Byron and Mr. Blunt with
                            unexpressed bat evident regret that the parallel was not yet ae complete
                            as it might have been.</p>
                        <p>Mr Blunt describes Sir Rivers Wilson's mis- | sion to Egypt as Minister
                            of Finance in 1878-79, | as an abject failure, it was nothing of the
                            sort. It was hardly probable that in the then distrsted state of the
                            country Mr. Wilson would be able to do all he had boped, still I
                            maintain that he did a very great deal of good If he had been the
                            failure that Mr. Blunt would have us believe, is it at all likely that
                            he would have been considered the best man to send out here, as he was
                            sent a few years after to arrange the law of liquidation, an arrangement
                            which he carried out with great ability.</p>
                        <p>In the other book, "Atrocities of Justice etc." Mr. Blant attacks Lord
                            Charles Beresford firh his action when on shore in Alexandria subsequent
                            to the bombardment, he undertook of the extremely difficult ta-k of
                            restoring and th maintaining order in the town. During that th time I
                            saw Lord Charles Beresford nearly every day and I can safely say without
                            fear of contradiction by anyone. who knows any. thing about it, that not
                            only was that work exceedingly well done, but it was done with the
                            greatest humanity that circunstances admitted of. It is true that some
                            people were shot, who in quieter times would have to been imprisoned
                            first and tried afterwards, but none were shot without ample proof of
                            their guilt, and if some examples bad not been made without loss of
                            time, murder and disorder would have became so rampant, that their
                            victims would have been infinitely more nomerons, and not only that, but
                            the small force of marines holding the town, might Pa easily bave been
                            overpowered by the thousands of looters who would have come L hack into
                            the town, if they were no leuger&lt;/p></p>
                        <p>&lt;p>afraid of the consequences, for most of these people were soldiers
                            in disguise, and well armed.</p>
                        <p>I have only referred to a few typical cases which, because they bappened
                            many years ago, are not so clear to the public of to-day, though I could
                            follow Mr. Blunt's accusations up to the present time and show on what
                            slender foundations they rest, but this would</p>
                        <p>take up too much time and space, and this ," letter is already too
                            long.</p>
                        <p>It would ill bec me me to write anything ed in justification of that

                            it is disheartening to at find that a man of our own nationality,

                            diplomatic service his st chiefs did not confide to him any work of e

                            the following question. al Did he never reflect that the willingness

                        <p>tound on their part to do him a service had d something to do with the
                            fact that he, or m, probably Lady Anne, carried a pretty heavy All purse

                        <p>I also knew Midliat Pasha as Governor a General of Syria, and agree with
                            Mr. Blunt or that he was pretty well played out before he o got there.
                            Did it never occur to Mr. Blunt that leif Midliat had still been the
                            energetic man he</p>
                        <p>once was, that he, Mr. Blunt, a stranger travelling in the country of a

                        <p>Scott wrote in one of his best known stanzas, e the lines which
                            immediately follow the words el "If such there be etc. etc. etc." I

                        <p>fame of some of the best of his own country. inen. It might be well for
                            Mr. Blunt to reflect on these things before he uses any more ink in the
                            interests of his friends.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Blunt on several occasions bemoans the waning of or political

                            specimens of this class, in its most obnoxious form, and it is sad to

                    <p>Coton L'examen</p>
                    <p>de la cote de clôture nous montre qu'à la seule exception de la matinée de
                        Samedi, qui a fini en petite amélioration de 3/82 sur la veille, les autres
                        jours les cours affichés le soir ont té régulièrement en baisse. En résumant
                        le tout, on trouvera peat-être que le mal n'est pas énorme, la perte n'étant
                        en définitive que de 13/82 du point maximum pratiqué pendant la semaine et
                        de 1/4 seulement depuis Vendredi, mais si sur ce point les choses ne
                        semblent passi mauvaises, l'observateur qui suit attentivement le marché ne
                        peut, pour sa part, se soustraire à l'impression que pendant ce même laps de
                        temps, l'Amérique a haussé, tandis que la baisse s'est produite surtout les
                        jours ou les nouvelles del'Etranger auraient été de nature à fournir à la
                        spéculation, sinon un motif base, du moins un prétexte à soutien. </p>
                    <p>Pareille tenue du marché, ne peut certaine ment signifier autre chose si ce
                        n'est qu'il y a lassitude et que la spéculation est à l'affat des occasions
                        qui seraient propices pour lui permettre de liquider ses positions ; mais
                        malheureusement pour les interessés, leur réussite n'a été que partielle et
                        même très partielle et pour le moment les chances n'ont pas l'air d'être en
                        leur faveur. En effet, ce n'est pas en disant que tous les exportateurs sont
                        pincés parce que l'un ou l'autre s'est laissé tenter par le prix de 18 5/8
                        avquel on a venda la premi re filière Novembre ce soir même, ou parce que
                        l'an de nos leaders de la hausse, qi fait moins d'af"faires qu'aucun de ses
                        confrères de la corbeille, mais peut être autant de bruit qu'à eux tons
                        réunis, trouve qu'il ne saurait y avoir aucun rapport entre américain et
                        égyptien, que la hausse peut se faire ; non, tout cela ne re présente que
                        des paroles soneres tout simple-1 ment, et ce n'est que le substantiel qui
                        senl peut faire atteindre le but </p>
                    <p>Or, ce substantiel continue à faire défaut, la filature ne cessant d'être sur
                        la réserve la plus compl te pour ainsi dire, la crise en Amériqne de sévit
                        toujours avee intensité, la question : d'argent chez nous d'entraver la
                        marche nor. male des affaires et les nouvelles de notre ré: colte d'être des
                        plas satisfaisantes. A deux qui nous opposeront la question des exportations
                        an premier point, nous répoadrons par le fait que dans ce qui s'embargne
                        actuellement </p>
                    <p>il y a beaucoup de coton qui part par ailticipa* tion, et même, pour
                        certaines parties, la </p>
                    <p>suite d'accords avec les filateurs Ca renseignements peuvent être obtenus de
                        tous les côtés. D'ailleurs, d'ici peu de jours on pourra acquérir la
                        certitude d'ane Jimination sensible de ce chef, et surtout pour Décembre, à
                        moins que de nouvelles affaires pour prompt embarquement n'aient lieu au
                        plus tôt. </p>
                    <p>Quant à la question de l'argent, on n'a qu'à regarder la modération des
                        opérations d'ar bitrage pour se rendre à l'évidence que les Banques
                        n'avancent pas tout ce qu'on leur demandet </p>
                    <p>Reste, pour ce qui concerne le local, le point important de la récolte : pour
                        le moment, il semble être résolu par l'estination donnée dans son dernier
                        "résnmé, que nous reproduisons plus loin, par l'Alexandria General Produce
                        Association, estimation considerée conservatrice. l'opinion de beaucoup de
                        personnes venant de l'intérieur et que nous avons on l'occasion d'entendre,
                        étant que 7.000 000 de cantars devraient être un minimum. En tous cas, inôme
                        en nous tenant au chiffre le pl, réduit de la Prodince de 6 3/4, il n'y
                        aurait pas de farine cotonnière à craindre chez nous, surtout avec les
                        conséquences fatales de l'élévation des prix en comparaison de ceux de
                        l'Américain. </p>
                    <p>La première filie de Novembre a été de cantars 21.250, ce n'est pas grand
                        chose, même pour le premier mois de la campagne, mais celad n'empêche qne la
                        quantité a fini par exercer a un certain effet sur le marché et qu'à 18 5/8
                        fe il ne s'est pas trouvé d'amateurs pour la filière. Id </p>
                    <p>Pour demain, il y aura probablement une d nouvelle émission qui circulers et
                        pour peu on qu'elle soit de quelques milliers de Cantars, le elle pourra
                        bien canser du "grabage." </p>
                    <p>En attendant, nous constatons que le report de Novembre à Janvier est de
                        23/32 ; de Janca vier à Mars, de 3 4 de tallari, et de Mars à fa Mai,
                        d'autres 3/4. Dans ces conditions, les n' perspectives pour la liquidalion

                        marchandise de cette façon, sur tout que le dernier mot ne semble pas avoir
                        été dit sur l'élargissement du report. </p>
                    <p>Le Novembre 1908 a beancoup perdu, dans In faveur de la spéculation et à
                        certains d moments, il n'était nullement aisé de tronver acheteur. Mais

                        désirer, nous aj aurons épuisé tout ce que nous avions à dire sur notre
                        marché des contrats et par consé quent nous pouvons consacrer quelques mots
                        and l'Américain. </p>
                    <p>Les nouvelles de ce côté-là sont noires, et tandis que de New-York on câble

                    <p>LA SEMAINE Au point de vue transactionnel la matinée ti de lundi a été aussi
                        nulle que les jours précédents, mais on a constaté en général plus de d
                        fermeté dans les prix, surtout pour les valeurs b dirigeantes Bien que les
                        échanges se soient disséminés en petit nombre sur toute la cote, on a traité
                        de façon particulière les Banques et le Comptoir. </p>
                    <p>Le lendemain les mauvaises nouvelles d'Amnérique et la hausse du taux
                        d'escompte ont causé ici une véritable consternation. Il n'en | fallait pas
                        tant pour infl encer une place quid n'était déjà que trop démoralisée. La
                        National Book et le Comptoir, en raison d'une offre persistante, ont été
                        spécialement éprouvés. </p>
                    <p>Mercredi l'aspect de notre marché n'a passe sensiblement différé de celui de
                        la veille à cette différence près qu'il a présenté plus d'animatiou, il
                        faudrait dire plus d'empressement de la part des vendeurs. Malgré tout, les
                        affaires sont restées clairsemées et limitées aux Comptoir, Estates, Delta
                        Land et en proportious plus restreintes aux Agricole, Natio nal Bank, United

                    <p>LA SITUATION GENERALE. </p>
                    <p>On nong rendra cette justice d'avoir va clair dans la situation. Seuls à peu
                        près nous avons constamment signalé le péril de la tension monétaire, le
                        nuage venant de Wall Street et l'utilité pour la spéculation locale de se
                        tenir dans la plus stricte réserve. Ce n'était pas an lendemain d'une
                        debacle égyptienne suivie presque aussitôt d'une crise aux Etats-Unis qu'il
                        tallait s'abandonuer des manceuvres de hausse De telles tentatives étaient
                        d'avance vouées à un échec, comme le récent mouvement inauguré ici en a
                        fourni une preuve éclatante. Pour avoir taché d'éclairer le public sur le
                        danger qu'on lui faisait courir en le lençant prématur ment dans un
                        mouvement risqu-, nous avons été taxés de pessimisme. Bien que nous ayons
                        déjà exprimé notre opinion A ce sujet et démontré l'inanité de l'accusation
                        au point de réduire au silence nos trop bouillants ad versaires, il n'est
                        peut être pas hors de propos de revenir sur la question, aujourd'hui que les
                        événements viennent encore une fois de nous fournir la meilleure des
                        justifications, la seule dont nous soyons jaloux. Tout ce que nous avions
                        fait entrevoir est arrivé, et au-delà : jamais nous n'aurins osé dire que le
                        taux officiel de la Banque d'Angle: terre atteindrait sitt 7% et qu'en dépit
                        de cette mesure cette Banque continuerait à voir sa caisse assaillie par
                        New-York. La Banque de France, qui a prêté à la Banque d'Angle terre 3
                        millions de livres en or s'est vu obligée de porter elle-même son taux
                        d'escompte à 4%. A Berlin le taux reste à 6 1/2 % mais la situa-11 tion y
                        est tort compliquée, ainsi qu'à Amsterdam, ou des runs se sont produits aux
                        Caisses d' pargne. En Amérique oh les retraite d'or des | banques atteignent
                        des sommes colossales, la gêne augmente de jour en jour, au point que les
                        établissements de crédit ne paient plus en or mais en cheques. Bref, la
                        disette de numéraire est si intense que le taux de 7% n'est même plus
                        suffisant pour protéger l'encaisse de la Banque d'Angleterre contre la |
                        demande d'or des Etats Unis. La proportion de sa reserve a été réduite
                        depuis vendredi dernier de 4 5/8 % a 35 1/4 contre 39 7/8 % la semaine
                        passée. </p>
                    <p>On conviendra que cette situation ne reg: semble en rien à celle que
                        faisaient pressentir certains organes tendancieux qui assuraient il y a peu
                        de jours que le taux d'escompte an | lien d'augmenter allait retomber à 4%
                        Sui-| </p>
                    <p>vant les mêmes proph tes, la cote devait obaque jour se relever. Nous pensons
                        qu'entre ces claironneurs de hausse intéressés et des eriti qnes ayant pour
                        tout souci de prévoir autant que possible l'allure venir du marché, le
                        public impartial n'hésitera pas un instant à se prononcer. </p>
                    <p>Est-ce à dire que nous soyons vonés à un krach inévitable et que la baisse de
                        doive plas s'arrêter Loin de là. Plus nous fléchissons, plus la reprise
                        approche ; une fois que nos bonnes valeurs a ront atteint un prix de
                        placement plus avantageux que les autres, comme elles jouissent en général
                        de sérieuses garanties, elles seront mises en portefeuille. Ce sera le
                        sigual de la hausse. Mais vouloir, comme cela s'est produit depuis deax ou
                        trois ans, a des intervalles périodiques et à la faveur de la plus-value
                        rationnelle de nos titres de tout repos, ponager de façon factice du papier
                        sans valeur définie, c'est pocasionner des retours regrettables, bons tout
                        au plus à déconsidérer tout l'ensemble de notre stock. </p>
                    <p>La crise américaine elle-même doit avoir une fin, puisque le pays est
                        prospère. Il De BU faut donc pas désespérer. Avec du sang-froid et de la
                        prudence, on sortira graduellement des Pul complications existantes. La
                        confiance peu* peu renaltra et avec elle le credit. Evidem ment ce ne sera

                    <p>tion, sur une valeur nominale de £ 1. La société fit l'acquisition de
                        quelques lots de terrains de pre nier choix dans les provinces à des prix </p>

                    <p>EGYPTE </p>
                    <p>LA SITUATION ACTUELLE </p>
                    <p>De l'intéressante étude da Dr. A. Eid sur la propriété urbaine en Egypte,
                        dons nous avons publié la conclusion il y a quelques jours, nous croyons
                        intéressant d'extraire le passage suivant sur la situation actuelle </p>
                    <p>Les transformations survenues dans le pays provoquèrent un mouvement de
                        spéculation sur la propriété urbaine. Les transactions chaque jour plus
                        nombreuses finirent par englober des terrains de plus en plus éloignés, dont
                        beaucoup apparaissent à la reflexion incapables de donner un revenu d'ici
                        longtemps. Il n'en pouvait être autrement ; on ne multiplie pas les
                        constructions comme on le veut ; les capitaux et la main-d'oeuvre
                        disponible, les matériaux existant sur place sont autant de bar rières qui
                        s'opposent à un mouvement trop rapide, même quand le besoin s'en fait
                        sentir. 11 était donc sage de se munir de terrains suffi sants quitte à les
                        rendre prodnetifs lorsque l'occasion s'en présenterait. </p>
                    <p>Mais cette spéculation, bonne dans le fond, a pêché par exoes, car comme les
                        prix des terrains montaient toujours, un grand nombre de nouveaux requéreurs
                        s'empressieht de reyendre lenrs biens ; et il se forma même toute une
                        catégorie de personnes qui n'achete fent que pour spéculer, n'ayant ni le
                        désir i les moyens de mettre en valeur leurs sequisitions. Chaque vendeur se
                        retira avec bénéfice et l'on aboutit finalement à des prix très élevés qui
                        excitèrent la défiance des capitalistes. </p>
                    <p>La hausse rapide rendit les erreurs et les exces inévitables, car rien n'est
                        plus difficile que d'évaluer le prix de la propriété urbaine dans un moment
                        de spéculation. La propriété rurale offre encore un élément objectif d'estil
                        mation, le rendement, qu'il est aisé de calculer, surtout dans un pays
                        recevant l'eau avec autant de régularité que l'Egypte. Quant à la propriété
                        urbaine, son rendement est constitué par les loyers des immeubles qui sont
                        déterminés en tout premier lieu par leur situation. Or, cette situation
                        dépend de tant de facteurs différents, de tant de circonstances fortuites,
                        qu'il est bien malaisé de dire dans une ville en voie de transformation quel
                        quartier prévaudra sur les antres. Si une telle évaluation n'est pas
                        toujours 1 facile dans les quartiers déjà tormés et d'un plein rapport, elle
                        est entourée de bien plus de difficultés et souvent presque impossible an
                        moment où une ville s'agrandit et commence à utiliser de toute parts des
                        terrains restés im-1 productifs jusqu'alors. </p>
                    <p>Les grandes sociétés immobilières, ellesmêmes, arrivent à peine à se
                        constituer des élément objectifs d'appréciation, malgré tous les moyens
                        d'investigation qu'elles ont sous la main, malgré les spécialistes dont
                        elles s'assurent le concours. Quant au gros des acheteurs il se laisse
                        guider uniquement par des impres. sions subjectives. </p>
                    <p>Maintenant que la hausse a duré près de trois ans et qu'ane réaction sérieuse
                        s'est fait sentir, les traits essentiels qui ont caractérisé à le mouvement
                        se dessinent avec plus de nettet et il est possible d'en tracer un tablean
                        générale permettant de tirer certaines conclusions quant. à l'avenir
                        immédiat qui l'attend. </p>

                        d'Alexandrie en quatre catégories. </p>
                    <p>La première comprend, dans les centres, les p quartiers qui ont été accaparés
                        par les bureaux et magasins (1). Ils ont bénéficié par leur transformation
                        même d'une plus-value conside-11 rable, car les locaux affectés à des
                        banques, des bureaux et des magasins de toute sorte rap portent bien plus
                        que des maisons d'habitation, la surtout quand celles ei se composent de
                        villas avec jardins comme cela était le cas naguère pour l'Ismailieh. Nous
                        devons ranger dans la même catégorie les quartiers limitrophes de ces
                        centres d'affaires. Une plus-value analogne, dans une certaine mesure, est
                        résultée pour eux de ce fait. </p>
                    <p>Les prix atteints dans ces quartiers sont considérés par beaucoup de
                        personnes comme eragérés et devant amener la ruine là où ils sont pratiqués.
                        Ils nous semble au contraire que si la hausse a été trop rapide, elle a
                        rarement dépassé dans ces quartiers un niveau raisonnable. Et nous basons
                        notre opinion non pas tant sur la comparaison des prix payés dans </p>
                    <p>(1) Les affa res se concentrent aa Caire days leo kartiers da Mousky, de
                        l'Ezbékieb at de l'Istila; Alexandrie,elles ont deux centres principaux,
                        l'un autour de la Bourse de Minet </p>
                    <p>1- Bassal, l'autre dans la rue Chérif et les to Avoisinantes.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>les différentes villes en Europe et en Orient que sur les éléments mêmes de
                        plus-value qui se sont manifestes au Caire et à Alexandrie. </p>
                    <p>La valeur de la propriété urbaine peut difficilement se comparer d'une ville
                        à l'autre et encore moins de pays pays. Ces paralleles ne peuvent donner que
                        des indications et nous y reviendrons plus loin Les conditions de la vie,
                        les revenus des habitants, le mouvement des affaires, les b néfices moyens
                        et le taux de capitalisation, la disponibilité plus ou moins grande de
                        terrains aptes à servir à des bats spéciaux, les facilités de
                        décentralisation, sont autant de facteurs qui déterminent cette valeur et
                        qui varient à l'infini. Nous remarquerons toutefois que, même en Europe od
                        les moyens de communication plus nombreux que dans les pays nouveaux rendent
                        facile l'extension des centres habités dans la campagne environnante, |
                        souvent dans les quartiers des affaires, les terrains atteignent et
                        dépassent les prix pratiques au Caire et cela même dans les villes de
                        deuxième ordre (2) </p>
                    <p>Au Caire et à Alexandrie, sauf pour les lots jouissant d'une situation
                        exceptionnelle comme </p>
                    <p>situation, le prix táarehand des terrains chers -est de 30 à 40 liv. ég.,
                        soit 750 à 1,000 fraues. </p>
                    <p>Nous parlons bien entendu de moyennes et nous excluons certains prix de
                        fantaisie pratiqués les derniers temps. Ces prix trouvent comme nous l'avons
                        dit leur justification dans les conditions mêmes qui se sont combinées en
                        Egypte d'une façon particulièrement favorable à la propriété urbaine </p>
                    <p>Nous avons assez parlé des modifications de la vie économique pour ne pas
                        avoir besoin d'y revenir, mais nous devons relever tout spéciale ment que,
                        malgré toutes les transformation qu'elles ont suscitées, la quantité de
                        terrains vraiment aptes à servir aux besoins com merciaux et financiers est
                        assez limitée et leur extension malaisée. L'état déplorable des quartiers
                        arabes, les moyens de transport encore assez restreints dans certains
                        quartiers, le Nil qui borde les quartiers ayant le plus profité du mouvement
                        récent, sont autant de barrières qai forcent les commerçants, les banquiers,
                        les directeurs de grandes sociétés à choisir l'emplacement de leurs magasins
                        et bureaux dans des limites assez restreintes. Alexandrie étant enserrée de
                        tous côtés, les quartiers spéciaux dont nous parlons y sont encore plus
                        nettement délimit s. </p>
                    <p>Cette compétition des locataires a fait bauxser les loyers en dehors de toute
                        proportion avec les prix des terrains. Néanmoins les bénéfices | qu'assure
                        l'Egypte aux affaires bien comprises et sérieusement dirigées, bénéfices qui
                        ont attire tant de capitaux européens, ont permis aux grandes entreprises de
                        payer facilement jusqu'ic. ces loyers élevés. </p>
                    <p>(à suivre) </p>
                    <p>(2) Nous donnerons à titre de simple indication quelques-uns de ces prix que
                        nous avons pu recueillir. Sans parler de New-York,où dans </p>
                    <p>ne vente récente on a atteint le prix de 56 liv. ég. par pied carré, soit
                        15,000 francs par mètre arré, ni du Strand de Londres où l'on vend
                        couramment le pied carré à des prix exorbitants sur la façade. A Geneve on
                        paje actuellement sur les quais jusqu'à 2,000 francs le mètre carré ; dans
                        la rue du Mont-Blanc, qui aboutit à la gare et constitue par ounséquent un
                        centre commercial, le prix de 1,000 et 1,200 fraves est comnian. </p>
                    <p>Parisne possède pas de centre exclusifcomme Londres ou New York; néaumoins,
                        entre les Champs-Elysées et le Louvre, le m tre carré se vend de 1,000 à
                        1,700 francs et beaucoup de terrains bien situés de passent 2,000 francs. </p>
                    <p>A Lyon, les prix des terrains varient sur la place Bellecour et la rue de la
                        République de 1,200 à 1,500 francs le inètre carre : dans les Tues
                        commerçantes de Bordeaux on les paie 500 à 600 francs ; à Marseille, le
                        centre entre la préfecture et le Cour Belzunce se paie de 500 and 2.000
                        fraues suivant la situation. Si nous nous rapprochons plus de l'Egypte nous
                        voyons qu'à Athènes les terrains entourant la place de la Constitution
                        trouvent facilement acheteur entre 900 et 1,000 francs et cependant Athènes
                        est loin d'avoir un mouvement d'affaires comparable à celai du Caire et
                        d'Alexandrie. </p>
