                    <head>THE CALIPHATE.</head>
                    <p>An interesting point has been raised by 
                    Canon McColl, who maintains that the Sultan 
                    of Turkey is not, and never has been, Caliph; 
                    that the spiritual power is rested solely in the 
                    Sheik-ul-Islam. The importance of the point 
                    exists in the fact that were the Sultan truly 
                    Caliph Mohammedans in every country would 
                    be compelled to obey his orders and fight against 
                    their rulers. Canon McColl's assertion is sup-
                    ported by the fact that when Abdul Hamid 
                    inaugurated his great Pan Islamic crusade, 
                    although some success was won among lesser 
                    tribes, the Sultans of Morooco and Zanzibar 
                    laughed to scorn the emissaries of the "Shadow 
                    of God" and “Refuge of the World”—by which 
                    unassuming titles the Sultan is known. The 
                    supreme spiritual head of the Church in 
                    Turkey is the Sheik-ul-Islam. The relations 
                    between himself and the Saltan are of a com-
                    plicated, even grimly ludicrous, character, 
                    unparalleled throughout the world.</p>
                    <p>The Caliph must be of the Prophet's tribe, 
                    but that distinction cannot be claimed for the 
                    Sultan. Seeing that mothers of Turkish Sultans, 
                    are almost insatiably slaves, there is very, 
                    little but plebeian blood left in the Turkish 
                    royal family. Still, heir he is born, and, with 
                    miraculous luck, Sultan he becomes. As such 
                    it is his privilege to lay hands upon the relics, 
                    of Mohamed. This the Sheik-ul-Islam may not 
                    do. Now, the Sultan nominates, and may 
                    depose, the Sheik-ul-Islam. But this is a re-
                    ciprocal arrangement, for if the Sultan-
                    amiable subjects determine to murder or other-
                    wise efface their lord they may not do so 
                    until the formal written permission of the 
                    Sheik-ul-Islam has been given. Moreover, if he 
                    wishes to make any appeal to the Faithful, he 
                    must so appeal through this potent priset. 
                    Without the consent of the letter he cannot 
                    promulgate any new dogma, neither can he 
                    alter any item of the Islamic ritual. He must 
                    have this high dignitary about him, and must 
                    appoint him; but, having made the appoint-
                    ment, he has set up his own master and given 
                    into his hands the mastery of hie life and death.</p>

                    <p>London, September 4.</p> 
                    <p>The "Daily Mail” has published the account 
                    of an interview with Prince von Buelow, who 
                    is reported to have repudiated the idea that 
                    Germany thinks of competing with England
                    for the mastery of the sea; her object was 
                    merely commercial rivalry. He declared that 
                    Germany's interests in Persia and the Bagdad 
                    railway were purely commercial. The King 
                    and the Emperor William at their recent 
                    meeting did not discuss acute political ques-
                    tions, as such did not exist between England 
                    and Germany. The meeting marked an suspi-
                    cions stage on the road to the elimination of 
                    misunderstandings. (Reuter)</p>

                    <p>MALTESE INFANT MORTALITY.</p>
                    <p>Many persons begin to be appalled by the 
                    infant mortality of Malta. They give expres-
                    sion to their alarm and anxiety in the local 
                    newspapers, particularly in the Italian section 
                    of them. It is not clear how the frightful loss 
                    of infant lives is caused nor how it can be 
                    lessened. Official statistics just published show 
                    the general death-rate to have been for the 
                    last governmental year 26 per 1,000 of the 
                    population, whereas children under one year 
                    have perished at the rate of 244 for every 1,000 
                    born. The death rate of children under five 
                    years of age ascends to 53 per cent. of the 
                    general death-rate.</p>

                    that year, and that the year began on what 
                    would now be July 19. He bases his assertion

                    <p>It may interest oar readers to know some-
                    thing about the new American Mission School 
                    at Luxor. It is a very large one, capable of 
                    accommodating 5OO girl boarders. The building, 
                    which cost about £9.000, is now nearly com-
                    plete, and it is considered the best structure 
                    of its kind in Egypt. It is unique too in 
                    being erected upon the avenue of sphinxes 
                    leading from the sacred temple at Karnac 
                    to the temple at Luxor. Such a school should
                    prove a great blessing to Upper Egypt, not 
                    only for its strictly educational value, but 
                    also because it is training so many native 
                    girls to become good wives and mothers. It 
                    is very fortunate in possessing such an ex-
                    cellent Head Mistress as Miss Buchanan, 
                    who is a cultivated and large-minded woman 
                    with her heart in the work, and is aided by a 
                    good staff of teachers. The School will open 
                    on Wednesday, September 5th, when the au-
                    tumn term begins.</p>

                    <p>With a view be placing the study of science 
                    on a better footing the Ministry of Public 
                    Instruction so long ago as July, 1905, present-
                    ed s note to the Council of Ministers recom-
                    mending the division into scientific and 
                    literary sections of the State secondary schools, 
                    so that students could follow more successfully 
                    the particular branch of study of their choice. 
                    On Sunday 55 bachelors of science and 28 
                    bachelors of letters applied to the Khedivial 
                    school of Medicine, for admission. The Director 
                    informed them, however, that by a letter of 
                    from the Ministry of Public Instruction, not 
                    more than 40 bachelors of science could be 
                    admitted at a time, so that the superfluous 15 
                    would have to call again on Saturday, to be 
                    listed. Regarding the bachelors of letters, the 
                    Director regretted his inability to accept them, 
                    and advised them to go and study medicine in 
                    England, whence they would be officially 
                    recommended to the Egyptian Ministry of 
                    Public Instruction. Our friend the "Moayad" 
                    begs the Government to enter the 15 bachelors 
                    of science to the Polytechnic School.</p>

                    tion in the Abdin district of Cairo on Monday 
                    night by three Greek sobjects. A police officer, 
                    accompanied by shawishes, speedily arrived 
                    on the scene of the affray, hot experienced 
                    considerable trouble in quelling the disturbance 
                    which was caused, and only succeeded in 
                    arresting two of the three men, who were 
                    intoxicated. In the course of the disturbance 
                    a gas pipe was broken and a fire broke out, 
                    but was speedily extinguished.</p>
                    <p>So runs the report. We do not intend, 
                    however, to state these as the exact details 
                    of the case, which we hold over for confirma-
                    tion. We are informed by the Ministry of 
                    the Interior that two British soldiers were 
                    attacked on that night, but at the time of 
                    our inquiries they were unable to give us 
                    any particulars of the affray, or state whether 
                    the victims were officers or privates. We 
                    also made enquiries at the Cairo Headquarters 
                    of the Army of Occupation and received 
                    as a reply that we were the first to have given 
                    that office any information of an attack having 
                    occurred.</p>
                    <p>The following is the version of the "Journal 
                    da Caire” :</p>
                    <p>On Monday evening the police officer of 
                    Abdin district was informed that three natives, 
                    in a state of intoxication, had seriously assault-
                    ed two British officers in the midan of the 
                    Opera. On arrival on this square, he found 
                    three persons striking the shawishies who were 
                    holding them. After a lively resistance he 
                    took them to the caracol. While the officer was 
                    drawing op the procès verbal, one of the assail-
                    ants Alexander Kodsi, snatched it from him 
                    and tore it up, and at the same time, G. 
                    Arakgi upset the writing table on the officer, 
                    and wounded him. The third attacked the 
                    shawishes and hit them repeatedly. The three 
                    ruffians were overpowered, however, and con-
                    fined. Soon afterwards a fire broke oat owing 
                    to the carrying away of the gas-pipe in the 
                    prison. The shawishes promptly put the fire 
                    out. The enquiry has found these ruffians to 
                    be Greeks, of evil antecedents.</p>

                    that steamer, came to greet Prince Mohamed 
                    Aly Pasha, who was among the passengers. The 
                    brother of His Highness the Khedive is 
                    beloved by the Egyptians and the “Young Egyp-

                    the latter's book is still in the minds of all 
                    and fully proves his sincere patriotism. When 
                    Helbawi Bey draw near the Prince to greet 
                    him His Highness refused to hold out his hand 
                    to him, and addressed to him some painful 
                    and wounding words, which we will refrain 
                    from mentioning. When His Highness was 
                    asked by tbe Captain of the steamer as to the 
                    gentlemen whom he would invite to his table, 
                    Prince Mohamrd Aly replied "all the Egyptian 
                    passengers except one named Helbawi.” Such 
                    is the Prince’s patriotism, which is a good 
                    lesson. The existence of such a spirit in our 
                    princes and leaders is welcome.</p>

                    <p>The plastering and repairing of the interior 
                    of All Saints' Church is making good progress, 
                    but owing to a certain amount of delay in 
                    commencing operations there is little likeli-
                    hood of the work being finished before the 
                    end of the month. So long as the work is in 
                    hand it is impossible to hold the accustomed 
                    services on Fridays and Saints' days, conse-
                    quently in the calendar they have bean omit-
                    ted, but should the repairs be completed before 
                    the close of September, these services will, of 
                    course, be at once resumed. Notice of their 
                    resumption will be given out at the Sunday 
                    services and printed in General Orders.</p>
                    <p>The services on the last three Sundays in 
                    August have been held in the Boulac Chapel 
                    and North Aisle. The organ it rather far 
                    away from the choir, and this adds somewhat 
                    to the difficulties of a choir, reduced in num-
                    bers, and of Mr. Mackintosh, the new organist, 
                    but they have successfully triumphed over 
                    these difficulties, while the compactness of the 
                    congregation has made the service more hearty 
                    and the attendance to appear larger than 
                    usual. Mr. Roddam, who bas been such a 
                    pillar of strength to the choir, both in the 
                    regularity of his attendances at services and 
                    practices and in the never failing power of his 
                    voice, has left for three months, having gone 
                    to England on leave. He carries with him 
                    the good wishes of all who know him for a 
                    very happy holiday.</p>

                    <head>MR. MEIMARACHI’S POSITION.</head>
                    <p>The rumour of Mr. Constantine Meimarachi’s 
                    resignation of the Managing Directorship of 
                    Walker and Meimarachi Limited has created 
                    considerable stir locally, for that gentleman 
                    commanded the confidence of the shareholders, 
                    and was generally regarded as the moving 
                    spirit of the Company. All sorts and kinds of 
                    reports have been afloat as to whether he had 
                    or had not resigned, and many and various 
                    have been the reasons given for this step. On 
                    the other hand, the "Phare d'Alexandrie" on 
                    Monday stated that the differences between 
                    Mr. Meimarachi and the London Board had been 
                    settled and that consequently the resignation 
                    had been withdrawn. We regret to state that 
                    our contemporary’s optimistic statements are 
                    inexact. Mr. Meimarachi is at present in 
                    France with his family, and will only go 
                    to London in the middle of this month, 
                    when the Board of Directors will hold a 
                    meeting. At this meeting Mr. Meimara.
                    chi will present his report on the working 
                    of the Company during the past year. 
                    At this meeting the Board of Directors 
                    will discuss the question of the construction of 
                    the new Cairo stores. In case the Board 
                    refuses to sanction Mr. Meimarachi's plans 
                    and programme he will send in his resignation. 
                    It is sincerely to be hoped that the Board will 
                    approve all Mr. Meimarachi’s plans and will 
                    give him a free hand to do his utmost for the 
                    development of the Company, whose welfare 
                    he has so sincerely at heart. But assuming 
                    that the contrary happens, and that Mr. 
                    Meimarachi finds that he is obliged to tender 
                    his resignation, we presume that a general 
                    meeting of the shareholders of the company 
                    will be convened in Egypt, for no less 
                    than seven-eighths of the total shares are 
                    held at Cairo and Alexandria and almost all 
                    the shares are in the hands of friends and
                    acquaintances of Mr. Meimarachi. Possibly 
                    therefore the shareholders will demand that 
                    the London Board should be done away with. 
                    That board costs the shareholders about £2,000 
                    a year and there does not appear to be any 
                    valid reason for its existence, as, in our 
                    opinion, the best site for the Board is at Cain, 
                    the London Board being really a superfluous 
                    luxury.</p>

                    declared that the resolutions voted on at

                    are of no effect and will now be voted as 
                    follows:—</p>
                    <p>The meeting approved of the amalgamation 
                    of the Building Lands of Egypt with the 
                    Egyptian Trust and Investment Limited by 
                    the absorption of the latter Company, and on

                    of the two Companies.</p>
                    <p>The meeting decided to increase the capital

                    of £4 to bear rank "pari passu” with those 
                    already issued. These 60,000 shares will be

                    <head>THE YEMEN.</head>
                    <p>The two transports bought by the Turkish 
                    Government in England have left Smyrna with 
                    3,000 recruits on board for the Yemen. It 
                    appears that a disturbance broke out on board 
                    one of the vessels, the men objecting to going 
                    to the Yemen, but the movement was repressed 
                    without difficulty, and the vessels continued on 
                    their voyage. Two transports arrived at Kavak 
                    some days ago with recruits from Black Sea 
                    ports also bound for the Yemen, bat they mu-
                    tinied and seized and bound their officers, 
                    refusing at all costs to go to the Yemen, 
                    whence they declared none of their comrades 
                    had ever returned. They were willing to die 
                    for the Sultan in any other part of the Empire 
                    but not the Yemen. An aide de-camp from the 
                    Sultan was sent on board and after some nego-
                    tiation the men received assurances that they 
                    would not be required to continue their 
                    voyage. They immediately released their offi-
                    cers and were subsequently landed in Constan-
                    tinople were they have been enrolled in the

                    <p>Suakio, Angnst 29.</p>
                    <p>Terrible washouts have again occurred in 
                    several places, and the line has been inter-
                    rupted now 1er over a month. Several bridges 
                    will have to be added to the Suakin-Atbara 
                    line so as to allow a free passage of the water, 
                    which come down in torrents over 1,000 feet 
                    wide and about 8 to 10 feet deep. The Khors 
                    are far too wide for a few bridges of 100 feet 
                    span, so that now the rush of water with its 
                    full force is bound to wash away the earth-
                    banks adjoining the bridges. Of course these 
                    large washouts were not foreseen when the 
                    line was in construction as this year’s wash-
                    outs are the biggest seen for many years. The 
                    soldiers and Berbereen labourers are working 
                    very hard under the supervision of Bimbashis 
                    Newcombe and Lord to make new embank-
                    ments where the lines have been washed out. 
                    The force of the water was so strong that it 
                    washed away heavy iron girders and huge 
                    rocks for a distance of a few kilometres.
                    The British steamer "Langdale” arrived here 
                    from England on the 25th inst., with a large 
                    consignment of railway material for the Sudan 
                    Government Railways, including 11,000 bags 
                    of cement and 10 bridges.</p>

                    <p>Italy is greatly improving her commerce 
                    with Egypt, especially in silk. She is now on 
                    a level with France in her exportation of silk 
                    into Egypt, and even the French Chamber of 
                    Commerce in Alexandria foresees that Italy 
                    will be the entire mistress of the silk trade in 
                    Egypt. One reason for this is that Italian silk 
                    is cheaper and lighter than French silk. One 
                    quality especially, called "silk zephyr,” which 
                    has recently been launched on the Alexandria 
                    market has met with the greatest favour. It 
                    is made plain, striped, figured and embroi-
                    dered in open work. Its price varies from 1 1/2f 
                    to 2 1/2f It is a lovely material for ladies’ 
                    blouses for summer, as well as for Orientals to 
                    wear. It ought to be a success on the English

                    fikths (school masters) and arifs (oshera) :— 
                    Out of 1,325 candidates, 327 fikihs and 241 
                    arifs passed the examination ; of these six

                    <head>NOTES FROM BEYROUT.</head>
                    <head>NEW DRAINAGE SCHEME.</head>
                    <head>AN ELECTRIC TRAMWAY-</head>
                    <p>(From our Correspondent.)</p>
                    <p>Beyrout, August 27.</p>
                    <p>The drainage scheme to which I referred in 
                    my last notes is beginning to crystallize into 
                    palpable shape. The Monicipality is now 
                    buildiog at the end of the Damascus road, 
                    which opens into the Square, a few meters of 
                    subterranean vaulted sewer of solid masonry, 
                    by way of trial, in order to determine the pre-
                    cise cost per meter, and thus be in a position 
                    to properly assess the properties on both sides 
                    of tbe roads through which the sewers are 
                    proposed to be made. I had mentioned that 
                    the rate of contribution, according to which 
                    the Municipality had called upon the proprie-
                    tors to subscribe, was fixed at 100 piastres per 
                    meter; I am now informed by the Mayor, 
                    who has the credit of being the initiator of 
                    this excellent scheme, that simultaneously 
                    with the construction of the sewers the laying 
                    of paved sidewalks will be undertaken, and the 
                    rate of construction is estimated to amount 
                    then to L.T. 2 per meter of built property. 
                    This up-to-date system of covered sewerage 
                    will incalculably improve the sanitation of the 
                    town. The fact of Beyrout being built on a n
                    atural amphitheatre will, by the rather steep 
                    inclination of most of the roads, constitute in 
                    itself a great source of economy. The sidewalks 
                    prove another boon to the inhabitants. The 
                    promiscuity of traffic in the streets of Beyrout 
                    is as ludicrous as it is revolting. Carriages, 
                    cars, trucks, uncouth camels with bulky and 
                    obstructive burdens, mules and donkeys with 
                    equally cumbersome loads, and riders of horses, 
                    mulee, and donkeys, share with the poor pedes- 
                    train the limited space of our streets. Indeed 
                    the human species has the worst part of the 
                    road, and to cap his miseries, lounging, idle, 
                    dirty dogs beset his path, and would resent 
                    with a growl or a snarl any summary request 
                    en the part of the passer-by to make way. 
                    But, great as is this nuisance of dogs, it has i
                    ts good side, and I, for one, believe that without 
                    these energetic scavengers heaps of fermenting 
                    domestic refuse would fill the atmosphere of 
                    the town with noxious exhalations. These 
                    scavengers perform their duty at least more 
                    conscientiously than their paid biped collea-
                    gues of the Municipality.</p>
                    <p>Electric Tramway.</p>
                    <p>The people of Beyrout are awaiting with 
                    great anxiety the beginnings of this important 
                    scheme, which is not only calculated to bring 
                    about a better condition of the roads, and 
                    develop the town in different ways, but will 
                    also deliver people of modest means from the 
                    unrestrained insolence and tyranny of carriage-
                    drivers. It had been said that the Company’s 
                    engineer was to return here in October next, 
                    to start the work forthwith. I have been in-
                    formed by the President of the Municipality 
                    that he recently received a telegram from the 
                    engineer advising him of his arrival at Brussels, 
                    and adding that he was forwarding particulars 
                    by letter. Although things in the East are apt 
                    to evolve rather slowly, yet in this instance the 
                    fact of the Electric Tramway Company having 
                    already bought some land at the outskirts of 
                    the town for the erection of its depot station 
                    is an earnest of the accomplishmennt of the 
                    scheme.</p>
                    <p>An American Horse Collector.</p>
                    <p>The famous American cartoonist, Mr. Homer 
                    Davenport, arrived here lately with two 
                    wealthy Americans enamoured of sport and 
                    travel. Mr. Davenport has for his main object 
                    in this visit the purchase of the best Arab 
                    breds. He has unfortunately been forestalled 
                    by a party of Italians, who last week sailed 
                    by the Florio Rubattino steamer with the 
                    finest specimens of Arab bred horses, destined 
                    for the Italian Royal studs. It is said, however, 
                    that a large tribe of about 1,400 Bedouins 
                    have migrated lately from the Northern re-
                    gions between the Tigris and Euphrates to 
                    the plains of Hama and Homs, with all their 
                    cattle and horses, and this may afford this 
                    American horse collector an exceptional oppor-
                    tunity to come across some fine specimens, 
                    without having to travel extensively in the 
                    interior and lose much time and money. In 
                    the meantime these three travellers are having 
                    extra fine sport in the bountiful regions around 
                    Alexandretta and Antioch, and they are said 
                    to be provided with rifles of the most perfect-
                    ed type, mounted with small telescopes for 
                    long distance shooting. I hear from the 
                    American Consul that Mr. Davenport is ex-
                    pected back here in about a fortnight, and 
                    that be intends giving a lecture on cartooning, 
                    which he may be illustrating with extempore 
                    rough cartoons on a screen ad hoc. This 
                    would certainly be a rare occasion.</p>
                    <p>U.S. Vice-Consul.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Megelsen, United States Vice-Consul, 
                    who is acting for the Consul General, pending 
                    the arrival of Mr G. Bie Ravndal, has been 
                    appointed Consul at Baghdad. While his 
                    friends are pleased at this promotion, yet 
                    they, and, indeed many of the Beyroutines, 
                    will regret the departure of a capable gentle 
                    man who has lived so many years in this 
                    country and taken such an intelligent interest 
                    in its economic development.</p>

                    <p>To the Editor of the “Egyptian Gazette.” </p>
                    <p>Sir,—Are the Alexandria City Police or the 
                    Manicipality making any attempt to prevent 
                    the public health being injured by tinned and 
                    canned foods? After the shocking revelations 
                    of American methods, as given in "The Jun-
                    gle,” surely the authorities in Egypt ought 
                    to take some measures to protect the public. 
                    I noticed the following paragraph in the latest 
                    English newspapers:—</p>
                    <p>"At a meeting of the Devon Standing Joint 
                    Committee the Chief Constable (Mr. F.R.C. 
                    Coleridge) reported that during the three 
                    months ended July 31 the police, acting as 
                    inspectors under the Food and Drags Act, 
                    took forty samples of tidied, canned, and 
                    potted meats. He regretted to say that grave 
                    fault had been found with those of foreign 
                    brands, the county analyst having in some 
                    cases certified the contents of tins to be unfit 
                    for human consumption. He suggested that 
                    the Committee, in the interest of the public, 
                    might think right to authorise him to issue 
                    some warning on the subject”</p>
                    <p>This is the way the authorities should act 
                    here in the imperative interests of public 
                    health.		Truly yours</p>

                    <p>GAMBLING IN EGYPT.</p>
                    <p>To the Editor op the "Egyptian Gazette”.</p>
                    <p>Sir,—In one of the native papers I have 
                    recently read a article about an aggressive 
                    war against some of the police officials when 
                    raiding a gambling den, in Cairo, and how the 
                    proprietors of that hell brought untamed dogs 
                    to attack the raiders.</p>
                    <p>By chance, after reading that article. I took 
                    the "Review of Reviews, where I found that in 
                    Australia, most aggressive wars are occurring 
                    against the authority. Two paragraphs quoted 
                    here will show how the officials when raiding 
                    are met:—</p>
                    <p>(1) ”In four successive cases, detectives and 
                    witnesses who had been active against gam-
                    bling were set upon in the dark, brutally ill 
                    used and left sensless, or attacked in their 
                    own homes by bombs."</p>
                    <p>(2) "The thing is a nest of scoundrels, a 
                    den of thieves, saturating the community with 
                    a gambling spirit, and not content with that, 
                    carrying an aggressive war of evil against 
                    constituted authority.”</p>
                    <p>Very glad to say that such attacks in Egypt 
                    are not known, but in course of time, we may 
                    think it possible that the gamblers and the 
                    directors of the gambling dens, when more 
                    oppressed and annoyed, will do the same.</p>

                    <p>An Egyptian.</p>

                    derniers temps.</p>
                    <p>Cet état est dù au changement rapide et 
                    imprévu de l'eau brute du canal, à la suite de 
                    la nouvelle crue. Une quantité d'alun plus con-
                    sidérable a été employée pour purifier l’eau,

                    <p>Il y a lieu de remarquer que malgré cet état

                    <p>Le juge des référés du Tribunal mixte du 
                    Caire était appelé à rendre un jugement dans 
                    une affaire très délicate. Une de nos plus 
                    jolies et spirituelles mondaines, Mme X., qui 
                    se trouve actuellement en villégiature à San 
                    Stefano, a été assignée par on médecin den-
                    tiste très connu de notre ville. M. W., qui lui 
                    avait prêté ses soins. La belle défenderesse 
                    déclare que le traitement imposé par le den-
                    tiste lui causait de si vives souffrances qu’elle 
                    n’a pu le continuer. Le médecin prétend que 
                    ce n’est que par caprice que sa gentille cliente 
                    n’a pas continué le traitement, ce dernier étant 
                    conforme aux rigoureux enseignements de la 
                    science.</p>
                    <p>Maltre Merzbach, le sympathique substitut 
                    de Mtre Carton de Wiart, occupait pour M. 
                    W., Mtre Fatica pour Mme X.</p>
                    <p>Le premier a demandé une expertise sor la 
                    bouche de la capricieuse cliente ; le second une 
                    descente sur les lieux dans la cabinet du peu 
                    galant médecin dentiste.</p>
                    <p>M. Vasquez, juge des référés, a rendu sa-
                    medi son ordonnance, tort bien motivée, et a 
                    déclaré n’y avoir lien ni à référé, ni `a exper-
                    tise, et a condamné le docteur aux frais.</p>

                    <p>La bonne tendance de ces derniers jours

                    ces derniers, c’est -que le terme ne se vend 
                    guère plus cher que le comptant.</p>
                    <p>Parmi les titres qui montrent du soutien 
                    il faut citer l’Agricole qui est ferme à 9 23/32, 
                    la Delta Light à 11 3/4 et la Cassa di Sconto 
                    à 226.</p>

                    <p>The murderous outrage at the house of M. 
                    Stolypin, the Russian Premier—which, so far 
                    as its intended victim was concerned, was 
                    happily a failure—can only awaken horror 
                    even among the most earnest sympathizers 
                    with the cause of liberty in Russia. M. Stoly-
                    pin, however ineffective his policy may have 
                    been, is personally a blameless and amiable 
                    figure. He took the Premiership with the 
                    intention of offering moderate reforms, and he 
                    began by negotiating with leading politicians 
                    of the Octobrist party tor places in his Cabinet.
                    If these negotiations proved unsuccessful and 
                    M. Stolypin’s position soon became ambiguous, 
                    it is because the hidden forces of reaction are 
                    still too strong to be combated by a statesman 
                    who holds his mandate not from the people 
                    but from the Tsar. (“Times.”)</p>

                    <p>Reaction even in its blackest form would be 
                    preferable to the anarchy of the Terror, But 
                    the choice need not be, and ought not to be, 
                    between these two extremes. The great 
                    majority of educated people in Russia are in 
                    favour of a Constitutional Monarchy, and 
                    would gladly rally to the support of the 
                    Grand Dukes and the Court, and call together 
                    a real Cabinet of Reform, without neutralising 
                    its political complexion, as was done in the 
                    case of M. Stolypin’s Cabinet, by the inclusion 
                    of Ministers purposely chosen to act as a drag 
                    on their chief. It looks to outsiders as though 
                    the occasion called for common action on the 
                    part of the Octobrists and the Cadets or Con-
                    stitutional Democrats who are in general 
                    agreement on their broad lines of policy—to 
                    prove to the world that the Terrorists are not 
                    the only earnest politicians in Russia.</p>

                    <p>The general attitude of -Frenchmen towards 
                    the Church is one of indulgent indifference. 
                    On the other hand, they are quietly deter-
                    mined that on no conceivable consideration 
                    shall the foundations of the Republic be 
                    shaken. The system of government which 
                    was based on the ruins of a profligate, cor-
                    rupt, adventurous, and unsettling Empire 
                    has given peace and confidence to the nation 
                    —has preserved its peace and maintained 
                    its confidence through several anxious crises. 
                    Unfortunately, some of the men who have 
                    distinguished themselves by zeal for the Church 
                    are equally well known tor their antipathy 
                    to the Republic. It was a bad day for Roman 
                    Catholicism in France when some of its leaders 
                    formed an alliance with the Nationalists, and 
                    thus identified its spiritual claims with a 
                    disturbing and disloyal movement.</p>

                    wrong, the non-tipper's life is seldom unattend-

                    <p>Mr. Roosevelt's conversion to the doctrine 
                    of the reformed spelling is no new thing. It 
                    has grown out of his profound admiration for 
                    the works of the late Mr. Artemus Ward, who, 
                    as all the world knows, was one of the earliest 
                    pioneers of this reform.</p>
                    <p>We understand that the presidential mandate 
                    applies—for the moment, at any rate—to the 
                    American language only, but if England does 
                    not soon fall into line it will be regarded as 
                    a breach of the Monroe doctrine, and, there-
                    fore, as a distinctly unfriendly act.</p>
                    <p>We also hear, by the way, that the Kaiser, 
                    not to be outdone by the second strongest 
                    in the world, is shortly issuing a code of rules 
                    of English syntax, under which any misuse of 
                    the unsplit infinitive will be regarded as lèse 
                    majesté, and punishable by ten years’ solitary 
                    confinement in a military fortress.</p>

                    <p>Few deep thinkers have devoted much atten-
                    tion to the subject of male costume. Centuries 
                    ago, a great intellect found that a couple of 
                    battons on the back of the coat would keep 
                    the sword belt in position. Though none of us 
                    habitually wear swords, or even swords belts, 
                    with our frock coats, we still retain the buttons 
                    invented by the great intellect. Since his death, 
                    little was done for us when M. Gibus invented 
                    the opera hat. Now, that really was a useful 
                    thing. It is astounding, therefore, that we, who 
                    have retained the two buttons, should have 
                    discarded the opera hat.. Nothing is more 
                    disastrous to a silk hat than theatre wear, 
                    except, of course, church wear. Why shouldn’t 
                    we wear opera hats when we go to church? If 
                    you saw your solicitor on Sunday wearing 
                    his opera hat, you would withdraw your 
                    trust moneys from his keeping.</p>

                        <p>The increasing activity of German shipping 
                        in the Mediterranean is causing the American 
                        Consul General at Marseilles much anxiety.</p>
                        <p>Until a year ago, he states in a recent report, 
                        the German flag was inconspicuous in the 
                        Mediterranean. German steamers to the United 
                        States and to the Far East called at Italian 
                        ports only, principally for passengers and emi-
                        grants. The only important concern then 
                        operating from Marseilles was the East African 
                        Company, with ships going as far as Durhan 
                        (Natal). Since then a complete charge of policy 
                        has been adopted, with a consequent feeling of 
                        uneasiness among shipowners of other nations, 
                        and probably also of irritation in circles acus-
                        tomed to regard as peculiarly their own that 
                        large volume of trade handled at Marseilles.</p>
                        <p>The first visible sign of the German shipping 
                        invasion was the establishment of a weekly 
                        line of fine and fast North German Lloyd 
                        steamers between Marseilles and Alexandria. 
                        Next came the announcement of a semi-
                        monthly service organised by tbe German 
                        Levant and North German Lloyd companies 
                        between Marseilles Constantinople, Batoim, 
                        and intermediate ports.</p>
                        <p>The North German Lloyd Company has 
                        arranged to have its steamers from Australia 
                        call at Marseilles every month, thus duplicat-
                        ing present French and British services, and 
                        it seems a fair inference, although it is not 
                        announced, that the same steamers will call 
                        at this port on their journey outward.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the Hamburg-American Company 
                        announces a new monthly service from Mir-
                        seilles to the Persian Golf. Complaint is voiced 
                        in France that this sudden accession of interest 
                        on the part of German shipowners in this part 
                        of the world is not explained by traffis require-
                        ments. At Genoa, numerous German lines call 
                        regularly, and it is evident that a ruinous sys-
                        tem is being arranged whereby every region 
                        will be connected eventually and made to 
                        constitute an efficient feeder for German con-
                        merce, and probably also for the heavy German 
                        railway investment in Turkey.</p>
                        <p>It is scarcely to be presumed, adds the 
                        Consul, that old French and British companies, 
                        which have worked together fairly well in the 
                        Mediterranean and the Black Sea, will fail to 
                        answer this challenge.</p>

                        holders of the Compagnie des Messageries 
                        Maritimes, the most important of the French 
                        navigation companies, an increase in the capi-

                        <p>It is a striking fact that science and morality 
                        are now at one in ruling alcohol to be a 
                        danger to the human being. Human nature 
                        being what it is, the rational arguments which 
                        science brings against alcohol are at least as 
                        likely to make for temperance as the trascen-
                        dental arguments which religion employs. It 
                        has for years been observed by mountain clim-
                        bers that work in the high altitudes, which 
                        most severely tries human vitality, it better 
                        accomplised by abstainers, and it is, of course, 
                        a commonplace that any insurance will give 
                        special terms to teetotallers, because their 
                        expectation of life is longer than even that of 
                        the most moderate drinkers. If alcohol be 
                        injurious and poisonous, the abstainer’s longer 
                        life is explained; while if alcohol be a harmless 
                        drag or a valuable food, the insurance results 
                        are quite inexplicable.—“Daily Mail.”</p>

                        <p>Through an order for the deportation from 
                        Canada of an English immigrant classed as a 
                        vagrant, a romantic story of a member of an 
                        aristocrate British family has come to light. A 
                        fine, soldierly appearing man was arrested 
                        at Ottawa several days ago accused of begging. 
                        He said he was Claude Hamilton and denied 
                        the charge. On evidence submitted he was 
                        ordered to be deported.</p>
                        <p>It then was ascertained that the alleged 
                        vagrant bad come to the capital with letters 
                        of introduction to Colonel Hanbury Williams, 
                        military secretary to the Governor General 
                        of Canada. He was described in these letters 
                        as an English officer who had served in the 
                        Soudan under Lord Kitchener and in India. 
                        He looked the part to perfection, having the 
                        manners and stylish make op of an English 
                        officer and with the genuine tan acquired in 
                        military service in Egypt and India. He was 
                        accompanied to Ottawa by a handsome, well-
                        dressed young English girl, an actress, whom 
                        he had married a few days before leaving 
                        England. He had ample money for immediate 
                        needs when be arrived here, but spent it 
                        lavishly.</p>

                        its way from England, sufficient to keep him 
                        for a year, not having arrived when his last 
                        dollar was gone, his baggage was seized at the 
                        hotel for an unpaid board bill. He applied at 
                        the police station for an order for the recovery 
                        of his property and then the story came out.
                        He had been unable to deliver his letters to 
                        Colonel Hanbury-Williams and others because 
                        they were out of town for the summer vaca-
                        tion. There was a stormy scene in the hotel 
                        between Hamilton and his young wife. She ac-
                        cused him of having assured her he was a man 
                        of wealth. With their baggage gone, and with-
                        out food or shelter, the man walked the streets 
                        until he was arrested. The woman sought and

                    duty at the regimental depot, Omagh, in relief 
                    of <persName>Lieutenant W. A. G. Kinsman</persName>, D.S.O., 
                    whose tour expires on the 4th prox. The former 
                    officer will join at Omagh on the 5th.</p>
                    <p><persName>Major and Brevet Lieutenant Colonel H.R. 
                    Lloyd</persName>, Royal Sussex Regiment, second in 
                    command of the 2nd Battalion, Crete, has 
                    been placed on half pay under the provisions 
                    of Article 92 Royal Warrant of this year. 
                    <persName>Lieutenant Colonel Lloyd</persName> became connected 
                    with the Royal Sussex Regiment in February, 
                    1904, when he was specialty transferred from 
                    the Somersetshire Light Infantry as second in 
                    command of his late battalion. He got his 
                    first commission in the Somersets to far back 
                    as August, 1878, and kit advancement was 
                    very slow. He saw service with the Somersets 
                    in the Burmese Expedition, 1885-87 (medal 
                    with clasp), and in South Africa he had a 
                    varied experience in the Transvaal, Orange 
                    River Colony and Cape Colony, and for nearly 
                    a year commanded his battalion in the field, 
                    although then only a major of three years' 
                    standing. For his services he was twice men-
                    tioned in despatches, given a brevet lieutenant 
                    colmelcy, and the Queen's medal with three clasps, 
                    and the King’s medal with two clasps.</p>
                    <p>Some time ago considerable consternation 
                    was caused by the statement that a large per-
                    centage of the navy's guns were almost useless 
                    owing to defective sights, and the case of 
                    first class battleship Centurion, sent out to 
                    the China Station, was instanced as one of the 
                    most glaring. Since then the matter was taken 
                    up by the Admiralty, and under the superin-
                    tendence of <persName>Captain Jellicoe</persName>, the Director of 
                    Naval Ordnance, the re-sighting of the older 
                    pattern guns on the active list has been success-
                    fully carried ont. The process has been a very 
                    costly one, as the cross sighting apparatus, 
                    with its complicated series of dials and tele-
                    scopes costs from £120 in the 6 inch gun 
                    to £200 in the 12 inch. The night sighting has 
                    not yet been completed, but it is well in hand. 
                    That the sighting should have been allowed to 
                    deviate so much from the true until it became 
                    notorious is one of the things not easy to 
                    understand.</p>
                    <p><persName>Captain A. G. Macdonald</persName>, Royal Berkshire 
                    Regiment, having completed his tenure in the 
                    adjutancy of the 1st Battalion at Dublin, has 
                    been succeeded by <persName>Lieutenant Herbert L. 
                    Stevens</persName>, of the same battalion. The new adjutant 
                    of the 49th joined the regiment in May, 1900, 
                    from the ranks of the Natal Forces in the 
                    field, and he has had considerable service on 
                    the staff and in the field. He shared in the 
                    Matabeleland campaign, 1893 (medal) and was 
                    with the Natal Mounted Polios in the South 
                    African War, 1889-1900, including the fighting 
                    for the relief of Ladysmith (Queen's medal w
                    ith two clasps). and after getting hit commis-
                    sion he was employed for some time with the 
                    West African Frontier Force, was aide de camp 
                    to the Governor of the Gold Coast, and up till 
                    a year ago was employed in the East African 
                    Protectorate.</p>

                        <p>A match between the above teams was play-
                        ed at Suez last Saturday. The ship's team,
                        which batted first, were dismissed by Mansell 
                        and Battiscombe, assisted by a certain element 
                        of luck, for the small total of 68. The E.T.C. 
                        started badly and lost 7 wickets for 53, but 
                        thanks to some free hitting by Shaddock and 
                        steady batting of Mansell and Harris, even-
                        tually won an exciting game by 24 runs. For 
                        the visitors Kendall and Pickthall did well 
                        both in batting and bowling. Scores :—</p>

                        <p>The Institute did not do so well as usual 
                        last month, despite the fact that the team was 
                        stronger than it had been for some time. It is 
                        true that they encountered better sides than 
                        usual, but this is no excuse for the poor 
                        displays they have given. Want of proper 
                        practice had a lot to do with this. We may 
                        look tor a better state of things now that Rev 
                        J.T. Burns is back, and it is to be hoped that 
                        the R.I.C.C. will add to their list of victories 
                        this month.</p>
                        <p>On Friday, 27th July, the Institute gained 
                        an unexpected victory over the Army Ordnanoe 
                        Corps. The home team occupied the wickets 
                        first but were soon out for 50. The visitors did 
                        even worse, the whole side being out for 35. 
                        R. Appleby bowled extremely well, his six 
                        wickets costing him only 8 runs.</p>
                        <p>The Institute were badly beaten on Friday, 
                        3rd August, by  “F” Company, King’s Royal 
                        Rifles. They batted first and completely 
                        collapsed, the total only amounting to 29. This 
                        the soldiers easily passed and eventually won 
                        by 61 runs.</p>
                        <p>On Friday, 10th August, the Institute visit-
                        ed Slade Park and were defeated by the 
                        Mounted Military Police. Bad fielding was 
                        mainly responsible for this loss.</p>
                        <p>On Friday, 17th August, the Institute were 
                        beaten for the third time in succession. The 
                        Detachment of the Berks. Regiment completely 
                        outplayed the homesters and after scoring 106 
                        disposed of the Institute for 50. At one time 
                        it seemed as if 20 would not be reached, no 
                        fewer then six wickets falling for 6 runs. G. 
                        Attwood was top scorer with a nicely compil-
                        ed 22.</p>
