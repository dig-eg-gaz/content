                        <head>THE EDUCATION <lb/> OF “RAILWAY CHILDREN."</head>
                        <p>For some time past the servants of the State Railway Administration who
                            are employed on the service of the permanent way have had a very
                            legitimate grievance against the condi- tions of their employment. The
                            Railway Ad- ministration has very properly insisted that all such
                            employes shall be able to read and write. The percentage of illiterates
                            among them is falling steadily ; e.g. among the platelayers it has
                            dropped from about 80 % to 40 % in ten years, and in the higher native
                            ranks it has almost disappeared.</p>
                        <p>The men are, almost without exception, married and with families. Those
                            who are employed near the large centres and many of the villages, are,
                            of course, able to send their children to school if they wish, and it to
                            gratifying sign of the times that <cb/> almost all have realised the
                            importance and value of an education, however unambitious. They have
                            obtained their posts through their knowledge of the three R’s, and if
                            their edu- cation has not exactly been advanced it has at least aided
                            them to live a hard-working and useful life.</p>
                        <p>The men employed on the lines between the stations, and indeed on many of
                            the small stations, have little or no chance of educating their
                            children. Though there are 10,000 kut- tabs in Egypt (if we add to the
                            list of Govern- ment kuttabs, the private kuttabs and those administered
                            by the Wakfs) there are not nearly enough—supposing them to be all per-
                            fectly organised and in the hands of first-rate teachers—for the needs
                            of the country. And as only 4,000, if as many, are regularly inspected
                            by the Government inspectors,and Mr. Dunlop has lamented their
                            shortcomings, it is per- missible to suppose that a large proportion of
                            them serve no very usefal purpose except the teaching by heart of the
                            Koran, which all Moslems support as vigorously as our Anglican clergy
                            and laity support the teaching of the Bible in primary schools, and no
                            doubt for the same good reasons.</p>
                        <p>But if a large number of children who frequent the kuttabs are very
                            imperfectly taught, what of the enormous numbers who are not taught at
                            all ? Among these last none, we think, deserve assistance more than the
                            children of the railway employes whom we have mentioned, and we are glad
                            to be able to state that, thanks to the energy of Mr.Cotterill,
                            something is being done for the children of 1,400 or 1,500 railway men
                            who cannot avail themselves of other kuttabs, and are in consequence
                            condemned to illiteracy as long as their fathers remain at out-of-the-
                            way posts.</p>
                        <p>Owing to Mr. Cotterill’s exertions some 95 kut- tabs have already been
                            founded for their benefit, and, we may add, for the benefit of children
                            who, live in the same neighbourhood and suffer the same disadvantages.
                            We need not say that this number will shortly be augmented, for much
                            remains to be done ; at least 1,200 em- ployes are in reach of no school
                            where their children can be taught, and the exigencies of the
                            time-table, or the fact that they are posted between stations, prevent
                            them from making use of the free passes granted to scholars. There
                            cannot be any doubt that the men will support the kuttabs and send their
                            children to them as fast as they are formed. They have not to pay a high
                            price for their children’s instruction—P.T. 2 a month for one child and
                            P.T. 3 for all the children of a family—but even these small sums count
                            with men who, besides their wives and small children, often maintain
                            their parents and divorced or widowed sisters, and it is very gratifying
                            to note that scarcely any have grudged the payment. We hope to have more
                            to say about this interesting subject in the near future.</p>

                            William Willcocks is making inquiries as to the pos- sibility of
                            obtaining a grant of about fifty thousand acres of State land in the
                            Punjab for agricultural development by a syndicate or company.</p>

                        <p>Coal Imports.—From the 1st January to the 3rd August, 555,285 tons of
                            coal were imported into Egypt. Wales sent 311,454, Newcastle 122,745,
                            Scotland 70,080, York- shire 30,988, and other places 19,968 tons.
                            During the same period of last year 564,780 tons were received.</p>

                        <p>The Nadouri Murder.—It appears there is no foundation for the report that
                            the secret police had discovered the identity of the murderer of Nadouri
                            Pasha. They are. on the contrary, still hunting for the clue to a
                            mystery, which we cannot help thinking would be better left
                            unsolved.</p>

                        <p>An Abyssinian Mission.—A telegram from Djibouti to the "Temps” states
                            that Mechacha, an important personage of the Court of the Emperor
                            Menelik, left on the 24th ulto. for Jerusalem, whence he will proceed to
                            Constan- tinople, Vienna, Berlin, and Paris, and perhaps to London. Some
                            political importance is attach- ed to this mission.</p>

                        <p>New Cairo Hotel. — A group of Swiss capitalists has been authorised to
                            build a hotel on the Suares and Cattaoui lands at Kasr- el-Nil. It is
                            said that the new building will be constructed after the plans of the
                            Cecil Hotel in London, with a large terrace looking over the river.
                            Building operations will be commenced next month.</p>

                        <p>The Austrian Lloyd S.S. Company in- form us that, in order to meet the
                            many demands for passages from Trieste to Alex- andria, they have
                            decided to run a few extra steamers between the regular sailings. The
                            first of these extra departures will take place on the 8th October,
                            arriving at Alexandria on the 12th at daylight, to sail again for
                            Trieste on the 15th October at 3 p.m.</p>

                        <p>Lack of Employes.—The recent opening of new banks has produced a very
                            great demand for employes ; and the question arises as to whether there
                            will be sufficient to fill the vacancies. It is certain that in spite of
                            this abnormal demand those applicants who have the best education and
                            knowledge of languages will have the preference ; and those who frequent
                            the Berlitz Schools will find a just recompense for their efforts in
                            this direction by a rapid and practical method. [Advt.]</p>

                        <p>Alhambra. Theatre.—The Della Guardia Italian dramatic company arrived
                            yesterday by the Florio-Rubattino steamer and, as already announced,
                            opens at the Alhambra this evening with Sardou’s famous comedy Fedora
                            The title role will be taken by of Signa. G. Della Guardis, and the
                            other parts are also in seemingly good hands. We look forward to an
                            excellent performance this evening. To-morrow afternoon a matinee
                            performance will be given, and in the evening Le Maitre des Forg s (“The
                            Ironmaster”) will be produced. The latest success of the French stage,
                            L'Autre Danger, is to be staged on Monday.</p>

                        <p>We publish the following extracts from a letter describing the adventures
                            of one of the cotton worm inspectors, who, we hope, will allow us to
                            compliment him on the courage and coolness he evidently showed under the
                            most trying circumstances. We withhold the writer’s name for the
                            present, as we have not received his permission to publish it:—</p>
                        <p>"I arrived safely on Monday evening, but not without some exciting
                            experiences. It is really wonder that I am alive to tell the tale, for
                            10 minutes I was facing death by two means, burning and drowning; and
                            this is how it happened. You must know that to get to Faraskour from the
                            station it is necessary to cross the Nile by ferry. The train arrives at
                            the station at 9.15 and as it happened on Monday night there was only
                            one ferry boat, and quite 20 people came in it, besides bring- ing heaps
                            of baggage and luggage of all sorts. The boat was crammed and there was
                            not room to move one’s legs. I was sitting on a seat by the mast. There
                            were two women in the boat and one of these had a young child. There was
                            a candle burning in a lamp in the middle of the boat about two feet from
                            me on the floor. As we were just in the middle of the river I heard a
                            crash, and on looking round found that a man who was carrying a very
                            large bottle, had dropped it and the contents, which looked like wine to
                            me in the dark, flowed all over the bottom of the boat. The bottle must
                            have held nearly a gallon. I had just said to the boatman, “Be careful
                            you don’t cut your feet,” when a huge flame shot up from the bottom of
                            the boat almost to the top of the mast. The bottle contained spirits of
                            wine, and when this reached the candle it of course ignited. There was
                            an awful scramble in the crowded boat for a moment and the yells and
                            screams of the frightened people were terrible. I managed to scramble to
                            my feet and at once shouted to the boy who was steering to make straight
                            for the bank. I then set myself to keep the poor wretches from throwing
                            themselves into the river, and from capsizing the boat by making them
                            crowd together at both ends of the boat. I seized the first thing that I
                            could put my hands upon, and it happened to be a broom. With this I
                            fought the flames. There were two poor men whose clothes were burning on
                            them from head to foot, and I thought they would certainly be burnt to
                            death. I brushed the flames downwards and succeeded in extinguish- ing
                            their burning clothes,and they were drawn along out of further danger
                            for the time, but they were both very badly burnt. I then started to try
                            and put out the flames on the floor of the boat, and succeeded in
                            brushing all the spirit between the floor of the boat and the bottom,
                            where it continued to burn fiercely. We then got to the bank. I made the
                            two women land first, and then all the men except the two who were
                            burnt, and then we pushed off again, the flames still burning under us
                            till we reached the landing place. I saw we could do that without much
                            further danger. We got there all right I had sent a man for the doctor
                            when the first lot landed, and had called to Bisheer to bring a lantern,
                            for it was as dark as pitch. Just as we got to the landing place the
                            flames had burnt them- selves out, and we lifted the two poor men ashore
                            in great agony. I sent off at once for olive oil and cotton wool and
                            when it came, dressed their burns and sent them home. But the crowd was
                            immense, and the wailing of the women, the crying of the children, and
                            the cries of agony from the men were enough to turn one’s brain. I came
                            up to my tent and drank nearly half a bottle of port, and then went off
                            to their houses to see how they were. They are getting along all right,
                            as the burns were only superficial, but still very large and painful. It
                            was an experience I don’t want again in a hurry. I am sure had I not
                            been there they would all have been drowned or burnt to death, as
                            everyone had lost his head. I have not quite got over it yet.”</p>

                        <p>Mrs. A.B. MacGregor writes to the “Morn- ing Post” :-Havirg read the
                            paragraph, under the heading of "Discovery and Invention” in your issue
                            of Jully 22 with regard to the seed found in the tombs of Egyptian
                            mummies, think the following account of "Mummy Corn,” by my husband, the
                            late Mr. John MacGregor may interest your readers. “Mummy Corn.” On June
                            9,1871, a wooden sarcophagus brought from the Khedive of Egypt by the
                            Duke of Sutherland, was opened at Stafford House by Dr. Birch, of the
                            British Museum, and Mr. John MacGregor. The lid of the mummy case seemed
                            to have been unopened before, as the clay luting was in the joint nearly
                            all round. From the hieroglyphics outside Dr. Birch pro- nounoed the
                            mummy to be that of a priest sacred to Osiris, and about two thousand
                            six hundred years old, and he predicted there would be found inside
                            several articles, a blue glass net, images, &amp;c., which were found
                            within. Among the loose debris inside the case were four grains of corn
                            ;two of these Mr. Mac- Gregor planted a few days afterwards in small
                            flower-pot filled with sifted mould froi the Temple Gardens, the other
                            two grains were sent to Mr. Sowerby, at the Royal Botanic Society,
                            Regent’s Park; the pot from the Temple was also sent to Mr. Sowerby in
                            August with one of the grains grown up about eight inches high. This was
                            returned in December 1871, as a stalk four feet long with twelve grains
                            of oats growing on it; the other two grains grew up into several stalks,
                            but with- out fruit."</p>

                            F. L. Gower, committed suicide at the Hotel Bel Air here by shooting
                            himself with a revolver through the mouth. The bullet pierced the skull
                            and death was instantaneous. The motive, if any, for the act is unknown,

                            drawn up. All proprietors are now obliged to catalogue their stock of
                            drugs alphabetically, while poisons, arranged in alphabetical order,
                            must be placed in special compartments and grouped. Mineral waters must
                            be kept under- ground if possible, to avoid the rays of the sun. The
                            keys of all medicine chests, drawers, etc., containing poison must be
                            kept in the sole charge of a pharmacist who is in possession of a
                            diploma. All orders and prescriptions must be entered daily in a special
                            register, and the shop assistants may not hand over to customers any
                            medicine or drug containing poison. Prescrip- tion must be returned to
                            their bearers, but in cases where they contain a medical error, the
                            pharmacist is to keep the document as a ‘piece justificative’ and give a
                            copy to the person for whom it has been drawn up. Proprietors are held
                            responsible for the purity of all drugs in medicines that leave their
                            pharmacies. </p>

                        <p>The Comptoir National d’Escompte de Paris opens its new agency at
                            Alexandria on the 7th inst. For the present, the offices of the Comptoir
                            National are installed on the first floor of the Antoniades Building,
                            Cherif Pasha- street They will be transferred to the ground floor as
                            soon as the necessary changes in the building, which are in course of
                            completion, have been carried through.</p>
                        <p>The Comptoir National's capital amounts to frs. 150,000,000, all paid up.
                            It has 40 branches in Paris, 111 in France, and many others in Loudon,

                            Australia and Madagascar. Its excellent or- ganisation enables it to
                            meet the financial and commercial needs of Alexandria under the best
                            possible conditions.</p>

                        <p>BY WILHELM MEISTER.</p>
                        <p>(Translated).</p>
                        <p>(Continued from July 28).</p>
                        <p>An offensive movement of the nature I have described would be attended by
                            difficulties that would prevent its execution from being a mere matter
                            of a week, or a month. Several months’ preparation would be required,
                            and during this interval the hypothetical invader would not have failed
                            to disembark strong contin- gents to discipline and train the volunteers
                            of the Lebanon and to undertake the defence of the eastern glacis of the
                            mountain rampart. Even admitting the all but impossible possibi- lity
                            that the Turks, with all their want of organisation, could capture the
                            barrier, their success would cost them half their effectives, and a
                            further advance down the western glacis would soon be checked by the
                            fleet’s guns.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances it is hardly probable that their commanders
                            would risk the adventure, and one may fairly assert that they would
                            regard an immobile and defensive attitude screened by the Anti-Lebanon
                            as the only practicable and safe alternative. There they would stay
                            waiting for reinforcements or the disbandment of their army. And
                            reinforce- ments would not reach them. The sea routes would be closed,
                            the precipitous Tarns would impede the advance of an Anatolian army, and
                            it is hard to see from what quarter fresh troops would come. The
                            defensive force, immobile, harassed, and disorganised, would break up,
                            and Syria of her own accord would unfasten the bonds that unite her to
                            the Turkish Empire.</p>
                        <p>I now pass to the second hostile element, the German Empire.</p>
                        <p>In my first study of the question I establish- ed that Germany’s only
                            method and plan of striking England on land presupposes the employment
                            of the reorganised Turkish army. It is obvious enough that if the
                            Ottoman armies in Syria, the hue of operations against England, are not
                            ready to respond to the pro- posal of Germany, the plan of England’s
                            rival is foredoomed, and being a sagacious power, Germany will not dream
                            of attempting its execution. It is essential to remember that the
                            Turkish army will never become that wedge of proved steel, on which
                            Germany counts, till the completion of the system of strategic rail-
                            ways enables its leaders to make the reform general, and bring the
                            Syrian Corps into line with the rest. Failing this Von der Goltz’s great
                            ideas must remain unfruitful and 'Car- thage’ can rest in peace, for it
                            is not on the waves that Germany will measure herself against her great
                            rival and defy Leviathan on his own element.</p>
                        <p>Syria may therefore be amputated without any fear from this quarter, and
                            though Ger- many may threaten and chide she will not prevent the
                            operation.</p>
                        <p>The third hostile element, as formidable but yesterday as the giant
                            Polyphemas, has been beaten to the ground and lies in the convul- sions
                            of a revolution. Russia, the victim of the England of the East,
                            exhausted and all but expiring, cannot lift a little finger to check the
                            conquest of a province where yesterday her feverish activity was laying
                            landmarks for future conquest.</p>
                        <p>France and Italy remain. Immemorial tradi- tion and the memory of former
                            interventions and glorious struggles on behalf of the Christians of the
                            East have made both, and especially France, the protectors of the Syrian
                            Coast. But both these Powers, strangely enough, appear to be to some
                            extent falling back in face of the rights which England has acquired in
                            the Levant by virtue of her occupation of Egypt and her position in
                            India and Arabia, and are turning for their expansion to other parts of
                            the Medi- terranean, Italy to Tripoli in Barbary (another province that
                            seems ready for amputation), and France to Morocco, where Germany has
                            lately threatened to dislodge her, though in reality the great central
                            Power would infinitely prefer to dislodge its insular rival (and all
                            others) from the Levant.</p>
                        <p>It certainly seems that France and Italy have finally given up their
                            dreams of expan- sion in Syria and the Holy Land in return for
                            advantages that guarantee their integrity in Europe and the development
                            of their African possessions. Well-informed students of interna- tional
                            politics are fully aware that both France and Italy would welcome either
                            of the solu- tions of the Syrian question that we have suggested and if
                            necessary would aid in their realisation. They have ever played a noble
                            and chivalrous part on behalf of the oppressed nationalities of the Near
                            East, for whom they have sacrificed money and blood, and whose
                            deliverance from their thraldom would crown with success the secular
                            aspirations of the Latin race.</p>

                        <head>PROGRESS TO DATE.</head>
                        <p>The marvellous progress which has been made during the past three years
                            in the deve- lopment of the cotton-growing industry within the confines
                            of the Empire clearly indicates that the day is not far distant when the
                            British spinner will not be at the mercy of the United States for his
                            supplies of the raw material. This movement to develop new sources of
                            supply was not initiated’a moment too soon. Apart from the obvious
                            absurdity which de- pendence upon a foreign country for such a commodity
                            entails, when there are thousands of miles of British territory capable
                            of pro- ducing it in quantities and quality equal to all home
                            requirements, there was a much more serious aspect of the question
                            developing apace. The United States has not only nearly reached the
                            economic limit in production of the new material, but that country’s
                            domestic requirements have been of late years increas- ing in an adverse
                            ratio to the free ship- ment abroad of the commodity. In other words,
                            the United States spinners, in a com- paratively brief period of time,
                            provided recognised agricultural and economic laws are not outraged in
                            their interests, will require to look outside their own country for
                            addi- tional supplies of raw cotton. Assuming that the rest of the world
                            depended upon India and Egypt—which, had the new cotton-grow- ing
                            districts not been developed, they would unquestionably have done — ruin
                            stared the spinning industries of Europe in the face, and consumers
                            everywhere would not only have depended upon America for such supplies
                            of raw material as she chose to release, but for the manufactured
                            products as well.</p>
                        <p>The development, then, of cotton-growing within the British Empire is a
                            matter of im- portance, not only to the Lancashire spinner, but
                            consumers of all classes throughout the world. Instead of being
                            dependent as they practically are at present—for Great Britain takes
                            practically half of the present Indian crop and a very heavy percentage
                            of the Egyptian output, the balance of the former scarcely meeting local
                            requirements and the balance of the latter being so widely distri- buted
                            that it can scarcely be regarded in any one instance as a certain source
                            of supply— upon the United States crop, grown in what is, after all, a
                            comparatively limited area and subject to almost similar weather
                            conditions, the surplus outputs of British Colonies and dependencies all
                            over the world will in a few years be available for the consumers of raw
                            material. It is impossible to imagine such a state of affairs as the
                            universal failure of the British crop, considering that we shall be able
                            to draw upon India, Egypt, South Africa, West Africa, East Africa, the
                            West Indies, British North Borneo, Australia and the Malay States, to
                            say nothing of other widely distributed centres, for our supplies.</p>
                        <p>The cotton thus produced is not a make- shift, and for proof of this
                            assertion one has merely to stroll round the excellent little exhibition
                            of British-grown cotton which has been got together at the Imperial
                            Institute, and is open daily at South Kensington. The exhibition is
                            proof—if such were needed—of the energy which the British Cotton Growing
                            Association has displayed in fulfilling the task it set itself to
                            perform three years ago. As the result of its first year’s work cotton
                            to the value of £100,000 was grown in British territories where it had
                            not been produced commercially within the memory of man, and this year
                            the value of the output should exceed a quarter of a million sterling.
                            This sum, large though it be, is admittedly a mere trifle when placed
                            side by side with the value of our total imports of raw cotton ; but it
                            must be remembered that it represents the product of entirely new areas
                            brought under cultivation on scientific lines. The outlay to achieve
                            this result, too, has been compara- tively heavy, but had it been a
                            hundred times as large the results can be said to perfectly justify the
                            expenditure.</p>
                        <p>Omitting reference in detail to India and Egypt—where, however, the areas
                            under cul- tivation are increasing each year—it is interest- ing to note
                            the very material progress which has been made in Colonies where the
                            growing of cotton has been initiated by the association. Few people are
                            probably aware of the fact that the United States received its first
                            consign- ment of cotton-seed a hundred and seventy years ago from the
                            West Indies, via the Chelsea Physic Gardens. Yet such is the case, and,
                            what is more, these islands during the first year of the last century
                            shipped to Europe no less than ten million pounds of the raw material.
                            In 1836 the exports had fallen to eight million pounds, and in 1901 they
                            had declined to the infinitesimal total of 280,000 pounds. The ap-
                            parent collapse of what was, undoubtedly, a profitable industry was due
                            to the introduction of sugar-growing in the islands. With a lack of
                            foresight many of their descendants have had good cause to regret, the
                            planters rushed at the new industry to the detriment of the old, and
                            left the supplying of the raw cotton market to the Americans. They have,
                            however, taken up cotton-growing again with such vigour that in two yews
                            they doubled the output of 1901, and a the present rate of progression
                            the crops from the Antilles should, in a brief period of time, exceed
                            the highly respectable total of 1801. At the present moment St Vincent
                            pro- duces probably the finest Sea Island cotton in the world, while the
                            Barbadoes, Trinidad, St Kitts, and Antigua are not far behind that
                            colony in the quality of their products. The 1905 crop is estimated at
                            5,000 360-lb bales, valued at something like £100,000.</p>
                        <p>The Sudan, too, will shortly be a factor to be reckoned, with in the
                            production of raw cotton. When, the fact is recalled that the <cb n="2"
                            /> total exports in 1902 amounted to only four cwts, the progress which
                            has been made by Egypt’s dependency will be understood and appreciated
                            by the statement that in 1904 8,000 acres were under cultivation with
                            com- mercial cotton, the bulk of which was available for export. West
                            Africa is another more than promising cotton-growing centre. Until the
                            Cotton-Growing Association and the Govern- ment took matters in hand,
                            the cotton grown by the natives was of little or no commercial value.
                            Experiments with good seed, under the direction of competent
                            instructors, soon show- ed the natives that a new industry, with which
                            they already had an elementary acquaintance, could be created, and they
                            have worked at it to some purpose. At any rate, raw cotton to the value
                            of £7,310 was shipped in 1903, and the output, now that large areasure
                            going into cultivation, is bound to increase in the near future. In
                            Natal and in the Transvaal, in Rhodesia and Swaziland, extensive experi-
                            mental plantations are in existence, and from some of these centres good
                            commercial cotton has already been obtained. In East Africa and British
                            Central Africa the growing of the Egyptian variety of cotton and the
                            improve- ment of native varieties has been taken in hand. Indeed; in no
                            British possession in the Dark Continent has the production of cotton
                            been shown to be impossible ; and when, in some of the colonies,
                            questions of transport and labour have been solved, a steady output from
                            all of them can with confidence be anti- cipated.</p>
                        <p>In Asia, outside India, some very excellent samples—they are nothing
                            more, however— from the Straits Settlements and the Malay States are
                            shown at the Imperial Institute ; but the cultivation of the plant
                            suffers from an uncertain climate, attacks of parasites and lack of
                            labour, so that the difficulties in the way of successful production are
                            bound to retard private individuals embarking in the industry,
                            especially when other money-making enterprises are at their hand. North
                            Borneo, however, promises to be an important addition to British Empire
                            cotton areas. The climate is suitable, and the supply of necessary
                            labour is ample. Cotton grows wild in North Borneo, as, indeed, it does
                            in nearly all the centres enumerated above—and efforts are being made to
                            improve the native variety, as well as in- troduce cultivated cotton
                            from India and other recognised producing areas. In Australia the labour
                            problem retards not only the growing of cotton commercially in
                            Queensland—where at one time it was somewhat extensively cultivated for
                            export—but also the carrying out of experiments in other parts of the
                            con- tinent. In the Fiji Islands a parallel in many ways to the West
                            Indies can be found. These islands at one time grew cotton extensively,
                            the shipments in 1870 being valued at £93,000, but by 1902 the exports
                            had entirely ceased. Causes of a local character led to the collapse of
                            this industry, but efforts are now being made to revive it, and as the
                            principal diffi- culty in the way of successful cultivation has been
                            removed there is no reason why the Fiji Islands should not in a few
                            years’ time, again figure among the list of shippers of raw cotton to
                            Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>The Imperial Institute Exhibition professes to show the cotton industry
                            from the growing plant to the manufactured product. This it does do in a
                            fashion which is easily under- standed of the people. In an hour’s time
                            a man of average intelligence can learn more of one of our most
                            important industries by visiting the Institute’s little show than he
                            would probably learn from a year’s solid reading of books dealing with
                            the subject. Even the wisest and youngest of us can learn some- thing
                            from a glance round these carefully- arranged exhibits.</p>

                        <p>IVORY.—The quarterly ivory sales com- menced 25th inst. and concluded
                            27th inst. ; they comprised 61 tons (against 54 tons same time last
                            year), viz: 20 1/2 tons Zanzibar, Bombay, Mozambique and Siam, 6 tons
                            Abys- sinian, 21 tons Egyptian (17 1/4 tons Alex- andrian, tons Malta
                            description), tons West Coast African, 1/2 ton Lisbon and 6 3/4 tons
                            land carriage, also 1 3/4 tons sea horse teeth, a few walrus’ tusks, and
                            14 1/2 tons waste ivory - total 77 1/4 tons.</p>
                        <p>Of the above quantities 8 tons were indi- rect import or ex sale lots,
                            viz. 6 3/4 tons land carriage and 1 1/4 tons sea horse teeth.</p>
                        <p>There was a good general demand, and competition was fairly active
                            throughout.</p>
                        <p>The quantity offered was larger than at recent sales, more particularly
                            of Zanzibar and Egyptian, and contained a large propor- tion of soft
                            ivory. Prices were a little irre- gular, and in some instances rather in
                            buyers’ favor.</p>
                        <p>The five tons Abyssinian ivory, which ar- rived previous to the April
                            sales,and remained unclaimed in the docks for some time, has now found
                            an owner in the Emperor Menelik of Abyssinia.</p>

                        <head>INSULTING THE SULTAN.</head>
                        <p>Among the animals performing at the Royal Italian Circus, says the
                            Evening Standard, on behalf of the Fresh Air Fund, is Fasolin, the
                            acrobatic and trapeze monkey. Although Fasolin can rival the cleverest
                            human performers on the trapeze, he has hot yet learned to read. If his
                            education had been attended to in-this respect he would have been
                            greatly interested in the news of the attempt on the life of the Sultan
                            of Turkey by bomb-throwing miscreants. Fasolin, however, alone amongst
                            monkeys, has had the dubious honor of throwing glass- lustres at the
                            Sultan.</p>
                        <p>He committed this outrage some years ago at a command performance at
                            Yildiz Kiosk. A trapeze was put up on the ceiling of a grand saloon,
                            which was illuminated by great glass chandeliers. Something, frightened
                            the monkey, which, instead of swinging to the trapeze, sprang on one of
                            the chandeliers,and to Signor Volpi’s consternation proceeded to tear
                            off the lustres and pelt the Sublime Porte with them.</p>
                        <p>Everyone trembled for the audacious mon- key’s fate. A sack and the
                            Bosphorus were thought to be his deserts, but the Sultan was greatly
                            amused, and presented his owner with a gold repeater, £500 in English
                            money and the Order of the Medjidie. Fasolin is now 16 years old, and
                            the cleverest mon- key at the Circus. Any little people, how- ever, who
                            patronise the F.A.F performance need have no fear that Fasolin will mis-
                            conduct himself as he did years ago At Yildiz Kiosk. He has grown wiser,
                            as well as older, and he is now the gentlest monkey Signor Volpi
                            possesses.</p>

                        <p>Russia persists in the statement that her army in Manchuria is still
                            anxious and willing to fight. Impartial observers returned from the
                            front tell us that officers and privates alike are panting for peace,
                            but that the authorities have for long been terrified at the idea of
                            leading home an army discontented by being led so often into defeat. But
                            this is not the first time there has been misunderstanding to the
                            attitude of Russian troops. An English traveller met a body of Russian
                            peasants, handcuffed and chained together, and being driven like cattle
                            along the road by soldiers. “Dear me !” said he to the officer in charge
                            ; “who are these prisoners ?” “Prisoners ?” re-echoed the officer.
                            “These are not prisoners. They are volunteers —hastening to the front
                            !”</p>

                        <p>(Harold Spender in the "Leisure Hour").</p>
                        <p>“If you want to see all the sights of Cairo,” the English resident will
                            tell you, as soon as you reach the Nile from Port Said, “you must go to
                            the Zoological Gardens on Sunday after- noon and see Lord Cromer.” The
                            instruction sounds puzzling, and perhaps a little disre- spectful to
                            British authority. But if you take the advice, what then ? After you
                            have seen the lions feed, admired the chimpanzee, and talked to the
                            cockatoos, you will go and drink tea at the Pelican Island. Then, if you
                            keep your eyes open, you will soon see the great sight.</p>
                        <p>A little family party—father, wife, nurse and child—come strolling along.
                            There is no state—no escort, no footmen, no Consular “Ca- vasses”
                            sparkling in gold and white. It is just a little middle-class party out
                            for their Sunday afternoon—enjoying the holiday and the sun- shine,
                            gazing at the strange animals — im- mensely concerned and interested in
                            the baby. “Monsieur, Madame, and Bebe”—you see the same group wandering
                            along under the trees in the Champs-Elysees, or under the lime-trees in
                            any little German town. The man is grey- haired, but still keen-eyed,
                            strongly built, and bronzed of face. He seems more anxious about the
                            baby than either the mother or the nurse.</p>
                        <p>I open with this picture from his life at Cairo because it conveys in the
                            best possible manner the secret of Lord Cromer’s rule in Egypt. The
                            secret lies in its simplicity. You are often told by the followers of
                            other schools that the only way to govern the East is by display. Lord
                            Cromer knows the East quite as well as any man ; but he has chosen the
                            way of simplicity.</p>
                        <p>Mark the result. “The meek shall inherit the earth”—Lord Cromer’s
                            simplicity has suc- ceeded where display would probably have utterly
                            failed. Twenty years ago, when he entered upon his present task, Lord
                            Cromer was surrounded with enemies. He might have fought them with
                            display. He has chosen a better and a more successful plan.</p>
                        <p>The house in which Lord Cromer lives is no palace, but just the old
                            British Consulate. It stands in the European residential quarter, not
                            far from the Nile, and all the Arab drivers of the smart little
                            two-horse victorias which brighten the European quarter know it, if they
                            know it at all, as “Lord Cromer’s.”</p>
                        <p>It is an old-fashioned mid-Victorian mansion with a couple of wings.
                            There is a pleasant, well-lighted drawing-room ; but the centre from
                            which Egypt is governed is the high, rather sombre, chamber which Lord
                            Cromer uses as his official study.</p>
                        <p>There, every morning, he receives all the English official “Advisers” who
                            constitute his real Cabinet. There is an Egyptian Cabinet, of course,
                            just as there is a Khedive ; but they all have to obey the instructions
                            of their English “Advisors.” And all those instruc- tions are supervised
                            by Lord Cromer. It is no exaggeration therefore, to say that Egypt is
                            governed from this study.</p>
                        <p>To do all this work at his age, Lord Cromer has to live the simplest
                            possible life. Since his severe illness a few years ago, he never dines
                            out. His young wife, a sister of the Marquis of Bath and a Thynne, dines
                            out for him and busily looks after the whole social side of his life. He
                            himself goes to bed early and rises early.</p>
                        <p>The whole morning he devotes to seeing the "Advisers.” In the afternoon
                            he drives out with his wife and child. After six o’olock he is
                            accessible again to any person with a claim to see him.</p>
                        <p>He is, in fact, the hardest-worked man in Egypt. He can only keep the
                            work going by becoming the servant — almost the slave— of duty.</p>
                        <p>“Who is that very quiet young man ?” a lady is said to have asked Sir
                            Henry Storks in the sixties in Malta. “He seems to have nothing to say
                            for himself.”</p>
                        <p>“That is young Baring.”</p>
                        <p>Even in those days Lord Cromer never wasted words.</p>
                        <p>At that time he was aide de camp to Sir Henry Storks as the Governor of
                            Malta, and went with Sir Henry on his journey to Jamaica as a member of
                            the Eyre Commission.</p>
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p>This was towards the end of his first career —that of a soldier.</p>
                        <p>Born at Cromer Hall in Norfolk on Feb- ruary 26th, 1841, the son of Henry
                            Baring, he entered Woolwich when still a boy and became a Lieutenant of
                            Artillery in 1858. He worked hard at the military calling, wrote
                            military essays, became a Captain in 1868, and passed through the Staff
                            College.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps he might have stuck to the military profession and gained renown
                            as a General if he had not been appointed as aide de camp to Sir Henry
                            Storks when High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands in 1860. He followed
                            Sir Henry to Malta and thence to Jamaica. In 1872-6 he went to India as
                            private secretary to his cousin, Lord Northbrook, the “Viceroy ; and at
                            the end of that period he retired defi- nitely from the Army as Major,
                            and passed from the sphere of arms to that of diplomacy.</p>
                        <p>In 1879 he became a Commissioner of the Egyptian Debt, and afterwards one
                            of the Controller-Generals under the dual control. In 1880 he went back
                            to India as the Financial Member of the Council of India in succession
                            to Sir John Strachey, and remained there three years. He returned to
                            England in 1883, was made a K.C.S.I., and appointed to succeed Sir
                            Edward Malet as Consul-General and Minister Plenipotentiary in
                            Egypt.</p>
                        <p>The actual beginning of his real power in Egypt dates from September 4th
                            of that year—1883.</p>
                        <p>This brief sketch of Lord Cromer’s life will show that he went to Egypt
                            with a very full training both in military and dip- lomatic affairs—with
                            a valuable experience of Anglo-Indian administration - and with a
                            thorough knowledge of Egypt itself. All this must have done a great deal
                            to prepare him for his great success.</p>
                        <p>Lord Cromer—then Sir Evelyn Baring— arrived in Egypt at a most critical
                            and difficult moment. A few weeks after his ar- rival (on November 5th)
                            General Hicks’ army of 10,000 Egyptian soldiers was massacred in the
                            Sudan. At the beginning of the new year (1884) the British Government
                            began to put forward the momentous proposal that General Charles Gordon,
                            then generally known as “Chinese Gordon,” should be sent out to relieve
                            the situation in the Sudan. Sir Evelyn Baring at first strongly opposed
                            this suggestion, but ultimately agreed, on the strict understanding that
                            General Gordon’s mission should be limited to the task of evacuating the
                            Sudan as quickly as possible.*</p>
                        <p>For the whole of the next year Sir Evelyn Baring was absorbed in this
                            distracting episode of General Gordon’s mission and the siege of
                            Khartoum. His prime duty was to act as the channel between the Cabinet
                            in London and General Gordon in the Sudan. It was no easy task. At one
                            end of the cable was a hero—“a hero of heroes,” as Mr. Gladstone himself
                            called him—but a hero who was not easy to govern.</p>
                        <p>The contrast of character sharp and complete. On the one side a man of
                            precise and practical vision : on the other an idealist. Those strange
                            jottings of lonely peril, General Gordon’s Journals, show us the
                            impatience which Sir Evelyn Baring’s caution aroused in General Gordon.
                            It was the impatience of a tired and over-wrought man. When we con-
                            sider the conditions of that awful, lonely, siege we cannot wonder ; but
                            we must remem- ber that it was Baring’s duty to carry out the policy of
                            the Government.</p>
                        <p>In February and March, 1884, General Gordon sent to Baring eleven
                            telegrams in as many days, making varied suggestions for a way out of
                            their difficulties. On March 2nd Sir Evelyn Baring replied as follows
                            :-</p>
                        <p>"I have received your eleven telegrams of the last four days on matters
                            of general policy. I am most anxious to help and support you in every
                            way, but find it very difficult to understand exactly what you want. I
                            think your best plan will be to reconsider the whole question carefully,
                            and then state to me in one telegram what it is you recommend.”</p>
                        <p>There is no document which sums up better the difference between the two
                            men—Genera Gordon’s heroic, restless optimism, and Baring’s prosaic but
                            practical common-sense.</p>
                        <p>We are none of us always right in our prophecies, and General Gordon
                            would have claimed no special privilege. There is one passage in his
                            Journals, written in 1884, which</p>
                        <cb n="3"/>
                        <p>comes back to one’s mind with curious rebound when one thinks of Lord
                            Cromer to-day:—</p>
                        <p>"We seldom realise our position. In ten or twelve years’ time Baring,
                            Lord Wolseley, myself, Evelyn Wood, etc., will have no teeth and will be
                            deaf; some of us will be quite passe; no one will come and court us; new
                            Barings, new Lord Wolseleys will have arisen, who will call us ‘bloaks’
                            and ‘twaddlers.”</p>
                        <p>Not ten, nor twelve, but more than twenty years have passed, yet Lord
                            Cromer is still the central, and one of the most youthful figures in
                            Egypt.</p>
                        <p>After the fall of Khartoum Sir Evelyn Baring resumed that policy of
                            abandoning, the Sudan which he had always advocated in the then
                            condition of Egyptian finance. He had “helped and supported” General
                            Gordon in every way, even to the extent of backing him up in his
                            proposal to set Zobeir, the old slave- raider, in command of the Sudan.
                            He had advised the sending of the relief expedition and given every help
                            to Lord Wolseley, though he had vetoed Gordon’s proposal that he should
                            retire to the Equator. On the whole, the practical man had stood loyally
                            by the dreamer in his extremity. But now that Gor- don was dead, he
                            strongly recommended the abandonment of the expedition to Khartoum.</p>
                        <p>The Liberal Cabinet adopted his advice in April, 1885, and the Government
                            of Lord Salisbury carried on the policy of Mr. Gladstone until 1896,
                            when at last the condition of Egypt justified Lord Kitchener’s
                            re-conquest. Thus Lord Cromer was given ten clear years to deal with
                            Egypt alone, without the embarrassment of anxieties and expenses
                            outside.</p>
                        <p>A clear account of what Lord Cromer did during this decade of peace has
                            been written once and for all by Lord Milner in his “England in
                            Egypt.”*</p>
                        <p>Let me try to state quite simply and briefly some of his chief
                            reforms.</p>
                        <p>He found Egypt just emerged from the bankruptcy which had been brought
                            upon her by the “wild-cat” profligacy and extravagance of the Khedive
                            Ismail. The Powers had in- tervened but not to save Egypt. They had
                            deposed Ismail, secured the incomes of the bond-holders, but left the
                            peasantry of Egypt little better off than they were before. The
                            fellaheen were still ground down with a hundred taxes and exactions.
                            They were still denied either justice in their trials or humanity in
                            their punishments. They could be still torn from their homes and
                            enslaved at any moment for either public or private works—just as the
                            Khedive or the Pashas might will.</p>
                        <p>The first task was to restore freedom. The Corvee, or right of calling
                            out any peasant for work, was abolished, except for sudden levies in
                            time of flood. Conscription was put on a rational basis—the number of
                            soldiers limited, the years of service cut down, and the treatment
                            entirely changed. The spick-and-span Egyptian soldier whom you see in
                            Cairo to day, the smart hero of Atbara and Omdurman, is an entirely
                            different being from the poor weeping wretch who was driven away in
                            chains from his village to die in the Sudan.</p>
                        <p>The next step was to reduce taxation, and that process is still
                            unfinished. But the severest burdens have been relaxed. The tax on sheep
                            and goats, the tax on all trades and crafts, the tax on fishing—all
                            these and many other smaller but still oppressive burdens have been
                            remitted. The tax on land must be retained as the chief source of
                            revenue in an agricultural country ; but it has been immensely reduced,
                            especially in the poorer provinces. Railway rates have been continually
                            lowered, and every- thing is still being done to cheapen transit and
                            encourage trade.</p>
                        <p>Lord Cromer has not been content with merely removing hardens. Egypt is
                            the only country in the world where the skill and in- genuity of the
                            State can double or treble the richness of the soil, for Egypt is, in
                            Herodotus’ old phrase, the “gift of the Nile.” It literally consists of
                            the soil brought down by the Nile, and depends yearly for its crops on
                            the Nile</p>
                        <cb n="4"/>
                        <p>waters alone. He, therefore, who can entirely subdue the Nile to the
                            service of man can increase, the wealth of Egypt indefinitely.</p>
                        <p>The Egyptians had often tried their hands at the task, from the times of
                            the old Pharaohs until now. But when we went to Egypt they had never got
                            very far beyond the old “basin” system described by Herodotus, and still
                            pre- vailing in Upper Egypt to day. The Khedive Mehemet had employed a
                            Frenchman to build a dam across the Nile just below Cairo, but Mehemet
                            had never had the skill to use it, and we found it lying idle and
                            useless.</p>
                        <p>Our first task was to put this dam—the Cairo “barrage”—in order. This was
                            done by Sir Colin Scott Moncrieff, who came from India, and did wonders
                            for Lower Egypt. The barrage was put in order, and it enabled the
                            Government to start a double system of canals all over the Delta so
                            arranged as to introduce the year-round irrigation. In other words, the
                            land is never entirely submerged, but is continually fed by the life
                            giving water, and thus produces throughout the year a continual series
                            of beautiful crops. Ever green, ever fertile, passing without pause or
                            weariness from one rich output to another, this land of Lower Egypt is
                            now one of the richest in the world.</p>
                        <p>The next step was to extend this great benefit to Upper Egypt, and after
                            many, inquiries Assouan was chosen as the place for a second dam, with a
                            barrage at Assiout. It looked as if it would be impossible to obtain the
                            £3,000,000 required. For Egypt is treated, by the Law of Liquidation as
                            an undischarged bankrupt, and not allowed to borrow any money on its own
                            account. But a way out was found by a private loan, extending over many
                            years, from Sir Ernest Cassel, and the contract was accepted, as all the
                            world knows, by Sir John Aird. The work was finished in 1902, and now a
                            great wall of granite, 150 feet high, and a mile and a half broad, runs
                            from bank to bank of the Nile above Assouan. It is one of the most
                            wonderful works of man in the world, and enables one engineer to
                            regulate the whole flow of the river down to Cairo. Already —in 1903—it
                            has saved Egypt from one famine.</p>
                        <p>The truest test of prosperity in the East is always population, and if we
                            apply that to Egypt we find that Lord Cromer’s policy has produced the
                            most astonishing results. Between 1882 and 1897 the population increased
                            by 43 per cent. It went up from nearly 7,000,000 to nearly 10,000,000,
                            and though the rate of increase has happily moderated a little, it is
                            still going on at a great pace. The devastating agencies have been
                            checked and the fertilising agencies encouraged.</p>
                        <p>Such is Lord Cromer’s role.</p>
                        <p>If you wish to realise the increased wealth and happiness of Egypt under
                            all these measures, you must ride, or walk, as we did for several months
                            at the beginning of the present year, through the fields and among the
                            villages of Egypt. As you watch the people at their work and listen to
                            their songs and laugh- ter, note their clean clothes and bright faces,
                            their merry children and happy, child-hearted women, you gain an
                            impression of happiness which, alas ! you no longer find on the country-
                            side of old England.</p>
                        <p>Come with me some bright radiant morning —such a morning as you only get
                            in Egypt in the opening of the year—on the great raised road that runs
                            across the plain from the Nile at Luxor to the distant Arabian hills. As
                            you trot along on your donkey —that white, large-limbed, patient beast
                            of Egypt—you meet a constant succes- sion of peasants going out or
                            coming in from the fields, driving great flocks or herds, carry- ing on
                            their heads great bundles of fodder for the cattle, greeting you
                            cheerfully with an Arabic “Good-morning,” sometimes plodding along on
                            foot, often on donkeys or camels. There is no sign of poverty, little
                            begging, except where the tourists have gone by, every mark of that
                            slow, long industry which, in the East, takes the place of our feverish
                            Western activity.</p>
                        <p>When he goes through the fields or down the river on one of his simple,
                            favorite holi- day trips, Lord Cromer must feel that his long patient
                            labours—the labours of twenty-two continuous years—have not been in
                            vain.</p>

                            of the district, a wreath for the coffin of the late President Kroger.
                            The cost, amounting to £2, was paid out of the town funds, and to this
                            there is an interesting sequel. The Government auditor has called upon
                            the members to refund the money on the ground that the expenditure was
                            “not a lawful disbursement of municipal funds, the matter not being of
                            general public interest.” Indignant demand, the members have refused to
                            comply with the auditor’s request, and intimated that he may take what
                            action he likes. The councillors are supported in their attitude by the
                            ratepayers, and the ultimate result is awaited with interest. </p>

                        <p>Mlle Bartet, of the Comedie-Francaise, has been appointed to the rank of
                            a Knight of the Legion of Honour, and is thud the first actress to
                            receive this decoration in special recognition of her talent. Mlle
                            Jeanne-Julia Regnault, dite Bartet, was born in Paris in 1854, and after
                            studying at the Conservatoire under Bo- nier made her debut at the
                            Vaudeville in 1872 as Vivette in “L’Arlesienne.” In 1888 she first
                            appeared at the Comedie-Francaise in “Daniel Rochat.” The following are
                            a few of the plays in which she has since appeared : “Mme Caverlet,”
                            “Francillon," “Denise” “Thermidor,” "Dora,” and in most of the
                            masterpieces of the repertoire of the,“House of Moleire,” as well as in
                            the plays of the drama- tists of to-day, MM. Lavedan, Heryieu, Don- nay,
                            Capus, Brieux, and Curel. Her latest role was in “Le Duel.” In addition
                            to Mlle Bartet, the other members of the Comedie-Francaise who belong to
                            the Legion of Honor are ; MM. Mounet-Sully, Coquelin cadet, Leloir,
                            Silvain, de Feraudy, and Le Bargy, actors; M. Jules Claretie,
                            director-general ; and MM. Edouard Noel and Lemaire, readers.</p>

                        <p>Coton. Samedi et lundi il y a eu de la fer- meté et de la hausse sur les
                            contrats ; les deux jours suivants, nous avors été un peu plus calmes,
                            quoique soutenus ; jeudi la faiblesse a prévalu sur des réalisations en
                            prévision d’un Bnreau favorable à la récolte américaine et finalement
                            aujourd’hui, après avoir commencé la matinée en bonne tendance, le recul
                            constaté en clôture d’hier s’est accentué. Voilà en peu de mots quelles
                            ont été l’allure et la tenue do notre marohé pendant la semaine qui
                            vient de finir. Que pour certaines séanoes l’aotivité ait été plus ou
                            moins grande ou que la spécu lation se soit montrée par moments plus ou
                            moins bien disposée, le résumé de tout cela est que nous finissons en
                            baisse de 1/8 de tallari environ sur Vendredi dernier, ce qui équivaut
                            aux douze ou quatorze points perdus par New- York depuis lors. Nous
                            n’avocs donc fait que snivijB l’Amérique pas à pas, comme du reste c’est
                            le cas depuis quelque temps, et sans le rapport mensuel de Washington
                            qui est venu créer une diversion passagère et faire naître une petite
                            agitation parmi le monde de la Bourse, nous n’aurions, pour cette fois,
                            absolu- ment rien eu d’intéressant à enregistrer, leR faits locaux ayant
                            continué à nous faire défaut d’une façon complète.</p>
                        <p>Mais si la marche de la vieille récolte a été toute pacifique et
                            uniquement guidée par celle de l’Américain, il n’en a pss été de même
                            pour ce qui regarde l’Août. La persistance de la de- mande pour certains
                            classements en disponible et les prix que l’exportation a payés, la main
                            plutôt forcée que de bonne grâce, ont produit du raffermissement, qui a
                            fini par se traduire par une hausse totale ds 11/16 sur le cours d*'
                            Vendredi dernier.</p>
                        <p>Dans nos précédentes revues, nous avions bien signalé les besoins en
                            fully good fair et good Mit Afifi qui restaient à couvrir pour quelques
                            filateurs ; nous avions également prévu les gros embarquements qui ont
                            fourni îe premier point d’appui aux haussiers sur la récolte actuelle ;
                            mais, au fond et contraire- ment à oe qui arrive, nous étions persuadés
                            que les vendeurs auraient été les premiers à faire des concessions pour
                            arriver à liqnider l’Août. Nous nous sommes trompés sur ce point et
                            notre excuse est que les ordres d’achat ont été plus urgents qu'on ne
                            l’aurait supposé, qu’il n’y avait qu’un seul détenteur des qua- lités
                            voulues, le groupe qui avait reçu le Mai, et que ce détenteur devait
                            tout naturelle- ment chercher à tirer profit de la moindre cir
                            constance.</p>
                        <p>Le disponible, qui avait commencé calme, a fini très actif et avec des
                            cours en hanese de 3/8 à 3/4 de tallari, snivant le genre et le
                            classement ; cette amélioration dans les prix ne doit nullement
                            surprendre après ce que non* venons de dire à propos des contrats
                            Août.</p>
                        <p>Quant aux exportations, elles sont supé Heures à tonte attente et pour le
                            moment le surplus sur l’année dernière est de Bal. J4,000 ce qui laisse
                            le stock à Car tare 11,000 au dessous de celui existant à la même date
                            ev 1904. Les deux différences en question augmen- teront encore
                            davantage la semaine prochaine, les prévisions, comme expéditions, étant
                            encor-- pour des quantités relativement importantes</p>
                        <p>Liverpool n’a pas été mauvais pour ros cotons : il est vrai qu’en
                            définitive les cours n’ont pas varié mais en somme la d mand est bonne
                            et le marché reste soutenu, fait qu: semble quelque peu extraordinaire
                            avec nr stock s’élevant presque au double de celui d- l’année dernière à
                            pareille époque. Là-bar, comme ici, ce sont encore les Fully good fair
                            et Good Beurrés, pas bien abondants pour sûr, qui sont le plus
                            recherchés. Les bonnes pro- venances Haute-Egypte jouissent aussi d’uDr
                            certaine demande à des prix favorables aux détenteurs.</p>

                            la plante comme étant, de 74 9/10 %, oontre91 6/10 l’année dernière, n’a

                            de nos spé culateurs, c’est la baisse qui a suivi sa publication.

                            plausible.</p>
                        <p>En attendant, les personnes compétentes disent que, sauf par la
                            sécheresse, il n’y a jamais eu de récolte réellement atteinte en
                            Amérique et cette année o’est de l’excès de pluies que l’on se
                            plaint.</p>
                        <p>Chez nous, la récolte va admirablement bien et le résnmé de la Produoe
                            Association pour le mois de Juillet, que nous reproduisons plus loin, en
                            est ane preuve éloquente.</p>
                        <p>Graines de coton : Mercredi a enregistré le maximum de la baisse produite
                            par la crainte des filières, mais dès qu’on s sn que les 254,000 ardebs
                            passés entre agences ont tons été arrê- tés, une reprise marquée s’est
                            produite et l’Août est remonté jusqu’à P.T. 57 j, soit P.T. 1^ de
                            hausse. Malheureusement, œtte amélio- ration ne se maintient pas
                            facilement, car do nonvean nous sommes aux alentours de 57, ce qni
                            ferait supposer qu’une partie de l’Août arrêté est pour compte de petits
                            faiseurs qui ne font qne chercher l’occasion de sortir. Hall, qai
                            s’était raffermi, est de nouveau plus oalme, mais, en fia de compte, il
                            a acheté beaucoup ces temps derniers et les perspectives sont tou- jours
                            bonnes pour la consommation de la graine de coton. Ce qui nons a fait un
                            peu concurrence depuis un mois, o’est Bombay qui a aussi vendu des
                            quantités assez rondes pour embarquement Août, Septembre et Ootobre.</p>
                        <p>Les expéditions de la semaine prochaine feront sensiblement baisser notre
                            stock.</p>
                        <p>La nouvelle récolta est toujours inactive, mais comme il n’y a pas de
                            pression de la part des veadeurs, elle se maintient très ferme. A Hall
                            aussi, les coure restent à £6 plutôt acheteurs.</p>
                        <p>Feves. Il n’y a absolument rien à dire sur cet article, car au fond il ne
                            s’y tait rien et les cours affichés ne sont que des prix imaginaires. En
                            disponible, il n’y a qne la consommation locale et celle de l’intérieur
                            qui opèrent. Alexandrie, 4 Août 1905.</p>

                        <p>Only a moderate business has been done in Egyptian Cotton this week, and
                            the quotation of Fully Good Fair Brown is exceptionally raised 1/16 per
                            lb.</p>
                        <p>In Futures a fair business has been done, and the following are the
                            latest values :— July 7.50 Sep. 7.42 Nov. 7.34 Ang. 7.46 Oct. 7.38 Dec.
                            7.31 Jan. 7.28</p>
                        <p>American Futures. The Market this week has been very a tive, with
                            frequent fluctua- tions ; an opening decline of 7 points was followed by
                            an upward movement of from 23 @ 25 points, which culminated yesterday
                            afternoon in anticipation of a revised acreage report gives the decrease
                            in acreage as 14.9 against the estimate of 11.4 on the 3rd June last.
                            This estimate, which is certainly “Bullish”</p>
                        <cb n="3"/>
                        <p>in character, was the occasion for the Bull clique in New York to
                            liquidate the remainder of their interest and caused a sharp décliné in
                            that market which has been reflected here to- day. Closing prices are 1
                            @ 3 points below those of last Thursday. In such ucsettled market
                            conditions it is impossible to form any decided opinion, but in view of
                            the Bureau report to be issued this day week, the 3rd proximo, we do not
                            anticipate any very decided movement but rather frequent and probably
                            sharp fluctuations.</p>

                        <p>(From our Correspondent.)</p>
                        <p>London, July 28.</p>
                        <p>The King left Victoria Station by special train on Wednesday morning for
                            Chatham, where he unveiled the Royal Engineers’ war memorial, and opened
                            the new naval hospital. His Majesty arrived at noon at Rochester Banks
                            Station, where the Mayors and Town Clerks of Rochester, Chatham and
                            Gillingham were presented. Through gaily-decorated streets the Royal
                            party drove to Chatham. After the first ceremony, lunch was served at
                            the Royal Engineers’ mess.</p>
                        <p>To the address of welcome presented on behalf of the Corporation of
                            Chatham the King replied as follows : “I thank you for your loyal
                            address, and I am much gratified by the hearty welcome with which the
                            town of Chatham again received me. It is my sincere wish that con- stant
                            progress and the full measure of prosperity may be granted to your town,
                            which has such close relations with my naval and military services, and
                            I am glad that one of the purpo- ses of my present visit is the opening
                            of a new and fine hospital for the relief and benefit of the men
                            belonging to my Navy. I cordially associate myself with you in hoping
                            that the memorial which is to-day unveiled may be treasured in your
                            midst as a record of the loyal devotion and heroism of officers and men
                            of the Royal Engineers who consummated their services to their country
                            by dying in her cause.” Both the King and the Duke of Connaught, who
                            accompanied him, wore the undress uni- form of a field marshal. The King
                            was at- tended by Major Holford and Colonel David- son, and General Sir
                            Neville Lyttelton also travelled. The Home Secretary had been present at
                            Victoria to see the King off.</p>

                        <p>The memorial is placed immediately oppo- site the Crimean Memorial Arch,
                            being be- tween the inner parade of Brompton Barracks and the forecourt
                            of the Royal Engineers’ Institute. A principal feature of the structure
                            is a series of panels in high relief depicting the various works
                            effected by sappers in war time. Two other panels representing
                            Paardeberg and Wagon Hill, where the Engineers particularly
                            distinguished themselves, are required to com- plete the series. All the
                            pictures have an historical value, in as much as they are based upon

                            men—some 420 in all—of the Regular, Militia, and Volunteer Engineers who
                            lost their lives in the South African war.</p>

                        <p>Wednesday was a great day for Wimbledon, for at noon it ceased to be an
                            ordinary urban district and became a full fledged borough. The event was
                            celebrated with great rejoicings. The baby borough gave itself over to
                            treating the occasion in no half-hearted manner. The Charter Mayor, Mr.
                            Hamshaw, accompanied by the Charter Town Clerk, Mr. Butterworth, arrived
                            at the Home Office shortly after 10 a.m, where they received the
                            charter, which was waiting for them. They drove in a pair- horse
                            carriage. Next they proceeded to the west side of Westminster Bridge in
                            order to meet the Lord Mayor and one of the Sheriffs of London. A few
                            minutes before Big Ben sounded the half-hour the City state coaches were
                            seen coming at a trot down the Embank- ment, escorted by two mounted
                            policemen.</p>
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p>When they arrived at Boadicea’s statue the Charter Mayor and the Town
                            Clerk of Wim- bledon left their carriage, and introduced themselves
                            first to Alderman Sir John Pound and Lady Pound, the Lord Mayor and the
                            Lady Mayoress, who were in the second car- riage, and then to the
                            Sheriff, Sir George Woodman, who was accompanied by Lady Woodman. As the
                            half-hour struck the pro- cession drove across the bridge for
                            Wimbledon.</p>

                        <p>On their return at noon the charter proces- sion was received with
                            befitting honors. On arriving at the borough boundary the proces- sion
                            was met by forty-seven carriages, mostly occupied by distinguished
                            guests, and the town clerk read portions of the charter, after which a
                            military band played “God Save the King.” The procession then moved to
                            the town-hall, where the charter was read in full and a short religious
                            service held. A luncheon followed, at which the Lord Mayor presided. In
                            the evening the school children and the old people were entertained, and
                            there was a military tattoo, a torch-light procession, and a bonfire on
                            the common.</p>

                        <p>Autre temps, autres maeurs, and this genera- tion has surely reached the
                            lowest depths of Parliamentary ill manners. Hardly a day can pass
                            without some one being excessively rude and offensive to somebody else
                            in the House of Commons. The poison of discourtesy has infected most
                            persons and all parties. Mr. Churchill’s offensive rancour, directed
                            against the Prime Minister, who sets the best example to others less
                            courteous than himself, is well known, and “C.B.” has lately tried the
                            in- dulgence accorded to an offensively stupid, if naturally amiable,
                            gentleman very far. But it is only just to acknowledge that the conduct
                            of those who mimicked Mr. Churchill’s stam- mer was quite as bad and
                            inexcusable as that of their opponents. There are still gentlemen in the
                            House. But the air of Westminster seems to nullify the effects of good
                            breeding and education. There is no chance of Parlia- ment’s regaining
                            its hold on public esteem until it mends its manners.</p>

                        <p>It is now some four months since the Com- mission of Inquiry into the
                            alleged atrocities in the Congo returned to Belgium, and their report
                            has not yet been issued. But there has just been published what might be
                            described as a bowdlerised summary of the evidence taken, and this, in
                            all conscience, is convincing enough. The book has been compiled by the
                            Congo Reform Association, of which Lord Beauchamp is president, and
                            which has a most distinguished committee of peers and members of
                            Parliament. It confines itself entirely to the testimony given before
                            the Commission, without a word of comment. And the con- clusion to be
                            drawn from reading its pages is that the atrocities and outrages which
                            such persistent attempts have been made to deny or discredit were
                            considerably understated, and that the terrible reality transcends the
                            pictures painted from transitory glimpses of incidents which had
                            hitherto leaked out. What we read in this book is sufficiently
                            revolting. But there are worse things that it omits: They are un-
                            printable. It is no longer possible for the charges against the Congo
                            Administration to be denied or palliated. The next move must be towards
                            punishment and—more important still—reform.</p>

                        <p>The National Trust has an opportunity of acquiring for purposes of
                            preservation the beautiful Tudor mansion known as Barrington Court,
                            situated about four miles from Ilmins- ter. Barrington Court is
                            well-known among lovers of good architecture as one of the finest houses
                            in Somerset. It dates from the middle <cb n="3"/> of the 16th century.
                            As a house in which the Duke of Monmouth stayed during his tour in the
                            West in 1680, it forms a connecting link with some of the more stirring
                            events of English history.</p>

                        <p>The house is about to rasa into the hands of one who is willing to sell
                            it, with 220 acres of land, to the National Trust for £10,500. Towards
                            the purchase price and necessary repairs (£11,500) an anonymous donor
                            has promised £10,000 on certain terms. Owing to this offer it will not
                            be necessary to ask the general public to subscribe more than the
                            balance of £1,500. For this sum the Council, therefore, appeals.</p>

                        <p>Since the motor took possession of the land the public have begun to
                            realise how impor- tant is the question of roads, their mainte- nance
                            and their construction. And now we see a definite result of this
                            awakening in the intro- duction of a Highways Bill, which seeks to
                            create a central department charged with the control of old roads and
                            the construction on a definite plan of new ones. It is premature to
                            canvass the precise merits of the whole pro- posal, which includes a
                            provision to classify certain roads as “national roads,” but its
                            initiation must lead to a quickening of interest that will not be amiss.
                            Perhaps the first highway problem awaiting solution is that of dust,
                            which has become a nuisance that must be checked in the interests both
                            of pedestrians, householders, and motorists. It is time, too, that wider
                            and better roads were made that should bring us up to the level of
                            France in this matter, and it is extremely important that the
                            construction of new suburban thorough- fares should be intelligent and
                            farsighted. The objects of the new Bill are really less surpris- ing
                            than its tardy introduction.</p>

                        <p>We have made very considerable progress in our prison system, both as
                            regards principle and practice, daring the past century or so. But in
                            some matters the law and its represen- tatives continue most egregiously
                            asinine, to put it at its mildest. That a Chinese prisoner, incarcerated
                            for this heinous crime of smuggling tobacco, should have had his pigtail
                            cut off by the prison barber is an illustration of stupidity and
                            brutality which is not to be excused by any plea of adherence to
                            regulations or routine. In another case, which is at present attracting
                            a good deal of attention—that of the Dartmoor prisoners whose portraits
                            have appeared on picture postcards—it would appear to be ra- ther the
                            lack of proper regulations which has caused a lapse no less
                            discreditable to the authorities concerned. Each of these cases points
                            to a lack of appreciation of the fact that the value of prison
                            discipline lies not in its punitive, but in its reformatory effect. The
                            object should be torestore, not further to impair, the prisoner’s
                            self-respect.</p>

                        <p> An interesting suggestion has been put for- ward in some quarters as to
                            the possibility of feeding underfed London school children from the
                            cookery centres in the metropolis. Prob- ably no one can speak with
                            greater expert knowledge on the subject than the Superin- tendent of the
                            National School of Cookery. Her opinion can be summed up in one
                            sentence. “I do not think it is possible under the exist- ing
                            conditions,” she said to a press repre- sentative. “Enough time is not
                            allowed for the teaching of school, children pupils at present. If they
                            had to prepare meals for the underfed scholars their opportunities for
                            learning would be seriously hindered. A child, who may come either from
                            a non-provided school or a London County school attends the class here,
                            according to the existing regulations, for two hours once a week during
                            the school year. The girl thus gets forty hours’ tuition, half of which
                            is spent in listening to lectures.</p>

                        <p>“I have, however, during the last week, re- ceived some information from
                            an Australian lady as to a scheme by which cheap meals are produced by
                            school children at the cookery centres in that country. There the
                            children attend the class for a whole day once a week for a period of
                            six months. With such a sys- tem of attendance it is possible to import
                            a thoroughly useful knowledge of the subject. Furthermore, much of their
                            time is not taken up by listening to lectures. With the limited time at
                            their disposal practice is far more valuable than precept. The meals
                            which the girls produce are sold to the general public at sixpence a
                            head in a dining-room attached to the cookery school. The girls lay the
                            tables, serve the dinners, and perform the clearing away and washing-up.
                            They thus gain a valuable additional training in these duties.”</p>

                        <p>In reply to a question as to how far such a system might be adopted here,
                            the super- intendent said she thought it showed what was possible. “Of
                            course,” she continued, “you have out in Australia a new country untram-
                            melled by traditions and red tape. But if the school-children there can
                            produce dinners of three or four courses, which are sold at six- pence,
                            and yet bring in sufficient revenue as they do, to make the cookery
                            centres com- mercially self-supporting, I think it demon- strates what
                            might be done for the underfed scholars here. A school child does not
                            need a four-course dinner. I should be inclined to make the children pay
                            a penny or some small sum for their meals to prevent any tendency to
                            pauperise the parents.”</p>

                        <p>Samaid did his best. He took his master to the Louvre, to the Bois, to
                            the Jardin des Plantes, and to the Musee Grevin. He took him to the
                            Eiffel Tower, the Comedie Fran- caise, the Morgue, and other places of
                            amuse- ment. He showed him motor-cars, airships, a motor train, the
                            Moulin Rouge, and the Post Office, and still Muzaffer ed Din remained
                            desperately bored. He feasted him, and sat him on a throne of gold, the
                            little princes near him upon thronelets cut from crystal, houris from
                            the Grand Opera danced before Muzaffer, and the King yawned them wearily
                            away ; he brought M. Henri Brisson to talk to him, and the Shah remained
                            glum. Nor did his long moustache move when M. Henri Rochefort offered
                            him three Louvre pictures and the helm of Saitaphernes.</p>
                        <p>In despair at their master’s melancholy, his faithful servants carried
                            him on to the balcony of his hotel, which overlooks the Champs Elysees,
                            and Samaid Khan telephoned for Dr. Schneider.</p>
                        <p>But as Samaid called “Alloh ! Alloh !” and made other remarks into the
                            instrument, another ran to him with the glad news : “The master smiles.”
                            Two old ladies were trying to cross the Champs Elysees.</p>

                        <p>As already announced by telegraph, on the occasion of the visit of the
                            French Fleet to Portsmouth the officers will be entertained to luncheon
                            by the House of Commons in West- minster Hall. It is proposed that the
                            enter- tainment should take place on Saturday, August 12. The suggestion
                            was brought under the notice of members by the chief Government Whip,
                            Sir A. Acland-Hood, and the chief Opposition Whip, Mr. H. Gladstone, who
                            together signed a circular on the subject issued to members of the
                            House. </p>

                        <p>The reason kidney disease is so generally fatal is, it comes on
                            unnoticed, and often gains a firm hold of the sufferer before he knows
                            what is wrong with him. Doan's Backacke Kidney Pills should be used
                            immediately there is any such sign of kidney disease as Backache, Dizzy
                            Spells, Aching Pain in the Loins, Water Troubles, Gravel, Sallow Skin,
                            Rheumatic Pains, Heart Irregularity, Sleeplessness, Irrita- bility,
                            Cramp, Spots before the Eyes, Watery Swellings in the Ankles or beneath
                            the Eyes, Stiffness of the Joints, Lumbago, Dazed Feeling, Bad
                            Circulation of the Blood (as shown by cold hands and feet). Doan’s Back-
                            ache Kidney Pills anti septically cleanse the kidneys, meters and
                            bladder, and assist the kidneys in their great work of filtering the
                            blood. They are purely vegetable, and reliable for men and women, young
                            and old. But be careful to get the genuine Doan’s Pills.</p>
                        <p>Mr. G. Chapman, who lives at 78, Ledbury roed, Westbourne Grove, London,
                            England, says:— “Before I began using Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, in
                            September of 1902, I had been given up by the doctor, who said that I
                            couldn’t live long, as I had Bright’s disease and dropsy in an advanced
                            stage. I was swollen to a dreadful size, especially the ankles, and the
                            pain I suffered in my back was beyond description. I heard the doctor
                            tell mother one night that I couldn’t live till morning; that was after
                            I had been under his treatment eight months. How- ever, I was never
                            better in my life than I am to day, and it is Doan’s Pills that have
                            cured me. I shall never forget how I suffered, nor shall I ever lose my
                            gratitude for my wonderful and lasting care. All my friends consider it
                            marvellous that Doan’s Pills saved me when I was so far gone.”</p>

                        <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but
                            which few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down,
                            as it were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what
                            may be its causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are
                            much the same; the more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of
                            prostration or weariness, depression of spirits and want of energy for
                            all the ordinary affairs of life. Now, what alone is absolutely
                            essential in all such cases is increased vitality—vigour--</p>
