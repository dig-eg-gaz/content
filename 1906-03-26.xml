                            the company in question would have the preference, so that no syndicate

                        <head>ANOTHER EGYPTIAN MINING</head>
                        <p>ISSUE. Mr. Tyudale White, who presided at the meeting of the Egyptian
                            Mines Exploration last week, said that the company had steadily opened
                            up what the board believed would prove a rich mining area. They had
                            proved the value of the Um Ros Mine, which had passed from the status of
                            a prospect to that of a crushing mine. The company had, however,
                            suffered, as all pioneers suffered, from the heavy expenses incidental
                            to the eatablishment of a now industry, end the business had increased
                            so rapidly that it would reqnire new capital. They had spent about £40
                            000 in five years, and the subsidiary companies £47,000 more. Generally
                            they were slowly advancing from the exploratory stage to that of
                            valuable gold mines. Though living through bad times, as far as markets
                            were concerned, the result of the developments had left little to be
                            desired, and if times were normal no doubt they would be able to dispose
                            of the company's properties on terms which would show handsome profits.
                            Mining in Egypt as likely to produce satisfactory profits as in any
                            other part of the world, and be confidently recommended them to take
                            shares in them company which he hoped would be shortly brought before
                            them. The company had unitsued shares and other means of raising money
                            for its own purposes, but the heavy expenditure on the three mines must
                            be undertaken by a separate company.</p>

                        <p>REPORT OF DIRECTORS</p>
                        <p>The report of the directors presented to the sixth ordinary general
                            meeting of the shareholders of the National Bank of Egypt, held in Cairo
                            on Saturday last, shows that during the year ouding tbo 31st December,
                            1905, a grow profit was raised of £408.902.10.8, of which 81.724.2.10,
                            derived from special investments, are exceptional profits. Deducting
                            rebate of interest, £27,418.14.9, and the current expenses, £84,906 5.9,
                            there remains a net profit of £296,577 9.9. The following distribution
                            is laid down by the statutes of the Bank : 4 % to the capital, or 8s.
                            per share, £100,000. 10 % of the net profit to the reserve fund,
                            £29,657.15. 10% to the directors, £16,691.19 6, leaving a balance of
                            £150,227.15 8, to which must be added the balance carried forward last
                            year. £80.417.81, making a total of £180,675.3.4. The directors
                            recommend the payment of a dividend of an additional 8s. per share,
                            which will absorb £100,000 and leave £80,675.8.4. They farther recommend
                            that a sum of £50,000, to be taken from the exceptional profits referred
                            to above, be carried to a reserve fund to be employed specially for
                            equalising future dividends and that £30,675.8.4 be carried forward to
                            profit and loss new account. Each share will thus be entitled to 16s,
                            equivalent to 8 per cent. on the capital.</p>
