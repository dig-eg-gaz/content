                    <p>Amid the contradictory reports referring both to the illness of H.I.M. the
                        Sultan and to the question of the succession to the Ottoman throne, one fact
                        stands out pre-eminently: the imminence of a diplomatic struggle be-tween
                        Germany and Great Britain for the first place in the regard of the Ruler of
                        the one great Moslem State. In the preliminary bouts Germany has undoubtedly
                        been successful. It remains to be seen whether the per-sonal influence to
                        the Kaiser will be equally potent with the next Sultan and Khalif as it has
                        been with Sultan Abdul Hamid II. The question is one of the greatest
                        difficulty, and our diplomatists will need to walk with the utmost
                        circumspection, stepping cautiously, per ignes suppositos cinero dolopso. </p>
                    <p> A false step may be productive of the ut-most danger to the British Empire,
                        and our opponents will do their utmost- and rightly, too, from their point
                        of view—to lead us into some pitfall from which we shall emerge in very
                        sorry plight. To guard against this danger we require not only diplomatists
                        and consuls, men of political discernment and special local knowledge, in
                        the Levant, but statesmen at home who are something more than the
                        mouthpieces of a party or the con-ciliators of a discordant Cabinet. To the
                        vigour with which it has almost always seconded a “spirited” foreign policy
                        the British public has seldom united the minimum of discretion, and its love
                        of the sentimental, its occasional flirtations with the impracticable, and
                        its mar-vellous readiness to believe all that it hears, make it a peculiarly
                        dangerous creature—to itself. </p>
                    <p> A few years ago the pro-Armenian campaign was in full swing. There was much
                        to be said on behalf of the Armenians, and their punishment, attended as it
                        was by revolting barbarities, was altogether out of proportion to the
                        offence. But we cannot help thinking that had the public, instead of calling
                        for war and the creation of an independent Armenia, urged, nay, commanded
                        the Government not to rest till it had brought about the adoption of a
                        respectable police organization in Kurdistan, we should have won the
                        gratitude not only of the Armenians, but of the vast majority of decent
                        Moslems who dislike being robbed by Kurds and Circassians as much as
                        Christians, and we should not have fallen between two stools. Had we gone to
                        war we should have run some risks, but should at least have won the respect
                        of the Turk, of the Eastern Christians, and of some of the Great Powers. As
                        it was, we exasperated Turkish sentiment and gave the Kaiser his chance. We
                        sympathized vastly with the Armenians, and we failed to afford them any
                        assistance—a few sonnets by Mr. William Watson and some charity bazaars
                        excepted. </p>
                    <p> The Armenian troubles over, we sympathized most enthusiastically with the
                        Greeks,--the upholders of civilization against the barbarous Turk. After the
                        Greek Army had sustained a series of lamentable disasters, which culminated
                        in the catastrophe of the Furka Pass, we realized that we had gone rather
                        too far. The exploits of the Greek bands and of Bulgaria komitajis in
                        Macedonia caused some of the loudest denouncers of Moslem intolerance to
                        wonder whether the “unspeakable” Turk, of whom they had constantly spoken,
                        really had the monopoly of outrages in the Balkans. Then came the stirring
                        of Pan-Islam=ism and the discovery that the Ottoman Government was not
                        actuated by the friendliest sentiments to the British Empire. </p>
                    <p> There was another school among us. To its followers the Turk was a marvel of
                        intelligence, the possessor of every Moslem and Christian virtue. True he
                        was a little rough at times, but wild, manly races were a trifle rough when
                        they dealt with rebels. They said of the Turkish Empire “Preserve it”—their
                        opponents, “End it” but as yet no middle school has arisen (we refer not to
                        statesmen, of the publicists but to the average man) that will have the
                        courage to say—“Help to mend it.”Amid the contradictory reports referring
                        both to the illness of H.I.M. the Sultan and to the question of the
                        succession to the Ottoman throne, one fact stands out pre-eminently: the
                        imminence of a diplomatic struggle be-tween Germany and Great Britain for
                        the first place in the regard of the Ruler of the one great Moslem State. In

                            taken of their own best property. In many cases, however, and obiefly in
                            villages where rioh potables lived, the villagers themselves invited and
                            eleoted special committees who col'e ted subscriptions and ereoted
                            kuttabs with the money thus collected. Some of the villagers even
                            established small Wakfs from their limited property. It is hoped,
                            however, that other notables and villagers will not fail to follow this
                            good exam pie, so that within a short time not a single kattab will be

                                <p> A London oontemporary gives the following appreciation of the
                                    Abonkir Company : The prosperous oondition of affairs in Egypt
                                    has been of considerable benefit to the Abonkir Company, whioh
                                    was granted a concession by the Egyptian Government nearly
                                    twenty years sgo for reclaiming, and owning in perpetuity, lands
                                    known as Lake Abonkir, near Alexandria, representing over 30,000
                                    aores. The Ordinary shares oarry 7 per oent. cumulative
                                    preferential dividend, then the Defeired are entitled to a
                                    similar payment, after which surplus profits are divided
                                    Although the lake was drained by the end of 1888 it was not
                                    until 1897 that the ordinary shares reoeived a first dividend of
                                    3 percent., which was also the rate for the next three years,
                                    and 6 per oent was paid for 1901. The oompany then did very mnoh
                                    better, and for 1902 was able to distribute no less than 55 per
                                    oent., for 1903 25 per oent, and for 1904 about 18 per cent.,
                                    whioh oleared off arrears as well as making a distribution of 7
                                    per cent, on the Deferred shares. A year ago 7 per cent, was
                                    paid on both olasses of shares, bat a mnoh larger balance was
                                    oarried forward. Now the directors annonnee an interim dividend
                                    for the ourrent year on both shares of 7 per oent., and for the
                                    first time a bonne of £1 ou the £1 Ordinary shares. It is
                                    interesting to note that sboold the oompany, after providing for
                                    the Deferred dividend, be able to pay £5 per share as bonus on
                                    the Ordinary, then the Deferred aharos will oease to be
                                    Deferred. The oompany baa since obtained aD interest in
                                    additional property, and ia doing so well that ahould the demand
                                    for land continue suoh a large bonus might possibly be

                                    preceding morning, and were looking forward to farther exercice
                                    on the morrow. The band of the Scottish Borderers providing the

                                    there were quite enough danoers to keep the ball rolling till
                                    long after midnight. There were, of coarse, the usual number of

                                    Hemming also wore cream and rosebuds, and Miss Ccxm’s cream
                                    satin frook was relieved by hand painted bands, revers, etc.

                                <p> Sir,—I have for a long time past been endeavouring to disoover
                                    whether Egyptian Nationalism Las any existence except as a
                                    jonrnalistio mirage for the use of self adver rising native
                                    editors. Cqlamns and oolumns of the vernacular Moslem Press are
                                    filled with talk aboat the National Party and its controversies,
                                    but up to now the so-called movement has never passed beyond the
                                    stage of mere verbiage. If it had the slightest olaim to a
                                    corporate existence as a genuine political movement there would
                                    have been attempts made at a party organisation and the
                                    elaboration of some sort of programme. At present it is a mere
                                    fatility and is not openly countenanced by a single Egyptian of
                                    any weight or standing. Surely if the aims of Mnstapha Pasha
                                    Kamel fonnd an echo in the hearts of bis compatriots, be would
                                    be able to point to support from among the innumerable crowd of
                                    Princes and Pashas, who ought to be honoured at being asked to
                                    serve on the oommittee of ihe Nationalist Party organisation.
                                    What could be a more noble ideal than the revocation of the
                                    racial oonsoiousness of tie oldest nation in the world ? The
                                    wealth of the upper oless Dative is so great that itonghtto be a
                                    very simple affair to get a oapital fond snbsoribed to pat the

                                    if the movement had any substantial anpport, considerable earns
                                    would be soon available and the subscribers wonld be only too
                                    pleased to see their names pnblioly figure on the lists of
                                    subscriptions in support of such a patriotic object as the
                                    realisation of national self dependence. But although the native
                                    newspapers have talked about the ‘National Party” for a long
                                    time past, the existence of snch a party as a coherent factor in
                                    the political life of modern Egypt is as yet nnreoognisable. The
                                    fatility of the movement is best seen in the faot that Mnstapha
                                    Kamel and bis friends are so entirely destitute of any gliippses
                                    of the troth of the faot that national movements solely depend
                                    on the people themselves, that he and his followers pride
                                    themselves because they think they have obtained some
                                    recognition in London from a small section of members of the
                                    Rtdioal Party. The Egyptians appear to be still destitute of the
                                    ritath of Wordsworth’s lines : /That in ourselves our safety
                                    must be sought, by our own ri6ht hands ** bo wiought, A’haLwe
                                    must stand unpropped, or be laid low. The Ye birth of ancient
                                    Egypt will never be until its people possess the elements or
                                    nationhood. At the present rime they are qoite ignorant of what
                                    raoial consciousness is, and are centuries behind other races
                                    such as the Hnngarians, Irish, Finns, and Poles, who have
                                    struggled for oentoriea and are still fighting plnokily towards
                                    national self realisation. Mnstapha Pasha Kamel and every other
                                    editor of the Nationalist newspapers know well enough that it
                                    any prominent Nationalist were offered a lucrative pobition in

                                <p> "A1 Watan” says : — We hardly thought it worth while to comment
                                    on the ridioolons interview with Mustapha Pasha Kamel given by
                                    the “Pall Mall Gazette,” bnt we have noted symptoms of the
                                    return of the old mania, from which we had thought the Pasha to
                                    have been relieved by the painful operations to which we made
                                    him submit this year and the painfol lessons that almost cost
                                    him his tottering reason. We mean that Mustapha PaBha has not
                                    yet oeased to oonsider himself the equal of princes and kings,
                                    and to omsider himself the axis aronnd whioh revolve politics
                                    and politicians. British papers obvionsly only publish these
                                    absnrdities to give their readers a oomio and pleasant pastime
                                    bnt if they in terest themselves in bis fatnities about as mnoh
                                    as we interest onrselves in the small talk of Corea, Java, or
                                    Uganda, the pnblioation of his delusions, e.g, the statement
                                    that be abandoned the Court ont of pure and simple generosity
                                    and courtesy to the Khedive, and especially their pnblioation in
                                    Egypt, doos a great deal of harm, for it may lead a few lnnatics
                                    to believe that he iB really a great maD, who ooonpies the
                                    thoughts of kings and tkeir ministers. Enough that his
                                    discourses on the "Occupation” and the "intrns” havo given ns an
                                    annaal addition of nearly £50,000 to the Budget. </p>

                                <p> Mr. Dioey, in disoassing the grievances of the telegraphists in
                                    Egypt in the “Dai'y Telegraph” concludes as follows :— The
                                    question is one about which there is a great deal to be said on
                                    both sides. All I can say is that if Mnstapha Pasha Kernel comes
                                    over to London this season, as he is Baid to intend doing, in
                                    order to bring the wroDgs of his fellow-ooontrymen before the
                                    British pnblio, 1 think he may be able to make ont » primà taoie
                                    oaee for the contention of Egyptian Nationalists, that oar
                                    British officials are somewhat highly paid, are granted
                                    exoessively liberal leave of absenoe, that they er joy very
                                    light hoars of work when they are in Bgypt,and that their duties
                                    might be discharged as effeotnally and mote economically by
                                    natives who understand Arabia and know the oonntry. The Earl of

                                    to receive an important appointment in Egypt. We do not quite
                                    see tc what post tbis rumour can refer, unless a new one is to
                                    be created. Sir Bampfylde Faller served as a yonng man in Egypt,
                                    and hid mnoh to do with irrigation and land settlement. H B.

                    <p> FROM CAIRO TO KERAK. SALADIN'S MARCH. The frontier arrangement, now so
                        happily concluded, between the Sultan and the Khedive, renders particularly
                        interesting the record of the celebrated march of Saladin from Cairo to
                        Kerak, in Syria, proceeding along the north side of theGalf of Akabs, on his
                        road to Damasons. This event took plaoe in the 578th year of the Hegira, or
                        1182 A.D. ThemoBt complete record of it is preserved in the Kitah
                        er-randhatelin of Abon Cbâma, whioh has been translated in the French eerie*
                        "Reoaeil des Historiens des Croissaird*, Histoires Arabes,” tôrne IV. The
                        history of the maroh is really ai extract from the diary, or report, of Imâd
                        ed din,seorefary to Saladin himself. Another author, Ibp el-Ahir, also
                        describes the famous march, bntina more oondensed form. It is probable that
                        this successful passage of Saladin’s troops, and that of the army of Sultan
                        .Beibars 84 years later, who hurried from Cairo to Petrs, may have impressed
                        the miud of Saltan Abdnl Hamid with the idea of repossessing himself of the
                        strategic "tête da golfe,” and of the rente from Egypt to Syria. The
                        itinerary gf Saladiu’a journey has reoeutly been examined by Monsieur
                        Clermont Gannean, who is able to explain the varioas sites mentioned by Abon
                        Cbâms, who says as follows: </p>
                    <p>"The 5th Moharrem the Sultan set out from El
                        Birkeh quarter of Cairo to proceed to Syria He followed by the way of Sader
                        aud Eilah by the desert.” These two sites are on the northern coast of the
                        Akaba Golf and appear here as in a parenthesis, for the earliest stage east
                        of Cairo now appears. "He passed the first night at Bowaib,” the usual halt
                        for a Syrian caravan or Meoca pilgrims mentioned by Arabio authors as on the
                        way towards Snez. 1 Then he made halts saooessiveiy at El Djisr, OuAli
                        Mousa, Hatha, and Sader.”</p>
                    <p> The first of these may be a site ou the Saez Canal
                        a little north of Ismailieh, bearing that name, bat if so Sdadin turned off
                        to the north, the nsnal track being to Ajrond, north West of Suez. So
                        probably there was another El Djisr nearer to the Red Bea. Owadi Monsa is
                        evidently a soribal error for O’yoûn Mouss, the springs of Moses, to tha
                        east of the Suez Gulf. The two suooeeding rjstiug places, Hatha and
                        Sader—one tho Wadi Aththa and the other Wadi Sadr ; or Sedonr, as in some
                        modem mapp,—prove that the Saltan proceeded southward along the east of the
                        Galf, after leaving the Wells of Moses. The historian then telis ns he
                        orossed the desert in five nights of marohing, coming ont at Ai'a Akaba at
                        the apex of the Gilf of that name. This route was a little to the soath, or
                        lower dowa the Sinaitio penin sals, than the usual pilgrim way and so
                        somewhat shorter ; but Saladin had to supply with water and food a large
                        army and transport, and so reduced to the utmost the length of the desert
                        marches At Aïla he entered Syria, and thence steered almost due north,
                        leaving Kerak, which ha masked with a detachment, on hi* left ; ho passed
                        Hisma, the projecting spar of the moantaios of Edom which overshadows the
                        road from Akaba to Kerak. With the remainder of the march to Damascus we
                        need not concern ourselves, the interest for present day Egypt lying in the
                        fact that for an army desiring to pas* from Egypt to Damascas, or vioe
                        versa, the line of ronte along the Akaba Galf throagh the territory now
                        permanently retained by Egypt. We hope that soon a light railway oonneoting
                        Suez with Akaba will render ea^y the journey of the Mecca pi'grims and lead
                        to a vast oom- between the Nile valley and Syria.

                    <p> EGYPT'S TRADE. </p>
                    <p> CARRIAGE IMPORTS- </p>
                    <p> The Journal of the British Chamber of Commerce says :— Prior to the
                        commencement of tha onrrent year, the Castoms authorities did not keep
                        separate statistics for carriages, the same being inoluded with the returns
                        for boats, tngs launches, bioyoles, motorcycles, and BO forth. On the 1st
                        January 1906 this classification was Bob divided, and we have been permitted
                        to extoaot from the record* the following particulars relating to the
                        principal countries importing carriages daring the ten months ending 31st
                        Ootober last. </p>

                    <p> Belgium 1,296 189 </p>
                    <p> It may be assnmed that the figures relating to countries other than the
                        above are not of any moment, and that the retarns quoted represent
                        praotioally the whole of the impôrtB I daring the period in question. On
                        this basis it will thus be seeu that the trade in European carriages is
                        only, comparatively speaking, of | small dimensions, and that Bngland has
                        not a large share of the same. The most common type of carriage in nse in
                        Egypt is the pair horse Viotoria or Mi-Lord, lha shipments being made
                        principally from Franoe, Austria and Italy. The retail pricé rans from say L
                        E. 110 to L.E. 140, according to the upholstering and general fitting np of
                        the oarriage. Although Franoe is to some extent assisted by the mere faot
                        that the goods are made in that country—the name ooantiog fot something—her
                        carriages are to a œrtain extent snperior to the English productions in
                        point* of luxurioneness and general ohmfort. In other words, their lines are
                        finer, their shapes mote elegant, and the fittings on a more lavish scale
                        than the home tarn ont. Another item to which the French pay great attention
                        is the question of the elasticity, so to speak, of the framewoik when fitted
                        on to the springs. Tbe latter, themselves, are not so strong and rigid as
                        the Euglish onep, and this, natnrally, is in favour of comfort. Another
                        point to be noticed is that a rather lighter and smaller carriage is
                        required in Egypt than at home, owing to the faot that the horses here are
                        smaller than the English bred animal. Asa rule, the Arab or 3yriao pony only
                        runs abont 14.2 hands. On the sntjaot of workmanship and materials employed,
                        we think we are scarcely exaggeiat- ing in sayiog that England is generally
                        admitted to lead the way, though it must not be forgotten that some of the
                        Continental houses also turn out a first class artiole. As a rale, however,
                        the English wood has a reputa tion for being better seasoned than that used
                        by the foreign firms, whilst, at the same time, the leather and olothwork is
                        of stronger and more darable quality, with the result that the life of the
                        carriage is much longer. This latter featuie.so far as the upholstering is
                        (Sbocerned, is not altogether one to be oonnted npon to any great extent in
                        favour of England, for we are rather inclined to the theory that, .owing to
                        the rapid and strong action of the snn, tho wealthy olasses here prefer to
                        have cheaper fittings, and to renew them more regularly than would be really
                        necessary in the Case of the better English goods. Athoagh the greater part
                        of the "voitures de loxe’ come from abroad, a certain number are made
                        locally. In Csiro and Alexandria there are several European coach builders
                        who are prepared to oopy almost any style of carriage, and to turn out an
                        artiole sufficiently "chic” to mi et the requirement* of those who do not
                        wish to pay Continental prices. In snob instances, the wheels, axles and
                        springs are generally imported from Europe, whilst the same remarks apply to
                        the leather fittings. The indiarubber tyres come from England, Germany,
                        Frauoeand America, the price here being from 5 to 9 francs (4/- to 7/) the
                        kilogramme (2.2 lbs.) </p>

                        The somroity of bigh-gtade Cotton is toaOhing alarming proportions,
                        and'mills thatoOmrome tbe long staple art confronted with â’vÿiatibas

                        largely in the prodnofc ot the Mississippi Delta,1 comparatively Httle
                        ootton oaD be seenred for the oonsump'ion of local millp, an J for
                        pfâotïCaTpnrposes Egyptian ootton is being used extensively,’ bat it does
                        not prodaoe the same standard of goods that tbe Amerioan long Btaple does.
                        It n a known faot that weather conditiotas have largely been responsible for
                        the meagre supply of high-grade ootton and this has been substantiated by a
                        personal observation whioh has been condnoted by two well-known mill agents
                        and a prominent ootton broker. It is claimed by the southern planter that
                        the heavy storms have worked bavoo with ’ the staple ootton, and this,
                        ooapled with the faot that shipping aooommodationB are very bad, make a
                        condition not easily understood by northern interests. It has been hinted at
                        that' the soathern planter is withholding the trad state of affairs aud has
                        negotiated with foreign factors fot the purchase of a large percentage of
                        the crop. However this may be, the simple faot remains that there is an
                        abnormal shortage and consumers are called npon to meet - unparalleled
                        conditions in the ootton market. Egyptian ootton landed in this oity brings
                        about 20 oenta, bat it is olsimed that this grade does not prodaoe the same
                        quality of yarn that the Amerioan long staple does. This annoying state of
                        affairs does not obtain sole’y in Massachusetts, bat Rhode Island is
                        likewise affected. There is evidence everywhere in fine goods mill towns of
                        the need of high grade ootton. The short staple found mostly in Texas'will
                        not serve the purpose of those mills that use long staple ootton, although
                        it is claimed by some northern mills that ootton planters are pushing forth
                        their damaged pro- duots, it being notioeable in a stained condition oaused
                        by the floods. It has been stated that a portion of the crop is being
                        withheld for speonlative purpose-», tbe planters having hopes to realize a
                        prinoely sum. It is to be expected, however, that all kinds of stories will
                        be afloat concerning the probable cause of the shortage, but it seems a faot
                        that the floods have been instrameotal in damaging the orop to a great
                        extent The oondition in the' Yaw material market will have a tendency to
                        harden the price of fine yarns and will necessitate a delay in the
                        deliveries. The finer counts in yarn are gene rally in good demand and
                        ordinarily bring a high figure on the market. If existing conditions are not
                        relieved in a measure the mills will be.confronted with a problem that will
                        not be easily solved, for, as it is now, the ootton market is oansing
                        endless worry to manufacturing interests. </p>

                    <p>FROM OUR FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT. </p>
                    <p> London, Deoember 28. The Money Market. </p>
                    <p> The squeeze at the end of the year has been exceptionally severe, and
                        Amerioan houses have freely paid as moch as 10 per cent for financing loans
                        against the best railway fecorities. As our bankers deoline to 6 -, an ce
                        Amerioan bills, they resorted to the expedient of sending the eeonrities to
                        this side, and loaning on them heavily. While this sort of business is for
                        the moment very profitable to the fiuano al houses here, it is brooming more
                        and more o'ear that it is impossible for Lmdou to finanoe America to any
                        large extent, and by agreement between barkers snoh business will
                        necessarily have to be restricted, and New York left to ficanoe itself. It
                        is beooming more and more apparent that while oheap money may be looked for
                        next month, in the present aotive state of trade all the world over no
                        return to the old 2 or 3 per oent. rate is to be looked for during the
                        coming year. The rapid development ot such countries as Egypt, Mexico, Peru,
                        Bolivia, and Argentina, all of whioh are calling for the neoessary resou-ces
                        of development, and will require farther large sums of gold, and the faot
                        that the older countries are er joying a period cf exceptional trade
                        activity, point to the supply of money being Bhort for a considerable time.
                        As regards Egypt, while it is recognised as nothing essentially unsound,
                        there have been considerable demands by financiers in that country to draw
                        upon London fiuance houses against securities deposited in the banks, which
                        wil’.so far as they have been successful, enable Egypt to draw still further
                        upon the stock of gold hete. </p>
                    <p> This week’s Bank statement, in normal con ditions, would be entirely
                        satisfactory, the reserve being, as it is, £18,719,223, or £1,090,032 higher
                        than last year, but in view of the above-mentioned considerations, it is
                        inadequate, and any fall in the Bank rate, even when money becomes cheaper
                        at tha beginning of the New Year, as it probably will, is likely to be
                        postponed to enable the Bank of England to make a larger soonmnlation of
                        gold to meet the exceptional demands whioh will probably oome forward in the
                        spring. To legitimate traderc the position is quite satis faotory, as a 6
                        per cent, rate does not hamper trade, and the bat ks in the country are not
                        charging to ganuiie traders and manufacturers the same high rates as have to
                        be paid here by American and London speculators. Discount houses are

                    <p> From the Stock Exchange point of view the present week has Dot been exaotly
                        satisfactory. To begin with, the faot that the settlement bad been fixed to
                        oommence on Monday, thus preventing the possibility of a long week-end
                        holiday over Christmas, was anything but appreciated in many quarters, and
                        the vacation was further ourtailed inasmuoh as Thnrs day was pay-day. I here
                        was of DOoeflsitÿ a fair attendance cf members on Monday, but little
                        business for new time was done, and the House was practically empty soon
                        after larch-time. On the re-opening of the Honse yesterday after the brief
                        respite, markets generally were in a holiday mocH, bat in one or two
                        departments some fairly aotive dealings took place, and throughout the
                        nudertone was good. The money position was, in the oiroam stanoes, Regarded
                        as satisfactory, bat the heavy rates charged for the Carry-over were
                        naturally'à deterrent to new busiress. Contangos on Americans were
                        especially heavy, and in some oases no less than 13 and 15 per oéut had to
                        be paid This state of things natarally caused nnoh anxioty in this section.
                        To day very little business is being done in the stock rinrkets, the work

                        et spécialement celle de son illustre et joyeax président. On sait que,
                        conformément à la décision prise par ce Comité, il devait y avoir séance ce
                        matin de 10 henres à 12 h. 30 m , comme d’ordinaire. O-, dès 9 h. 50, nue
                        séance "eui gcne-ris” s’est ouverte par les vociférations des re présentants
                        des 56 Agences, dont les nns de mandaient la cessation des affaires k
                        l’occasion des fêtes, les antres le contraire on quelque ohose d’approchant
                        et d’aoouns on ne sait exactement quoi. Le vacarme, le tumulte et la
                        oonfnsion étaient tels qn’il serait téméraire d’affirmer quoi que ce soit.
                        Il était pourtant aisé de oom prendre que la majorité des protestataires se
                        Bonoiait médiocrement de la question easen tielle, o’est-k-dire de la
                        question d’établir si la “séanoe” devait continuer, on b eu si l'on devait
                        aller se promener. Toujours est-il que le président de l’honorable
                        Corporation ne tarda pas k faire son apparition dans la oorbeille. Calme et
                        paterne, M. Paal Oziol essaya vail laminent de tenir tête à l’orage en
                        s’efforçant de contenter tout oe monde, y compris le Comité de la
                        Corporation. Aussi bien, aveo son éloquence habituelle, il fit nne
                        déclaration diplomatique appelé® k passer k la postérité. Le président
                        proclama ni plus ni moins que le Comité venait de prendre U déoision
                        définitive oi-après : “ceux qui voulaient travailler pon vaient travailler
                        et oecx qui ne voulaient paR travailler étaient également libres de ne pas
                        travailler.” Il est k peine besiin de dire que cette trou vaille, digne d’un
                        Talleyrand ou d’an Metter nioh, sinon d’an Robert Hoadin, eut pour effet de
                        porter l’anarchie à boo oomb'e, mais en même temps de la transformer
                        rapidement enne douce hilarité géuérale. Lô résultat final fat que personne
                        ne voulut travailler, s’il nous est permis d’employer l’expression heurease
                        du brave président, et qu’il n’y eut pas de marché L’opinion générale, en
                        Bsurse et an dehors, est que le Comité de l’honorab’e Corporation a
                        complètement perdu la tramontane. Pour notre part, nous protestons
                        énergiquement oontr^ oette manière de voir, tout au moins en ce qui oonoerne
                        notre sieur H. de Vries (toujours membre de ce comité jusqu'à décision de
                        justioe) qui n’a pas l’air d’avoir perda quoi que ce soit. </p>

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                    <p>Switzerland, the heart of Europe, has been described as "A cluster of
                        delights and grandeurs."</p>
                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M. de Caprino.and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO, may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town, situated at the top of lake Maggiore has a mild climate and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, “Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and ‘Tho Flight into Egypt,” by Bramantion.</p>
                    <p>LUCERNE—A striking picture on the Lake of Lucerne facing the Rigi and Pilatus
                        and the snow-clad Alps.</p>
                    <p>In and around the town the walks are charming, and the excursions to be made
                        from Lucerne by boat, rail, etc., are very numerous.</p>
                    <p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful excursions, those to the Rigi,
                        Pilatus, Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other
                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of
                        Lucerne, commands magnificent views of lake and mountain scenery. Along the
                        Lake of Uri from Brunnen to Fluelen runs the famous Axentrasse</p>
                    <p>A delightful exeption from Lucerne is that to ENGELBERG. Take boat to
                        Stansstad and from Stansstad it is about 1 hour and 40 min. by Electric
                        Railway, with delightful scenery en route. The ascent of Titlis, is made
                        from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps is grand; extending from Monte
