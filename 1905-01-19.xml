                    <head>EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT HOURS.</head>
                    <p> Next to the worry of having to live probably comes that of having to work,
                        and though we all like to live well we do not all care to work hard.
                        Business men and places often claim for themselves a superiority in this
                        respect which they do not deserve; there are many places in the world where
                        the life and work of the Government official are far harder than those
                        endured by members of the mer- cantile community, and for all we know to the
                        contrary some of these places may be in Egypt, But on the particular
                        question before<cb n="6"/>us we are glad to feel that Alexandria can proudly
                        hold up her head. In the matter of office-hours we have long been quite
                        European in baving many of them and few holidays. In Cairo it has remained
                        different, and cal- culations, prompted by curiosity but made with
                        knowledge, have shown how small a num- ber of full days' office work are
                        contained in a year, if the annual leave and all else be taken into
                        consideration. Under these circumstances we may not feel that sympathy which
                        is pro- bably expected from us for those who are in danger of curtailment of
                        their two whole and five half holidays per week plus extras. We can,
                        however, offer them consolation even though it be of a passing nature. It
                        appears that a certain branch of a certain department of the State at Cairo
                        is threatened with afternoon office hours. The consolation we can offer is
                        that it is, so far, only a threat and limited in extent; the danger which is
                        foreseen is that it will become a reality and of general effect. The fact,
                        which seems to have escaped recognition, is that the principle already
                        exists and it is its extended application that is resented. Only a few whose
                        ease it suited would be found ready to argue that the Posts and Telegraphs,
                        Railways, Trams, Banks, and offices should not work sufficiently long and
                        conve- nient hours; it has proved to be possible to make it compulsory and
                        to be easy to a degree to effect the same object by voluntary attend- ance
                        during the afternoons in consideration of small extra allowances. It is thus
                        placed beyond doubt that no customs or habits peculiar to Egypt stand in the
                        way.</p>
                    <p>A fact that may require recognition is that salaries are or are supposed to
                        be-based upon the existing short hours in most Govern- ment departments, but
                        we are not prepared to take for granted that this is to be ignored. From
                        what we have learnt by such enqui- ries as we could make we are, on the
                        contrary, inclined to believe that the better quality as well as the larger
                        quantity of work from the individual is aimed at by the gentleman who is
                        making these disturbing proposals to Government, and if the present
                        increased cost of living can be met by a cor- responding increase of work,
                        responsibility, and pay it seems to us the basis of a fair bargain. In
                        definitely concluding it we can well under- stand there is some difficulty:
                        there is sufficient ground for believing that some who can fall back on
                        pensions would not sacrifice their afternoon ease or engagements, and in
                        their case it may be sufficient ground for doubting whether an increased
                        quantity of work is of any increased value. On the whole, however, we
                        commend the idea, not only to the author- ities, but to all concerned who
                        mean business, and we regard the present time as highly opportune, for the
                        enhanced cost of the ne- cessaries of life compels a consideration of
                        salaries,</p>

                            <p>M. Combes formally tendered his resignation this afternoon. In a
                                letter to the President he declares that the coalition of impatient
                                ambitions and the Clerical and Nationalist hatreus have worn down
                                the Government majority. The future Government must, however, con-
                                tinue his policy.</p>
                            <p>M. Rouvier is mentioned as a possible successor to M. Combes.

                    <p>A Manchester scheme for the promotion of a company to buy cotton on a large
                        scale for importation to Manchester is taking definite shape. The proposal
                        has the active support of Mr. J. K. By thell, chairman of the Ship Canal
                        Company. It is proposed that cotton shall be brought up the canal and stored
                        at docks. When the first season's transactions are completed the
                        shareholders will be asked to decide whether the company shall continue the
                        trade or be wound up.</p>

                        stated in his newspaper that large numbers of native ladies and girls used
                        to resort to the shop as a rendez-vous, and that the proprietors used to
                        invite young men to their establishment in Midan-street with a view to
                        meeting fair female customers. The newspaper concluded its scandalous
                        imputations by saying it would publish more revelations the next week. The
                        article was published a fortnight ago and Messrs. Gammal at once commenced
