                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed
                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.
                        Najem Houry proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the
                        sea. Magnificent Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For

                        Army Contractor, Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia
                        (on Railway) to Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin
                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the
                        world. Also the tower or palace, the scene of "Othello'' and of Ford's
                        "Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus in the winter months is
                        delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                        <p>A store in the neighbourhood of the flourmill at Khartoum was entered, a
                            few days ago, by burglars and a part of its stock was removed. The
                            burglars, we understand, have been traced and arrested. A private house
                            near Victoria School was entered last Friday night through an open
                            window and the pockets of the occupant were relieved of a considerable
                            sum of money. It is hoped that the energy manifested by the local

                            of thieves may be put forth at present in order to put a stop to these

                        <p>Shortage of Cotton Yarn.</p>
                        <p>The continued scarcity of cotton yarn and the high prices charged tor
                            same are having a somewhat serious effect upon the spinning trade in
                            Lancashire. In order to relieve the scarcity the Central Council of the
                            North East Lancashire Cotton Spinners and Manufacturers' Association, at
                            a meeting held last week, decided in favour of a fortnight's stoppage of
                            the mills on dates between the end of June and the end of September. If
                            the whole of the local associations affiliated with the central

                            150,000 workpeople will be affected. This would represent a reduced
                            absorption of yarn of approximately 30,000lbs, or equal to two month's

                    <byline>(Gazette's Special Service.)</byline>
                    <p>The affairs of the Cassa di Sconto e di Risparmio are progressing favourably
                        and there is a prospect of reopening and the discharging of current
                        liabilities. The bank may wind up voluntarily within a moderate period
                        without material loss and the position is decidedly better than was feared.
                        Influential parties have provided the necessary funds for the immediate
                        pressing needs.</p>
                    <p>The meeting of the shareholders was summoned for 10 o'clock this morning at
                        the Alexandria office of the Cassa di Sconto. Punctually at 10 o'clock the
                        door was placed ajar so as to allow only one person to enter at a time. A
                        cavass was stationed at the entrance and took the proxy of each person.
                        Unfortunately the bank did not take the precaution to get the "feuille de
                        présence" signed by all the shareholders who entered, and afterwards the
                        room was so crowded it was found impossible to obtain the signatures. After
                        a calculation it was estimated that sixty five thousand shares were
                        represented. According to the statutes a quorum can only be obtained with
                        seventy five thousand shares, and as ten thousand shares were lacking, the
                        chairman of the board of directors, the advocate Clemente Castro, announced
                        that the meeting could not therefore officially take place. He then read the
                        "ordre du jour" and asked if any shareholders wished to put any questionsas
                        the board of directors were willing to reply. Some shareholders then
                        proceeded to make observations and M. Metaxa rose to reply. He stated that a
                        group had been formed with the assistance of the National Bank of Egypt, who
                        were willing to advance the necessary funds, about £300,000, on the
                        condition that a friendly liquidation should be agreed to by the meeting. A
                        shareholder then asked if he were confident of the success of these
                        negotiations. Mr. Metaxa answered that it there had been a quorum and the
                        meeting had been officially constituted, he believed that the arrangement
                        could have been arrived at today. As the present assembly could not be
                        considered valid and as according to the law a second convocation could not
                        be made until an interval of ten days had elapsed, and, furthermore, as it
                        was vitally necessary to come to a decision before the 5th inst., by which
                        date the bank must either reopen its doors or go into liquidation, therefore
                        it was moved by by Mr. Edgar Suares, that the present meeting should go on
                        permanently until 4 o'clock this afternoon, by which time seventy five
                        thousand shares would, it was hoped, be re- presented and the necessary
                        quorum obtained. This proposition was carried unanimously as it was
                        recognised to be the only way out the of the difficulty. The shareholders
                        who have not yet signed the "feuille de présence" will assemble at 3 p.m. to
                        append their names and the meeting will be resumed at 4 p.m.</p>

                    <p>The meeting was very tranquil and the shareholders appeared to face the
                        situation with a calm state of mind. It is considered from the attitude of
                        the meeting this morning, that the shareholders will approve the project of
                        the board and thus after the meeting the desired arrangement will be arrived

                    <p>MESSIEURS,</p>
                    <p>Dans notre Rapport de l'exercice 1906 nous vous faisions part de la grande
                        confiance que nous avions en l'avenir de notre Etablissement; nul n'aurait
                        pu croire que la crise financière qui sévit dans le pays serait venue
                        démentir nos prévisions d'une façon aussi imprévue et aussi brutale.</p>
                    <p>Cette crise, dont les premiers symptômes se manifestèrent vers la fin du mois
                        de Mars, prit de jour en jour des proportions plus alarmantes</p>
                    <p>et jeta bientôt le découragement et la méfiance sur le marché il en résulta,
                        tout naturelleinent, un ralentissement dans la rentrée de nos créances et
                        une diminution graduelle de nos dépôts: ces derniers, qui, à fin Mars, se
                        chiffraient par L. E. 570,067-, ne s'élevaient plus qu'à L. E. 423.013-à la
                        fin du mois de</p>
                    <p>Mai.</p>
                    <p>Entretemps, nos actions étaient vivement attaquées sur le marché et la baisse
                        empêcha le versement dû le 31 mai sur les actions de l'émission 1907 de
                        s'effectuer régulièrement.</p>
                    <p>En effet, sur la somme de Livres Egyptiennes 96,437 1/2, montant de cette
                        échéance, nos Caisses n'avaient reçu jusqu'au 13 juin, que 35,646 L.E. 188
                        mil.</p>
                    <p>Nous nous arrêtons à cette date du 13 juin</p>
                    <p>parce que ce fut ce même jour que nous constations qu'à la suite de la baisse
                        toujours plus rapide du cours de nos actions, une panique s'était emparée de
                        nos déposants; ceux-ci furent affolés surtout par les attaques, aussi <cb
                            n="3"/> violentes qu'injustifiées, dont notre Etablissement fut l'objet
                        et auxquelles la dépression profonde de l'esprit public offrait alors un
                        terrain trop favorable.</p>
                    <p>Le "run" qui s'abattit sur nos Caisses ne pouvait donc les trouver
                        suffisamment pourvues de numéraire; il atteignit bientôt, d'ailleurs, de
                        telles proportions, ici et au Caire, que, malgré tous nos efforts et le
                        concours que nous prêtèrent quelques grands établissements de crédit de
                        notre place, notamment la National Bank of Egypt, nous fames obligés, le 21
                        juin dernier, de fermer provisoirement nos guichets.</p>
                    <p>Du 31 Mai au 20 juin, nous avions remboursé à nos déposants L.E. 196 228,
                        dont L.Eg. 128.228, de nos propres ressources, et L.Eg. 68.000 par l'appui
                        des banques locales. Dans le but de vous permettre d'apprécier, en toute
                        confiance, l'état de nos</p>
                    <p>et</p>
                    <p>pour couper court, en même tem aines</p>
                    <p>insinuations malveillantes sur la valeur réelle de nos activités, nous avons
                        prié la Banque Impériale Ottomane, le Comptoir National d'Escompte de Paris,
                        l'Anglo-Egyptian Bank et la Deutsche Orientbank de bien vouloir procéder à
                        une évaluation de notre actif.</p>
                    <p>Ces Etablissements ont obligeamment accédé à notre demande et leurs délégués,
                        après un examen minutieux, ont conclu que sur le montant de L.Eg. 1,770,000
                        constituant l'ensemble de nos créances, il n'y a qu'une somme de L.Eg.
                        234,000 que l'on pourrait considérer comme compromise.</p>
                    <p>Etant donné la sévérité avec laquelle, d'après nous, cette évaluation a été
                        faite, et les principes dont elle a été nécessairement inspirée, en raison
                        de la situation actuelle, nous pouvons consciencieusement affirmer qu'une
                        grande partie de ce montant de L.E 234,000, sera recouvré. Et à ce sujet,
                        nous devons vous dire que, pour quelques-</p>
                    <p>unes des crées</p>
                    <p>teuses, des</p>
                    <p>comme doude garanties fort appréciables vont nous être fournis inces-
                        samment.</p>
                    <p>Mais, lors même que cette dépréciation devrait se produire, nos réserves (L.
                        E. 208.082) et les bénéfices nets réalisés (environ L.E. 45.000),-seraient
                        largement suffisants à la couvrir, de sorte que le Capital resterait, en
                        tous cas, absolument intact: ceci vient confir mer ce que nous avons eu
                        maintes occasions de vous déclarer, à savoir que notre attention s'est
                        toujours et exclusivement portée sur les affaires ordinaires de banque et
                        que jamais notre Etablissement ne s'est intéressé, de quelque façon que ce
                        fût, à des entreprises de spéculation.</p>
                    <p>Nous pensons donc que dans l'exercice de nos fonctions, nous avons fait de
                        notre mieux; nous n'avons eu en vue d'autre intérêt que celui de la Société.
                        Nul ne déplore plus que nous-mêmes que cette honnêteté d'intentions n'ait pu
                        prévaloir contre un ensemble de circonstances étrangères à l'état de nos
                        affaires venant à un moment où celles-ci prenaient une extension, peut-être,
                        trop grande.</p>
                    <p>Dans ces conditions, nous vous avons convoqués en Assemblée Générale
                        Extraordinaire pour arrêter avec vous les mesures à prendre pour sauvegarder
                        les intérêts qui nous sont confiés.</p>
                    <p>Nous devons ajouter que de sérieuses négociations sont en cours avec
                        l'Union-Bank, de Vienne, et avec quelques-unes des principales Banques du
                        pays, en vue de grouper tous les concours nécessaires pour aboutir, sinon à
                        la reprise immédiate de nos affaires, tout au moins à une liquidation
                        amiable et méthodique. Nous espérons vivement que ces négocia tions auront
                        une heureuse issue; à défaut, nous nous trouverions dans la nécessité
                        légale, pour conserver le droit au bénéfice du concordat préventif, de
                        déposer notre Bilan; cette mesure ne ferait, d'ailleurs, pas obstacle à la
                        solution d'une liquidation dans des conditions non désavantageuses, ni même
                        à la possibilité d'un relèvement.</p>
                    <p>LE CONSEIL D'ADMINISTRATION.</p>
                    <p>La différence existant, dans le montant</p>
                    <p>total de nos créances, entre la somme portée au Bilan et celle résultant de
                        l'estimation cidessus provient de réalisations effectuées depuis le 20

                    <p>The recent comments of our comic contemporary, the "Egyptian Standard," on
                        the plague have aroused considerable amusement in London, The "Pall Mall
                        Gazette" remarks:---</p>
                    <p>The "Egyptian Standard," the newly-founded organ of the amiable Mustapha
                        Kamel Pasha, reaches us periodically from Cairo, and is wont to afford us
                        instruction not unmingled with amusement. To-day we learn that a recent
                        slight increase in bubonic plague in Upper Egypt has inspired that journal
                        to announce that 338 deaths from plague were reported for the week ending
                        June 10, and to suggest that "it is the Government's wish gradually to
                        eradicate the native-born inhabitants from Egyptian soil following the
                        praiseworthy methods employed by the Anglo-Americans with the Red Indians in
                        the United States." But the joke is that (as the "Times" correspondent
                        states) "the 338 deaths reported were those of cattle and buffaloes, caused
                        by bovine typhus." Really, Mus'apha Kamel's Editor is what you might call a
                        Whole Hogger, and no mistake. His capacity for wholesale fiction should
                        secure him a lucrative position on the staff of some seditious native
                        journal in Bengal, if ever he succeeds in making Egypt too hot him-which, we
                        rather fancy, it is just possible he may. The "St. James's Gazette"
                        says:-</p>
                    <p>That great and good servant of his Suzerain, Mustapha Pasha Kamel, has for
                        long, like young Copperfield, been "a-going it." But we doubt whether his
                        organ, the "Egyptian Standard" will surpass the splendour of its latest
                        outburst. Commenting on the "fact" that 338 deaths from plague were reported
                        for the week ended June 10, it calls on the Government to check this
                        terrible mortality "unless, of course, it is the Govern ment's wish
                        gradually to eradicate the native born inhabitants from Egyptian soil
                        following the praiseworthy methods employed by the Anglo-Americans with the
                        Red Indians in the United States." Unluckily just when, despite the odd use
                        of the word "praise worthy," we were beginning to shrivel with horrified

                    <p>NILE VALLEY (NEW) COMPANY.</p>
                    <p>The following report from the company's engineers has been issued by the
                        secretary:-</p>
                    <p>During the month of May the company's operations have been confined to
                        stoping and milling, no further development work having been carried out.
                        Stoping--A total of 942.8 tons was broken. Milling-During the month the
                        10-stamp mill ran for 5.690 stamp hours, treating 1,100 tons of ore, which
                        yielded 461.57 ozs fine gold, exclusive of 2.3 tons of concentrates of an
                        assay value of 28.2 dwts per ton. The ore crushed was obtained as follows:-
                        From stopes, 900.5 tons; from dumps, 109.5 tons. From the manager's latest
                        correspondence it would appear that a certain amount of speciinen stone was
                        met with in small patches during the May running. He is unable to state
                        definitely how much went into the mill, but estimates that between £300 and
                        £490 worth of specimen stone was stamped. 25 lbs weight of stone, which was
                        treated separately, gave 25 ozs of gold. Although the bulk of the ore was of
                        slightly lower grade than the previous month, yet this occurrence of
                        specimen stone must be regarded as a satisfactory indication.</p>

                    <p>The accounts for the year ended April 30 show a profit of £30,234, after
                        providing for all expenses connected with the working of the hotels, and a
                        total charge of £11,412 for the redemption of Debentures, the premiums on
                        Debentures purchased for cancellation, and the writing off of one-seventh of
                        the compensation paid to the Cie Internationale des Grands Hotels, in
                        accordance with the directors' report of July 21, 1903. The cost of up-keep
                        of furniture and buildings at Shepheard's Hotel, which has been charged
                        before arriving at the profits, has been exceptionally heavy, being about
                        £6,000 more than would be necessary in normal seasons. The balance of
                        undivided profit brought forward from last accounts, after providing for the
                        dividends declared on June 26, 1906, was £1,413, and the profit for the year
                        ended April 30, 1907, was 150,994, making together £31,648. The directors

                    <head>CAIRO STATION.</head>
                    <p>Some time ago we published a letter from a correspondent pointing out the
                        necessity for the establishment of a first-class refreshment room in Cairo
                        station and our correspondent's Iviews were subsequently endorsed in a
                        leading article which appeared in the columns of a Cairo contemporary. It is
                        now rumoured that a new contract of three years' duration has been granted
                        by the Administration to the proprietor of the café on the station platform.
                        It is difficult to understand why Alexandria, Tantah, and other stations
                        should have firstclass refreshment rooms, while all that Cairo station can
                        boast of is a very second rate caté, where it is impossible to procure a
                        good cup of tea or French coffee, not to mention luncheon or dinner. Were
                        the State Railways transformed into a Company the directors would ap
                        preciate the needs of the public in the interests of their shareholders, for
                        with capable management such an undertaking should prove very remunerative.
                        Travelling in Egypt, especially in the summer, is sufficiently trying and
                        its discomforts should be alleviated by every possible means. We trust the
                        Administration will further inquire into the circumstances in which the
                        public is to be deprived, during three years, of the comforts of a
                        respectable refreshment room at the Cairo terminus, for to the uninitiated
                        the reason remains profoundly obscure.</p>

                    <head>A PEEP AT CYPRUS.</head>
                    <head>A GARDEN ISLAND.</head>
                    <p>There has been much talk at home of garden cities. In Nicosia there is one
                        ready-made. Within the circle of its Venetian ramparts there are groves of
                        stately palms, feathery mimosas, sweet-scented Persian lilacs, and the
                        bright glossy green of oranges and lemons starred with odorous blossoms.
                        Houses occur as accidents in the mass of foliage. Walking in the narrow,
                        winding streets, you wonder what has become of the trees until an open
                        doorway reveals the spacious garden court overflowing with foliage, the
                        tender hue of the vine mingling with the darker tints of the fig and
                        relieved by the vivid scarlet of the pomegranate blooms. This is all within
                        the walls. Outside there is the moat planted with eucalyptus which have
                        attained the dimensions of forest trees, and, beyond, the roads lined with
                        pines and the English bungalows smothered with roses and passion flowers.
                        One may see the same thing elsewhere, but the gardens inside the city are
                        unique. It would be safe to say that there are more flowers to the square
                        mile than in any other city in the world. There is a street of cobblers, and
                        every stall has its roof of vine. There is a street of blacksmiths, but even
                        there the intruding green softens the sward hue of the forges.</p>
                    <p>The road from Larnaca is dull. Why Lamaca should be the chief port is not
                        apparent. It is an open roadstead, and the town is in the midst of the least
                        fertile portion of the island. On the other hand, Famagusta has a harbour
                        with a quay 800 feet long and a depth of 24 feet of water alongside. It is
                        connected with Nicosia by an excellent light railway traversing the richest
                        grain district in Cyprus. They are getting in their harvest now, and the
                        journey of 37 miles presents a succession of delightfal rural pictures.
                        There is a gay note of colour in the Cypriote dress, both of men and women
                        and the Messaoria plain is a sheet of gold diapered with patches of a
                        lighter tint where the wheat and barley have fallen beneath the sickle.
                        Famagusta itself is inhabited exclusively by Turks. They seem to live mainly
                        by frequenting one another's cafes, and fill up their time between dawn and
                        dusk by smoking nargilehs Outside the walls is the Greek town of Varosia.
                        Here people work. Shoemakers, tailors, bakers, and shopkeepers ply their
                        trades briskly, and here are the women shaping the pottery that has a
                        reputation in the island and is modelled on forms which have obtained since
                        the days when the heap of stones called Salomis was a city. Varosia stands
                        for the modern Famagusta. Near the station is the Savoy Hotel, between which
                        and the club the half dozen Englishmen whose work lies here divide their
                        hours of leisure ; all except one—the harbour-master. He is planted among
                        the Turks in a part of the fortifications known as Othello's Tower. There
                        was, it seems, a Pro- veditore of the Signory of Venice here named
                        Cristoforo Moro, though whether it was the original of Othello is not clear.
                        But Shakespeare, from act ii, to act v., laid his scene at. Famagusta, and
                        the worthy skipper is proud of his residence. He has turned the grim
                        Venetian stronghold into a comfortable English home.</p>
                    <p>The city has undergone the shrinkage which marks every seat of former
                        civilisation into which the Ottoman has stepped. There are vast waste spaces
                        and the remains of thirty churches and several jmlaces. The Royal residence
                        is now a police barracks and a prison containing pyramids of old stone,
                        round shot, and queer pieces of artillery of the fifteenth and sixteenth
                        centuries. The chief glory of the place is the Cathedral, now a mosque, and
                        the strangest mosque, surely, in which a Mussulman ever prayed. It is a
                        noble work of the early fourteenth century—pure French Gothic, with two
                        western towers and a glorious apse with flying buttresses reminding one of
                        Notre Dame. It is only by looking at the palm trees that we realise that we
                        are not in some old cathedral town of the West. Here in the days of
                        Famagusta's splendour the kings of Cyprus were crowned kings of Jerusalem,
                        and here opposite the west front, in the last dreadfifl days of 1571, the
                        brave defender of the fortress, Bragadino, was flayed alive while the
                        statues of the saints were being dragged from these now empty niches and the
                        Christian fane was being turned into a mosque. He had been lured into
                        surrender by the infamous Mustafa under the promise took place in 1821.
                        There are about 51,000 Turks in the island now. They are a quiet,
                        inoffensive section of the population, but the land is slowly passing out of
                        their hands into those of the more industrious Christian cultivators. They
                        prefer employment under the Cyprus Government I found one reading a sixpenny
                        edition of an English classic the other day; to one who knows anything of
                        the Turks the incident was amazing. Not less so is the fact that, in
                        addition to a high school for boys, they have another for girls, built
                        chiefly by subscriptions from Moslems in Nicosia as a memorial to Queen
                        Victoria.</p>
                    <p>We were on our way to the ruins of an ancient castle near Kyrenia a
                        magnificent eagle sailed close overhead. "Aetos I" exclaimed the Greek boy
                        who was our guide. He spoke the tongue of Homer, of whom he had never heard.
                        The word took us away from the vestiges of mediaeval Cyprus and set us
                        thinking of the many masters whom the island has known in its chequered
                        history. It is tranquil under the present one. It might be more prosperous,
                        but in contrast with what we had seen of late it is an Eden, and to the
                        traveller fresh from Ottoman territory a delightful resting-place.

                        des aspirants £ la licence ayant frequents exclusive- ment les cours du
                        soir.</p>
                    <p>Deja en 1895, le Conseiller Judiciaire, Sir J. Scott, ecrivait, dans son
                        rapport sur les exa- mens, ces lignes caracteristiques :•—</p>
                    <p>"J'ai pu constater que la valeur des etudiants frequentant les cours du soir,
                        et specialement de ceux de premiere et de seconde annee, est de beaucoup
                        inferieure k celle de leurs condisciples des cours du jour. C'est egalement
                        l'impression de M. Kassem Amin Bey, Conseiller k la Cour d'Appel indigene,
                        qui apris avoir faitTdloge des elfcves de 2me annee des cours du jdur
                        ajoute: (Malheureusement, je ne puis en dire autant des dfevea de 2me amfee
                        du soir; sur sept que j'ai examines, j'ai dfi eri refuser quatre,
                        c'estA-dire plus de la moitfe ; et je dois ajouter que ces trois que j'ai
                        cru pouvoir admettre etaient peu briilants)."</p>
                    <p>Sir Malcolm Mcllwraith enregistrait, £ son tour, au lendemain de sa premiere
                        visite a l'Ecole, les monies risultats decourageants, et je detache de son
                        rapport sur les examens de 1898 un fragment qui montre assez ce qu'ont ete
                        dans le passe les cours du soir et ce qa'ils seraient destines £ redevenir
                        en cas de rita- blissement:—</p>
                    <p>"J'ai constate £ tous les examens auxquels j'aiassiste, que les ei&amp;ves
                        qui etaientnotablement inferieurs £ la moyenne, etaient toujours des efeves
                        des cours du soir qui, etant gendrale- ment occopes dans la journee, ne
                        peuvent pro- bablement pas consacrer un temps suffisant £ la preparation de
                        leurs examens. Certes, il est tris meritoire que des jeunes gens qui sont
                        forces de gagner leur vie en travaillant dans les Minist£res et ailleure
                        dans la journee, con- sacrent leurs loisirs du soir £ l'acquisition de
                        connaissances juridiques. Mais d'un autre c6te, comme la plupart de ces
                        etudiants insuffisam- ment prepares sont admis, en fait, k leurs
                        examens,—sou vent par suite d'une trop grande indulgence de la part des
                        examinateurs,—il se forme peu a peu dans le pays un contingent de mauvais
                        licencfes en droit qui, malgri leur insuffisance, sont ostensiblement tout
                        aussi qualifies que d'autres pour des emplois dans la magistrature et les
                        Ministeres pour lesquels il n'y a dej£ que trop d'aspirants."</p>
                    <p>C'est £ la suite et sous la pression de ces ptaintes, riguli&amp;rement
                        renouvelees chaque annee par les jurys d'examens, que le Miniature de
                        l'lnstruction Publique decida de supprimer la section des cours du soir k
                        partir de la ren- tree de 1898-1899. La reforme s'imposait par des raisons
                        si ddcisives que le savant jurisconsults, le regrette Charles Testoud, qui
                        avait pris l'initiative et la responsabilite de la creation de la section du
                        soir, s'empressa lui-m£me, avec sa loyaute cou turn fere, de reconnaltre que
                        l'opportunite de cette suppression etait £ l'abri de la discussion. Dans le
                        rapport qu'il adres- sait au Miniature, le 9 Juin 1899, il avouait, non sans
                        tristesse, les desiilusions que lui avait causees cette partie de son oeuvre
                        :</p>
                    <p>" Il n'a plus, ecrit-il, ete admis d'dfeves pour la section du soir.
                        Conformement aux suggestions de M. le Conseiller Judiciaire, cette section a
                        ete abolie £ la rentree d'Octobre 1899, mais elle a ete abolie sans effets
                        ritros- pectifs. Cette suppression doit Itre consideree comme avantagense au
                        bien des etudes. Les efeves du soir etaient en effet d'une valeur
                        inferieure, pour diverses causes que je n'ai pas £ appricier ioi. "</p>
                    <p>Si les cours du soir avaient subsiste jusqu'£ l'heure actuelle, l'ecart entre
                        le niveau de culture de leur clientele et celui de la population scolaire
                        riguli&amp;re serait aujourd'hui beaucoup plus acouse encore, qu'en 1898 ;
                        car, depuis. Le moment serait bien mal choisi de recom- mencer £ fabriquer,
                        comme dan« la pdriode d'enfance de mon &lt;*cole, des licencfes en droit au
                        rabais et de qualitfe inferieure, quaniF l'affluence de la clientele
                        scolaire aux cours actuels est ddj£ excessive ; quand nous nous demandons
                        avec inquietude si le barreau et la et la magistrature pourront longtemps
                        absorber des contingents de juristea aussi importants que ceux que nous
                        fbrmons actuellement chaque annee. 150 etudiants se sont assis en 1906-1907
                        sur les bancs de ma premiere annee, et si mes renseignements sont exacts,
                        l'Eoole fran9aise de Droit en a vu pris d'une centaine venir s'inscrire sur
                        ses registres. Une production annuelle de pris de 250 licencfes est dejk >en
                        flagrante disproportion avec les besoms riels du pays, et il semble
                        difficile de meconnattre que, comme lfecrivait M. le Conseiller Khedivial
                        Bem&amp;rdi dans son rapport sur les examens de l'annee dernfere, l'offre
                        des juristes ne va pas tarder £ depasser la demande. Est-ce k Thenre oh le
                        marche egyptien des professions liberates va regorger de juristes jusqu'B
                        satiete, et oh la lutte pour la vie va devenir trop dure pour que tous ceux
                        des nouveaux venus qui ont fait des etudes suivies et rigalicres puissent se
                        tailler une place au barreau, qu'il convient d'inviter k entrer en lice des
                        concurrents qui, prepares k la hate et, par consequent, moins bien arafes,
                        sont presque tous condamnes (Favance £ l'insucris ?</p>
                    <p>Pour qu'une section du soir ne fht pas une trop grossfere contrefa^on de
                        l'ecole actuelle, il faudrait que ses etudiants s'astreignissent k suivre
                        one moyenne de quatre heures de cours par soirie, avec une assiduite que
                        l'ex- perience 3u pass$ a demoiitri 6tre incompatible avec les exigences de
                        leurs professions. Pour la doter d'un personnel aussi nombreux et aussi
                        competent que celui qui enseigne dans mes cours du jour, le Minisfere de
                        l'lnstruction Publique devrait se resigner A d'importants sacrifices
                        bndgetaires qui ne trouveraient ni leur justification ni leur recompense
                        dans les resultats obtenus. Car le seul effet certain que nous puissions
                        attendre d'un etablissement des cours du soir, c'est de pouaser un grand
                        nombre de fonctionnaires £ quitter l'asile assure que leur offrent les
                        carrferes administratives pour se lancer, sans preparation sdrieuse, dans la
                        lutte pour la conquete de la clientele juridique, et de former ainsi une
                        classe d'intellectuels desoeuvris et besogneux qui, ne trouvant, ni au
                        barreau, ni dans la magistrature, I'emploi de son activite, risque de
                        coastituer un element de trouble pour la societe.</p>
                    <p>J'ai confere, £ ce sujet, avec le Conseiller Judiciaire qui m'a dit qu'il
                        partageait pleine- ment cette manfere de voir et maintenait l'opinion qu'il
                        avait exprimee en 1898.</p>
                    <p>Veuillez agreer, je vous prie, Monsieur le Ministre, 1'assurance de mes

                    <p>The second meeting of these clubs took place at Guezireh Badrane on Friday
                        28th. The Institute were unable to put a full team into the field, the
                        absentees including W.B. Davies; the captain, P.G. Windsor, who officiated
                        in his absence, won the toss and took out Eevd. J.T. Bums with him to bat.
                        Just after doubles figures had been passed Revd. Bums got his foot in front
                        of a straight one from Barnes. With the exception of Windsor the Institute
                        batsmen failed to make any resistance against Barnes and Girton both of whom
                        bowled exceptionally well. The total amounted to 61. The Gunners made
                        anything but a promising start, Bradley being smartly taken behind the
                        wicket when 2. On Sullivan and Burgess being partnered runs came quickly.
                        Both men gave easy chances at the commencement of their innings but both
                        were fortunate to be let off, and these mistakes cost the Institute the
                        game. The home team's total was passed with five wickets down but the later
                        men added only 16. The Gunners who reached 80 thus won by 19 runs and
                        avenged their defeat by 158 earlier in the season. Appended are the
