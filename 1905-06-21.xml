                House of Commons.—Mr. Balfour said that Great Britain took immediate steps with regard to the sinking of the “St. Kilda” by a Russian cruiser. Correspondence is proceeding between the British and Russian Governments, as this is a matter of which Great Britain takes a very grave view, because we had received the most specific assurance that no such action would be again taken by Russian cruisers.

In one of our transatlantic contemporaries’ accounts it is stated that at the bottom of one of the vases in the tomb was some honey, in which floated a flea, which certainly goes to prove that it is true that there is nothing new under the sun, and shows ns also that the early Egyptian had his trials.</p>
                    <p>Suicide.—A Syrian shoemaker, called George Hanna Akouri, committed suicide at about 9 a m. to day.

                        <head>ACCIDENT NEAR TEWFIKIEH</head>
                        <p>An accident, which might have had very serious consequences, took place about two hundred yards from the Tewfikieh station, between Teh-el-Baroud and Kafrel Zayat, at 11.28 a.m. yesterday. The last five carriages of the Cairo-Alexandria express left the rails, tearing up the track, which was considerably damaged. One Arab woman was injured and most of the passengers of the five second and third class carriages which were involved in the accident were shaken and alarmed. A wire was at once sent to Tantah, but the | station-master was unable to give any assistance owing to the down line being blocked.</p>
                        <p>As soon as the news reached Alexandria a relief train was sent up which arrived at 2 p.m. and brought the passengers into Alexandria at 4.10 p.m.—three and a quarter hours late.</p>
                        <p>An official enquiry is being held into the cause of the accident, which might have had most serious consequences. Had the derailed carriages turned over the loss of life must have been considerable as the train was travelling at a high rate of speed.</p>
                        <p>A Katr el Zayat correspondent informs ns that it is suspected that the gang which was at work “renewing” on the upline extended their operations to the down line, and not being warned by signal of the approach of tire express, failed to replace the bolts of the fishplates properly, with the result that the rails gave way when the train passed over them.</p>

                        <p>A few days ago we mentioned the extraordinarily scandalous state of the lane by the Alexandria Bourse leading from Cherif Pasha-street to Tewfik Pasha-street. The cause of the congestion of this small but important thoroughfare is due entirely to the slackness of the Alexandria Municipality, whose services, for reasons best known to themselves, allow a horde of disorderly hawkers to ply their callings there all day long and far into the night. The booths of the fruit-sellers, fish-mongers, florists, bean-Vendors, etc., are kept open until an early hour in the morning and the lane has become a noisy, dirty, and disorderly market, which is often the scene of disorder, the most foul language-being used from early noon to dewy eve. We have been asked by many persons to draw the attention of the Municipality to this disgraceful state of things,but it appears to be useless, for up to now nothing has been done to remedy matters.</p>

                        <p>The many improvements and alterations that have been going on at the above hospital for several months past are now all completed and the new first and second class wards for patients of European nationality on the second floor that has been added are now ready for occupation. This extra accommodation comprises 8 rooms for females and 7 for males, in all 22 beds, besides a sitting-room for the former, 1 service-room with lift to the kitchen, and 2 bath-rooms ; a fine broad verandah running the whole length of the building on each of four sides has been added also. On the same floor there-has likewise been erected a room for aseptic operations with two ante-rooms adjoining. The installation of this portion of the new storey, i.e, all the instruments operating-table, sterilisators,is the gift Of Dr. Wild, the principal medical officer, who has connected with the hospital for the past 21 years, since its foundation, in fact.</p>
                        <p>The first floor has been entirely repainted and greatly improved, and a lift, which was much needed, has been fitted to communicate with the two upper stories.</p>
                        <p>The whole of these alterations and additions have cost close upon £6,000; as the committee, which is composed of English, American, and German gentlemen, had only a portion of that sum in hand they were compelled to borrow from a local bank the sum of £1,500, which has been guaranteed by three members of the committee until such time as the funds of the institution permit of the liquidation of this loan.</p>
                        <p>The Victoria Hospital of the Deaconesses is pleasantly situated opposite the Cairo Waterworks and in close proximity to the new and fine Abbas boulevard. It was opened in 1884, and during the 21 years of its existence this deserving institution has relieved quite an army of patients of every nationality and creed, for, besides the accommodation for in-patients, there is an out-patients' department where large numbers of the poorer sick crowd daily for medical advice and medicines. The building for the out-patients is at present much too small for the ever-increasing work, and it is hoped next year, should funds permit, to demolish it and erect larger and more suitable premises.</p>

                            <p>We learn that the letter was sent registered by the National Bank at Cairo on Saturday, and on Sunday news was sent by the post office at the above-mentioned place that the letter had not reached there.</p>
                            <p>The postal authorities inform us that the following are the numbers of the missing notes ; — (for L.E. 100) :	14469 ; 14470 ;

                            <p>Nahla Effendi Tadrous, lately in charge of the branch post office at Mesara Thos. Cook and Son's offices, near Shepheard's Hotel, will assume charge of the new postal office that will be opened on the 1st July on the ground floor of the Ministry of Finance, at Nasrieh.</p>

                            <p>The case of the theft from the Mahmal is at present receiving the full attention of the Native Parquet, and there is every appearance that the guilt of the four arrested men, whose names we gave in last Saturday's issue of the “Gazette," will be established. The police have arrested one of Androus’s brothers on a charge of complicity in the crime.</p>
                            <p>The Parquet has decided to question the chief of the porters of the Mahmal, who is said to have been intimate with Andraous Meloka. Some suspicious marks have been found on the door of the van which contained the treasure. Two fresh witnesses attendants in a Turkish bath, are to be called, It appears that Meloka showed cuts on the side and neck directly after the theft, but told his acquaintances that he had hurt himself in a bath. The attendants assert that when he stripped for his bath he bore quite recent injuries.</p>
                            <p>The Parquet is investigating this clue.</p>

                            <p>In “East and West" there is an interesting article on the Caliphate. The author, Mr. Ab dullah A. M. Sohraworthy, concludes with the following significant hint: — A cultured Japanese (Mr. Okakura)has recently defined Islam as “Confucianism on horseback, sword in hand." The Land of the Rising Sun may produce the hero who, by a simple process, would weld the conquering Japs and the warlike Moslems into one brotherhood, and direct the fanatical forces that lie looked up in the wilds of Asia into the paths of peace and progress, or perhaps of new conquests.</p>

                                <head>ON THE HEDJAZ RAILWAY.</head>
                                <head>BY P.P.G.</head>
                                <p>It is not difficult to get up at an unearthly hour of the morning when yon are bound on a long and interesting journey. My packing was done : the excellent Pietro refused to hear a word of my bill till I returned from Ma’a “And when you come back,” he added, “you will please take off all your clothes before you come into the hotel, and I will have a bath made ready for you.” “Is it as bad as that ?" quoth I, but Pietro held up his hands with a gesture in which pity for my ignorance and abhorrence of the conditions of travel in a troop train were sublimely blended. Then I got into an arabiya and drove off.</p>
                                <p>A good many of my readers must have seen Damascus, so I will spare them any description of my drive. I passed through a variety of bazaars which Murray and Baedeker have made celebrated, and saw many of the types which every self-respecting traveller sees. Circassians, Druses, Kurds, Israelites, Bedawin, and the “shy Bedawin women stealing along with their tattooed faces uncovered.”—I quote somebody's guide book from memory,—who seemed to me to be no more shy than the good ladies who accompany gipsy caravans at home.</p>
                                <p>Eventually I arrived at the station, and here I realised for the first time what the Hedjaz line was. There was no platform here and no sort of order whatever. All sorts of boxes and bales lay about in the sand and all sorts of officials in uniforms gesticulated and bellowed. In the station shed some fifteen persons surrounded an Effendi who wrote the tickets out Tickets, as we know them, are not to be found on the Hamidie-Hedjaz line, and yon get instead a paper with your destination and a number of other particulars scrawled on it by the booking office clerk. My turn came at last and I asked for Ma’an. An awkward panse followed, but a letter—the letter—was in my pocket I drew it out, I am afraid with the same gesture with which the hero of the “Family Herald” roman ces draws his revolver and reduces the villain to au impotent and raging silence, and in two minutes I had my ticket and was preparing to board the train.</p>
                                <p>There were further difficulties to surmount. Porters do not abound on the Hedjaz line; one individual whom I asked to help me with my camp—bed and packs, said with some heat that he was a sergeant, at which I was properly abashed.</p>
                                <p>At this moment the carriages of the Railway Commission came bumping up to the station, Mr. Meissner the Director in Chief of the Construction of the whole line, whom I had already met and admired, hastened to invite me to accompany the Commission which was bound for Deraa and, after mildly upbraiding me for bringing no servant, banded my baggage over to an orderly, and presented me to the Os manli members of the Commission H. E. Raif Pasha, Marshal and Chief of the Staff of the Vth Army Corps, now seconded for service as Military Head of the Railway Commission and his lieutenants.</p>
                                <p>The Pasha was a vigorous looking man of about fifty years, with a heavy but intelligent face. He spoke French well and his knowledge of the military aide of Railway Engineering was evidently considerable. With him were two very pleasant and intelligent officers, one a Turk, the other of Arab origin on one side at least, who were to point out a vast number of interesting objects to me in the course of the next few hours.</p>
                                <p>At last the baggage was on board. The guard blew a long blast on a bugle, and we started with a terrific bump in fairly good time. Dera was to be reached at about 2 p.m. and from 10.0 a.m. to 2 pm. the train ran through the Hauran Plain, one of the most fertile and interesting districts in Palestine. (To be continued)</p>

                                    (8-20 Juin)</head>
                                    <p>Cette dernière quinzaine n'a pas été brillante. Non seulement lés positions de beaucoup se trouvaient surchargées, ainsi que nous l'avions prévu, mais une foule d’autres circonstances ont contribué à affaiblir le marché : la qu'on croyait imminente demeure encore problématique ; le malentendu franco-allemand, qui à sa période aiguë a produit un malaise général, n'est pas encore définitivement ap-plani ; les capitalistes partant en villégiature liquident leurs positions et ceux qui restent attendent des jours meilleurs ; enfin les banques elles-mêmes se montrent plus difficiles pour les avances et ne prêtent pas sur les titres nouveaux. Voilà plus de motifs qu'il n'en faut pour expliquer l'état actuel du marché. La petite spéculation, qui avait jusqu'ici sacrifié ses gros titres pour ne pas se défaire des petits avec une perte énorme, n’a pu tenir plas long-temps et a du liquider au mieux, ce qui n’a pas été facile, car aucun capitaliste n’était là pour sauver la situation en absorbant d’un seul coup tout le flottant. C’est donc moins aux titres eux-mêmes qu’aux circonstances défavorables actuelles qu’il fout attribuer la baisse de ces derniers jours.</p>
                                    <p>Parmi les valeurs qui se sont maintenues le plus ferme, il fout placer en première ligne l’Agricole, dont le cours débute à 18 11/16 atteint 13 7/8 pour clôturer à 13 21/32 ven deurs. La prochaine émission est pour beau-coup dans ce soutien relatif.</p>
                                    <p>De 26 3/4 la National Bank ancienne émission fléchit graduellement à 26 9/32 ex-droit, prix auquel elle clôture, tandis que la nouvelle émission est demandée à 26 1/2. Cet ecart que rien ne justifie, puisque l’ancienne émission a seule droit an coupon jette un nouveau jour sur la situation de notre place ; il suffit, en effet, qu’on ait peu d’argent à verser pour qu’une valeur y soit aussitôt recherchée et hausse contre toutes les règles du bon sens. Aussi faut-il s’attendre à un revirement dès qu’une amélioration se produira.</p> 
                                    <p>La Land Bank fluctue entre 9 et 9 3/16, prix auquel elle clôture acheteurs.</p>
                                    <p>De 28 11/16 la Daïra fléchit à 28 5/16 pour reprendre un peu plus tard à 28 19/32 et finir à 28 7/16. On ne sait rien encore de précis sur la liquidation dont on ne connaîtra les clauses détaillées que vers la mi-juillet.</p>
                                    <p>L’action Crédit Foncier fléchit de 823 à 812.</p>
                                    <p>L’Investment débute à 1 11/16 pour tomber graduellement jusqu'à 1 5/16, cours auquel on clôture acheteurs. Bon nombre de remisiers et de leurs clients qui avaient fait des reports pour le 15 de ce mois ont été contraints de liquider au mieux ; les acheteurs voyant les ventes continuer se tiennent naturellement sur la réserve. Ou a fait circuler la rumeur de la démission d'un administrateur de cette société, mais cette nouvelle a été de suite officiellement démentie.</p>
                                    <p>De 1 1/4 le Trust a baissé un moment jusqu’à 1 1/8 pour reprendre eu clôture à 1 3/16. Nombre de détenteurs de lettres de répartition n’ayant pas encore reçu leurs certificats au porteur se trouvent dans l’impossi bilité de livrer leurs titres, tandis qu’ils sont contraints d’en recevoir des paquets de déten teurs plus favorisés.</p>
                                    <p>D'importantes opérations ont eu lieu en Estâtes entre 7/8 et 15/16. Le prix de cloture
                                    est 7/8.</p>
                                    <p>La Béhéra monte de 45 1/2 à 45 3/4 pour
                                    finir à 45.</p>
                                    <p>Très soutenue d’abord à 124 1/2, la Banque d’Athènes clôture plus faible à 120 par suite de la commotion politique produite par l’assassinat de M. Delyannis.</p>
                                    <p>De 2 1/2 la Delta Dand fléchit à 2 1/4 vendeurs.</p>
                                    <p>L’Anglo-American Nile ouvre à 5 11/16, cote 5 5/16 ex-coupon et finit à 5 1/4 vendeurs.</p>
                                    <p>La Salt and Soda retombe de 35/6 à 33. On s’attend à une sérieuse reprise sur cette valeur au retour des capitalistes.</p>
                                    <p>La Delta Light monte de 12 15/16 à 13 1/16, mais ne tarde pas à retomber à 12 7/8 pour finir à 12 11/16. Ia Deferred baisse de 14 1/2 à 14 1/8 sans affaires.</p>
                                    <p>De 7 3/4 la Ramleh Railway à 7 3/8 avec un chiffre d'affaires restreint</p>
                                    <p>Les Privilégiées Tramways fluctuent entre 152 et 153 pour finir très soutenues à 152 1/2.</p>
                                    <p>Les Dividendes sont plus faibles à 348.</p>
                                    <p>L’Urbaine ouvre à 4 5/8, atteint 4 7/8, mais fléchit avec tout le reste à 4 5/8 vendeurs. Cette société serait déjà engagée, parait-il, dans plusieurs affaires de premier ordre.</p>
                                    <p>Les Splendid Hotels fluctuent entre 4 3/8 et 4 9/16 pour finir à 4 1/2.</p>
                                    <p>Les Eaux d’Alexandrie débutent à 15 3/4, cotent 15 1/4 ex-coupon et clôturent à 15 1/8.</p>
                                    <p>De 1,130, les Baux du Caire tombent à 1,120 acheteurs.</p>
                                    <p>Les Egyptian Markets se maintiennent à 22/3 acheteurs.</p>
                                    <p>En Filature on ouvre à 11/16, atteint 25/32 pour retomber en clôture à 11/16, avec nombreuses transactions.</p>
                                    <p>L’Obligation Crédit Foncier fléchit de 318 à 314 1/2.</p>
                                    <p>En somme, la situation n’est pas brillante, comme on vient de. le voir. Certaines valeurs pourraient même fléchir encore davantage avec la liquidation dè fin de mois, à moins qu'un événement favorable imprévu ne vienne changer la face des choses.</p>
                                    <p>Le marché a été calme jusque vers midi. A ce moment d’importants rachats ont eu lieu en Investment dont le cours a haussé rapidement de 1 5/16 à 1 7/16 forts acheteurs. On a fait 4 à 5000 actions à ce prix. Les positions surchargées étant à peu près liquidées, le mouvement ascensionnel a dos chances de s'accentuer.</p>
                                    <p>Certaines valeurs ont profité de cette reprise, mais en général les changements indiquent une baisse : La National Bank fléchit de 26 5/16 à 26 1/4, l'Alexandria Water de 15 1/4 à 15, la Delta Light de 12 11/16 à 12 5/8 et la Ramleh Railway de 7 5/8 à 7 7/16.</p>
                                    <p>Seule la Salt and Soda reprend légèrement de 33 à 83/8 et l’action Crédit Foncier de 813 à 813.</p>
