                        smallest indica tion that events are moving in the direction of making such
                        a return possible, but does not desire that it should be so. The time is
                        past, he says, for the Jewish race to be uni-national; he looks rather to
                        see his people good citizens of the countries of their adoption. Perhaps his
                        ideal is not less patriotic than Mr Zangwills. For social reasons, however,
                        and chiefly to ease the congestion within the Jewish pale of Russia, Mr.
                        Wolf is ready to join the Jewish Territorial Organisation in its endeavour
                        to plant a colony in any favorable region of the British Empire where a
                        grant may be obtained. The new State is to be developed along the line of a
                        self-governing British Colony, the gover nor or administrator to be a Jew,
                        but the most thorough religions tolerance to be exercised When British folk
                        can only supply twelve millions of white inhabitants to their posse sions
                        overseas, the offer to colonies a great tract of land with an industrious
                        and thrift; population is one not to be lightly refused Mr. Zangwill
                        announces that not only the poor and persecuted Jew of the lower orders is
                        prepared to cast in his lot with his co-religion ex ists in East Africa, but
                        also middle-class Jews some of them men of considerable so bet ana The
                        prospect of success is greatly enhanced thereby. Like all other countries,
                        the new Stet will undoubtedly at the outset be pastoral an agricultural To
                        many this will, perhapa suggest a doubt of its probable prosperity The
                        modern Jew is chiefly successful a financier, merchant, or tradesman. But of
                        ok he was an agriculturist; and that his capacity for working the land has
                        not passed away may be seen from certain communities is Southern Russia,
                        where in the early part of last century Jewish families were planted on the
                        soil and kept there at the point of the bayonet until today their
                        descendants are among the most prosperous of Russian farmers. In process of
                        time industries may take root in the proposed ed colony, as Mr. Zangwill
                        hopes No doubt a tract of country with mineral renames will be sought with
                        this and in view.</p>
                    <p>We trust that the British Government will see its way to making such a grant
                        of land that the colony may have a fair prospect of success. Whether we
                        believe or disbelieving that the gorgeous promise of prophecy, "the ransomed
                        of the Lord shall return and com to Zion, with songs end everlasting joy
                        upon their heads," presages an actual return of the afflicted people to the
                        Holy City, we cannot refuse to acknowledge that, despite ever attempt to
                        destroy it, the racial spirit of the Jews is unbroken today, as it was when
                        the legions of Titos stormed and sacked the Temple. If it be the of Great
                        Britain to promote the reunion of the Children of the Dispersion behind the
                        power of the Britain Navy, Great Britain may wall ha proud of her destiny.
                        Whether it be the direct inte position of the Divine Hand, or the working of
                        natural law, the prediction of Balaam over Israel appears to hold good
                        today: "Blessed is be that bleseeth thee, and cursed is that ourseth thee."
                        No nation has pros pen among wheat pence otic a of the Jews have bean a
                        feature of national policy.</p>

                            success. Amongst those present we noticed H.E. Khalil Hamdi Pasha
                            Hamada, the committee and a large number of members of the San Stefano
                            Club, Baron Acton, Consul General of Italy, H.B. Fakhry Pasha, Mr. Webb,
                            M. Scotidis, Hellenic Consul, Count Zizinia, and many others. The band
                            of the Customs porters’ chil- dren played several elections in an
                            admirable manner, and the dancing of Professor Longhi’s pupils was
                            exceedingly well done and made a very pretty sight The Brachale
                            orchestra gave several selections from Verdi's operas which were greatly
                            appreciated, and at the conclusion of the performance the management of
                            the Casino very kindly distributed a number of small presents amongst
                            the children. The receipts of the fête amounted to £60, and as all the
                            expenses were defrayed by the San Stefano Casino and H.E. Khalil Hamdi
                            Pasha Hamada, the fall sum was handed over to Baron Acton for his
                            Calabrian relief fund.</p>

                    <p>It appears that the late M. de la Bouglise was found lying dead in the Sharia
                        Soliman Pasha by two Italians. He was evidently on his way back from the
                        Villa Victoria where be had called upon M. Leroux, when the disease, from
                        which he had long suffered, struck him down. The corpse was taken to the
                        Abdin caracol, where it was identified by M. Bertrand and MM. Leronx and
                        Naus.</p>
                    <p>The funeral, which left the French hospital at 4 p.m. yesterday, was attended
                        by M. Bertrand and the French consular staff, by many members of the French
                        colony, and the leading representatives of the Sucreries Com- pany. The body
                        of the late M. de la Bouglise was interred in a vault in tho Old Cairo ceme-
                        tery, pending instructions from the family of the deceased.</p>
                    <p>M. Leroux left Cairo for Europe yesterday, having received news of the
                        serious illness of his mother. He hopes to return to Egypt in a short
                        time.</p>

                    <p>We published particulars in our issue of the 22nd instant of the now company
                        that has just been formed, with Sir William Willcocks as chairman, and which
                        will be brought out in the course of next month.</p>
                    <p>We are now informed that so favorably is this new undertaking viewed by both
                        the European and the Native communities that already more than the entire
                        capital of L B. 500,000 has been privately applied for, the applications
                        coming in from all parts of the country, and ranging from five shares to
                        several thousands. To comply with the rules of the local bourses a third of
                        the share capital will, however, have to be offered for public sub-
                        scription so as to obtain a quotation of the sharer of the company. Among
                        the satisfactory points to be noted are the following. No pro- motion money
                        will be paid in connection with the formation of the company but a certain
                        number of founders' shares will be created,and these wilt be allotted to the
                        promoters in lieu of payment in cash. The shareholders will moreover be
                        entitled to a prior and cumulative yearly dividend of four per cent, and the
                        founders’ shares only participate to the extent of thirty per cent of the
                        surplus profits, the balance of seventy per cent going to the share-
                        holders. In the meanwhile we may mention that the support the promoters have
                        so far received greatly exceeds their most sanguine anti- cipations.</p>

                    <head>AFTER THE EXPLOSION. </head>
                    <byline>(From our Correspondent).</byline>
                    <p>Port Said, Friday. The consequences of the explosion yesterday, notably the
                        rapidly growing congestion of the harbour here,are beginning to make
                        themselves apparent There are thirteen ships now on the buoys and vessels
                        have been arriving steadily all day. The coal basin is to be utilised
                        shortly for ships as they come in from sea and the Dutch, or man-of-war
                        anchorage will be used for vessels of short' length. The big berths in front
                        of the main streets, Rue de Commerce and Quai Eugenie, are reserved for the
                        arrival of mail and passenger boats, in all, the har- bour, as it is at
                        present can accommodate with cue about 25 more vessels, and this number will
                        soon be reached, as a glance at the lists of ships due here will shew. There
                        is talk of moving the vessels now in harbour into the canal between here and
                        Ras el Bah,as the new arrivals make extra berthing space a necessity and I
                        should think that this will require to be done in a few days, as early
                        during next week several large passenger boats will arrive.</p>
                    <p>I have heard nothing of what arrangements are being made regarding the
                        transport of mails in the event of the canal still blocked when the Brindisi
                        boat comes in on Wednesday, but hopes have been expressed by competent
                        authorities that it may be possible to send vessels through the canal past
                        the Chatham’s remains by that time.</p>
                    <p>No strangers are allowed to go down the canal on any account, though frequent
                        requests have been made by residents and others for permission to view the
                        spot.</p>
                    <p>Work is being pushed on by night and day at kilometre 18.4 ; Arabs in
                        hundreds are busily engaged removing débris from the canal banks, and
                        redoing the chaos which reigned yesterday to some semblance of order and
                        system. Fish is their staple food, and these continue to come to the surface
                        in hundreds, porpoise, black fish, and mullet being the principal
                        species.</p>
                    <p>The sounding charts are practically com- pleted, and a consultation is to be
                        held the moment the soundings and examination of the state of the bottom of
                        the canal are com- pleted.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Harris is to remain here to give the Canal Company the benefit of his
                        knowledge in the matter of blowing up what remains of the now famous ship,
                        and two divers who are skilled in submarine mining are due here to morrow to
                        go on with what Mr. Harris suggests. It is probable that no new explosion
                        will be made for a while, it it is found that dredging will make the channel
                        clear enough to allow the accumulated ships to get through.</p>
                    <p>There are seventeen ships at Suez this afternoon but none are allowed to
                        enter the canal.</p>

                    <dateline>Alexandria, September SO.</dateline>
                    <p>As I passed the scene of the explosion on my return home yesterday, few
                        traces were visible of the destruction caused by Thursday’s explosion. The
                        train moved along slowly, thus enabling me easily to see all there was to be
                        seen. All that could be discerned on the east or Asiatic bank was the gap
                        caused by the explosion, and, at the distance from which we saw it, this did
                        not appear to be very extensive.</p>
                    <p>All that was to be seen of the unfortunate Chatham was a portion of the mast
                        in the water. Several dredgers were at work in the canal, and steam launches
                        and other vessels in the service of the company were also busily employed.
                        The fresh-water canal had no fish remaining on its surface, -this could
                        hardly be expected twenty-six hours after the shock that had killed them.
                        Probably at that time few remained uneaten. I cannot say that the inter of
                        this canal looked very inviting,in fact that of the maritime canal looked
                        far more fit for drinking purposes. It was perhaps as well that I did not
                        notice this water before reaching Port Said, for although when filtered it
                        was beautifully clear and palatable, its state as it flows between the banks
                        most certainly appears to leave much to be desired. The western bank of the
                        canal bears no traces whatever—apart from the pipes and other appliances
                        used- of the explosion, and no one would imagine even that the telegraph
                        wires had been interfered with. Nor did I see any broken glass about.</p>
                    <p>I had a short but interesting conversation with Captain Hill, of the Chatham,
                        on Thurs- day. It is not, I think, generally known that the cause of the
                        fire spreading so rapidly after the collision with the Clan Cumming was the
                        foot that the lamp (or lamps) upset set fire to some highly flammable
                        composition contain- ing naphtha, many drums of which were stored on board.
                        These Exploded one after another, reusing the rapid extension of the fire
                        which necessitated the flooding and consequent sinking of the vessel with
                        its dangerous cargo. As to this same composition it is stated that but for a
                        contravention of the law which abso- lutely prohibits the storing of such
                        stuff in confined spaces, and insists upon the drums being carried on the
                        open deck, free to the air, no serious results would have arisen from the
                        slight collision which took place. Such colli- sions,I hear, are of somewhat
                        frequent occurrence.</p>
                    <p>More work for the lawyers!! The gentlemen of the long robe will no doubt be
                        extremely busy for a time, and the ill wind of the disaster will blow them
                        at least much good in the shape of fees. In conversation with Mr, Hama
                        yesterday, that gentleman informed me that it was probable that his stay in
                        <cb/>Egypt might be a somewhat prolonged one, as his evidence might be
                        required in a pending notion respecting the dynamite which was exploded
                        under his direction at Aboukir in Jane last Litigation ! litigation ! when
                        will arbitration takes its place in the settle- ment of disputes? The
                        question is easily answered. Never ! so long as the lawyers are the power
                        they are at present, in every nation and in every clime. T. A.</p>

                            few details of the crime committed on the road to the Oasis. As a matter
                            of fact, the examination of the witnesses ended only re- cently, and it
                            was useless to give details before ascertaining their truth.</p>
                        <p>The policeman, who returned to Assiout with the news of the crime, had
                            sustained three wounds in the head and shoulders, but these proved later

                            that he himself was the murderer, his anger having been aroused by the
                            fact that his wife had been guilty of improper conduct with one of the
                            camel drivers.</p>

                        <head>THE CAIRO CITY POLICE.</head>
                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette. Sir,—It appears to be the fashion
                            "all the year round” for most people who know anything bad about the
                            city police to im- mediately communicate it nicely trimmed to the local
                            press, while those, if there be any, (and I think there must be one
                            every now and then) who happen to know anything good about the members
                            of the force seem always careful to keep it to themselves. I will ask
                            you, if you think it worth while, to give your read- ers particulars of
                            the following case, which I think, most of them will admit, reflects the
                            greatest credit on the city police, as well as on the Parquet and on the
                            present existing ma- chinery and its working, which enabled them to
                            capture and bring the offender to trial in such a very short time.</p>
                        <p>On the 13th inst I reported to the Cairo city police that some
                            handkerchiefs had been stolen from “An Dé Rouge.” Molazim Awal Ahmed
                            Effendi Zeki of the Mouski police dis- trict commenced an investigation
                            of the case, in such a keen, intelligent and effective man- ner, that in
                            a very short time a man was arrested when offering the stolen
                            handkerchiefs for sale in the Fagallah quarter, and another (a Sudan-
                            ese) at the Cairo railway station. The police investigation threw
                            suspicion on a Sudanese servant employed by me. He bolted, and although
                            he lived near the Saida Bl Zeinab quarter, he was cleverly arrested by a
                            native shawish of the city police, when hiding upstairs in a liquor shop
                            off Clot Bey street.</p>
                        <p>To-day the three were brought to trial by the Parquet, and sent to prison
                            with hard labour for six months, i.e. in 15 days from the time the theft
                            was reported to the police. I am, Sir, etc. </p>

                    <head>SERPENT WORSHIP IN EGYPT</head>
                    <p>The last two numbers of the "Revue de l’Histoire des Religions" contain a
                        remarks ble article by M. Aun-lineau, in which he labours to prove that the
                        cosntant represen tation by the Egyptians of gods in serpent form implies
                        the doctrine that the souls of the gods took refuge after death within the
                        bodies of living snakes. This agrees fairly well with the facts noted by M.
                        Maspero in his essay on “De Quelques Cultes et de Quelques Croyances
                        Popalaires des Egyptians,” wherein be points oat that not only were certain
                        deities — for instance, the goddess Miritskro -alluded to in terms which
                        leave no doubt that they were actual and verita ble serpents, but also the
                        snake is still rever enced among both Christians and Mahom- medans in Egypt
                        at the present day. We have heard of houses in Alexandria and Cairo where a
                        cobra is a sort of pensioner fed on birds and milk. That this should be so
                        is by no means astonishing, when we consider how widespread is such worship
                        throughout Africa so far south even as Dahomey. This should warn us against
                        looking too exclusively to Asia as the source of Egyptian outturn. That M.
                        Amelineau’s reasoning is conclusive can, however, hardly be said, and his
                        writings continue to present that incapacity for clear statement which have
                        gone far to render his really epoch-making work at Abydos of less value than
                        it should have been. The chapters devoted to it in M. de Morgan’s "Les
                        Origines de l’Egypte" still remain the only intelligible record of it yet
                        published, and the perusal of of M. Amelineau’s four huge volumes on “Les
                        Novelles Fouilles d’Abydos" leaves the reader more confused than before as
                        to what he really discovered there. Yet his latest theory certainly demands
                        careful consideration. The representations of serpents, both divine and
                        demoniacal, on every page, not only in the "Book of the Dead,” but also in
                        the other funeral texts known as the "Book of Hades," the "Book of the
                        Gates," and the like, are suggestive, as is the representation-which be does
                        not seem to have noticed—of (the Greek) Sarapis and Isis under the guise of
                        crowned serpents, sometimes with human heads.</p>

                    <p>The Association welcomes the announcement, and ventures to hope that some
                        explanation will be forthcoming on the part of those who have made
                        themselves responsible for the dis- semination throughout the world of
                        information not consonant with fact.</p>
                    <p>It surely cannot have been a mere accident that Renter’s agent at Liege

                        repudiated by Sir Constantine Phipps— that the applause which greeted Sir
                        Albert Rollit’s remarkable statements "was led by the British Minister"

                    <p>Liverpool, September 21, The market this week has been very quiet, the
                        business being quite of a retail character, quotations,however,are
                        unchanged. In Futures the business has also been very limited. The following
                        are the latest values :— Sep. 7.42 Nov. 7.31 Jan. 7.18 , Oct. 7.38 Deo. 7.24
                        Feb. 7.17 Mar. 7.1C</p>
                    <p>American Futures. The market this week has been fairly active, and prices
                        have fluctuated sharply, a decline of six points has been followed by an
                        advance of 15@ 17 points. Todays closing values being 9 @11 pts. higher than
                        those of last Thurs- day. The decline was chiefly due to the general belief
                        in lower prices. and bear ma- nipulation, and the advance to the with-
                        holding by the South of the actual cotton, and considerable covering
                        operations by the short interest. Apparently at 50 @60 points decline the
                        South withheld their cotton, and with the assistance of banks, conferences
                        and combinations, they appear to possess the power to do so whenever prices
                        fall or are driven below the basis they consider that they should obtain for
                        their produce. They proved last season that they can largely control the
                        price, and although present con- ditions are not so favorable to them, they
                        evidently intend to use their power this season in the same direction.</p>

                    <p>To celebrate the recent settlement of the Lancashire cotton dispute, the Lord
                        Mayor of Manchester entertained at dinner, on Wednesday, last week, the
                        representatives of the employers and operatives who took part in the
                        conference arranged at his invitation, as a re- sult of which the crisis was
                        ended. The Lord Mayor presided, and in congratulating his guests on the
                        happy ending to the dispute, he said that the settlement had been welcomed
                        by all sections of the community. Among the letters he had received was one
                        from the Prime Minister expressing his satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>Mr. C. W. Macara, President of the Master Cotton Spinners’ Association, in
                        responding to the toast "prosperity to the Cotton Trade," said the forces of
                        Capital, and Labour had join- ed in the movement to extend the growth of
                        cotton throughout the British Empire, and to protect the interests of the
                        cotton industry, and he expressed the hope that in the coming deliberations
                        some means would be, equitable to all, by which disputes and differences
                        might be expeditiously and amicably settled, found, without recourse to
                        lock-outs and strikes.</p>
                    <p>The Lord Mayor received the thanks of the assembly for his kindly
                        intervention in the dispute.</p>

                    <p>—We would draw the attention of manufacturers and mer- chants to the work of
                        the British Chamber of Commerce of Egypt, which was formed in 1896 with the
                        sole object of assisting British trade in this country. The services of the
                        Chamber are always at the disposal of any member desiring information on
                        trade matters generally, including the question of appoint- ing suitable
                        agents. As no fee is charged for such advice, it is obviously in the
                        interests of all British traders here to become members, especially when it
                        is remembered that the annual subscription is merely the nominal one of XI.
                        The latter payment also includes a copy of the monthly Journal issued by the
                        Chamber. Home enquirers can obtain farther particulars from our London
                        office, 36, New Broad-street, which acts as agents to the Chamber.</p>

                    <head> RUSSIA AND THE POLES. “Times.”</head>
                    <p>Whether they have grasped the full consequences of their plan or not, the
                        Russian Committee of Ministers appear to have evolved a series of measures
                        which will give a direct and considerable increase of strength to the Polish
                        nationality from that fact we most conclude that they are not afraid, at
                        present, ' of intrenching it in a more influential position | in the Empire.
                        The actual concessions that will affect the Poles are comprised in two
                        recent Imperial Ukases. One of them, the edict on religious toleration,
                        applies indiffer- ently to the whole Empire. The other, which regulates
                        teaching in the schools, the revival of representation of the nobles, and
                        the acqui- sition of landed property in the nine “Western Governments,”
                        relates to the Poles directly. The chief secret of Polish acquiescence in
                        Russian rule is, we cannot doubt, that the Poles prefer to remain with the
                        Slav rather than to court by any other policy the dangers of Teutonic
                        aggression. The Russian Govern- ment will be well advised to make them loyal
                        and contented subjects. Its new programme is welcome as tending to that
                        result, even if it has been partially inspired by less creditable
                        motives.</p>

                    <p>The "Novoye Viemya”— a journal represent- ing views not usually friendly to
                        this country— while dismissing certain suggestions as inad- missible, by no
                        means scouts the idea of an Anglo Russian entente. No responsible au-
                        thority known to us has ever proposed that we should offer to Russia rights
                        which are not ours to give away. In the Anglo French Con- vention there was
                        no question of exchanging “rights" in Egypt for “rights” in Morocco. The
                        contracting parties recognised the pre- dominant interests—quite another
                        thing from rights—of one another in the respective coun- tries of Egypt and
                        Morocco, and undertook not to interfere with the protection and devel-
                        opment of these interests, subject always to respect for the legitimate
                        interests of other Powers. No British statesman could possibly "offer"
                        Constantinople to Russia, or the re- version of the Sick Man’s inheritance
                        in Asia Minor, for the good and sufficient reason that they are not ours to
                        give or to withhold. It is, however, a different thing to say that Eng- land
                        has ceased to have the peculiar interest in the Near Bast which was the
                        mainspring of our traditional policy in the Palmeratonian days.- Our
                        relations with the Mediterranean Powers, the opening of the Sues Canal, and
                        many other developments have changed all that.”</p>

                    <p>During the past three weeks the Ambassa- dors of the powers have been
                        uncommonly constant in their attendance at the Selamlik, and have been
                        received in audience both by the Sultan and tie Minister for Foreign Affaire
                        so frequently as to excite some comment. The Russian Ambassador has his own
                        axe to grind. His business is to impress the Sultan with the idea that the
                        emotion of forts on the Bosphorus is an unkind if not an unfriendly act
                        towards benevolent Russia . . . . The root-cause of the of the present
                        disturbances is that Bulgaria and Greece both sea that their chances of
                        possessing Macedonia are fading in proportion as the police become more
                        efficient and influen- tial In fact, this view of the matter is being
                        frankly advanced by a section of the Bulgarian Press, and therefore the
                        assumption can hardly be wrong that financial control is not the only
                        subject which the Sultan has to discuss with the Ambassadors to his Court

                    <head>LIBERAL CRITICISM OF CHINESE LABOUR. "Daily News."</head>
                    <p>From the carefully phrased report of Lord Solborue’s meeting with the Boer
                        farmers yes- terday, we might imagine that everything in the Transvaal was
                        "working smoothly and satisfactorily,” as the Archbishops would say. The
                        Boers apparently only needed a few com- forting words from the High
                        Commissioner to realise their happy position and the “inevit- ableness” of
                        Chinese labour, and to buret out into "a round of hearty cheers.” The report
                        does credit *o the discretion of the reporter and the affability of Lord
                        Selborne as well as to the unexacting nature of the Boers. It is difficult
                        to find the reason for their com- plaisance in the facts...............</p>
                    <p>Only this week it has been necessary to amend the Ordinance, with a view to
                        inducing tha civilian population to help the polios in recapturing the
                        runaways. And if the means of protection are sufficient, why arm the Boers
                        Bat, indeed, there is no need to ask this ques- tion in face of the
                        accumulated facts of the escapes and criminal incidents which can no longer
                        be concealed. Something like a reign of terrorism is developing, and the
                        sinister admission was made by the President of the Chamber of Mines
                        yesterday that there was no power of preventing the police from leaving the
                        compounds.”</p>

                    <p>Lord Selborne declared that the Chinese "scare" would soon be over, but we
                        see that Mr. Chaplin, the President of the Chamber of Mines, declared that
                        the mining companies are "unable, under the Ordinance, to restrict the
                        compounds." If they were permitted to do so, it would be moat undesirable,
                        as it would mean condemning the coolies to an existence which might be
                        called slavery thus giving rise to disturbances and depriving them of the
                        power of spending practically the whole of their wages in the country, which
                        power they at present possess.</p>
                    <p>We are rather inclined to agree that the compound should not be a prison ;
                        but at the same time we feel sure that the inhabitants of the Transvaal
                        never contemplated a state of facts in which the Chinese woe Id be able so
                        easily to get at large.</p>

                        Rouvier would suggest having the diffe rences settled by a court of

                        the Moorish frontier as France. A large sum has already been expended at
                        Melilla on the sup- port of Moorish fugitives, and the place is too small to
                        accommodate further numbers. An amplification of frontier territory is,

                    <p>We have resisted without an effort Ger many's power of seduction. It looked
                        as if Berlin had made np her mind to postpone these manifestations of
                        violent love. Not at all. Now, at the very moment when we seem to be taken
                        back to the early days of the strained situation prevailing at the begin-
                        ning, the“Berliner Tageblatt" seriously suggests that we should ally
                        ourselves with Germany in order to form with Russia a counterpoise to the
                        Anglo-Japanese coalition—that, of course, with the innocent object of
                        restoring the in- dispensable equilibrium for the maintenance of peace among
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>That is the pretty little lullaby with which William II. went to soothe
                        Nicholas II. at Bjoerkoe. Why should we turn agaist England ? We have no
                        alliance with her, but the fact that England makes common cause with us is
                        just what constitutes Germany's grievance against her. I see clearly that an
                        attempt is being made to frighten us into opposition to England, but, so far
                        as we are concerned, fright cannot take the place of reason. The "Berliner
                        Tageblatt” invokes, it is true, the interest of French Indo-China, the
                        security of which is a matter of concern for us. But to avoid all uneasiness
                        in that direc- tion we need not throw ourselves into the arms of Germany and
                        wage war against the yellow peri]. All we have to do is to seek closer
                        relations with Japan.</p>

                    <p>The"Republique Francaise" referring to the recent alerte, says it will have
                        shown Germany the unanimity of the French Press and the perfect harmony of
                        views existing on the subject between the British and French na- tions. It
                        is not without reason that Bebel was able to charge German diplomacy with
                        paving, through its arrogance and its blunders, thrown France into the arms
                        of England. If William II. imagined that by alarming France he would detach
                        her from her entente with the British people he made an egregious error, and
                        every time that there is an opportunity he may realise the effects and the
                        proofs of an increasing intimacy which he, more than anybody else, has
                        contributed to cement during the last few months.</p>

                    <head>WHY DELCASSE RESIGNED. “Manchester Guardian.”</head>
                    <p>According to Sir Thomas Barclay, when the Morocco trouble with Germany began
                        M. Dalcasse had a project for an alliance with England to which he failed to
                        convert the French Cabinet M. Delcasse, he says, did not resign on pressure
                        from Germany, but because the French Cabinet and he could not agree about
                        the further development to be given to the Anglo-French entente. This is
                        going rather further than the facts, as we know them, would warrant, but Sir
                        Thomas Barclay is undoub- tedly right in the main. M. Delcasse’s fall dealt
                        a deathblow to the idea that out friend- ship with France might become an
                        alliance against Germany. We are well rid of it, for it would be a miserable
                        anti-climax if friendship between two Liberal countries had merely served to
                        provide decrepit Jingoism with stouter crutches. There is no future for our
                        friendship with France except in the advance- ment of Liberal ideas in
                        international affairs. But how glorious that future might be.</p>

                    <head>SINKING OF THE CHATHAM. "Evening Standard."</head>
                    <p>Rather a curious position has resulted from the sinking of a steamer in the
                        Suez Canal a fortnight ago. The vessel had seventy tons of dynamite on
                        board, and there it a double reason therefore for removing her, if possible,
                        out of the path of navigation. It has now been practically decided that
                        there is only one way of doing this—to blow her up before she has the chance
                        of blowing up anything else. The situation is further complicated by the
                        fact that no one can foretell with exactitude what will be the result of
                        exploding so large a quan- tity of dynamite under such circumstances. Will
                        the vessel shoot up out of the water into the air, like a new kind of Flying
                        Dutchman, or will the disturbance make something like a tidal wave in the
                        Canal!</p>

                        remaïqnnblo et à nne amélioration sou daine do 7/S2 sur le Novembre et de
                        3/16 sur les autres échéances. Il n’en reste cependant pas moins vmi que les
                        plus hauts cours prati- qués depuis lors sont ceux de la matinée de Samedi
                        même, car, à partir du moment où l'on a payé le prix de 14 3/4, un certain
                        désir de réaliser s'est emparé no peu de tous les dé- tenteurs de contrats,
                        ce qui a été cause que pendant toute la semaine nous n'avons fait que
                        îluctuer entre le sus dit maximum et la cote de 14 5/8 affichée à la clôture
                        de ce jour. En somme, notre bilan pour oette huitaine consiste en un
                        bénéfice de 3/32 sur tous les mois, tandis que. l'Amérique, pour sa part, a
                        avancé de 14 points pour les rapprochés, Octobre exclu, jusqu’à 22 points
                        pour les éloignés.</p>
                    <p>Comme activité nous s avons rien eu de bieu brillant à l’exoeption de la
                        première jonrnér qui a été assez chaude ; le reste du temps les atlsiies ont
                        été en diminuant de jour en jour, au point de friser le calme plat, oomme
                        cela a été ta cas aujourd’hui où, pendant presque une heure entière, la
                        oorteilta est restée déserte on représentée seulement par quelques rares
                        oour- tien et remisiers taillant une bavette en guiso d'occupation.
                        Toutefois, et tout étonnant qu’il soit à oette époque de l’année, oe fait ne
                        nous surprend qu’à moitié, étant donné que l’ex portation est plus que
                        jamais à l'écart des af- faires en oontrats et que, par ta. fait, le marché
                        est toujours complètement abandonné aux que'- ques petits spéculateurs qui
                        sont constamment sur la brèche, mais qui ne peuvent pas faire beauoonp à eux
                        seuls.</p>
                    <p>Ia filature aussi continue à ce pas s’occuper des futurs et à ne montrer de
                        l'intérêt qae pour la marchandise prête, et même ceh daus une mesure
                        absolument limitée. Anssi, que voyons nous I Une exportation plus que mo-
                        dérée et inférieure à toutes les prévisions (6600 Balles contre 9800 l'année
                        dernière), un marché calme et en baisse de 1/4 de tallari au moins pour les
                        cotons supérieurs Mit-Afifi et cela malgré les artivages,bien petits en
                        comparaison de ceux de 1904 à la même épeque ; seules les provenances
                        Haute-Bgypte, probablement à cause de leur bon marché relatif, ont-, fini
                        soutenues et recherchées, avec une reprise de 1/8 à 1/4 de tallari.
                        Seulement, quand on pense que, à classement égal, l’écart entre oe genre de
                        coton et ta produit de la Basse-Egypte est de 2 1/2 tallari», la chose
                        parait toute na' urello et explique en même temps ta penchant justifié que
                        montrent les acheteurs pour ta genre en question.</p>
                    <p>Les arrivages ont commencé à avoir l’air de se développer d’une façon normale
                        et, par con- séquent, U nous faudrait un réveil accentué de la demande de la
                        part de la consommation, autrement les pronostios pour la semaine pro-
                        chaine resteraient bien mauvais, vu surtout " qu’elle a à se mettre en ligne
                        avec une expor tation de près de 17000 Balles pour la semaine correspondante
                        de 1904. Il ne faudrait cepen- dant pas être trop pessimiste, attendu que
                        tas besoins existent en Europe et que, si aocalmie il y a, elle ne saurait
                        persister trop longtemps.</p>

                        faiseurs et 1e refus des gros acheteurs d’acheter autrement qu’en fi xant ta
                        prix de suite, ont assaini la situation, oar l'agriculteur, obligé de
                        réaliser à cjqiae de ses besoins pécuniaires, profite malgré lui des prix
                        élevés actuels pour une partie de sa pro- duction, tandis que ta négociant

                        les a’éas inhérents au ridicule système, qui avait fini par se généraliser,

                        nous vient aujourd'hui avec un rapport de 66 4/10. Ou n’eu fait pourtant pas
                        de oas, car 1e souvenir de son 67 2/10 du mois dernier est encore présent à
                        toutes les mémoires, et, très proba- blement, ni haussiers ni baissiers ne
                        sauraient imprimer au marché une direction quelconque avant le rapport du
                        Bureau d'Agriculture qui doit paraître mardi prochain.</p>

                        faibli, quoique demandé pour nos huileries locales, et fiait aujourd’hui à

                    <p>Ba effet, oette dernière ne s'améliore pas et les affaires à la Bourse sur
                        les 3 mois, restent rares. Au point on uoaa eu sommas, il ne nous resta
                        qu'au seul espoir, o'est une baisse marquée pour attirer les acheteurs,
                        autrement, et comme nous l’avons déjà dit, nous resterons à la meroi de la
                        oonsommati ou du dehors qui n'a oertes pas intérêt à faire la hausse. Eu

                        September 26.)</head>
                    <p>Taking advantage of a pause in Sir Rudolph R. von Slatin Pasha’s animated and
                        interesting remarks, is asked it he found himself able to detect a genuine
                        progress in civilisation in the Sudan.; — “Yes, certainly I can,’’ he
                        replied. “In the towns you now find better-built houses, and in the villages
                        bigger and cleaner huts. Indi- viduals become more fastidious. Townspeople
                        are already looking for European furniture, and the bulk of the population
                        like nice clothes. But let us give you an example.</p>
                    <p>“Five years ago I visited the Southern Nuba Mountains. The chief of a big
                        moun- tain, who had never met a white man before came down from his
                        stronghold to see me, because he had beard that I was 'a good man.' He and
                        his followers and wives had very little clothing among them. Beads, brass
                        wire, leather strings round their hips, and some copper ornaments, were the
                        only finery they possessed. I gave this chief similar things as presents,
                        knowing the people wanted them, and I offered him also some small looking-
                        glasses, knives, and a piece of red and yellow coloured cloth. He accepted
                        everything beam ingly, except the cloth. When I explained to him how nice
                        and useful clothing was, he asked me to allow him to express his thoughts
                        freely to me, and, with the assis tance of an interpreter, the following
                        speech was delivered :—</p>
                    <p>" ‘You know I never wear clothes. My father and grandfather didn’t If it is
                        cold I sit in the sun or near a fire ; if it is warm I sit in the shade. I
                        am healthy and strong You give me these things because you are good. Will
                        this thing last for my whole life If it is finished, from where will I get
                        another Will there be a good man to give it to me for nothing like you do ?
                        Or will he ask me to give him my cow or sheep in exchange ? No, I like the
                        beads and brass wire, because they are nice, but I don’t want your cloth! </p>
                    <p>“I tried a little to convert this philosopher but gave it op, knowing that in
                        the course o time he would change his opinion. Sum enough, to-day my old
                        friend comes down from his mountain attired briliantly in many coloured
                        garments. Having seen, during the last few years, officers, officials, and
                        soldiers passing continually through his country human nature, old as Adam,
                        began to world in him, and he no longer cared to show himself garbed only in
                        beads and brass wire and so he asked for cloth. The irresistible desire to
                        imitate did more than any words of mine could.</p>
                    <p>“If you travel now on a steamer along the White Nile, you find the black
                        ladies, who a short time ago, were only clothed in atmo sphere, and the men,
                        who went bare-footed to the neck,' newly all in possession of some clothing
                        -they hesitate to meet you in their former state of nudity. I think this is
                        an ocular demonstration of the progress of civilisation.</p>
                    <p>“As to whether, by wearing clothes and getting used to luxury, these people
                        will get stronger and healthier, you must not ask me. have not had much
                        medical training, and Id not give them lectures about treatment by natural
                        remedies. But I would be disappointed if a fellow, whom I ordered to meet me
                        said he could not come because yesterday perspiring in full dress, be stood
                        in a draught and caught cold, and was afraid of getting influence, if be
                        moved from his place. But civilisation, on the whole, is a good thing. It
                        gives individuals generally a gentle dis position, and makes them kinder to
                        the neighbours. I cannot say that these are yet the main attributes of our
                        southern Sudan subjects,</p>
                    <p>“You ask me about missionary work. Mis sionary work is entirely in the hands
                        of private individuals, and the Government ban nothing to do with it But I
                        will explain the situation. We have to divide the Sudan into two zones—the
                        northern and the southern. The northern tone is inhabited by Moslems only.
                        The Sudan Mohamedans arc very igno- rant in religions questions, not
                        civilised enough to, be able to distinguish between the action of a
                        missionary as a single private individual and the action of Government. It
                        would be very dangerous to adopt so liberal and tolerant a policy as obtains
                        in Egypt. I think the greater part of the Sudan Moha- medans world believe
                        that the Government was trying to make them Christians, and would became
                        irritated. Therefore, the time is still distant when missionary work should
                        Im allowed amongst the Moslems of the Sudan.</p>
                    <p>“Of course, there are missionary schools at Khartoum for children of
                        Christian residents, with strict regulations, and there are not a few
                        Mohamedans who send their children to be educated in these schools. But
                        these schools are at the seat of a watchful Government, and every Mohamedan
                        knows through Govern- ment the conditions under which instruction is given
                        before sending his child to school. He understands thoroughly that such
                        schools are not to make proselytes, but only for general education.</p>
                    <p>“Quite different are the conditions in the southern zone. There the
                        population consists only of pagans. Except some tribes on the White Nile,
                        near Shambe and Gondokoro, and some of the Nuba mountains where Roman
                        Catholic missionary stations were established in former days, those savages
                        have not been brought into contact with any Christians. They know the
                        Mohamedana only slave raiders, and were nearly annihilated by them under the
                        Dervish rule. This is the part of the Sudan for missionary work. Spheres of
                        action for the different missionary Societies have been defined. American
                        missionaries are active on the Sobat and south-east. The Roman Catholic
                        mission has its headquarters at 'Lull (south of Kodok, formerly Fashoda) and
                        has also several stations at Tonga in the Bahr el Ghazel Only the British
                        Missionary Society has not yet began its work.</p>
                    <p>“Of course, the work of the missionaries has to be at the beginning only a
                        civilising one. If the missionaries should attempt to intro- duce
                        Christianity at once, and offer a wealthy native to send his wives away
                        because only one is allowed—they would soon be left alone and well treated.
                        But; through sound advice as to how to improve their wealth, technical
                        instruction, and tactful appealing to their common-sense, and offering
                        assistance in little matters, the missionaries will become popular and will
                        gain influence. The Bishop Mon- signor Dr. Geyer, the head of the Catholic
                        mission, is most energetic and active, and when I last met him, just
                        returned from an inspection, he expressed his- thorough satis- faction with
                        the situation and the behaviour of the natives. Ha said he had not baptised
                        any yet, and he bad not yet any Chris- tian converts, but he had already
                        improved the character of the population inhanding bis different stations.
                        This southern part of the Sudan is, of course, also open to Mohamedans, but
                        no application has been made till now by private individuals to establish
                        schools where the religion of Islam would be taught or general instruction
                        given.</p>
                    <p>And as to slavery. There is no more slave raiding on a big scale. There was
                        only one man, Ibrahim Wad Mahmood, near the Abys- sinian frontier, who,
                        living on an almost in- accessible mountain, raided the pagan tribes of his
                        neighbourhood. He was defeated by Colonel Gorringe, late Mudir of Sennar,
                        and hanged. The greater part of his followers were killed. There may be a
                        raid or two in miniature in a far-away district, but these must be regarded
                        more as tribal quarrels than as raids for the purpose of making slaves,
                        There have been a few cases of kidnapping, but the different posts of the
                        Slavery Depart- ment are practically patrolling the roads, There is not much
                        chance of any such male- factors escaping the eagle eyes of those officials,
                        and passing with slaves through the Sudan.</p>
                    <p>“Governors of provinces are working hand- in-hand with the Slavery
                        Department, of which Captain McMurdo is the head, and they have stated that
                        there is no doubt that the slave trade in the Sudan has received a very
                        severe check, and that only isolated cases now occur. During my continual
                        travelling I make careful in- quiries on this subject, and I am glad to be
                        able to say that the traffic in human beings has practically ceased. After
                        the reconquest of the Sudan, freedom was declared. It was in some ways hard
                        on the population. They were accustomed to keep slaves, and it was allowed
                        by their law and religion—and no compensation was given to them for the loss
                        of their slaves.</p>
                    <p>“Not a few landowners were unable to cul- tivate their estates, as at the
                        beginning of the new regime all blacks tried to enjoy their freedom
                        thoroughly, and it was not easy for us to keep such a mass of loafers in
                        order. But it could not be helped, and the Mohamedan natives understand our
                        rea sons.</p>
                    <p>“Through the registration of all individuals of pagan extraction in the
                        Mohamedan Sudan we are now able to control their movements. The black is by
                        nature a lazy individual, who does not like to be supervised. But with the
                        advance of civilisation, he knows now the value and necessity of money, and
                        realises that he cannot get it for nothing. Hence, with the agreement and
                        assistance of the Arab population, we are gradually changing the statue of
                        slavery into a system of paid labour, which will be liked by both master and
                        servant"</p>
                    <p>In reply to a question regarding the fron- tier between the Congo Free State
                        and the Sudan, the Inspector-General said :—</p>
                    <p>“Well, that is a very delicate question, and a soldier cannot say much about
                        matters which are in the hands of diplomatists. But to speak generally, it
                        is a great mistake to limit a frontier by degrees of latitude or lon-
                        gitude. It is quite easy to say the country north or south or east or west
                        of such a degree belongs to this or that nation. It looks neat and nice on a
                        map. But what has the poor fellow to do who is living on or near such an
                        artificial frontier, and whose watering and razing places are beyond the
                        official limit of his country ? If he passes the imaginary line, which he
                        is, perhaps, bound to do for his existence, he is driven back by force, or
                        has to pay heavily for his trespass.</p>
                    <p>You must understand that many tribes- men are in the habit of changing their
                        grazing grounds and cultivations during the year, without being nomads. The
                        frontiers between tribes in Africa—and, I think, elsewhere too— have been
                        settled by fighting in the course of ages. It has been a struggle for
                        existence. Now we come and say, ‘North of this degree you belong to me,
                        south to somebody else.’ Tbe tribe, perhaps, is quite willing to belong to
                        you altogether, but declines to be cut in two. Then it brings endless
                        trouble for the administration, too. A discontented individual or a
                        malefactor has only to go over the frontier, and can there hide himself
                        among his relatives, who are able to protect him, as he belongs to another
                        Government He would not easily find an asylum with another tribe.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, every Government should try to have always first a political
                        frontier, if pos- sible. The geographical comes only in second line. In this
                        special case, I do not think the Chief of the Congo Free State is thoroughly
                        informed about the situation. The Free State Government sticks to its right
                        that the fifth degree should be the limit but if the fifth degree of
                        latitude is to be considered as a frontier, the Congo State will find great
                        diffi- culty in administering this part of the country, as a sub-section of
                        the Niam-Niam will be cut in two whereas, if we have the watershed as
                        frontier, things would be much easier. On the whole, I do not think the
                        country is worth1 quarrelling about There is not much to gain; and some
                        indiarubber trees and a few villages, which are scarcely populated, will not
                        make much difference to either Government The matter is more a question of
                        conveniance to the few subjects living there. With regard to our other
                        frontiers, the French Sudan, Uganda, Abyssinia, and Eritreg, there reigns
                        ’the entente cordiale'."</p>
                    <p>“You ask about our medical arrangements. We are short of doctors. At Khartoum
                        we have a thorough modern civil hospital, under Dr. Christopher son, who,
                        through his kindness and ability, has gained the confidence of the popu-
                        lation. We have also is all provinces hospitals, but at the out-stations
                        civil work is still super vised by British medical officers, and we feel the
                        dearth of native doctors—I mean Egyptians or Syrians—as Sudanese are only
                        quack doc- tors, or medicine men.</p>
                    <p>“You ask me about the army. As to the indefatigable work of the Sirdar, his
                        adjutant- general, and officers, the army is equal to any European. The
                        equipment of the different arms is up to data, and the discipline and power
                        of maneuvering is excellent. One British regiment is always at Khartoum The
                        Egyptian battalions are stationed at Khartoum and dis- tricts north of it.
                        The Sudanese battalions are posted in the southern provinces. This arrange-
                        ment is trade for sanitary reasons. The army at the present strength is
                        sufficient to meet any eventuality, but I hope, for the sake of the country,
                        that there will be no necessity to demonstrate its value.</p>
                    <p>"Finally, with regard to myself. There is not much to say. I am still
                        travelling over the Sudan—sometimes comfortably, sometimes roughing it. My
                        position forces me to put my finger into every one’s pie, and if my com-
                        radee may be occasionally bored by my advice, I am sore they are convinced
                        of my good intentions. I confess I should like to enjoy a little more
                        civilisation, instead of living the greater part of the year with half or
                        thorough savages ; but as the Government still desires my services, and has
                        declined my resignation, I am ready to help as much as I can to improve the
                        situation in the Sudan as long as my health stands fit. Then, too, when all
                        is said, life is short I am old to change my metier, and I am very closely
                        identified with Africa. I make no particular pretensions to modesty. __</p>
                    <p>" I have a wide and intimate local know- ledge of the country and its
                        inhabitants, and I have the thorough cobfidence of the different tribes.
                        Therefore, I am able to render valuable services to the Government.</p>
                    <p>“ The conviction that I am of use to the country, and that my advice is
                        appreciated by the Government and the natives,—that is my reward and my
                        satisfaction.’’</p>
                    <p>And so ended what the Inspector-General described as the longest “interview"
                        he had ever experienced.</p>

                    <p>Colonel T. L N. Morland, C.B., D.S.O., who has been appointed
                        Inspector-General of the West African Frontier Force, in succession to
                        Brigadier General Kemball, is well-known on the West Coast as he has been
                        employed with the W.A.F.F. for the past seven and a half years and was
                        latterly commandant of the forces in Nigeria. His record of active service
                        is a good one including the operations up the Niger, 1897 98 (mentioned in
                        despatches, medal with clasp), the operations in Northern Nigeria, 1900,
                        when he commanded on Kanduma River ; (mentioned in despatches), the Ashanti
                        Expedition of the same year (mentioned in despatches, brevet
                        lieutenant-colonelcy) ; com- manded the troops in the campaign against the
                        Emir of Yola, 1900, when he was slightly wounded in action (mentioned in

                        the Kano-Sokoto Expedition, 1903, when his services were recognised by a
                        well-earned CB.</p>

                        a little less than six year’s service. Captain M. H. Helyar, simil- arly
                        promoted after the same length of service is with the 3rd Battalion at
