                        <p>AFTER PORT ARTHUR.</p>
                        <p>The fall of Port Arthur has necessarily brought up the question of
                            mediation or in- ervention, and a telegram from London this morning
                            states that various inspired sug- estions in the direction of peace are
                            emanating from Washington, representing Mr. Roosevelt as anxious to
                            mediate but unable to move until approached by both the belligerents.
                            Nothing whatever confirmatory has been receiv ed, and the peaee rumors
                            are not credited. The scepticism prevailing in London is doubt- less
                            well founded for we are still unable to believe that peace is near at
                            hand. The fall of</p>
                        <p>Port Arthur does not necessarily imply that the Japanese will triumph in
                            the war, for the capitulation of the Gibraltar of the Far East is
                            probably only the end of the first act, and not by any means the drop
                            scene, of the great drama. We believe that Ruarsa will fight to the
                            bitter end, subject always to the condition that there is no general
                            internal revolt. Such an occurrence is possible if the peasantry have
                            ceased to fear a beaten Government, or are convinced that the war will
                            drain them of too much of their strength, and if the soldiery are
                            unwilling to put insurrection down ; but it seems to us most improbable.
                            Very few Rus- sians realise what the loss of sea-power means, and fewer
                            still are fully convinced that it has been lost. There has been no
                            invasion, no cap- ture of any ancient Russian city, nothing to enable an
                            unusually ignorant population to see the war. They feel the draft made
                            on them by the summons to the Reserves, and they are disturbed by
                            rumours that Holy Russia is not crushing her enemies with her usual com-
                            pleteness ; but there has been no disaster sufficiently visible to
                            destroy the mingled fear and reepect felt for the authority of the Tsar,
                            or to induce the people to run the terrible risks involved in any
                            insurrection not supported by the soldiery. So long as there is
                            obedience the governing group in St. Petersburg can go on with the war
                            if it will; and its material resources, except at sea, are not yet worn
                            out, or even seriously affected. Even if the Russians have lost in the
                            campaign two hundred thousand men through the hardships of transport,
                            the out- bursts of sickness, and the deaths in actual fighting, these
                            losses will soon be replaced by the conscription, more especially as
                            most of the dead belonged to the Asiatic side of the vast Empire. The
                            losses of officers, which have been frightful, are being made up. Better
                            artillery, better powder, better muni- tions altogether, are all
                            procurable for money; and the idea that the wealth of Russia has
                            been-exhausted in less than a year of war is positively inept. The
                            Treasury must provide for the interest on the Debt, and for all that is
                            purchased abroad; but it has reserves of gold to meet those necessities,
                            and everything procur- able at home can be paid for in paper, to be
                            redeemed on the conclusion of the war. There are plenty of resources for
                            a secoond campaign, and the great Russians are, as we believe,
                            determined to fight one. They have at least three sets of motives, any
                            one of which would induce them to adopt that course. They are as proud
                            of Russia as we are of Great Britain, and would feel ultimate defeat by
                            an Asiatic Power as an inexpiable shame. They are firmly convinced that
                            their defeat has been due to unpreparedness, mismanagement, and
                            corruption, and believe that with a few months for reorganisation they
                            can collect a mighty army, resume the offensive, and in the next
                            campaign drive the Japanese into the sea. And the governing classes
                            feel, rather than see, that a shameful peace, especially if it included
                            an indemnity, would be fatal to the autocracy; that is, would, in their
                            judgment, be the precursor of anarchy, and probably of
                            dismemberment.</p>

                    <p>(Reuter.)</p>
                    <p>St. Petersburg, January 3.</p>
                    <p>The fall of Port Arthur is unknown to the general public. It has hitherto
                        only been known to the official world, and to certain restricted private
                        circles.</p>
                    <p>(Reuter.)</p>
                    <p>Chi-Fu, January 3.</p>
                    <p>In the conditions of the capitulation of Port Arthur, it is stipulated that
                        the officers of the garrison will return to Russia on parole and the men
                        will be sent to Japan as prisoners.</p>
                    <p>(Havas.)</p>
                    <p>Tokio, January 3.</p>
                    <p>The Russian officers will be permitted to return to Russia on parole. They
                        will retain their swords. The Japanese occupied a number of forts
                        to-day.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese are very annoyed at the destruction of the ships arid the
                        despatching of destroyers after the oiler to surrender. The newspapers, in
                        consequence of such action, demand that the garrison shall receive severe
                        treatment. It appears, however, that the destruction, etc., occurred after a
                        Council of War had decided upon surrender but consider- ably before the
                        Commissioners met.</p>

                    <p>Chi-Fu, January 3.</p>
                    <p>Three torpedo-launches have arrived from Port Arthur. There are now 7
                        Japanese destroyers in the harbour.</p>

                    <p>Apparently all the Russian destroyers reach- ed Chi-Fu and Tsingtan safely.
                        The Russians destroyed all the men-of-war, and wrecked the remaining forts,
                        together with everything valuable.</p>

                    <p>London, January 3.</p>
                    <p>All the comments of Europe and America agree that the fall of Port Arthur
                        will conclude a military drama without parallel in history, on account of
                        the valour and achievements of the victors, and the heroism and devotion of
                        the vanquished. It is thought that the war will continue unabated.</p>
                    <p>The Standard states that the end has been worthy of that marvelous conflict
                        between men who were equally matched as regards an inexhaustible resource of
                        unflinching courage and un ailing endurance.</p>
                    <p>The Morning Post says that the capture of the fortress is one of the finest
                        feat of arms on record.</p>
                    <p>The Daily Telegraph states that the attack, demanding appalling sacrifices,
                        has crowned the victors with glory.</p>

                    <p>Double Murder for- P.T. 50.—The Keneh Native Court has passed sentence of
                        death on one Hussein Darwish, of the village of Barak- ma, Keneh Markaz, who
                        was found guilty of the murder of both his uncle and aunt. Some time ago he
                        deposited with his victims the sum of P.T.50,for the return of which he had
                        applied on more than one occasion. His uncle, being in poor circumstances,
                        was unable to pay the money and always postponed the time for doing so. At
                        last, when the man’s patience was ex- hausted, he took a knife, went to his
                        uncle’s house, and murdered both him and his wife, afterwards confessing his
                        guilt to the Parquet.</p>
                    <p>St. Joseph’s Home, in the Moharrem Bey quarter of Alexandria, gave a
                        delightful Christ- mas Tree fete yesterday. A large number of ladies were
                        present including Mme. Girard, Mrs. Chataway, Countess de Zogheb, etc. The
                        fine Christmas Tree was given by Mr. von Pitner. It was bedecked with
                        innumerable toys and beautifully illuminated. The tree had been decorated by
                        the ladies who organis- ed the fete. The delight of the children who are so
                        well looked after at this excellent insti- tution was a treat to behold, and
                        gave a well deserved pleasure to the lady patronesses, who had been at great
                        pains to organise the fete for the children. The fete was in the first place
                        due to the initiative of Mrs. G. Debbane, who was kindly assisted by the
                        “Dames de l'Ouvroir des Mires Chretiennes” and by many young ladies of
                        Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>The Egyptian Slave Trade. — An Anglo- Egyptian abolitionist has passed away
                        by the death in London a few days ago of Mr. Charles H. Allen, F.R.G.S., who
                        was for 19 years secre- tary of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery
                        Society, in his 81st year. Mr. Allen came of a Quaker stock. Throughout his
                        life he showed special interest in the development of Africa. At first his
                        attention was largely concentrated on Egypt, where the British Government
                        had, recently undertaken great responsibilities. He received invaluable
                        assistance from General Gordon in pressing for the abolition of slavery and
                        the slave-trade throughout the Egyptian dominions; and seldom did General
                        Gordon come to London without visiting Mr. Allen to discuss some plan for
                        the liberation of the mil lions in the Dark Continent. A warm coadjutor was
                        found from the first in Lord Cromer, who rendered splendid help, both by his
                        general policy and also by promoting individual schemes such as the Home for
                        Freed Woman Slaves in Cairo.</p>

                        will be received with great pleasure by the members of the British colony,
                        among whom Brewster Bey counts many friends. The Bey has been 35 years in
                        the service of the Egyptian Government, having entered the Customs
                        Administration and Coastguard Service in 1870. In 1879 he was appointed
                        Director of Customs at Suakin by the late General Gordon. This post he held
                        till 1882, when he served in the Egyptian campaign on the Commissarist stall
                        (medal and bronze star). He returned to Suakin in 1883, and served under
                        Baker Pasha in the Intelligence and Commissarist Department and was
                        subsequently appointed by the late Admiral Sir W.. Hewitt as Sub Governor,
                        in addition to his duties at the Customs. In 1884 he was appointed Commander
                        of the Imperial Order of the Medjidieh, and in the following year he was
                        lent to the Intelligence Depart- ment by the Egyptian Government, and was
                        attached to General Graham’s force. He was present at several actions and at
                        the taking of Tamai, being mentioned in despatches. He remained in Suakin as
                        Director of Customs until 1890, when he was transferred to the Coastguard
                        Service at Alexandria as Secretary and Controller. In 1891 he was selected
                        by the Khedive Mohamed Tewtik as his Private Secretary, and acts now in the
                        same capacity to the present Khedive, his son. He already holds the rank of
                        Bey of the first class, and is Commander of the Imperial Ottoman Orders of
                        Osmanieh and Medjidieh, and Chevalier of the Francois Joseph Order.</p>

                    <head>MOTORS IN CAIRO.</head>
                    <p>The motor car is becoming, more and more one of the regular features of the
                        traffic of the Capital, and it is satisfactory to note that the drivers are
                        showing a reasonable regard for the convenience and safety of the public.
                        There is one point, however, as to which it seems desirable to draw their
                        attention. This is that the mere fact of their having a good clear stretch
                        of road before them does not justify their driving at high speeds in narrow
                        streets or near footpaths occupied by pedestrians. At any moment a tyre may
                        burst, with the im- mediate consequence of whirling the car sud- denly round
                        to the right or left, and plunging it into the midst of a crowd of
                        passers-by with- out leaving these a chance of escape. Several fatal
                        accidents have already occurred in Europe in this way.</p>

                    <p>The new subway under the railway, that was to have been opened for public use
                        during last month, is still far from complete, and we shall in all
                        probability be well on into the new year before it will, or indeed can, be
                        opened, The roadway has been pierced and the side walls built, but the iron
                        roofing has yet to be fixed and the approaches constructed, and this means
                        no small amount of labor. That, when completed, it will prove a great relief
                        to the foot traffic over the Shoubra Bridge there can be no doubt, but, if
                        it is to be rendered really effective, it will have to be placed under
                        constant supervision, both with regard to the uses it may be put to and for
                        the prevention of obstructions and blocking. Very much of its utility will
                        depend upon the approaches, as if these are not convoniently placed and
                        arranged they will very largely discount the value of the accommodation the
                        tunnel will afford.</p>

                    <p>A Note has been issued by the Government of explaining its intentions in
                        imposing the regulations of this year upon the pilgrimage. The Note points
                        out that, so far from in any way exploiting the pilgrims for its own profit,
                        it has to pay a considerable charge to the Khedivial Steamship Company,
                        being obliged to guarantee a minimum number of pilgrim passengers in return
                        for the reduction of their fare.</p>
                    <p>The Government points out that the oscort of the Mahmal has been increased to
                        400 men, causing an additional expense of L.E. 5,000. The pilgrims, of whom
                        1,614 have expressed their desire to accompany tho Mahmal, will thus benefit

                        provided.</p>

                        as a lamp set fire to the canvas and the whole place was in a very short
                        time burnt to the ground.' A panic ensued amongst the spectators, but they
                        all managed to escape uninjured. The Fire Brigade arrived on the scene
                        promptly and rendered every assistance, but the engine could not be made use
                        or as the firemen were unable to get up steam.</p>

                    <p>On Thursday, 29th ult, a sumptuous tea and impromptu concert was given at the
                        above club to the seamen in port. The rooms had been tastefully decorated
                        for the occasion, and the tables were beautifully laid with large supplies
                        of cake, sandwiches, and fruit. About 40 seamen sat down to partake of the
                        treat offered them. After the tea, which was served by lady, visitors, a
                        concert followed, and the men cheerfully came forward to sing songs. During
                        the concert cigars, cigarettes, sand- wiches, and refreshments were served,
                        and the greatest cordiality and good feeling prevailed throughout, though
                        the men were of divers nationalities, creeds, and color. The meeting broke
                        up at 10p.m., all those present standing up to sing “God save the King.”</p>
                    <p>The committee are deeply grateful to the ladies who so kindly volunteered
                        their services, and also to several friends who contributed in other ways to
                        the success of the evening.</p>

                    <p>The Pall Mall Gazette makes the following remarks on the interview which we
                        reproduced from the Standard on Monday last:- If any- thing were needed to
                        confirm the rumours , afloat regarding the construction of an altern- ,
                        ative canal between the Mediterranean and Red Sea, we should imagine the
                        interview with M. Bonnet, the secretary of the Suez Canal Company, published
                        in the Standard, would, sufficient. This gentleman denies nothing, but in
                        the course of a columm of commonplace remarks he asserts that his company
                        has a monopoly for seventy years to come. Such a statement will cause not a
                        little surprise in London, and, we should imagine, to the shade Mr.
                        Gladstone. To those behind the scenes Mn Bonnet’s ingenuousness is quite
                        refreshing, for the leaders of the agitation for a new 1anal are hard at
                        work upon their scheme. How long will it be before Prince d’Arenberg follows
                        the example of the late M. de Lesseps, who, after protesting that he would
                        concede nothing, came to London to find out on what terms shipowners would

                    <head>TWO MEN KILLED</head>
                    <p>A fatal quarrel took place yesterday after- noon between three Greeks in a
                        bar behind the Attarin Bazaar. The parties all hail from Smyrna, and tt

                        was a suitor for his own sister's hand. A discussion arose between the men
                        and the murderer drew his knife and despatch- ed one at the brothers with a
                        single stab. The other brother came to the rescue but received two stabs, to
                        which he succumbed in the Greek Hospital at midnight.</p>
                    <p>The murderer is a young man, about 20 years of age, and is extraordinarily
                        muscular. His name is Yanni Antonio Stigrigo, and he was arrested by tho
                        polioe in front of Cairo Railway Station. He made no resistance to the
                        police and allowed himself to be handcuffed quitely.</p>

                    <p>The Service of Antiquities has recently undertaken excavations at the low
                        stone pyramid of Zawyet el Arayan, which lies on the desert plateau between
                        Ghizieh and Sak- karah. The site dates from the Ancient Empire and news has
                        just been received of the discovery of a large granite mastaba or tomb.
                        Strong hopes are entertained that a find of considerable magnitude is about
                        to be un- covered. Extensive subterranean galleries were excavated some
                        years ago, but, owing to the difficult descent at the entrance shaft,
                        visitors rarely go down to these long passages under the desert.</p>

                    <head>PROF. MASPERO'S NEW TRANSLATION.</head>
                    <p>M. Maspero has published a new translation of the stele of Userkaf (the
                        Usercheres of Manetho) of the fifth dynasty, found by Prof. Petrie at
                        Abydos. He thinks that if Prof. Petrie's copyist had been, as he says, “a
                        professional Egyptologist," he (or she) might have been ablo to make a guess
                        at many of the mutilated signs, and thus have oonsidorahly reduced the
                        lacuna in the copy from which we now have to work. He does not agree with
                        Mr. Griffith in the view that the inscription was originally written on
                        papyrus, and afterwards transferred to stone, and he corrects the
                        translation published by the last-named in 'Abydos IL' in several
                        particulars. M. Maspero has also given a criticism of Dr. Erman’s recent
                        ’Aegyptisches Glosaar,' in which he laments that Dr. Erman refers his
                        readers in certain cases to his grammar only, and not to the texts on which
                        it is supposed to be founded. As M Maspero says, it is necessary for
                        beginners even more than for more advanced scholars that they should have an
                        opportunity of check- ing for themselves the theories of the Berlin school,
                        without being forced jurare in verbum magistri. Perhaps the sting of his
                        criticism ies in the concluding words that the 'Gloasar' should prove useful
                        to students at German universities and beginners in other countries.</p>

                    <head>VERDI THEATRE DEBACLE.</head>
                    <p>A Cairo correspondent writes:—</p>
                    <p>I see that the Verdi Theatre performances are few and far between at present,
                        that ap- patently the company are losing over the ven- ture, in short, that
                        they are likely enough to give it all up. It is the greatest possible pity.
                        Here we have good, an excellent opera com- pany giving us just the
                        repertoire which should appeal to us. The weary resident and the gay visitor
                        do not usually want overmuch Wagner or the like ; they prefer these lighter
                        operas, and yet no one seems to go. I admit that the Verdi Theatre has had
                        one or two off-nights, viz, and to wit, Gioconda for one; but Mignon, Aida,
                        Carmen, Otello, all were excellent. They have a surprisingly good orchestra.
                        They have five or six leading players who are good enough for
                        anything—Signora Monti-Baldini, Signor Tomisani, Signora Popovici—and I was
                        told that Signora Svicher was very good. I have not been, I admit, to all
                        the performances—by no means—but I have heard about those I did not see.</p>
                    <p>I will say at once that the raison d'etre of this article is not personal in
                        any sense; it is more an expression of my wish to tell Cairo people in
                        general (so far as they take any notice of my valued criticism) that if they
                        wish to see a good light opera oompany, they havo the chance and I wish they
                        would take it. It is pitiful to see the house emptier and emptier, and the
                        performers less and less enthusiastic or inclined to do their best And I
                        should imagine it is certain enough that if this Company gives up this their
                        first attempt we shall get little enough chance of any further repetitions.
                        I admit the locality is annoying, but the swift Cairo cabs make this of
                        little account. Once in a way it may be said by some that they-let us put it
                        so— prefer the environment, internal as well as external, of the Khedivial
                        Opera House, but they can always take a box. And really it was the sight of
                        those many empty boxes which moved me, as could no free seats or first-night
                        suppers or other induce- ments (which same I haven’t had), to cover two
                        sheets of paper — that, and the wish to hear the operas myself, for, O well-
                        beloved visitors and residents, if you don’t en- courage the opera, the
                        opera will vanish, and I shall have to go without! Invade the boxes, then,
                        ye visitors and we, “poor devils on a fixed income," will, lessen our supply
                        of ciga- rettes, and set apart the piastres necessary for our postri

                    <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE</p>
                    <p>Sir,—Your criticisms on the lack of initiative of the Alexandria
                        Archaeological Society to reference to the state of affairs prevailing on
                        the property of Prince Omar Pasha Toussoun at Aboukir may be absolutely
                        correct, but I should like to point out that the society suffers from a
                        chronic impecuniosity, due to the fact that it is so poorly supported by the
                        public of Alexandria. I use the phrase "chronic im- pecuniosity" in a
                        comparative sense, for if the society's means were greater, it would indulge
                        in far more extensive operations. Considering the grant that the Egyptian
                        Government accords to the Museum Service, it is absurd that the Alexandria
                        Archaeological Society should depend on private contributions.</p>

                    <p>The following article appeared in the latest issue to hand of the London
                        Morning Post-</p>
                    <p>British trade with Egypt still compares favorably with that between the
                        Khedive's subjects and any other nation. In round figures a third of the
                        total imports are taken from this country, and a part of the remainder from
                        our various colonies and possessions. It would appear, therefore, that there
                        is greater reason to express satisfaction with such results than to utter
                        any words of criticism or warn- ing. Yet a study of the import figures given
                        in the latest issue of the journal of the British Chamber of Commerce in
                        Egypt and of some of the consular remarks which the directors of the
                        publication bare deemed it expedient to quote shows that complaisant
                        satisfaction is not the attitude which it is desirable to com- mend. The
                        reason is that we are not keeping the proportion of trade hitherto enjoyed.
                        Egypt, as we have frequently pointed out, is making great strides forward as
                        a buyer and as a seller. She is most fortunate inn having author- ities who
                        are keenly alive to the development of all those means of transport which
                        act as incentives to commerce. In this journal of the Chamber of Commerce we
                        find a reoord which serves as a pertinent illustration of readiness to meet
                        the views of the trading classes. Some years ago it was urged on these
                        authorities that the Mahmoudieh Canal was not doing the amount or work of
                        which it was capable.^. Abolition of the lock and bridge tolls was advocated
                        with a view to facilitating navigation and increasing trade. In 1900 the
                        tolls were in operation and the total number of boats which passed Atfeh was
                        four thousand five hundred and sixty-four. In 1901 the tolls were abolished
                        and the number passing rose to sixteen thousand seven hundred and twelvo,
                        while last year it was twenty-three thousand and ninety-nine. At Kafr-Dawar
                        lock the total in 1900 was thirteen thousand seven hundred and twenty-four,
                        and last year it was thirty-five thousand seven hundred and thirty-two.
                        These are amazing figures. Strong representations are now being made in
                        favor of improving the facilities tor landing - goods at Cairo, and when
                        this is carried out the water trans- port, especially by means of low-height
                        sailing vessels, will be of far greater use and value. At the same time it
                        should be remembered that Lord Farrer and Mr. Oliver K. H. Bury are engaged
                        in a special inquiry as to the administration ot the State railways of
                        Egypt, and it is expected that they will be able to make suggestions fur
                        improving the efficiency of the public sen ice. Egypt, therefore, presents
                        an attractive field which other nations are' ready to work to the greatest
                        advantage. British trade, while holding a "very com- manding position," has
                        to meet increasingly strong competition in almost all directions. The Earl
                        of Cromer urges on his oouutry- men "greater adaptability to tho "wants of
                        customers” not only in the form of the goods but also in the language and
                        trade terns of circulars and prioe lists. His Lord ship regards the
                        employment of more an 1 better-equipped travelling agents as a matter ot yet
                        greater importance. Kecommeudatioua of the kind are so frequent that they
                        lose some of their force. A glance over detailed figures of import for the
                        first nine months of this year shows bow severe competition is in trades
                        which we have developed to a high degree of efficiency. Of eighty .thousand
                        pounds worth of boots only ten thousand pounds worth oarne from this
                        country. We supply but a tenth of the imported furniture, and about tho same
                        of the glass and china, though in earthen- ware tho percentage is far more
                        in our favor. In brass, copper, and bronze we are masters, and send about
                        two-thirds of the total, while in iron and ironwork our pro- portion is
                        nearly four-fifths, and we send twice as much machinery aa all other
                        countries. But we have but a small share of the ironmongery trade, and we
                        are badly beaten in locomotives and irrigation pumps, though in portable
                        engines it is Great Britain first and this rest practically nowhere. The
                        figures suggest that oertain of our trades have made a great effort to meet
                        Egyptian wants, and hare been successful, while in other direc- tions there
                        has been that absence of adaptabi- lity whereon Lord Cromer comments. We do
                        not draw attention to the state of trade for exclusively commercial reasons.
                        The substan- tial advantage we enjoy ia well worth preserv- ing, and the
                        outlook ia good enough to justify us in regarding Egypt as one of the best
                        of the neutral markets. But there are also political reaaona for desiring to
                        see our trade with the Khedive's possessions pros- pering. Though for the
                        moment the pres- sure of international jealousies is relaxed, and wc may not
                        feel embarrassed by the peculiarly undefined and almost (indefinable nature
                        of' our relations with Egypt, it is im- portant to strengthen all the ties
                        of interest that bind us to that country. Our predominant share of her trade
                        is one of the solid grounds on which our protectorate may be justified, and
                        its existence is an evidence that the relations which have boon established
                        are not even sen- timentally irksome to the people. They will do more
                        business with us if we are equal to the task of meeting every form of
                        rivalry with skill and energy. Egypt noeds our manufactures, and is not
                        likely to be a competitor against them. We, on the other hand, need her pro-
                        duce as raw material for many of our indus- tries, so that there is a
                        natural basis of per- manent exchange, from which the advantages should be
                        mutual.</p>

                        for the year, and it was proposed to have tho utx.unis completed to the end
                        of 1904, and present thorn early in the present year. He was pleased to be
                        able to say that thuir third exp tlition had now been sumo time at the mine,
                        that work was progressing there rapidly and with excellent results, gold was
                        being contin- uously sloped out, and monthly returns were being made, and
                        unless some uuforaaeea diffi- culties arose there was every reason to
                        believe that they would continue. The company was funned to take over an
                        area on the N do Valley Company's concession. That area was held by them
                        under a sub-licence, which expires in March, 1906. The directors have now
                        obtained an extension of their Haimur holding for a further period of two
                        years. They have also obtained mining leases of tho Haimur mines direct from
                        tho Egyptian - Uovenuuout fora period of thirty years, with the right to
                        renew for' a further period of filteen years, and at their option the right
                        to determine in any year during those periods. The shareholders had
                        therefore fixity of tenure as regards Haimur, in addition to their
                        prospecting rights.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman continued : — Now with regard to your property at Haimur: during
                        my visit to Egypt last year I visited Haimur in oompany with vour engineer,
                        Mr. Harry Lake, when we made a thorough investigation of the property, and I
                        am leaving England early in January for Egypt and intend to again visit your
                        property with Mr. Lake. A great deal of development work was done at Haimur
                        last season, in the course of wlich a considerable amount of gold was won,
                        the proceeds of which have been placed to your credit, but owing to the fact
                        that under our original holding we were debar- red by the Government from
                        removing any more gold than was necessary to prove the property, practically
                        no sloping was carried out. The bulk of the gold which was removed was that
                        taken from the drives, rises and winzes, which were put in to prove the
                        extent and richness of the mine. All this is now changed. 'ihe rich stone,
                        tho existence of which we had proved but which we were compelled to leave
                        before, we now have tho right under our leasee to win, and this is now beiug
                        done. Tbe pay ground already opened up extends for a considerable distance
                        longi- tudinally, and from tho highest to the lowest points at present
                        opened up is a depth of some 400 to 500 ft. in proving your property, we
                        have used our best endeavours to work on strictly economical linos, and with
                        that end iu view we, have followed the trend of tho veins, putting in adits
                        at different elevations aioug the hili-side and two prospecting shafts in
                        Uie Waili, and where wo have out the formation we have driven on it and
                        followed it down by menus of winzes, connecting up the different drives for
                        purposes of ventila- tion. We still propose to pursue this method of
                        development, and new having obtained our lease we propose to put down our
                        main shaft and develop tbe property at depth. You will see on referring to
                        tho drawing at the end of the report, which shows the trausverso sec- tion
                        of the Haimur workiugs, that at, and uear, the surface on the hill they
                        consist of a series of veins which run parallel, or nearly parallel, to each
                        other. It baa been found, however, as we haye gone down on them that they
                        are converging towards a single point. In fact the formauou suggests a cane
                        which has split into a aeries ol smaller parts at the end although the main
                        body of it remains in one piece. Whilst 1 cannot promise you that these
                        parallel planes make together at one point, there appears from their trend
                        to be a reasonable probability that they do so, and we now propose to put
                        doVru our main shall to open up formation in the neighbourhood where we
                        anticipate this is likely to occur, lu these parallel veins on which wo havo
                        been working the veins have varied in thiokness and in productiveness. Some
                        extraordinarily rich stone has been taken out, and quotiug from the report 1
                        see that in Adit No. 1. drive N. it is stated “some splendid milling ores
                        have lately oome from tho bottom end of Winze N. giving up to some 50 oz.
                        per ton over 4 to 6 in." On the other hand I see that 5 or. valoes have been
                        obtained over 2 feet of reef, and what is oven more interesting, in the
                        lowest parte of the workings in tho Wadi the formation runs as much as 10
                        feet wide.</p>
                    <p>With regard to water, without which, mining in tho desert is an expensive
                        process, I must tell you that water is making its way into the bottom of the
                        shaft in the Wadi, a depth of some 500 ft. from the highest point of tho
                        workings, and approximately 800 ft below W*di level. I do not anticipate
                        that this influx of water is going to create any difficulty, bnc on the
                        contrary is going to be a very valuable asset, and indeed will materially
                        lessen the cost of working there. I hope I have mado it clear to you bom the
                        fore- going remarks that , you have a valuable property in Haimur, in
                        addition to your other interests, that a large amount of pay ground has
                        already been proved and is now being profitably workod, and that your Board
                        propose m the immediate future to farther open up the mine, and generally to
                        develop your pro- perty on energetic lines. I would call your attention to
                        the very moderate capitalisation of your oompany, and in oonoluaion would
                        point oat that a large number of fooee are now being worked and stone is
                        being taken out whichitu estimated will average from £10 to £12 per ton nett
                        profit, and it is anticipated that regular shipments will be made which will
                        enable the Company to develop its property.</p>

                        <p>“ A photographer is born, not made," said a Camera Artist. He is hewn to
                            endure aa many troubles as the rest of mankind. Mr. Arthur F. Brookes,
                            of 25, Tho Arcade, Wol- verhampton, has travelled through many I
                            countries with his camera, but in London his | professional career was
                            threatened. "1 was ill," j he said, "and none of the doctors knew what
                            was the matter. But Dr. Williams' pink pills i for pale people found my
                            trouble and ourod it 1 was terribly ‘run down.' My nerves seemed to have
                            left me, and at sight of food my stomach would turn. When I forced down
                            a little food to keep up my strength, the pains in my chest were
                            excruciating.</p>
                        <p>“Two eminent doctors said I was snflering from nervous prostration, and
                            ordered oomplete rest. I was under them six months, but soon after was
                            as ill as ever. 1 had such pain in my bank as to make me cry out and
                            clutch at the first thing I came to.</p>
                        <p>“I attended a hospital for two months, and my case puzzled evou the
                            clever doctors there. Reduced to a mere skeleton (for eating was
                            impossible) 1 lingered in a dreadful state until four months ago I met
                            an old triend who asked me why 1 didn’t try Dr. Wilburns' pink pills—
                            they always set him up. 1 purchased a box, and it made me a great deaf
                            better. By the time 1 had finished a second box 1 was rapidly putting on
                            flesh. My appetite returned, and 1 enjoy my meals now, without any ill
                            alter-ctlocta. My improved health, after only three boxes, is a
                            revelation. 1 have not toll so well for over ten yean as 1 do at the
                            present I time. There bus never been the least retain of the pain.”</p>
                        <p>Nerves broken down by irony and work set up the most difficult fora of
                            chronic indi- gestion. Broken uervas are nerves starved for the want of
                            blood. Dr. Williams' pink pills for pale people—genuine only with lull
                            name, seven words—make blood, limy banish aroenua and the pains that
