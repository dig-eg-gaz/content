                    <head>AFTER PORT ARTHUR.</head>
                    <p>The fall of Port Arthur has necessarily brought up the question of mediation
                        or in- ervention, and a telegram from London this morning states that
                        various inspired sug- estions in the direction of peace are emanating from
                        Washington, representing Mr. Roosevelt as anxious to mediate but unable to
                        move until approached by both the belligerents. Nothing whatever
                        confirmatory has been receiv ed, and the peaee rumors are not credited. The
                        scepticism prevailing in London is doubtless well founded for we are still
                        unable to believe that peace is near at hand. The fall of<cb n="6"/> Port
                        Arthur does not necessarily imply that the Japanese will triumph in the war,
                        for the capitulation of the Gibraltar of the Far East is probably only the
                        end of the first act, and not by any means the drop scene, of the great
                        drama. We believe that Ruarsa will fight to the bitter end, subject always
                        to the condition that there is no general internal revolt. Such an
                        occurrence is possible if the peasantry have ceased to fear a beaten
                        Government, or are convinced that the war will drain them of too much of
                        their strength, and if the soldiery are unwilling to put insurrection down ;
                        but it seems to us most improbable. Very few Russians realise what the loss
                        of sea-power means, and fewer still are fully convinced that it has been
                        lost. There has been no invasion, no capture of any ancient Russian city,
                        nothing to enable an unusually ignorant population to see the war. They feel
                        the draft made on them by the summons to the Reserves, and they are
                        disturbed by rumours that Holy Russia is not crushing her enemies with her
                        usual com- pleteness ; but there has been no disaster sufficiently visible
                        to destroy the mingled fear and reepect felt for the authority of the Tsar,
                        or to induce the people to run the terrible risks involved in any
                        insurrection not supported by the soldiery. So long as there is obedience
                        the governing group in St. Petersburg can go on with the war if it will; and
                        its material resources, except at sea, are not yet worn out, or even
                        seriously affected. Even if the Russians have lost in the campaign two
                        hundred thousand men through the hardships of transport, the out- bursts of
                        sickness, and the deaths in actual fighting, these losses will soon be
                        replaced by the conscription, more especially as most of the dead belonged
                        to the Asiatic side of the vast Empire. The losses of officers, which have
                        been frightful, are being made up. Better artillery, better powder, better
                        muni- tions altogether, are all procurable for money; and the idea that the
                        wealth of Russia has been-exhausted in less than a year of war is positively
                        inept. The Treasury must provide for the interest on the Debt, and for all
                        that is purchased abroad; but it has reserves of gold to meet those
                        necessities, and everything procurable at home can be paid for in paper, to
                        be redeemed on the conclusion of the war. There are plenty of resources for
                        a secoond campaign, and the great Russians are, as we believe, determined to
                        fight one. They have at least three sets of motives, any one of which would
                        induce them to adopt that course. They are as proud of Russia as we are of
                        Great Britain, and would feel ultimate defeat by an Asiatic Power as an
                        inexpiable shame. They are firmly convinced that their defeat has been due
                        to unpreparedness, mismanagement, and corruption, and believe that with a
                        few months for reorganisation they can collect a mighty army, resume the
                        offensive, and in the next campaign drive the Japanese into the sea. And the
                        governing classes feel, rather than see, that a shameful peace, especially
                        if it included an indemnity, would be fatal to the autocracy; that is,
                        would, in their judgment, be the precursor of anarchy, and probably of
                        dismemberment.</p>

                            <p>The Japanese are very annoyed at the destruction of the ships arid
                                the despatching of destroyers after the oiler to surrender. The
                                newspapers, in consequence of such action, demand that the garrison
                                shall receive severe treatment. It appears, however, that the
                                destruction, etc., occurred after a Council of War had decided upon
                                surrender but considerably before the Commissioners met.</p>

                            <p>All the comments of Europe and America agree that the fall of Port
                                Arthur will conclude a military drama without parallel in history,
                                on account of the valour and achievements of the victors, and the
                                heroism and devotion of the vanquished. It is thought that the war
                                will continue unabated.</p>

                                endurance.</p>
                            <p>The Morning Post says that the capture of the fortress is one of the
                                finest feat of arms on record.</p>
                            <p>The Daily Telegraph states that the attack, demanding appalling

                        <p>The Keneh Native Court has passed sentence of death on one Hussein
                            Darwish, of the village of Barak- ma, Keneh Markaz, who was found guilty
                            of the murder of both his uncle and aunt. Some time ago he deposited
                            with his victims the sum of P.T.50,for the return of which he had
                            applied on more than one occasion. His uncle, being in poor
                            circumstances, was unable to pay the money and always postponed the time
                            for doing so. At last, when the man's patience was ex- hausted, he took
                            a knife, went to his uncle's house, and murdered both him and his wife,
                            afterwards confessing his guilt to the Parquet.</p>

                        <p>An Anglo- Egyptian abolitionist has passed away by the death in London a
                            few days ago of Mr. Charles H. Allen, F.R.G.S., who was for 19 years
                            secre- tary of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society, in his 81st
                            year. Mr. Allen came of a Quaker stock. Throughout his life he showed
                            special interest in the development of Africa. At first his attention
                            was largely concentrated on Egypt, where the British Government had,
                            recently undertaken great responsibilities. He received invaluable
                            assistance from General Gordon in pressing for the abolition of slavery
                            and the slave-trade throughout the Egyptian dominions; and seldom did
                            General Gordon come to London without visiting Mr. Allen to discuss some
                            plan for the liberation of the mil lions in the Dark Continent. A warm
                            coadjutor was found from the first in Lord Cromer, who rendered splendid
                            help, both by his general policy and also by promoting individual
                            schemes such as the Home for Freed Woman Slaves in Cairo.</p>

                        the service of the Egyptian Government, having entered the Customs
                        Administration and Coastguard Service in 1870. In 1879 he was appointed
                        Director of Customs at Suakin by the late General Gordon. This post he held
                        till 1882, when he served in the Egyptian campaign on the Commissarist stall
                        (medal and bronze star). He returned to Suakin in 1883, and served under
                        Baker Pasha in the Intelligence and Commissarist Department and was
                        subsequently appointed by the late Admiral Sir W.. Hewitt as Sub Governor,
                        in addition to his duties at the Customs. In 1884 he was appointed Commander
                        of the Imperial Order of the Medjidieh, and in the following year he was
                        lent to the Intelligence Depart- ment by the Egyptian Government, and was
                        attached to General Graham's force. He was present at several actions and at
                        the taking of Tamai, being mentioned in despatches. He remained in Suakin as
                        Director of Customs until 1890, when he was transferred to the Coastguard
                        Service at Alexandria as Secretary and Controller. In 1891 he was selected
                        by the Khedive Mohamed Tewtik as his Private Secretary, and acts now in the
                        same capacity to the present Khedive, his son. He already holds the rank of
                        Bey of the first class, and is Commander of the Imperial Ottoman Orders of

                    <p>The motor car is becoming, more and more one of the regular features of the
                        traffic of the Capital, and it is satisfactory to note that the drivers are
                        showing a reasonable regard for the convenience and safety of the public.
                        There is one point, however, as to which it seems desirable to draw their
                        attention. This is that the mere fact of their having a good clear stretch
                        of road before them does not justify their driving at high speeds in narrow
                        streets or near footpaths occupied by pedestrians. At any moment a tyre may
                        burst, with the im- mediate consequence of whirling the car sud- denly round
                        to the right or left, and plunging it into the midst of a crowd of
                        passers-by with- out leaving these a chance of escape. Several fatal
                        accidents have already occurred in Europe in this way.</p>

                        during last month, is still far from complete, and we shall in all
                        probability be well on into the new year before it will, or indeed can, be
                        opened, The roadway has been pierced and the side walls built, but the iron
                        roofing has yet to be fixed and the approaches constructed, and this means
                        no small amount of labor. That, when completed, it will prove a great relief
                        to the foot traffic over the Shoubra Bridge there can be no doubt, but, if
                        it is to be rendered really effective, it will have to be placed under
                        constant supervision, both with regard to the uses it may be put to and for
                        the prevention of obstructions and blocking. Very much of its utility will
                        depend upon the approaches, as if these are not convoniently placed and
                        arranged they will very largely discount the value of the accommodation the
                        tunnel will afford.</p>

                    <p>Suez, Tuesday.—A few days ago, a native theatrical company came to Suez and
                        erected in the centre of the town a wooden theatre covered with awnings.
                        Last evening, at 7.30 on the occasion of the first performance, a crowd of
                        natives assembled at the theatre, but did not enjoy the play for very long,
                        as a lamp set fire to the canvas and the whole place was in a very short
                        time burnt to the ground.' A panic ensued amongst the spectators, but they
                        all managed to escape uninjured. The Fire Brigade arrived on the scene
                        promptly and rendered every assistance, but the engine could not be made use
                        or as the firemen were unable to get up steam.</p>

                    <p>On Thursday, 29th ult, a sumptuous tea and impromptu concert was given at the
                        above club to the seamen in port. The rooms had been tastefully decorated
                        for the occasion, and the tables were beautifully laid with large supplies
                        of cake, sandwiches, and fruit. About 40 seamen sat down to partake of the
                        treat offered them. After the tea, which was served by lady, visitors, a
                        concert followed, and the men cheerfully came forward to sing songs. During
                        the concert cigars, cigarettes, sand- wiches, and refreshments were served,
                        and the greatest cordiality and good feeling prevailed throughout, though
                        the men were of divers nationalities, creeds, and color. The meeting broke
                        up at 10p.m., all those present standing up to sing "God save the King."</p>

                    <p>The Pall Mall Gazette makes the following remarks on the interview which we
                        reproduced from the Standard on Monday last:- If any- thing were needed to
                        confirm the rumours , afloat regarding the construction of an altern- ,
                        ative canal between the Mediterranean and Red Sea, we should imagine the
                        interview with M. Bonnet, the secretary of the Suez Canal Company, published
                        in the Standard, would, sufficient. This gentleman denies nothing, but in
                        the course of a columm of commonplace remarks he asserts that his company
                        has a monopoly for seventy years to come. Such a statement will cause not a
                        little surprise in London, and, we should imagine, to the shade Mr.
                        Gladstone. To those behind the scenes Mn Bonnet's ingenuousness is quite
                        refreshing, for the leaders of the agitation for a new 1anal are hard at
                        work upon their scheme. How long will it be before Prince d'Arenberg follows
                        the example of the late M. de Lesseps, who, after protesting that he would
                        concede nothing, came to London to find out on what terms shipowners would
                        oonsont to make peace.</p>

                    <p>A fatal quarrel took place yesterday afternoon between three Greeks in a bar
                        behind the Attarin Bazaar. The parties all hail from Smyrna, and it appears
                        that the murderer loved a sister of his two victims, one of whom was a
                        suitor for his own sister's hand. A discussion arose between the men and the
                        murderer drew his knife and despatched one at the brothers with a single
                        stab. The other brother came to the rescue but received two stabs, to which
                        he succumbed in the Greek Hospital at midnight.</p>
                    <p>The murderer is a young man, about 20 years of age, and is extraordinarily
                        muscular. His name is Yanni Antonio Stigrigo, and he was arrested by the
                        police in front of Cairo Railway Station. He made no resistance to the
                        police and allowed himself to be handcuffed quietly.</p>

                    <p>The Service of Antiquities has recently undertaken excavations at the low
                        stone pyramid of Zawyet el Arayan, which lies on the desert plateau between
                        Ghizieh and Sak- karah. The site dates from the Ancient Empire and news has
                        just been received of the discovery of a large granite mastaba or tomb.
                        Strong hopes are entertained that a find of considerable magnitude is about
                        to be un- covered. Extensive subterranean galleries were excavated some
                        years ago, but, owing to the difficult descent at the entrance shaft,
                        visitors rarely go down to these long passages under the desert.</p>

                    <head>PROF. MASPERO'S NEW TRANSLATION.</head>
                    <p>M. Maspero has published a new translation of the stele of Userkaf (the
                        Usercheres of Manetho) of the fifth dynasty, found by Prof. Petrie at
                        Abydos. He thinks that if Prof. Petrie's copyist had been, as he says, "a
                        professional Egyptologist," he (or she) might have been ablo to make a guess
                        at many of the mutilated signs, and thus have oonsidorahly reduced the
                        lacuna in the copy from which we now have to work. He does not agree with
                        Mr. Griffith in the view that the inscription was originally written on
                        papyrus, and afterwards transferred to stone, and he corrects the
                        translation published by the last-named in 'Abydos IL' in several
                        particulars. M. Maspero has also given a criticism of Dr. Erman's recent
                        'Aegyptisches Glosaar,' in which he laments that Dr. Erman refers his
                        readers in certain cases to his grammar only, and not to the texts on which
                        it is supposed to be founded. As M Maspero says, it is necessary for
                        beginners even more than for more advanced scholars that they should have an
                        opportunity of check- ing for themselves the theories of the Berlin school,
                        without being forced jurare in verbum magistri. Perhaps the sting of his
                        criticism ies in the concluding words that the 'Gloasar' should prove useful
                        to students at German universities and beginners in other countries.</p>

                    <head>VERDI THEATRE DEBACLE.</head>
                    <p>A Cairo correspondent writes:—</p>
                    <p>I see that the Verdi Theatre performances are few and far between at present,
                        that ap- patently the company are losing over the ven- ture, in short, that
                        they are likely enough to give it all up. It is the greatest possible pity.
                        Here we have good, an excellent opera com- pany giving us just the
                        repertoire which should appeal to us. The weary resident and the gay visitor
                        do not usually want overmuch Wagner or the like ; they prefer these lighter
                        operas, and yet no one seems to go. I admit that the Verdi Theatre has had
                        one or two off-nights, viz, and to wit, Gioconda for one; but Mignon, Aida,
                        Carmen, Otello, all were excellent. They have a surprisingly good orchestra.
                        They have five or six leading players who are good enough for
                        anything—Signora Monti-Baldini, Signor Tomisani, Signora Popovici—and I was
                        told that Signora Svicher was very good. I have not been, I admit, to all
                        the performances—by no means—but I have heard about those I did not see.</p>
                    <p>I will say at once that the raison d'etre of this article is not personal in
                        any sense; it is more an expression of my wish to tell Cairo people in
                        general (so far as they take any notice of my valued criticism) that if they
                        wish to see a good light opera oompany, they havo the chance and I wish they
                        would take it. It is pitiful to see the house emptier and emptier, and the
                        performers less and less enthusiastic or inclined to do their best And I
                        should imagine it is certain enough that if this Company gives up this their
                        first attempt we shall get little enough chance of any further repetitions.
                        I admit the locality is annoying, but the swift Cairo cabs make this of
                        little account. Once in a way it may be said by some that they-let us put it
                        so— prefer the environment, internal as well as external, of the Khedivial
                        Opera House, but they can always take a box. And really it was the sight of
                        those many empty boxes which moved me, as could no free seats or first-night
                        suppers or other induce- ments (which same I haven't had), to cover two
                        sheets of paper — that, and the wish to hear the operas myself, for, O well-
                        beloved visitors and residents, if you don't en- courage the opera, the
                        opera will vanish, and I shall have to go without! Invade the boxes, then,
                        ye visitors and we, "poor devils on a fixed income," will, lessen our supply
                        of ciga- rettes, and set apart the piastres necessary for our postri

                            for an ideal fresh-air-lying-in-laying-out show. Come, come,—I mean "Go

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE</p>
                        <p>Sir,—Your criticisms on the lack of initiative of the Alexandria
                            Archaeological Society to reference to the state of affairs prevailing
                            on the property of Prince Omar Pasha Toussoun at Aboukir may be
                            absolutely correct, but I should like to point out that the society
                            suffers from a chronic impecuniosity, due to the fact that it is so
                            poorly supported by the public of Alexandria. I use the phrase "chronic
                            im- pecuniosity" in a comparative sense, for if the society's means were
                            greater, it would indulge in far more extensive operations. Considering
                            the grant that the Egyptian Government accords to the Museum Service, it
                            is absurd that the Alexandria Archaeological Society should depend on
                            private contributions.</p>

                        our various colonies and possessions. It would appear, therefore, that there
                        is greater reason to express satisfaction with such results than to utter
                        any words of criticism or warn- ing. Yet a study of the import figures given
                        in the latest issue of the journal of the British Chamber of Commerce in
                        Egypt and of some of the consular remarks which the directors of the
                        publication bare deemed it expedient to quote shows that complaisant
                        satisfaction is not the attitude which it is desirable to com- mend. The
                        reason is that we are not keeping the proportion of trade hitherto enjoyed.
                        Egypt, as we have frequently pointed out, is making great strides forward as
                        a buyer and as a seller. She is most fortunate inn having author- ities who
                        are keenly alive to the development of all those means of transport which
                        act as incentives to commerce. In this journal of the Chamber of Commerce we
                        find a reoord which serves as a pertinent illustration of readiness to meet
                        the views of the trading classes. Some years ago it was urged on these
                        authorities that the Mahmoudieh Canal was not doing the amount or work of
                        which it was capable.^. Abolition of the lock and bridge tolls was advocated
                        with a view to facilitating navigation and increasing trade. In 1900 the
                        tolls were in operation and the total number of boats which passed Atfeh was
                        four thousand five hundred and sixty-four. In 1901 the tolls were abolished
                        and the number passing rose to sixteen thousand seven hundred and twelvo,
                        while last year it was twenty-three thousand and ninety-nine. At Kafr-Dawar
                        lock the total in 1900 was thirteen thousand seven hundred and twenty-four,
                        and last year it was thirty-five thousand seven hundred and thirty-two.
                        These are amazing figures. Strong representations are now being made in
                        favor of improving the facilities for landing - goods at Cairo, and when
                        this is carried out the water trans- port, especially by means of low-height
                        sailing vessels, will be of far greater use and value. At the same time it
                        should be remembered that Lord Farrer and Mr. Oliver K. H. Bury are engaged
                        in a special inquiry as to the administration of the State railways of
                        Egypt, and it is expected that they will be able to make suggestions fur
                        improving the efficiency of the public sen ice. Egypt, therefore, presents
                        an attractive field which other nations are' ready to work to the greatest
                        advantage. British trade, while holding a "very com- manding position," has
                        to meet increasingly strong competition in almost all directions. The Earl
                        of Cromer urges on his oouutry- men "greater adaptability to tho "wants of
                        customers" not only in the form of the goods but also in the language and
                        trade terns of circulars and prioe lists. His Lord ship regards the
                        employment of more an 1 better-equipped travelling agents as a matter ot yet
                        greater importance. Kecommeudatioua of the kind are so frequent that they
                        lose some of their force. A glance over detailed figures of import for the
                        first nine months of this year shows bow severe competition is in trades
                        which we have developed to a high degree of efficiency. Of eighty .thousand
                        pounds worth of boots only ten thousand pounds worth oarne from this
                        country. We supply but a tenth of the imported furniture, and about tho same
                        of the glass and china, though in earthen- ware tho percentage is far more
                        in our favor. In brass, copper, and bronze we are masters, and send about
                        two-thirds of the total, while in iron and ironwork our pro- portion is
                        nearly four-fifths, and we send twice as much machinery aa all other
                        countries. But we have but a small share of the ironmongery trade, and we
                        are badly beaten in locomotives and irrigation pumps, though in portable
                        engines it is Great Britain first and this rest practically nowhere. The
                        figures suggest that certain of our trades have made a great effort to meet
                        Egyptian wants, and hare been successful, while in other direc- tions there
                        has been that absence of adaptabi- lity whereon Lord Cromer comments. We do
                        not draw attention to the state of trade for exclusively commercial reasons.
                        The substan- tial advantage we enjoy ia well worth preserv- ing, and the
                        outlook ia good enough to justify us in regarding Egypt as one of the best
                        of the neutral markets. But there are also political reaaona for desiring to
                        see our trade with the Khedive's possessions pros- pering. Though for the
                        moment the pres- sure of international jealousies is relaxed, and wc may not
                        feel embarrassed by the peculiarly undefined and almost (indefinable nature
                        of' our relations with Egypt, it is im- portant to strengthen all the ties
                        of interest that bind us to that country. Our predominant share of her trade
                        is one of the solid grounds on which our protectorate may be justified, and
                        its existence is an evidence that the relations which have boon established
                        are not even sen- timentally irksome to the people. They will do more
                        business with us if we are equal to the task of meeting every form of
                        rivalry with skill and energy. Egypt noeds our manufactures, and is not
                        likely to be a competitor against them. We, on the other hand, need her pro-
                        duce as raw material for many of our indus- tries, so that there is a
                        natural basis of per- manent exchange, from which the advantages should be
                        mutual.</p>

                    <p>In addressing the shareholders at the annual general meeting of this company,
                        the Chairman said that owing. to delays m obtaining the complete accounts
                        from Egypt, it had been found impossible to paci before them the accounts
                        for the year, and it was proposed to have tho utx.unis completed to the end
                        of 1904, and present thorn early in the present year. He was pleased to be
                        able to say that thuir third exp tlition had now been sumo time at the mine,
                        that work was progressing there rapidly and with excellent results, gold was
                        being contin- uously sloped out, and monthly returns were being made, and
                        unless some uuforaaeea diffi- culties arose there was every reason to
                        believe that they would continue. The company was funned to take over an
                        area on the N do Valley Company's concession. That area was held by them
                        under a sub-licence, which expires in March, 1906. The directors have now
                        obtained an extension of their Haimur holding for a further period of two
                        years. They have also obtained mining leases of tho Haimur mines direct from
                        tho Egyptian - Uovenuuout fora period of thirty years, with the right to
                        renew for' a further period of filteen years, and at their option the right
                        to determine in any year during those periods. The shareholders had
                        therefore fixity of tenure as regards Haimur, in addition to their
                        prospecting rights.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman continued : — Now with regard to your property at Haimur: during
                        my visit to Egypt last year I visited Haimur in oompany with vour engineer,
                        Mr. Harry Lake, when we made a thorough investigation of the property, and I
                        am leaving England early in January for Egypt and intend to again visit your
                        property with Mr. Lake. A great deal of development work was done at Haimur
                        last season, in the course of wlich a considerable amount of gold was won,
                        the proceeds of which have been placed to your credit, but owing to the fact
                        that under our original holding we were debar- red by the Government from
                        removing any more gold than was necessary to prove the property, practically
                        no sloping was carried out. The bulk of the gold which was removed was that
                        taken from the drives, rises and winzes, which were put in to prove the
                        extent and richness of the mine. All this is now changed. 'ihe rich stone,
                        tho existence of which we had proved but which we were compelled to leave
                        before, we now have tho right under our leasee to win, and this is now beiug
                        done. The pay ground already opened up extends for a considerable distance
                        longi- tudinally, and from tho highest to the lowest points at present
                        opened up is a depth of some 400 to 500 ft. in proving your property, we
                        have used our best endeavours to work on strictly economical linos, and with
                        that end iu view we, have followed the trend of tho veins, putting in adits
                        at different elevations aioug the hili-side and two prospecting shafts in
                        Uie Waili, and where wo have out the formation we have driven on it and
                        followed it down by menus of winzes, connecting up the different drives for
                        purposes of ventila- tion. We still propose to pursue this method of
                        development, and new having obtained our lease we propose to put down our
                        main shaft and develop the property at depth. You will see on referring to
                        tho drawing at the end of the report, which shows the trausverso sec- tion
                        of the Haimur workiugs, that at, and uear, the surface on the hill they
                        consist of a series of veins which run parallel, or nearly parallel, to each
                        other. It baa been found, however, as we haye gone down on them that they
                        are converging towards a single point. In fact the formauou suggests a cane
                        which has split into a aeries ol smaller parts at the end although the main
                        body of it remains in one piece. Whilst 1 cannot promise you that these
                        parallel planes make together at one point, there appears from their trend
                        to be a reasonable probability that they do so, and we now propose to put
                        doVru our main shall to open up formation in the neighbourhood where we
                        anticipate this is likely to occur, lu these parallel veins on which wo havo
                        been working the veins have varied in thiokness and in productiveness. Some
                        extraordinarily rich stone has been taken out, and quotiug from the report 1
                        see that in Adit No. 1. drive N. it is stated "some splendid milling ores
                        have lately oome from tho bottom end of Winze N. giving up to some 50 oz.
                        per ton over 4 to 6 in." On the other hand I see that 5 or. valoes have been
                        obtained over 2 feet of reef, and what is oven more interesting, in the
                        lowest parte of the workings in tho Wadi the formation runs as much as 10
                        feet wide.</p>
                    <p>With regard to water, without which, mining in tho desert is an expensive
                        process, I must tell you that water is making its way into the bottom of the
                        shaft in the Wadi, a depth of some 500 ft. from the highest point of tho
                        workings, and approximately 800 ft below W*di level. I do not anticipate
                        that this influx of water is going to create any difficulty, bnc on the
                        contrary is going to be a very valuable asset, and indeed will materially
                        lessen the cost of working there. I hope I have mado it clear to you bom the
                        fore- going remarks that , you have a valuable property in Haimur, in
                        addition to your other interests, that a large amount of pay ground has
                        already been proved and is now being profitably workod, and that your Board
                        propose m the immediate future to farther open up the mine, and generally to
                        develop your pro- perty on energetic lines. I would call your attention to
                        the very moderate capitalisation of your oompany, and in oonoluaion would
                        point oat that a large number of fooee are now being worked and stone is
                        being taken out whichitu estimated will average from £10 to £12 per ton nett
                        profit, and it is anticipated that regular shipments will be made which will
                        enable the Company to develop its property.</p>

                    <head>[Told by a Photographer,]</head>
                    <p>" A photographer is born, not made," said a Camera Artist. He is hewn to
                        endure aa many troubles as the rest of mankind. Mr. Arthur F. Brookes, of
                        25, Tho Arcade, Wol- verhampton, has travelled through many I countries with
                        his camera, but in London his | professional career was threatened. "1 was
                        ill," j he said, "and none of the doctors knew what was the matter. But Dr.
                        Williams' pink pills i for pale people found my trouble and ourod it 1 was
                        terribly 'run down.' My nerves seemed to have left me, and at sight of food
                        my stomach would turn. When I forced down a little food to keep up my
                        strength, the pains in my chest were excruciating.</p>
                    <p>"Two eminent doctors said I was snflering from nervous prostration, and
                        ordered complete rest. I was under them six months, but soon after was as
                        ill as ever. 1 had such pain in my bank as to make me cry out and clutch at
                        the first thing I came to.</p>
                    <p>"I attended a hospital for two months, and my case puzzled evou the clever
                        doctors there. Reduced to a mere skeleton (for eating was impossible) 1
                        lingered in a dreadful state until four months ago I met an old triend who
                        asked me why 1 didn't try Dr. Wilburns' pink pills— they always set him up.
                        1 purchased a box, and it made me a great deaf better. By the time 1 had
                        finished a second box 1 was rapidly putting on flesh. My appetite returned,
                        and 1 enjoy my meals now, without any ill alter-ctlocta. My improved health,
                        after only three boxes, is a revelation. 1 have not toll so well for over
                        ten yean as 1 do at the present I time. There bus never been the least
                        retain of the pain."</p>
                    <p>Nerves broken down by irony and work set up the most difficult fora of
                        chronic indi- gestion. Broken uervas are nerves starved for the want of
                        blood. Dr. Williams' pink pills for pale people—genuine only with lull name,
                        seven words—make blood, limy banish aroenua and the pains that afttict the
                        weaker sex. But they are equally valuable for men, having cured indigtnuou,
                        palpitations, bile, nervous depression, sciatica, rheumatism, paralysis, Sl
                        Vitus' dance, and nervous disorders. Two shillings and uwopeuce for one box,
                        or thirteen and nine for six sent to Dr. Williams' medians Go.,
                        Molboro-viaduot, London, will bring the pills by return poet. But they can
                        be had at medicine shops, it readers insist on the genuine.</p>
