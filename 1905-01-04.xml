                        <p> AFTER PORT ARTHUR.</p>
                        <p> The fall of Port Arthur has necessarily brought up the question of
                            mediation or in- ervention, and a telegram from London this morning
                            states that various inspired sug- estions in the direction of peace are
                            emanating from Washington, representing Mr. Roosevelt as anxious to
                            mediate but unable to move until approached by both the belligerents.
                            Nothing whatever confirmatory has been receiv ed, and the peaee rumors
                            are not credited. The scepticism prevailing in London is doubt- less
                            well founded for we are still unable to believe that peace is near at
                            hand. The fall of</p>
                        <p> Port Arthur does not necessarily imply that the Japanese will triumph in
                            the war, for the capitulation of the Gibraltar of the Far East is
                            probably only the end of the first act, and not by any means the drop
                            scene, of the great drama. We believe that Ruarsa will fight to the
                            bitter end, subject always to the condition that there is no general
                            internal revolt. Such an occurrence is possible if the peasantry have
                            ceased to fear a beaten Government, or are convinced that the war will
                            drain them of too much of their strength, and if the soldiery are
                            unwilling to put insurrection down ; but it seems to us most improbable.
                            Very few Rus- sians realise what the loss of sea-power means, and fewer
                            still are fully convinced that it has been lost. There has been no
                            invasion, no cap- ture of any ancient Russian city, nothing to enable an
                            unusually ignorant population to see the war. They feel the draft made
                            on them by the summons to the Reserves, and they are disturbed by
                            rumours that Holy Russia is not crushing her enemies with her usual com-
                            pleteness ; but there has been no disaster sufficiently visible to
                            destroy the mingled fear and reepect felt for the authority of the Tsar,
                            or to induce the people to run the terrible risks involved in any
                            insurrection not supported by the soldiery. So long as there is
                            obedience the governing group in St. Petersburg can go on with the war
                            if it will; and its material resources, except at sea, are not yet worn
                            out, or even seriously affected. Even if the Russians have lost in the
                            campaign two hundred thousand men through the hardships of transport,
                            the out- bursts of sickness, and the deaths in actual fighting, these
                            losses will soon be replaced by the conscription, more especially as
                            most of the dead belonged to the Asiatic side of the vast Empire. The
                            losses of officers, which have been frightful, are being made up. Better
                            artillery, better powder, better muni- tions altogether, are all
                            procurable for money; and the idea that the wealth of Russia has
                            been-exhausted in less than a year of war is positively inept. The
                            Treasury must provide for the interest on the Debt, and for all that is
                            purchased abroad; but it has reserves of gold to meet those necessities,
                            and everything procur- able at home can be paid for in paper, to be
                            redeemed on the conclusion of the war. There are plenty of resources for
                            a secoond campaign, and the great Russians are, as we believe,
                            determined to fight one. They have at least three sets of motives, any
                            one of which would induce them to adopt that course. They are as proud
                            of Russia as we are of Great Britain, and would feel ultimate defeat by
                            an Asiatic Power as an inexpiable shame. They are firmly convinced that
                            their defeat has been due to unpreparedness, mismanagement, and
                            corruption, and believe that with a few months for reorganisation they
                            can collect a mighty army, resume the offensive, and in the next
                            campaign drive the Japanese into the sea. And the governing classes
                            feel, rather than see, that a shameful peace, especially if it included
                            an indemnity, would be fatal to the autocracy; that is, would, in their
                            judgment, be the precursor of anarchy, and probably of
                            dismemberment.</p>

                        <p>St. Petersburg, January 3.</p>
                        <p>The fall of Port Arthur is unknown to the general public. It has hitherto
                            only been known to the official world, and to certain restricted private
                            circles.</p>
                        <p>(Reuter.)</p>
                        <p>Chi-Fu, January 3.</p>
                        <p>In the conditions of the capitulation of Port Arthur, it is stipulated
                            that the officers of the garrison will return to Russia on parole and
                            the men will be sent to Japan as prisoners.</p>
                        <p>(Havas.)</p>
                        <p>Tokio, January 3.</p>
                        <p>The Russian officers will be permitted to return to Russia on parole.
                            They will retain their swords. The Japanese occupied a number of forts
                            to-day.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese are very annoyed at the destruction of the ships arid the
                            despatching of destroyers after the oiler to surrender. The newspapers,
                            in consequence of such action, demand that the garrison shall receive
                            severe treatment. It appears, however, that the destruction, etc.,
                            occurred after a Council of War had decided upon surrender but consider-
                            ably before the Commissioners met.</p>

                        <p>Three torpedo-launches have arrived from Port Arthur. There are now 7
                            Japanese destroyers in the harbour.</p>

                        <p>Apparently all the Russian destroyers reach- ed Chi-Fu and Tsingtan
                            safely. The Russians destroyed all the men-of-war, and wrecked the
                            remaining forts, together with everything valuable.</p>

                        <p>All the comments of Europe and America agree that the fall of Port Arthur
                            will conclude a military drama without parallel in history, on account
                            of the valour and achievements of the victors, and the heroism and
                            devotion of the vanquished. It is thought that the war will continue
                            unabated.</p>
                        <p>The Standard states that the end has been worthy of that marvelous
                            conflict between men who were equally matched as regards an
                            inexhaustible resource of unflinching courage and un ailing
                            endurance.</p>
                        <p>The Morning Post says that the capture of the fortress is one of the
                            finest feat of arms on record.</p>
                        <p>The Daily Telegraph states that the attack, demanding appalling
                            sacrifices, has crowned the victors with glory.</p>

                        <p>Double Murder for- P.T. 50.—The Keneh Native Court has passed sentence of
                            death on one Hussein Darwish, of the village of Barak- ma, Keneh Markaz,
                            who was found guilty of the murder of both his uncle and aunt. Some time
                            ago he deposited with his victims the sum of P.T.50,for the return of
                            which he had applied on more than one occasion. His uncle, being in poor
                            circumstances, was unable to pay the money and always postponed the time
                            for doing so. At last, when the man’s patience was ex- hausted, he took
                            a knife, went to his uncle’s house, and murdered both him and his wife,
                            afterwards confessing his guilt to the Parquet.</p>
                        <p>St. Joseph’s Home, in the Moharrem Bey quarter of Alexandria, gave a
                            delightful Christ- mas Tree fete yesterday. A large number of ladies
                            were present including Mme. Girard, Mrs. Chataway, Countess de Zogheb,
                            etc. The fine Christmas Tree was given by Mr. von Pitner. It was
                            bedecked with innumerable toys and beautifully illuminated. The tree had
                            been decorated by the ladies who organis- ed the fete. The delight of
                            the children who are so well looked after at this excellent insti-
                            tution was a treat to behold, and gave a well deserved pleasure to the
                            lady patronesses, who had been at great pains to organise the fete for
                            the children. The fete was in the first place due to the initiative of
                            Mrs. G. Debbane, who was kindly assisted by the “Dames de l'Ouvroir des
                            Mires Chretiennes” and by many young ladies of Alexandria.</p>
                        <p>The Egyptian Slave Trade. — An Anglo- Egyptian abolitionist has passed
                            away by the death in London a few days ago of Mr. Charles H. Allen,
                            F.R.G.S., who was for 19 years secre- tary of the British and Foreign
                            Anti-Slavery Society, in his 81st year. Mr. Allen came of a Quaker
                            stock. Throughout his life he showed special interest in the development
                            of Africa. At first his attention was largely concentrated on Egypt,
                            where the British Government had, recently undertaken great
                            responsibilities. He received invaluable assistance from General Gordon
                            in pressing for the abolition of slavery and the slave-trade throughout
                            the Egyptian dominions; and seldom did General Gordon come to London
                            without visiting Mr. Allen to discuss some plan for the liberation of
                            the mil lions in the Dark Continent. A warm coadjutor was found from the
                            first in Lord Cromer, who rendered splendid help, both by his general
                            policy and also by promoting individual schemes such as the Home for
                            Freed Woman Slaves in Cairo.</p>

                            (2nd class)of the Order of the Medjidieh on his English private

                            British colony, among whom Brewster Bey counts many friends. The Bey has
                            been 35 years in the service of the Egyptian Government, having entered
                            the Customs Administration and Coastguard Service in 1870. In 1879 he
                            was appointed Director of Customs at Suakin by the late General Gordon.
                            This post he held till 1882, when he served in the Egyptian campaign on
                            the Commissarist stall (medal and bronze star). He returned to Suakin in
                            1883, and served under Baker Pasha in the Intelligence and Commissarist
                            Department and was subsequently appointed by the late Admiral Sir W..
                            Hewitt as Sub Governor, in addition to his duties at the Customs. In
                            1884 he was appointed Commander of the Imperial Order of the Medjidieh,
                            and in the following year he was lent to the Intelligence Depart- ment
                            by the Egyptian Government, and was attached to General Graham’s force.
                            He was present at several actions and at the taking of Tamai, being
                            mentioned in despatches. He remained in Suakin as Director of Customs
                            until 1890, when he was transferred to the Coastguard Service at
                            Alexandria as Secretary and Controller. In 1891 he was selected by the
                            Khedive Mohamed Tewtik as his Private Secretary, and acts now in the
                            same capacity to the present Khedive, his son. He already holds the rank
                            of Bey of the first class, and is Commander of the Imperial Ottoman
                            Orders of Osmanieh and Medjidieh, and Chevalier of the Francois Joseph

                        <p>The motor car is becoming, more and more one of the regular features of
                            the traffic of the Capital, and it is satisfactory to note that the
                            drivers are showing a reasonable regard for the convenience and safety
                            of the public. There is one point, however, as to which it seems
                            desirable to draw their attention. This is that the mere fact of their
                            having a good clear stretch of road before them does not justify their
                            driving at high speeds in narrow streets or near footpaths occupied by
                            pedestrians. At any moment a tyre may burst, with the im- mediate
                            consequence of whirling the car sud- denly round to the right or left,
                            and plunging it into the midst of a crowd of passers-by with- out
                            leaving these a chance of escape. Several fatal accidents have already
                            occurred in Europe in this way.</p>

                        <p>The new subway under the railway, that was to have been opened for public
                            use during last month, is still far from complete, and we shall in all
                            probability be well on into the new year before it will, or indeed can,
                            be opened, The roadway has been pierced and the side walls built, but
                            the iron roofing has yet to be fixed and the approaches constructed, and
                            this means no small amount of labor. That, when completed, it will prove
                            a great relief to the foot traffic over the Shoubra Bridge there can be
                            no doubt, but, if it is to be rendered really effective, it will have to
                            be placed under constant supervision, both with regard to the uses it
                            may be put to and for the prevention of obstructions and blocking. Very
                            much of its utility will depend upon the approaches, as if these are not
                            convoniently placed and arranged they will very largely discount the
                            value of the accommodation the tunnel will afford.</p>

                            own profit, it has to pay a considerable charge to the Khedivial

                        <p>Suez, Tuesday.—A few days ago, a native theatrical company came to Suez
                            and erected in the centre of the town a wooden theatre covered with
                            awnings. Last evening, at 7.30 on the occasion of the first performance,
                            a crowd of natives assembled at the theatre, but did not enjoy the play
                            for very long, as a lamp set fire to the canvas and the whole place was
                            in a very short time burnt to the ground.' A panic ensued amongst the
                            spectators, but they all managed to escape uninjured. The Fire Brigade
                            arrived on the scene promptly and rendered every assistance, but the
                            engine could not be made use or as the firemen were unable to get up
                            steam.</p>

                            the above club to the seamen in port. The rooms had been tastefully
                            decorated for the occasion, and the tables were beautifully laid with
                            large supplies of cake, sandwiches, and fruit. About 40 seamen sat down
                            to partake of the treat offered them. After the tea, which was served by

                        <p>The Pall Mall Gazette makes the following remarks on the interview which
                            we reproduced from the Standard on Monday last:- If any- thing were
                            needed to confirm the rumours , afloat regarding the construction of an
                            altern- , ative canal between the Mediterranean and Red Sea, we should
                            imagine the interview with M. Bonnet, the secretary of the Suez Canal
                            Company, published in the Standard, would, sufficient. This gentleman
                            denies nothing, but in the course of a columm of commonplace remarks he
                            asserts that his company has a monopoly for seventy years to come. Such
                            a statement will cause not a little surprise in London, and, we should
                            imagine, to the shade Mr. Gladstone. To those behind the scenes Mn
                            Bonnet’s ingenuousness is quite refreshing, for the leaders of the
                            agitation for a new 1anal are hard at work upon their scheme. How long

                        <p>A fatal quarrel took place yesterday after- noon between three Greeks in

                            tt appeara that the mur- derer loved a sister of his two victims, one of
                            whom was a suitor for his own sister's hand. A discussion arose between
                            the men and the murderer drew his knife and despatch- ed one at the
                            brothers with a single stab. The other brother came to the rescue but
                            received two stabs, to which he succumbed in the Greek Hospital at

                        <p>The murderer is a young man, about 20 years of age, and is

                            stone pyramid of Zawyet el Arayan, which lies on the desert plateau
                            between Ghizieh and Sak- karah. The site dates from the Ancient Empire
                            and news has just been received of the discovery of a large granite
                            mastaba or tomb. Strong hopes are entertained that a find of
                            considerable magnitude is about to be un- covered. Extensive
                            subterranean galleries were excavated some years ago, but, owing to the

                        <p>M. Maspero has published a new translation of the stele of Userkaf (the
                            Usercheres of Manetho) of the fifth dynasty, found by Prof. Petrie at
                            Abydos. He thinks that if Prof. Petrie's copyist had been, as he says,
                            “a professional Egyptologist," he (or she) might have been ablo to make
                            a guess at many of the mutilated signs, and thus have oonsidorahly
                            reduced the lacuna in the copy from which we now have to work. He does
                            not agree with Mr. Griffith in the view that the inscription was
                            originally written on papyrus, and afterwards transferred to stone, and
                            he corrects the translation published by the last-named in 'Abydos IL'
                            in several particulars. M. Maspero has also given a criticism of Dr.
                            Erman’s recent ’Aegyptisches Glosaar,' in which he laments that Dr.
                            Erman refers his readers in certain cases to his grammar only, and not
                            to the texts on which it is supposed to be founded. As M Maspero says,
                            it is necessary for beginners even more than for more advanced scholars
                            that they should have an opportunity of check- ing for themselves the
                            theories of the Berlin school, without being forced jurare in verbum
                            magistri. Perhaps the sting of his criticism ies in the concluding words
                            that the 'Gloasar' should prove useful to students at German
                            universities and beginners in other countries.</p>

                        <head>VERDI THEATRE DEBACLE.</head>
                        <p>A Cairo correspondent writes:—</p>
                        <p>I see that the Verdi Theatre performances are few and far between at
                            present, that ap- patently the company are losing over the ven- ture, in
                            short, that they are likely enough to give it all up. It is the greatest
                            possible pity. Here we have good, an excellent opera com- pany giving us
                            just the repertoire which should appeal to us. The weary resident and
                            the gay visitor do not usually want overmuch Wagner or the like ; they
                            prefer these lighter operas, and yet no one seems to go. I admit that
                            the Verdi Theatre has had one or two off-nights, viz, and to wit,
                            Gioconda for one; but Mignon, Aida, Carmen, Otello, all were excellent.
                            They have a surprisingly good orchestra. They have five or six leading
                            players who are good enough for anything—Signora Monti-Baldini, Signor
                            Tomisani, Signora Popovici—and I was told that Signora Svicher was very
                            good. I have not been, I admit, to all the performances—by no means—but
                            I have heard about those I did not see.</p>
                        <p>I will say at once that the raison d'etre of this article is not personal
                            in any sense; it is more an expression of my wish to tell Cairo people
                            in general (so far as they take any notice of my valued criticism) that
                            if they wish to see a good light opera oompany, they havo the chance and
                            I wish they would take it. It is pitiful to see the house emptier and
                            emptier, and the performers less and less enthusiastic or inclined to do
                            their best And I should imagine it is certain enough that if this
                            Company gives up this their first attempt we shall get little enough
                            chance of any further repetitions. I admit the locality is annoying, but
                            the swift Cairo cabs make this of little account. Once in a way it may
                            be said by some that they-let us put it so— prefer the environment,
                            internal as well as external, of the Khedivial Opera House, but they can
                            always take a box. And really it was the sight of those many empty boxes
                            which moved me, as could no free seats or first-night suppers or other
                            induce- ments (which same I haven’t had), to cover two sheets of paper —
                            that, and the wish to hear the operas myself, for, O well- beloved
                            visitors and residents, if you don’t en- courage the opera, the opera
                            will vanish, and I shall have to go without! Invade the boxes, then, ye
                            visitors and we, “poor devils on a fixed income," will, lessen our
                            supply of ciga- rettes, and set apart the piastres necessary for our

                        <p>Sir,-was "Cariene's" object to drive my nails home, or stir up the dry
                            bones in the almost forgotten valley of satire? Preeuming he latter, I
                            pick up a bone here and there and offer you the “bouquet"</p>
                        <p>Most decidedly,“Cairene,” the “philanthropic (why not philo-progenitive)
                            labors" should have some “forthcoming,” and if the Anglo- American
                            Hospital is to have the honor of presenting our dual community with
                            fifteen new members “at one and the same time" more power to it (the
                            hospital); long may it flourish (the hospital again); also the “fifteen
                            at one and the same time" (A happy new year to them); also the thirty
                            proud responsibilities (A happy new year to them too). But was it not as
                            you infer, a little invidious to call upon the resident civilian
                            community to share the responsibility and add another "embarrassment"
                            fifteen of them to their “present financial" ones</p>
                        <p>By all means “Cairene," agitate for State- aided lying-in hospitals, and
                            impose penalties on those who do not make use of them, but why a private
                            community, bachelors and bene- dicts alike, should be called upon. to
                            “lay out” to the tune of fifteen ‘lying-in’’ embarrass- ments at a time,
                            and which they had not bar- gained for, is just a little too much.</p>
                        <p>And why, “Cairene,” do you laud and damn in the same breath the “recent
                            opening of a similar establishment in Cairo,” when the “highest medical
                            authorities have apparently fixed upen Ghezireh as the one and only site
                            for an ideal fresh-air-lying-in-laying-out show. Come, come,—I mean “Go

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE</p>
                        <p>Sir,—Your criticisms on the lack of initiative of the Alexandria
                            Archaeological Society to reference to the state of affairs prevailing
                            on the property of Prince Omar Pasha Toussoun at Aboukir may be
                            absolutely correct, but I should like to point out that the society
                            suffers from a chronic impecuniosity, due to the fact that it is so
                            poorly supported by the public of Alexandria. I use the phrase "chronic
                            im- pecuniosity" in a comparative sense, for if the society's means were
                            greater, it would indulge in far more extensive operations. Considering
                            the grant that the Egyptian Government accords to the Museum Service, it
                            is absurd that the Alexandria Archaeological Society should depend on
                            private contributions.</p>
