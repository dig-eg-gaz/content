OUR SPECIAL CABLES.
THE ELECTIONS.
Mk. HALDANE AND THE ARMY.
(Gazette’s Special Service.)
London, Monday, Jan. 29.
To day the Government gains are seven and
the Unionist one. The Government undergoes
no change in sixteen constituencies and the
Unionist in six. Mr. Walter Long has been
elected.
( Gazette’s Special Service )
^London, Monday, Jan. 29.
Mr. Haldane, speaking at Edinburgh, laid
stress on the fact that what we want in the army
is more "thinking” officers in the cavalry and
line regiments. He looks to the universities to
suppiy these. Commenting on the magnificent
majority gained by the Government, and the
power it conveyed, he said that what they
wanted was ideas.
LOCAL AND GENERAL.
Mariout Diatrict.
Miralai Hopkins »n Bey, Commandant of the
Alexandria City Police, left yesterday for a
five days’ inspection of the Mariout district
Stray Dogs.
Stray and ownerless dogs found in the Ein
Shams district of Cairo at dawn to morrow,
'and in Abbassieh at dawn on Wednesday, will
be poisoned by the police.
A New Departure.
Messrs. Gilliam and Walters, representing
the British American Tobacco Co., Limited,
Cecil Chambers, London, have engaged premi-
ses in Cairo and will shortly start work.
Hashish Seizure.
Two sacks of hashish were seized by the
Coast Guards on Saturday night as they were
being drawn through the water towards the
coast at Gabbari by means of ropes from some
ship in the harbour. The would-be smugglers
escaped.
The Weather.
A fairly strong gale prevailed yesterday and
on Saturday night at Alexandria, and a high
sea ruled. The Coast Guard Nesseem was
caught in the gale off the coast on Saturday
night and had one of her boats carried away,
besides her bowsprit She had to put in to
Aboukir for shelter.
The Kaiser’s Birthday.
Saturday being the 47th anniversary of the
Emperor William’s birthday many buildings
in Cairo flew the German flag. A service was
held in the German Church at 10 a.m. at
which Dr. Rucker Jenisch, Diplomatic Agent
and Consul-General; Dr. Gumprecht, Consul;
and all the staff of the Agency and Consulate
were present. A reception was held at the
Agency and later in the morning Dr. Rucker
Jenisch called on Boutros Pacha Ghali, Minis
ter for Foreign Affairs, who returned the
call shortly afterwards. Iu the evening a
grand tanquet was held at the Continental
Hotel at which over a hundred members of
the German Colony were present.
Egyptian Directories.
The directories of Mr. Stefano G. Poffandi
and of Messrs. Rizzo and Co. for 1906 have
made their appearance. Considering the great
difficulties That have to be encountered in this
country in keeping a directory np to date and
ferreting out all the changes of address, estab-
lishments of new firms and companies, and the
hundred and one other odds and ends that go
to make up a reliable work of the kind, we
must say that these two works are excellent.
With the exception of the G unison Directory,
which is only a partial one, there are no other
works of the kind in Egypt, and both Mr.
Poffandi and Messrs. Rizzo & Co.’s books
deserve to be on the desk of every business
man in Egypt.

DEATH OF SIR E. PALMER.
PROMINENT LOCAL FINANCIER.
SKETCH OF SUCCESSFUL CAREER.
MENA HOUSE GYMKHANA.
The Gymkhaua to be held at Mena House
Hotel on Tuesday, 6th February, promises to
be a great success. Officials from the country
who are taking advantage of the Beyram
holidays are beginning to send in their ponies
to Mena House Hotel, whose management have
made special arrangements to provide stalls
for that purpose. Id order to enable residents
to take part in the donkey races the manage-
ment have also made arrangements to keep
a large number of donkeys on the race course
which can be hired there at the rate of 5
piastres a-boad. The bookings for the ladies’
horse race (distance three furlongs) are coming
in fast, and the two hack races for gentle-
men are likely to be well patronized. The
band of the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers has
been engaged and an excellent tea will be
served on the ground free of charge.
Lieut. Col. Hill has kindly consented to
act as judge, and if the weather is as
fine as it is now, there is no doubt that half
Cairo will be out at Mena House to see the
fun. The Tramway Company has arranged
for an extra service that day. Cars will run
from Kasr-el-Nil tramway station evary 15
minutes.
We regret to announce that Sir Elwin
Palmer died yesterday morning at 6 15 o’clook
at his residence at Cairo. In the first week of
December, Sir Elwin and Lady Palmer left
fora trip to Khartoum, where Miss Palmer had
preceded them, Sir Elwin being desirous
of seeing something of Mr. Leigh Hunt’s
development work at the Atbara. On return-
ing to Cairo he appeared to be ill and it
was believed that he was suffering from
a touch of sun-stroke. Bat it was soon
recognised that the malady was enteric fever.
It was thought that it was only a mild case
and to all appearance ho w a so soon on the
way to recovery that we were able to announce
on the 10th inst. that he was making rapid
progress towards convalescence and he could
even see a few visitors. Two days afterward
it was stated that he was so well that he
hoped to be able to return to work in a few
days’ time. But in enteric no patient can be
considered out of danger until his convales-
csnce is complete, for a relapse may even be
worse than the primary fever, as was the case
with Sir Elwin. Early last week he became
rapidly worse and bulletins were posted daily
on the door of his home at the National Bank.
On Wednesday the doctors reported that the
invalid had passed an easier night, on Thurs-
day the news was not so comforting, Dr.
Hess and Dr. Wildt, who were in attendance,
reporting that he had somewhat lost strength,
bat Friday’s bulletin showed that he had
passed a better night and that his temperature
had come down. Ou Saturday we stated that
he had passed a bad night and that his heart
had become weaker, and yesterday morning
the end came.
Sir Elwin was born on the 3rd March, 1852
and was therefore in his fifty-third year. He
was the son of Mr. Edward Palmer and of
Caroline, the daughter of Colonel Gonthorpe.
He was educated at Lancing College and
entered the Indian Financial Department in
1871. In 1881 he married Mary, the daughter
of Major Herbert M. Clogstoun, V. C. He
to be badly India until 1885, when he was
appointed to accend Sir Gerald Fitzgerald
as Director General of Appoints in Egypt. It
is thanks to Sir Gerald Fitzgerald and Sir
Edwin Palmer that Egypt p system 
of accounts which can bear companies with 
those of any other country in Europe. It 
is quite possible for the finances of a country
to be badly administered, whilst, at the
same time, the accounts may be in good
order. On the other hand, it is impossible
for the statesman or financier to seriously
commence the work of fiscal and adminis-
trative reform until, by the organisation of
proper system of accounts, he is placed
in possession of the true facts connected
with the resources and expenditure of the
State. One of the principal reasons why the
early attempts made to regulate the financial
condition of Egypt failed, was that the ac-
counts were in a state of the utmost confu-
sion. Owing to the efforts of Sir Elwin and his
predecessor the Egyptian Accounts Department
was thoroughly well organised and it would
be difficult to exaggerate the importance of
this achievement. In the summer of 1889
Sir Edgar Vincent resigned the post of Fi-
nancial Adviser to the Egyptian Government
to go to Constantinople as the Governor of
the Imperial Ottoman Bank and Sir Elwin
Palmer was appointed to succeed him in
what was then and is still the corner-stone
of English influence inside the Egyptian Ad-
ministration. Sir Edgar Vincent left Egypt
too soon to see the complete vindication of
his financial policy, for during the six years
of his administration he had been vigorously
attacked as a juggler, who bad no real genius
for grappling with the difficulties of finance,
but only great skill in avoiding them. But
Sir Elwin prudently and ably continued Sir
Edgar’s system of administration, which has
since then produced such brilliant results.
In 1897 Sir Elwin was made a K. C. B. and in
1892 K.C.M.G. Iq September, 1898, he re-
igned his position as Financial Adviser and Sir
Eldon Gorst succeeded him. It is curious to
note that the late Sir Clinton Dawkins severed
his connection with the Finance Ministry
almost at the same time as did Sir Elwin and
both have died within a few months of one an
other. The reason of Sir Elwin’s retirement
from the service of the Egyptian Government
was because he was appointed Governor of the
National Bank of Egypt, which had been
founded in that year. Previous to his retire-
ment the Egyptian Government, acting on his
advice, had sold the Daira Sanieh for £6,250,000
to Sir Ernest Cassel and a group of capitalists.
The appointment of Sir Elwin Palmer to the
governorship of the National Bank, coinciding
with the disposal of the Daira Sanieh, caused
some comment, especially when it was reported
that the Government had in their possession a
report of Crookshank Pacha, which declare I
that the Daira was worth at the lowest com-
putation £10,000,000. This subject has been
revived in a, recent work on Egypt and Harari
Pacha made the following declaration to the
author in regard to Sir Elwin’s share in the
matter. In justice to the memory of Sir Elwin
we will reproduce what Harari Pacha said on
the subject of the Daira deal :—
The Financial Advisers have never made
use of their position for their personal profit
never, and Sir E. Palmer is the last man in the
world to do so. Only he left the Government
service to take up a brilliant position ; hence
the trouble. Palmer was poor, why should he
refuse such a good berth ? As to making him
self responsible for the sale of the Dairs, the
<cb n="3"></cb>
thing is ridiculous, for, powerful as the Finan-
cial Adviser may be, he can do nothing with-
out, on the one hand, the approval of the
Council of Ministers, and on the other, that of
Lord Cromer. The idea that Lord Cromer
would allow any suspicious deal whatever is so
absolutely impossible that one does not stop
even to consider it. The truth of the matter is,
that the thing was done with the complete ap-
proval of all the members of the Government
Egyptian and English. No one could foresee
that the estate would increase in value to such
an extent, and in so short a space of time.
£6 2'0,000 was considered a very good price
for the Daira,’ and, besides, the buyer said, ‘I 
relieve you of all the trouble, all the anxiety
all the expense which the estate has brought
you. On my part I shall do the best I can for
myself, and if at the finish of the business
there is a profit, we shall share equally in it.’
It must be admitted that the offer seemed a
good one, and one cannot blame the Adviser
who recommended it and had it approved by
the Ministers.”
Mr. Raphael Suares, the well-known banker,
has corroborated Harari Pacha’s statements
that Sir Elwin had no arrangement with Sir
Ernest Cassel. To the same author, here
marked : —‘‘The thing won’t hold water,” and
I can prove it. It was I, and not Ca°sel whom I
had only seen once in my life and with whom I
had had no business relations—it was I, I re-
peat, who obtained, first, the concession for
the founding of the National Bank and the
option of purchasing the‘Daira’ for £6,0 0,000.
Our house, Suares Brothers, not wishing to
supply all the capital necessary, I left for
London with the intention of offering a share
in the business to one of my friends. On the
boat, Mr. D., well-known in Egypt, advised me
to immediately see Cassel, who, he believed, was
anxious to enter into business relations with
Egypt. I took his advice. When I offered 50 per
cent. of the ‘Daira’ to Cassel he said: ‘I know
nothing about this class of business, what do
yon think it ought to yield ? I told him I
looked for a profit of something over £1,000 000,
when he said be would trust to me ; and the
affair was concluded. The concession for the
Bank seemed to please him more and he asked
who should place at the head. It was then
that I proposed Palmer, whose name, so well
known as Financial Adviser, was bound to
carry weight. You will see, therefore, that
there was absolutely no arrangement between
Sir E. Cassel and Sir E. Palmer.”
It must be confessed that Sir Elwin was a
very lucky man, and in both the high official
posts which he occupied in the Egyptian 
Government the pioneer work had been under-
taken by his predecessors. 
The Director-Generalship of Accounts was
his first office in Egypt, which Sir Gerald Fitz-
gerald had occupied from 1877 to 1885. Lord
Cromer remarked in the recent Report, “Of the
many Englishmen, who, by steady and unosten-
tations work, hare rendered good service to 
the cause of Egyptian reform, there are few to 
whom greater merit con be assigned than Sir 
Gerald Fitzgerald, who first took this difficult
task in hand, and who, by dint of untiring
industry and perseverance, overcame all the
obstacles which had to be encountered. Sir
Gerald Fitzgerald did not take much part in
the reforms themselves, but he performed work
which was indispensable to others if the reforms
were to be carried out.” During the years 1885-
1889 in which Sir Elwin occupied the post he
was enabled to initiate those reforms which
the industry of his predecessor had made
possible, and the same luck fell to him when
he was called upon to occupy the post of 
Financial Adviser. During the six years of his
predecessor’s. Sir Edgar Vincent’s, administra-
tion, the seed was sown and was steadily
ripening- which under Sir Elwin Palmer and
his successor yielded a bountiful harvest. “In
many cases,” Lord Milner declares in his monu-
mental work on Egypt “the reforms, which
have borne the richest fruit, were due directly
to Vincent’s initiative,” and he elsewhere re-
marks that “Vincent will always be remembered 
as the most gifted and one of the most ener-
getic of the little band of Englishmen who, 
under the presiding genius of Baring, rescued
the finances by restoring the prosperity of 
Egypt.” Sir Elwin for the second time found 
his path made easy for him. He was as lucky in
his career as a banker as he was as an official, for
the National Bank was launched at the psycho-
logical moment and was bound to be a success,
as was the Agricultural Bank, of which he was 
chosen President in 1902. Besides his banking
duties ha was greatly interested in many local
companies of various sorts. He appears to have
been esteemed by his fellow-directors for his
shrewdness and business like capacities, and
owing to the success of the many concerns he 
was interested in he was able to accumulate a 
large fortune in the few years that have followed
his retirement from the post of Financial
Adviser. Of all the Anglo-Egyptians who have
benefited by the progress of Egypt, Sir Elwin
was the foremost so far as wealth is concerned,
and he must have left a very considerable
estate. He could not be termed a popular man, 
and some of his business methods have been 
the subject of much criticism. Whether he 
administered the National Bank with that
scrupulous regard for financial "tone,” such as 
should characterise the conduct of a great State
Bank, it is not for us to decide. Criticism is
very easy in Egypt and it is only natural that
such a successful man as Sir Elwin was should
have some enemies. But nothing succeeds like
success, and nobody will venture to dispute
that Sir Ernest Cassel made a wise choice
when he selected Sir Elwin Palmer to guide
the fortunes of the great banking institution
which he has directed with such signal success.
The operations on the Bourse this morning
began as usual at 10 o’clock, when the Presi-
dent of the Corbeille, Mr. D. Caralli, pro-
nounced an eloquent discourse on the late
banker and proposed that business should be
suspended for half an hour as a sign of respect
for his memory.

The salary of the Governor of the National
Bank is £5,000 a year with residence equi-
talent to a rental allowance of £1,000 a year.
There are also many other perquisites such as
a box at the opera, etc.
Sir Elwin was insured in the New York Life
Insurance Company for £2,000. The insurance
was a 20 years endowment policy, expiring 
in next July.
The National Bank of Egypt both at Cairo
and Alexandria was closed to-day. The other
Cairo banks will close this afternoon at 3
o’clock.
There will be a memorial service this after-
noon at All Saints’ Church, Cairo.
The body is to be embalmed and taken to
England.
Among the orders, which the late financier
received were the Grand Cordons of the
Osmanieh and the Medjidieh.
Sir Elwin belonged to the St. James’s Club
in London.
His recreations, as given in “Who’s Who”
for 1906, are limited to golf and cycling.

SUDAN NOTES
(From our Correspondent).
El Obeld, Kondofan, Jan. 10.
Things are very quiet here at present, as
most of the officers, both civil and military,
are out	in their various districts collecting
taxes. etc. There is no polo going on,
am afraid we shall not he able to play again
until March or April, when some of the officers
return here from their districts. We are having
beautifully cool weather now, and the climate
here at this time of year is quite perfect. 

WALKER AND MEIMARACHI, LTD.
The new board of this company is now com-
posed of Messre, L. Carton de Wiart, Adolphe
Cattaoni, Montagu Summers, F.Z.S., F R G.S.,
J. E. Drower, W. A. Loning, and Mr. Con-
stantine Meimarachi, the managing director.
In regard to the acquisition of the new site
for this company’s business in Cairo, we think
it our duty to note a remarkable example of
the altruistic character of Mr. Constantine
Meimarachi’s dealings. This gentleman lately
purchased a site at the junction of Charia El
Manakh and Charia El Madabegh, in the
Ismailieh quarter of Cairo, at the price of
L.E. 72,247. The property is of an area of
4816.5 square metres, of a rectangular shape,
and through its central position in the Euro-
pean business and residential quarter, it un-
undoubtedly provides one of the finest and most
suitable sites in Cairo for the erection of the
new buildings. According to the report of Mr.
Henry Hinks (Messrs. Barclay Hinks & Co.,
Cairo), a member of the Surveyors Institn-
tion, London, dated the 16th January, 1906
the present value of this property is L.E.
96,330, or £20 per square metre. Now this
property was bought by Mr. Meimarachi in his
own name and he could, if he so wished,
have disposed of it to the company at a profit
to himself of £18 000. But he refused to take
advantage of this and with a noble disinte
restedness, which is very rare in Egypt, he has
disposed of it to the company without a mil-
lieme profit to himself. Such actions deserve to
be noted when they occur as an example of
high financial rectitude, and we take great
pleasure in making the Egyptian public ac-
quainted with Mr. Meimarachi’s altruism.

NILE-RED SEA RAILWAY.
SPEECHES TO THE NATIVES
BENEFITS OF THE NEW RAILWAY.
(From our Special Correspondent).
Port Sudan, Saturday, 12 p.m.
The excellent speech delivered by Lord
Cromer was translated into Hadendowa for the
benefit of the large crowds of natives present
by the Commandant of Police, and was received
with cheers.
Slatin Pacha’s speech to the natives con-
tained the following passages : "I do not
think any one of you is ignorant of the benefits
to be derived from this railway which has now
been established between here and Khartoum,
especially you merchants, who can perfectly
realise that to facilitate communications will
entail much progress in trade. The success
that will be attained by Suakin and Port
Sudan will open more markets and increase the
trade in both towns and will give the Arabs
a good opportunity to sell their animals,
batter, and milk at good prices.”
Slatin Pacha also pointed out the openings
there would be for labour and said that camel
owners could use their camels for agricultural
transport as in Egypt.
The peroration to Slatin Pacha’s speech was
as follows : The Government cannot offer you
fortune, but guards your property and will
protect you from aggression. The acquirement
of wealth depends on your ability and activity.
May God enlighten you and increase the fruits
of prosperity and progress. You must believe
in the Government’s good intentions and all
its endeavours for your welfare. It is your duty
to wish long life to Lord Cromer and the
Governor-General, who are responsible for the
administration of the country and ask God to
guide them to do good and benefit the Sudan.
Visit to the Harbour.
After the inaugural ceremony had been
concluded, a visit was paid to the works going
on in the harbour. Lord Cromer, accompanied
by the Governor-General, Sir Vincent Corbett,
Sir Randolf von Slatin, Inspector General,
Captain Phipps-Hornby, R. N., Colonel Mao-
Cracken, Commanding 2nd Bn. R. Berkshire
Regt., Major Hawker, Governor Red Sea
Province. Captain Kennedy R. E., Director
of Works, Mr. Higgins and Lieut. Kelly R. E.,
Resident Engineer, Port Sudan, were conveyed
by the narrow gauge railway along the eastern
arm of the harbour to inspect the works, as far
as the temporary quays.
At the landing stage of the temporary quay,
Lord Cromer and party were conveyed across
the harbour to the western side. From here
Lord Cromer, the Governor General, Sir 
Kennedy, R. E, and Lieut. Kelly, R. E. wre
conveyed by motor-car along the harbour to
the Point, and then to visit the walls, return-
ing via the hospital, and en route visiting the
town, to the Mess Buildings.
Afterwards the party returned to the landing
stage, and went round the harbour, visiting the
south-west arm, skirting the quarantine pro
montory, thence to the special landing stage,
Picket boats of H.M.S. Diana were in readi-
ness, the leading boat conveying Lord Croxer,
the Governor General, Sir Vincent Corbett.
Captain Phipps Hornby, R.N., Captain Ken-
nedy, R.E., and Major Hawker. On disembark-
ing, Lord Cromor and party rejoined the train,
and returned to the station enclosure.
The impression formed after the visit was
that Port Sudan was the cleanest and best laid
out town on the Red Sea, and that the progress
which has been achieved here during the last
nine months is simply amazing.
Lord Cromer, accompained by the Governor
General and the other members of the party,
on reaching the station, took train for Suakin
the Egyptian Artillery firing a salute of 21
guns as the train lift the station.
The British guard of honour and the officer
in command returned to Khartoum by the
same train.

Lord Cromer, on arriving here, made an
inspection of the condensors and afterwards
inspected the harbour on board the launch
Pioneer. His lordship afterwards left for the
Atbara. He will spend the night at Gebeit
(From our Special Correspondent)
Atbara, Sunday, 12.30 p.m.
Arrival at Atbara.
I have just arrived at Atbara after a most
interesting journey. I expect to arrive at
Khartoum about 5 p.m. Lord Cromer arrives
at Khartoum to-morrow. His lordship visited
Sinkat, the scene of Tewfik Bay’s gallant
defence in 1884, and slept at Gebeit.
At Suakin yesterday I was officially in-
formed that the Abou Hamed-Kareim v line
had been completed.
The Press party have been throughout
splendidly treated, and thanks are especially
due to Kaimakhm Owen Bey for his unfailing
kindness and energy on our behalf.


OPINION OF LONDON PRESS.
(Gazette's Special Service.)
London, Monday, Jan. 29.
All the London papers to-day contain enlo-
gistic articles regarding Lord Cromer, in con-
nection with the opening of the Nile-Red Sea
Railway, and are full of appreciation of the
work accomplished by Colonel Macaulay, con-
trasting the state of affairs in D 85 and in
1906. They point to the moral triumphs
achieved end look upon the Berber Railway
as one of the wonders of the modem world.

PERSONAL AND SOCIAL.
Mr. Machell’s brother-in-law, Count Glei-
chen, who celebrated his forty-third birthday
last week, is shortly leaving Berlin, where he
is Military Attache at the British Embassy, an
appointment he has held some time, and is
going to Washington in the same capacity.
Count Gleichen is a cousin of our King, and
his godson, hearing the same name, Albert
Edward. He is a keen soldier, has seen much
good service, and is a successful author, his
best known works being "With the Camel
Corps up the Nile” and "With the Mission
to Menelik.”
Mr. MacMillan, the American millionaire,
who has been such a frequent visitor of late to
Egypt, is now living in British East Africa at
the Juga farm, where he has all the comforts of
his Mayfair home. Mr.MacMillan’s farm, which
is at Donya Sabok, comprises all that the word
"Ideal” implies. The electric light, coupled
with an ice plant, and luxuries that only a great
city affords, have been brought to the gate of
the greatest game-shooting field in the world.
We are asked to state that, owing to Sir
Elwin Palmer’s death, Mrs. Dickson’s dance at
the National Bank on February 7 will not
take place.
When the Leicestershires were quartered at
Alexandria there was no more popular officer
than Captain the Hon. Harold Brooke Hawke.
The many friends he left in Egypt will therefore
he interested to learn of his engagement to
Anne, widow of Arthur J. J. Bamford, of
Misterton, Leicestershire.
The Chairman of the Daira Sanieh Company
is unfortunate in losing Bast Bradford, and
we venture to think East Bradford is unfortu-
nate in losing him. Sir Vincent Caillard is
a distinguished financier and clever business
man, and his presence in the House could
scarcely have resulted in anything but good.
Sir Vincent is also Chairman of the London
agency of the National Bank of Egypt and
has been a good deal besides, since the 23rd
of October, 1856. Then he was born, the son
of a judge, and a good judve, too, who married
the daughter of Lord Besoonfield's first
cousin, and sent the son of the marriage to
Etom, and "The Shop."
"The Shop" turned out a Pollock Gold
Medallist, who, thirty-one years ago, got his
commission in the Royal Engineers. Other
commissions, however, proved more attractive,
and Sir Vincent sat upon a good many of
mese. Then he took a torn with the Intelli-
gence Department daring the Egyptian Cam-
paign of 1882, the result of which was that
the Ottoman Public Debt Council acquired a
President, in 1883, and England, Holland and
Belgium a financial representative at "Cons-
tant.”
From that onerous office Sir Vincent retired
five or six years ago with all the honours and
some other medals, and the Grand Cordons of
the Osmanieh and the Medjidieh. Intermediat-
ely, he has been of the brotherhood of the
pen; and has written articles for other people’s
news-papers and reviews.

EGYPTIAN MINING.
The feature of the Egyptian Mining market
on the London Stock Exchange is a Bearsqneeze
which appears to have occurred in Nile Valley
shares. Heavy selling earlier in the week,
aided by anticipations that the company may
have to go through the throes of reconstruc-
tion, brought the shares down to about 5s.
But on Saturday week a distinct change came
over the scone. The attempt to take in shares
in connection with the settlement sufficed to
show that they were in exceedingly short sup-
ply, for the moment at any rate, and the price
left off at about 9s., rising about 50 per cent
during the morning as a result of the scramble
to obtain them.
The North Nile Valley is to suspend opera-
tions until the Nile Valley mine at Um
Garaiat is further developed. The directors of
the former company, whose property is only a
short distance away from Um Garaiat, intend
to be guided by the results obtained at depth
in the Nile Valley—a cautions and no doubt a
wise policy. The secretary of the Nile Valley
has issued a circular stating that it is hoped
to hold the annual meeting this month, and
adding that temporary arrangements have
been made for providing the company with
funds. In the report of the engineers mention
is made of the lack of labour, owing to the
religious festivals, but hope is expressed that a
fall complement of workers will very shortly
be again available.



VIOLIN RECITAL.
Many people flocked to Signor Arrigo
Serato’s violin recital, which took place at the
Savoy Hotel on Friday afternoon after having
been postponed from Wednesday evening. As
usual there was an extraordinary small percen-
tage of English among the audience, and we
regret to say that some of these seemed to have
mistaken the object of the entertainment, for
they chatted unconcernedly to each other
through several of the items. A certain amount
of disappointment was felt at the announce-
ment that the orchestral accompaniment was
not available, as advertised, bat this feeling
speedily wore off after Mme. M. Malateata had
taken her place at the piano. She is a perfor-
mer of no little note and her power of touch
and brilliancy of execution are rare in a
woman, while as an accompanist she keeps in
most perfect sympathy with her partner.
It was the first of Signor Serato’s concerts
this season, but he made known his name in
Cairo last year and the audience showed by
the warmth of their greeting what pleasant
recollections they held of his previous appear-
ances. It was an infinite pleasure to listen to
this great violinist. He succeeded in drawing a
beautiful tone from his violin, his renderings
were without exception fall of feeling, and the
certainty of his bowing and accomplished
technique excited general admiration. Signor
Serato is certainly one of the greatest violinists
of the present day and it must always be a
pleasure to listen to him. His great qualities
were especially evident in the concerto of
Weiniawsky, the Perpetunm Mobile of Ries,
and Jarnefeld’s Berceuse, and on the conclusion
of Bach’s air on the fourth string he was
accorded a perfect ovation, so enraptured was
his audience. The whole concert was indeed a
great success and we hope we shall hear Signor
Serato several times more this season.

PRE-EMPTION.
To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.
Sir,—Your correspondent “Capitalist” does
not seem to consider the position which his
proposal would create. The object intended
to be secured by the law of preemption was
what the English call the “amenities” of the
property, the privacy consonant with the
Moslem custom of secluding? women and like-
wise of getting rid of an obnoxious neighbour
by buying him out. Now suppose that two
Europeans or a native and a European have
contracted for the sale of property and that
the would-be pre emptor is a native, according
to the proposal of "Capitalist” the native
would be excluded from exercising his right.
Can “Capitalist” or anyone else tell me why
in the name of reason or equity the native
pre-emptor should be debarred from the exer-
cise of this right, because one of the parties
to the contract happens to be a European ?
If I might be allowed to offer a suggestion
I think that the difficulties raised by “Capital-
ist” can be got over, as they very often are,
by patting in the contract of sale, and there-
fore on the register, so high a price as would
preclude pre emption, which, it must be re-
membered, has to be exercised within six
months from date of sale. This practice would,
in such case, be of benefit to the Treasury
and cannot in any sense be considered as
“contra bonos mores,” seeing that, firstly, the
parties to the sale do not guarantee the
accuracy of the statement as to price, nor has
in reality anybody a right to enquire what
was the arrangement between two private in-
dividuals. Seeing that the Government has
reduced the tax on registration from five to
two per cent, the extra payment involved in
the pretended increase of price would fall but
lightly on the purchaser and can be regarded
in the nature of an insurance.

EGYPTIAN CIGARETTES.
THE YEAR’S EXPORTS.
The export of Egyptian cigarettes during
the past year shows a decided increase over the
previous year. In 1995 Egypt exported
cigarettes to the amount of kilos 702,813 as
against 620,470 in 1904, an increase of kilos
82,337. This is not, however, the same rate of
increase as was the total for 1901 over 1903.
when there was an increase of nearly 90,000
kilos over the latter year's exports. Germany
was Egypt’s biggest customer in 1905, taking
kilos 864,645, an increase of kilos 59,604.
England came next with kilos 93,485, am
increase of only kilos 1,715. Iu fact, England’s
consumption of Egyptian cigarettes remains
almost stationary and by a carious coincidence
the amount she took last year corresponded
exactly to a kilo with what she received in
1904, viz., kilos 96,485. The next largest
customer was British India and England’s other
Eastern possessions, which took kilos 74,364,
then Austria-Hungary with kilos 50,998, China
and the Far East with kilos 25,054,and France
with kilos 22,718.
