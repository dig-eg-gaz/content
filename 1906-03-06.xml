                    <head>ALEXANDRIA MUNICIPALITY</head>
                    <p>The Municipal election have come and gone without exciting much more interest
                        than usual. Small though the number of electors is once more a considerable
                        number of them have not taken the trouble to record their votes, and until
                        the inhabitants take a greater interest in their own affairs, it shoald not
                        astonish them that the result of Municipal labours is not much to their
                        liking. For some years past, after each election, we have tried to flatter
                        ourselves that changes have been made for the better, and that the result
                        will soon be apparent. We freely confess that we have usually been
                        disappointed, and not long since the cab strike, with its attendant
                        discomforts, gave evidence of some friction in the Municipal machine,
                        something similar to that which causes our tramcars to make the hideous
                        noise they do. This cab strike was brought about by the heavy hand of our
                        Municipal Councillors in the matter of taxation. It appears to us that they
                        do not take any trouble to fairly differentiate their taxes. For instance,
                        if P.T. 60 is a fair tax on a carriage with four iron-bound wheels and a
                        number, why should that same carriage have to pay P.T. 150 if its number is
                        taken off. and its wear and tear of municipal roads is much reduced by the
                        addition of rubber tyres? It is true perhaps that in the present state of
                        our roads a little more wear and tear is not of much consequence, still it
                        might be taken into consideration. Again, why should the light one-horse
                        numberless carriage pay the same rate as the much heavier two-horse
                        carriage? This is not so in other countries. It seems to be one of the
                        paradoxical conditions of Egypt that the less a carriage wears the road the
                        more it should pay. It is only too evident that the numberless carriage is
                        not generally an article "de luxe" and can hardly be expected to pay extra
                        on that score. The mention of rubber tyres naturally reminds us of meter
                        cars, and although these do not wear the roads much we hear that they are to
                        pay the not inconsiderable tax of L.E. 5 a year, whether big or small, so
                        long as they have four wheels. We cannot imagine any logical reason why the
                        modest voiturette of 4 or 5 horse power, going only at a moderate speed,
                        should be expected to pay as much as the ponderos, 30 or 40 horse-power
                        machine going at about 30 or 40 kilmetres an hour and covering everything
                        and everybody with dust. We reserve further details for a future occasion,
                        at present we only wish to show that if taxes are to be increased this
                        should be done in a more equitable manner.</p>
                    <p>To return to our re-constituted Municipality which will shortly begin its
                        labours for the general welfare of our town, we again venture to hope that
                        changes have been made for the better. We know that some of the
                        newly-elected members are good men. We hope they all are, and that they may
                        use their indience in the right way. The Municipality has much work ready to
                        its hand, and for the moment nothing more important than the allotment and
                        disposal of the largo area of land reclaimed by the new quay. The future
                        appearance of the important sea frontage of the town depends largely on the
                        way in which this is done. Now is the time for our Municipality to decide as
                        to what restrictions they will place on buildings intended to occupy so
                        important position in the town; if this occasion is lost, he effect might be
                        deplorable for all time. Not only should due care be given to appearance,
                        but what is equally important is that the land should, in preferance, be
                        sold to those who really intend to build on it at once, or within a
                        reasonable time. If this land is allowed to be bought up by speculators,
                        with a view to waiting until they can sell it again at some abnormal profit,
                        we may then give up all hope of ever seeing a proper sea frontage in our
                        time. If this land is well laid out and wisely disposed of, the Municipal
                        Councillors who may have influenced this work will have merited the thanks
                        of their fellow-citizens.</p>

                    <head>THE UPPER NILE.</head>
                    <p>Not for the first or the second time, says the "Globe," the Congo State
                        Government is seeking to establish a permanent military post on the Upper
                        Nile. It has no right whatever to occupy a single inch of territory adjacent
                        to the great river, the whole area being vested in England and Egypt
                        jointly. Now, however, that a Little England Government is in being at
                        Downing-street, it will be more difficult than ever to fence off the Nile
                        Valley from Congolese incarsions. The Sudan Government, after forcibly
                        remonstrating against the occupation of Inyelo by a Congolese armed party,
                        has resorted to the stoppage of Belgian supplies via the river. So far,
                        however, this boycott has not had any remedial effect ; the foreign force
                        still holds on at Inyelo, and as it is said to be adequately victualled,
                        arrangements most have been made beforehand for the dispatch of food
                        supplies and ammunition from the Congo State. In short, all indications
                        point to a deliberate design in this wholly unjustifiable trespass, and
                        there seems every likelihood that force will have to be employed to get rid
                        of the intruders. The entire Nile Valley, from the lakes to the
                        Mediterranean, must in any case be kept free from foreign intrusion, that
                        some sort of an "imperium in imperio" should gradually grow up above
                        Khartoum. We have always considered it was a grave mistake to have leased a
                        small area near Lado to Belgium.</p>

                        varying from 1.2in. to l.5in. Commercial experts valued it at about 5d, per
                        lb. Experiments are being continued in order to find the type of cotton most
                        likely to withstand the local conditions, but there are obstacles to any
                        great development of cotton in the Malay States, such as the difficulty of
                        obtaining labour. It is regarded as practically certain that the industry
                        would never repay European supervision, and indeed the Resident General
                        thinks there is little prospect of an established cotton industry at
                        all.</p>

                        <p>A great sensation has been created in America by a young Egyptian, who
                            calls himself Khaldah and claims occult powers. He recently gave
                            astonishing instances of acutal thought transference, or telepathy, at a
                            private residence at New York. Requesting a member of the party to write
                            several numbers and a name on paper, Khaldah asked this person to call
                            up a certain number on the telephone and to inquire what numbers and
                            what name were written on the paper. To the amazement of every one, the
                            person at the other end of the line told, without making a mistake, the
                            numbers and same written on the paper. This mysterious person at a
                            distance, Khaldah admitted, was a friend of his.</p>

                    <head>A CLEVER SWINDLER.</head>
                    <head>"BARON HERTENSTEIN."</head>
                    <head>HOW CAIRO TRADESMEN WERE "DONE."</head>
                    <p>A clever swindle was brought to light last Friday, when a supposed German,
                        who had given his name as Baron Hertenstein, left Shepheard's for an unknown
                        destination without paying his bill, after spending a week in one of that
                        famous hotel's best apartments. Shepheard's Hotel, however, has not been the
                        only place to suffer from the man's visit. There are but few firms in Cairo
                        who have not received large orders from the supposed "Baron," but none of
                        these have had their bills paid.</p>
                    <p>He figured prominently at the "Corso Masque" which was held at Ghezireh on
                        the 25th ult, when he gained the first prize of £30 for an excellently
                        decorated windmill car in which he sat disguised as a woman in a pink
                        domino. In front of the car was a broad green ribbon on which was written in
                        large gold letters "Mimi Gaillette, Chambre No. 116, Shepheard's," and he
                        issued many invitations to dinner at Shepheard's to the admiring men with
                        whom he gaily bandied words and exchanged showers of confetti. The design of
                        the car and his costume were of the costliest, and he had also ordered
                        another costume for the Ghezireh fancy-dress ball for which he owes a
                        considerable sum of money to one of Cairo's best-known dressmakers.</p>
                    <p>The "Baron" leaves at Shepheard's Hotel, in lieu of the price of his bill,
                        some ten pairs of boots, which was unpaid ; the Hotel de Suez holds a few
                        travelling trunks which he had ordered from Messrs. Davies Bryan, and
                        throughout his stay in Cairo he has ordered lavishly but paid for
                        nothing.</p>
                    <p>It is not known exactly how this swindler escaped from Cairo but it is
                        believed that on going to the station on Friday morning he had not
                        sufficient courage to face the crowd there, many of whom would know him, and
                        that he then drove to the Citadel, where he endeavoured to find a
                        camel-driver who would be willing to take him as far as Benha, where he
                        intended to take the train. In this he was unsuccessful and he then drove to
                        the Bristol Hotel and dismissed the carriage of Shepheard's Hotel, in which
                        he was driving, without payment. From there we have no trace of his
                        movements but it is believed that he got safely to Alexandria or Port Said
                        and embarked for a European port.</p>
                    <p>We understand that the police of the principal ports have been communicated
                        with by telegraph and it is hoped that he will be arrested at whatever port
                        he may disembark.</p>

                        <p>Port Said, Monday.</p>
                        <p>Quite a number of troopships have passed through here daring the last few
                            days. The Russian transports Malaya and Mercury, with together over
                            2,800 soldiers from Vladivostock, arrived on Monday, and left later for
                            Odessa.</p>
                        <p>Some French troops were on board the Admiral Latoucbe Freville ; and
                            subsequently, 700 Turkish soldiers, to reinforce Faizi Pache's army,
                            passed throngb on the Turkish transport Tsib.</p>
                        <p>Owing to the 2nd class cruiser Donegal, which arrived here on Tuesday
                            afternoon and proceeded shortly after on her way to the Far East, having
                            gone ashore off Tor, H.M.S. Minerva left here early on Saturday morning
                            to render assistance. As, however, the Donegal managed to get off the
                            Minerva received orders to come back and arrived here yesterday
                            afternoon.</p>
                        <p>The many people who paraded the town at carnival appeared to enjoy
                            themselves and certainly appeared some amusement. Those on foot had to
                            stand a good deal from the natives, and the latter had most of the fun.
                            Tbe more fortunate, who could afford the luxury of a "buggy," had a good
                            time but would have been better advised had they thrown more "oonfetti"
                            and less haricot beans. A money-changer in the Rue de Commerce got a
                            full charge, and has had his eye in a bandage ever since. Nothing is
                            perhaps more beneficial than genuine fan, bit some steps should be taken
                            to control people who cannot control themselves when out for a lark.
                            They should not be allowed to think that real fun consists in doing harm
                            to persons or property. Mardi Gras has come and gone, so we can do
                            nothing now but sympathise with the injured ; on future occasions,
                            however, the police should be instructed to prevent the throwing of
                            haricot beans, or other sorts of so-called oonfetti, that are likely to
                            cause injury.</p>

                        <p>THE RECONSTRUCTION SCHEME.</p>
                        <p>In view of the legal obstacle to the reconstruction proposal of the Nile
                            Valley Company the directors are formulating a new scheme without
                            exceptional provisions as regards any dissentient shareholders, who will
                            then have the usual right to be paid off at a valuation. We understand
                            that it is intended to call the meeting to consider the new scheme for
                            some date next week.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Justice Kekewich a few days ago, declined to sanction the
                            reconstruction scheme.</p>
                        <p>His Lordship, in giving judgment, said he could not see how the old
                            oompany or the liquidator could compel a shareholder to take shares in
                            the new company, whether it was his rateable proportion or not, and
                            imposing thereby a liability. Under this scheme an attempt was made to
                            get over that. Under this scheme those shareholders willing to accept
                            partly-paid shares in the new company could get them. Then came a
                            difficulty as to what was to be done with those who would not accept the
                            new shares. They could not be forced to accept them, and they were
                            entitled to their share of the assets of the company in their proper
                            proportion. It was proposed, under this scheme, if some of the
                            shareholders obstinately refused—and they were entitled to be obstinate
                            if they chose—to take the shares to the new company they were to have
                            something else. What was that something else? If the shares in the new
                            company were not taken up by the contributors to the old company they
                            were to be sold by the liquidator within a certain period. There seemed
                            no objection to a reasonable time limit, but the liquidator was to sell
                            not necessarily all at once, but to sell them as he could. At any rate,
                            he was to sell. If eventually they were sold for an "old song," they had
                            to go, as the shares had to be realised and the amount distributed after
                            deducting expenses among the shareholders dissenting from the
                            arrangement. That might prove extremely unfair to some of them, for some
                            of the shares might be sold at a good price, while the others sold for
                            an "old song.'' But those whose shares were sold for practically nothing
                            were to get the same portion as those whose shares had realised a high
                            price. That seemed to be unfair and unjust. Apart from that, however, it
                            seemed to be telling the dissenting shareholders that if they did not
                            come into the scheme they would only get a proportion, whatever it might
                            be, of the sale of these shares held by the dissentient shareholders.
                            But if they did come in they would have to accept the new shares with
                            their liability. That seemed unfair. It seemed that the scheme in
                            question took away what belonged to the shareholders. In the
                            circumstance he proposed to restrain the defendant company from carrying
                            out the agreement as it stood. How far it would succeed in another form
                            he could not say, but it was unacceptable as it was.</p>

                    <head>ON THE WANE.</head>
                    <p>TALK OF HOMEWARD JOURNEY.</p>
                    <p>A fortnight ago the season was in its zenith. Today one begins to feel that
                        all good things come to an end and that it will not be many weeks before
                        Cairo again sinks into its six months' sleep of summer. A certain number of
                        familiar figures will be no more seen after today, and the spirit of unrest
                        is in the air and many plans are being made for the return journey and for
                        other meetings in the future and under far different conditions.</p>
                    <p>Mrs Armstrong, who has been such an indefatigable hostess all winter at the
                        Savoy, is leaving today for England, and at the same time are leaving Mr.
                        Acton Adams and his attractive niece, Miss Collins, and also Mrs. Smart and
                        her daughter, who have both been so exceedingly popular daring their stay.
                        There will be a good many more departures before the middle of the month,
                        but it is to be hoped that the visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales
                        will induce the greater proportion of visitors to remain till April. The
                        Prince and Princess are expected on March 29, and their visit will last in
                        all probability for just under the week. Preparations are being made for
                        their reception at Abdeen Palace, and everything will be done to make their
                        stay a memorable one.</p>
                    <p>Four hundred dinners were served in the Savoy Hotel on Saturday night, but
                        nevertheless the ball-room was never uncomfortably hot. The big fancy-dress
                        ball at Ghezireh and the two private balls held last week probably exhausted
                        the energies of a good number of dancers and others were receiving
                        themselves for the fancy-dress ball at the Savoy this evening.</p>
                    <p>A most regrettable incident occurred at the dance on Saturday night when a
                        visitor chose to complain to the leader of the orcestra on the qaality of
                        the music and in the heat of the moment made use of language highly
                        uncomplimentary to M. Bracale and most unsuitable to the society in which he
                        found himself. Such contretemps are not always avoidable, but it is always a
                        matter of regret when a visitor, and presumably a gentlemen, so far forgets
                        himself in a public assembly.</p>

                        <head>KEHDIVIAL OPERA HOUSE.</head>
                        <p>"IRIS."</p>
                        <p>Iris is an opera which hardly repays the curosity that sends one to see
                            it. For music it gives the impression of a rechanffes of Tosca, with a
                            strong suspicion of Cavalleria now and again: it has about the same
                            place in music as patchouli in perfumes, a sustained, fictitious, and
                            wearisome attempt at emotion. The plot has some merit, and is
                            suggestive: that is hardly an excuse for the piece, as one naturally
                            assumes that a more than commonplace composer chooses something abnormal
                            to carry off other futilities. Still, per se, apart from all else, the
                            plot is worth word instead of the absurdly normal magazine story of
                            Madame Butterfly and such like eftusions, we have the idea, the absolute
                            ignorance of the Japanese child who cries over her bad dreams and broken
                            doll, who wails, like Melisande: all the lover can obtain from her is
                            'je ne suis pas heureuse." Her father's curse at the end frightens her,
                            she only realises that he is angry, and she throws herself down to her
                            death as a child would throw itself on the ground in tears ; and her
                            death-song is the longing for happiness of which she knows nothing, the
                            praise of the sun which she cannot see behind its cloud. There it a
                            faint touch of eternity in the story.</p>
                        <p>The interpretation was not much better or worse than that usually given
                            in the Khedivial Opera House. The principals were mostly good,
                            especially Iris herself and the tenor, who has a nice "timbre." The
                            staging ires good, and the chorus better than usual. But it is hardly a
                            piece to see twice what with the languid music which never means
                            anything, which wakes the listener with a start of momentary
                            expectation, only to find that the phrase has collapsed into yet another
                            wave of mediocrity. It is lukewarm, and Laodicean, and not worthy of the
                            story.</p>

                        <p>Princess Ena and her mother lunched with King Edward at the British
                            Embassy. His Majesty afterwards called on M. Faillieres and conversed
                            with him for half an hour. The President returned the visit immediately.
                            His Majesty gave a dinner in the Embassy in the evening at which M and
                            Madame Fallieres, M and Madame Reuter and a few others, including Baron
                            de Lource were present. The latter, after he has received by the Enperor
                            William at Copemigen, went to Berlin, where he again met the Emperor and
                            conferred with Count von Bulow. (See despatch of the 19th February).</p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
                        <p>Sir,—I think that all those who have visited Egypt during a good many
                            years past must agree in admiring the way in which the Post Office
                            usually carries out its work, a work which in this country must be beset
                            by special difficulties. Three languages, Arabic, French, (the official
                            tongue), and English (the dominant) are always to the fore. In the
                            winter what a congregation of visitors, speaking and receiving letters
                            written in many varieties of tongues! How we expect our letters to
                            follow us hither and thither and how well all this is managed! And how
                            exceedingly civil and helpful one finds the postmasters even in the most
                            out-of the-way places.</p>
                        <p>Now for the inevitable "but."</p>
                        <p>But, Sir, there is a thing which the post office professes to do and
                            does, in a way which leaves not a little to be desired. It professes to
                            convey and deliver to post offices of a certain degree money "in group,"
                            that is, a bag fall of cash. There are in Egypt but a very few towns. We
                            can almost count them on the fingers of our two hands, but the face of
                            the country is dotted over in all directions with villages. It is not
                            until you have been establishing work, and until you have to pay wages
                            regularly in small coin, that you realize how hard it often is to get
                            change even for a sovereign in these villages. Here, at El Kab, I an
                            about 10 miles from one post town, Edfu, and 20 from another, Esna. My
                            post office at Mahamid is naturally of the simplest and at our railway
                            station it is not infrequently difficult to get change for a sovereign.
                            I am forced to have silver and nickel from Cairo, "in group," which I
                            receive at Edfu. The mail train with its letters and parcels comes every
                            day, and offers all reasonable conveniences, I am but 18 hours post from
                            Cairo. But if a "group" is sent a complete change comes over the
                            scene.</p>
                        <p>In December last I sent to the Bank of Egypt for a "gronp" to be
                            delivered for me at Edfu. On the 20th the money was sent from Cairo, but
                            not until the 29th does it arrive at Edfu, to which place I send. From
                            the time I write (the 18th) to the time I receive is 12 days. Recently
                            it has taken from the 19th to the 25th February to send from Cairo to
                            Edfu—5 days. From the time 1 write till the time I receive 8 days. On
                            enquiry I am told that the money comes by train to Luxor, but at that
                            place the old and exploded post boat comes into operation. The group
                            must wait at Luxor until the next boat turns up and by that conveyance
                            it comes to Edfu although the railway station is just across the
                            river.—I am, etc, SOMERS CLARKE.</p>

                        <p>Dear Sir,—In two issues of the "Egyptian Gazette" I read about that
                            shameful act of the students stopping a lady, when she meant their
                            benefit, from speaking to them her opinion.</p>
                        <p>Certainly she has been led by her sympathies, saw it her duty, and so she
                            is obliged for human's sake to help them in, what we may say, their
                            critical position, in seeing the right way.</p>
                        <p>And, Sir, they have been unthankful and uncourteous to her most moral
                            help, and met her with what you term "conspuee et ex pulsee."</p>
                        <p>Please, Sir, do you think that any barbarian would do such an act, not an
                            Egyptian Student! We may be ignorant of the laws of etiquette, but we
                            are never unrespectful to ladies. Could you believe the thing then?</p>
                        <p>Certainly no, is it not most absurd? Who could believe it? None!</p>
                        <p>Then permit me, Sir, to say, it is an invention of a silly head who has
                            done much unjustice to the students, than the new regulations of the

                            especially in view of the growing importance of that locality owing to

                    <p>Colonel Marling, V.C., 10th Hussars, having vacated the command of that
                        regiment, the command has been given to a well known North Country officer,
                        Lieutenant-Colonel Pollok Morris, whilst the vacant majority has been filled
                        by this promotion of Captain Charles H. Leveson, presently employed with the
                        Egyptian Army. Major Leveson remains on promotion with the Egyptian Army. It
                        is over 16 years since he first joined the 18th, and he reached his late
                        rank just six years ago. He was employed with the West African Regiment,
                        1899-1901, and took up his present employment three years ago. He has had
                        considerable experience of active service, beginning with the Chitral Relief
                        Expedition (medal with clasp), to which he added two additional clasps for
                        the Tirah Expedition three years later. Whilst attached to the West Africa
                        Regiment, he saw service in Ashanti (medal with clasps) and in the winding
                        up of the Boer War he was with the 18th in the drives and operations in the
                        Transvaal, Orange River Colony, and along the Zululand borders of Natal, in
                        the course of which he was severely wounded (mentioned in despatches,
                        Queen's medal with four clasps).</p>
                    <p>Major H. D. A. Harkness, C.B., Welsh Regiment, who for a considerable period
                        was attached to the Egyptian Army, will shortly succeed Colonel Dickinson in
                        command of the 2nd Battalion at Quetta, Bombay. Major Harkness during his
                        service with the Khedive's troops participated in the Sudan operations of
                        1889, for which he received the medal, star, and 4th Class Osmanieh.</p>
                    <p>Lientenant P. R. Napier, Army Service Corps, who has been serving for some
                        time with the 54th Company, Portsmouth, has been placed unders orders to
                        join at Cairo in relief of Lieutenant Bleucowe, who has joined the Khedive's
                        Army. Lieutenant Napier originally was gazetted to the Scottish Rifles in
                        1899, and was transferred to the A.S.C. on the New Year's day of 1902. He
                        was with the Army Service Corps, as an attached officer, in the Transvaal
                        campaign, 1901-02 (Queen's medal with two clasps).</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant C. F. N. Bartlett, Royal Berkshire Regiment, recently doing duty
                        with the 2nd Battalion at Khartoum, has resigned his commission in that
                        regiment. Mr. Bartlett joined the Royal Berks, in April, 1900, from the 3rd
                        Battalion Oxfordshire Light Infantry, then embodied at Buttevant,
                        Ireland.</p>
                    <p>Orders have been issued for the infantry brigades on home service, from the
                        9th to the 14th, to receive the new short rifle and bandolier equipment.</p>
                    <p>In the near future the German naval superiority to France will become
                        conspicuous unless a special effort at once be made to counteract the
                        activity in German dock-yards. It is interesting to note that the world at
                        largo, and England in particular, cannot be indifferent to any marked
                        decline in the relative strength of the French navy. The prevent friendly
                        relations between France and England only slightly effect the question. All
                        such pleasant relations are liable to change, but the maintenance of the
                        balance of sea power affords a guarantee of European peace.</p>

                        <head>PROF. PETRIE'S THIRD LECTURE.</head>
                        <p>Prof. Flinders Petrie gave the third of his lectures on Egyptian Art at
                            the Continental Hotel, Cairo, yesterday afternoon. The subject was that
                            of the rise of the and it is of spontaneous growth. During the
                            prehistoric age art could hardly be said to there was no accurate
                            appreciation of such as there was in the prehistoric age of Europe. The
                            oldest figures of men that are known in thin country are two fighters,
                            rudely outlined on a vase, belonging to the first prehistoric age of
                            pottery. The most able work of the prehistoric people are some heads
                            carved on ivory tusks, which shew the type of that race, with tall
                            heads, long beards, and aquiline noses. The enormous change which came
                            in with the conquest by the dynastic race between 6000 and 500 B. C. is
                            a vary strong proof of the entry of a different race into the country.
                            The oldest example of their work, the rude figures of Koptos, have
                            spiritual figures of animals. The series of slate carvings which
                            commemorate the conquestt of the land are of admirable vigour. And one
                            of these bears the first piece of pure art known in Egypt : the graceful
                            figures of two long-necked gazelles, standing either side of a palm
                            tree, show the beginning of one of the best known designs of all ages,
                            the tree and two supporters. When we enter the historic times the
                            article taste and technical skill of the bracelets of the reign of king
                            Zer strike us with astonishment. The fine design, each entirely
                            different from the others, the freedom of work, and the perfection of
                            the soldering of the gold, all shew that the Egyptians had already a
                            mastery in jewellery as early as the beginning of the first dynasty.</p>
                        <p>The drawing of the pyramid period was rather hard but very accurate at
                            first; in the Vth and VIth dynasties it fell off. The earliest good
                            example is that of the well-known geese from Medum. The scenes in the
                            tomb of Ti at Sakkara are spirited; and the group of fighting boatmen in
                            the Cairo Museum shows how readily the artists could step outside of
                            conventions that were arising. An interesting series of subjects outside
                            of the usual line are the scenes of bargaining in a tomb. The sculpture
                            in the round was the principal artistic expression of the early kingdom.
                            Even before Menes there were large numbers of ivory figures carved and
                            one of the most subtle of those ivory carvings is that of an aged king
                            of about the period of Menes.</p>
                        <p>This shows how early the expression of character had been effected and
                            the accidents of surroundings subordinated to the feeling of the whole.
                            The reliefs of the wooden panels of Hesy show the result of round work
                            in the high projection and fine modelling of the figures. Beside this
                            work there was also a somewhat different school, which affected a more
                            archaic style, with staring eyes and a heavy expression, as the statue
                            of Mertiteps the queen of Seneferu at Leyden. The figures of Rahotep and
                            Nefart in the Cairo Museum show the rise of the noble style of the
                            pyramid builders. The character is carefully treated ; and the contrast
                            is well shown between the anxious and responsible expression of the
                            king's son, with the dignified and commanding style of the princess who
                            has always had her wishes obeyed. The statuette of Khufu, the builder of
                            the great pyramid, small as it is, shews extra ordinary power of
                            treatment. The grip and determination is unrivalled in any later work in
                            Egypt, or perhaps in the world. The dignified statue of Khafra, the
                            builder of the second pyramid, is on much the rame lines as the figure
                            of Khufu as regards the massive body, but the head is much more suave
                            and refined in its type. The work is perhaps the most exalted in style
                            that we know in Egypt, most remote from mere passion, and most nobly
                            shewing forth the beneficent autocrat, king and god of his country.</p>
                        <p>It was not only the great rulers who were thus immortalised, the lesser
                            officials also are shewn with their own characters and manners. The
                            well-known wooden statue has perhaps the greatest popularity, with his
                            bon hommis and business air. But the fellow figure of a woman is a
                            higher piece of art, with a mixture of impetuosity and shrewdness which
                            is extraordinarily life-like. A totally different character is seen in
                            the scribe figures. The scribe in the Louvre is the alert man of
                            business, the thinker of daily affairs, without ideals, but watchful to
                            every torn of fortune. The scribe in the Cairo Mnsenm is more
                            easy-going, but with the same observant ready air. The humble attendant
                            on his lord who kneels with folded hands, and obsequious face, in the
                            Cairo Museum is yet another different kind of man. And the low class
                            serving women grinding the corn in the Florence Museum shows the hard
                            working housewife, without any of the abilities of those already
                            noticed. The statue of a great noble Nenkhept-ka shows yet again the
                            high type of the able administrator, shrewd but kindly. All of those
                            figures impress us with the versatility and grasp of character shown by
                            the Egyptian artist. The work is nowhere copied from general types but
                            is intensely individual in expression and spontaneous in its nature.</p>
                        <p>The metal work was also highly developed. The fine gold hawk's head of
                            the VIth dynasty is wrought in a facile material. But the large upper
                            figures of Pepy and his son are triumph of expression, as life like as
                            some of the best Roman work. The technical difficulties of working the
                            metal by hammering vet with such truth and exactness, make us admire the
                            more the freedom and spirit of the artist. The view of the early and
                            best age of Egyptian art shows how it stands as perfect as any of the
                            other great schools of art, and superior to almost all others. It also
                            makes us feel how great was the declension to the better ages and how
                            the vulgar notion of it is infinitely below the grand and noble works of
                            the great age of this land.</p>

                            their enterprise in Eastern countries such as Turkey, it is in combent
                            on his Majesty's Government to take into serious consideration a change
                            in its present diplomatic and consular system in its relation to British
                            trade, and to improve and adapt it to modem exigencies."</p>
                        <p>This meeting proved of the greatest interest to all commercially
                            connected with the Near East. It has been a complaint of long standing
                            that British trade with the Balkans showed very little elasticity and
                            expansion, whereas the imports of other countries, especially Germany,
                            increased by leaps and bounds. The British Chamber of Commerce on
                            Constantinople, in various meetings, has laid the blame for this state
                            of affairs apon what they call an 'antiquated and inefficient Diplomatic
                            and Consular Service," whereas many impartial observers were of the
                            opinion that British manufacturers had done nothing, while the German
                            and other manufacturers had done everything to secure for themselves the
                            markets of the Balkans. Although frequently urged to do so British
                            manufactures and merchants have failed to make systematic and
                            concentrated efforts to win the Balkan market. In consequence British
                            trade in the Balkans has been pushed more and more into the background,
                            while other countries have superseded England's formerly dominant
                            position there.</p>

                        <p>An instruetive table is published by the "Manchester Guardian" showing in
                            thousands of pounds the amount of cotton yarn and twist exported from
                            Great Britain daring 1903, 1904 and 1905 respectively, with the average
                            value per pound for each of the countries. From this it appears Russia
                            is easily first in the quality of the yarns taken, the imports amounting
                            to 557,000 lbs. with an average value last year of 30 66d. per lb.,
                            while Egypt has the lowest average in the same year. viz, 8.59d. on a
                            total import of 4,381,000lbs. In 1904 Egypt imported 4,381,000lbs. with
                            an average value of 9.83d. and in 903 we received 4,590,000 with an
                            average of 8.06d.</p>

                        <head>ABYDOS III.</head>
                        <p>In the "Revuedel' Histoire des Religions" there is a review of Messrs.
                            Ayton and Correlly's publication 'Ahydos III.,' wherein M. G. Foucart
                            points out that their discovery of the funnerary chapel and stela of
                            Teta Shera c'ears up the mystery which has hither to hung over the
                            ancestry of Ashmes I, the founder of the glorious Eighteenth dynasty.
                            This king, who finally delivered his country from the role of the hated
                            Hyksos, was, according to M. Foncart, the son of Sequenenra the fierce
                            Sudani prince who first threw off the Hyksos yoke, by Aah-hetep who was
                            probably of the ancient royal blood of Egypt. Aah-hetep's mother was the
                            Teta Shera last mentioned, and by Sequene-ra she had Aahmes's
                            predecessor Kames, and by a subsequent husband the celebrated
                            Nefert-ari, whom Aahmes married. The great prominence and the divine
                            honours given in later Egyptian times to the queens of Aahmes's family,
                            and especially to Nefert-ari, lend much colour to M. Foncart's view.</p>

                            hours. After a spell of delightful weather, which continued till
                            yesterday morning, ominous clouds gathered and the wind rose, increasing
                            as the day advanced to the force of a strong gale. At night heavy gales
                            prevailed, the wind having the velocity of 90 kilmetres. The morning
                            opened dull and there was some heavy rain, with a moderate gale from
                            N.W. The barometer is now rising and warmer conditions should prevail
                            today.</p>

                        <p>Voici les principaux attendus et le dispositif du jugement rendu samedi
                            par la Chambre commerciale du Tribunal Mixte du Cairo declarant la
                            Societe des Sucreries en etat de faillite.</p>
                        <p>… Attendu que la Societe debitrice soutient qu'il y a une distinction a
                            faire entre la Societe, etre moral personnifant les actionnaires, et les
                            administrateurs ses representants ; qu'a l'appui elle expose qu'il
                            s'agit d'une societe anonyme composes de 325,000 actions, dont une tres
                            petite proportion aux mains des administrateurs et que personne
                            n'allegne la mauvaise foi des actionnaires qui, frappes de pertes
                            imprevues et impossibles a prevoir, sont par consequent des debiteurs
                            malheureux; qu'elle ajoute que les administrateurs mandataires de
                            l'assemblee generale, revocables a tout moment, ne peuvent etre
                            confondus avec les mandants ; qu'il importe pen que le mandat soit d'une
                            nature speciale, et a concurrence des actions qu'ils possedent et qu'on
                            ne saurait pretendre que si cette societe a ete trompee par ses
                            mandataires elle devient indigne du concordat preventif et subit ainsi
                            une veritable penalite ;</p>
                        <p>Attendu que les creanciers intervenants ont pris les memes conclusions en
                            ajoutant que le vrai debiteur est la societe, o'est-a-dire les
                            actionnaires ;</p>
                        <p>Attendu que ni la Societe ni les creanciers n'ont cite le texte d'un
                            auteur quelconque a l'appui de leur systeme de defense et que la
                            jurisprudence belge y est contraire……</p>

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>

                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These express steamer's have enormously powerful engines, and attain a very
                        high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having been specially
                        built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi. If you are going
                        straight through to England you will find the train waiting at Brindisi
                        which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete arrangements
                        for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in London on the
                        fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY</head>
                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at
                        Salsomaggiore.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San

                    <p>LOCARNO, may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty

                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>

                    <p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful excursions, those to the Rigi,
                        Pilatus, Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other
                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of

                        Railway, with delightful scenery en route. The ascent of Titlis, is made
                        from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps is grand; extending from Monte
                        Rosa to the Black Forest, and from the Santis to the Matterhorn.</p>

                        avenue of walnut trees the chief resort of visitors. Interlaken is also not
                        far from the famous waterfalls, Giessbach, Trummelbath and Staubbach. Then
                        also the glaciers of Grindelwald and view from Murren and the Schynige
