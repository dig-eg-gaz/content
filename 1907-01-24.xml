                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed
                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.
                        Najem Houry proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the
                        sea. Magnificent Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For

                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the
                        world. Also the tower or palace, the scene of “Othello'' and of Ford's
                        “Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus in the winter months is
                        delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                            caused by the clearing out of Kom el-Dik reservoir on Sunday, when the
                            inside received a cost of composition which is perfectly wholesome, and
                            is the same as that applied to new pipes, which sometimes cause a

                    <p>Cairo presented a particularly animated appearance this morning on the
                        occasion of the great Khedivial reception of Kourban Beyram.. Numbers of
                        officials from all parts of Egypt have arrived in the Capital in order to
                        pay their respects to his Highness, and all this morning the streets leading
                        to Abdeen Palace were filled with crowds of magnificently caparisoned
                        personages of all degrees of rank.</p>
                    <p>The Kourban Beyram prayers were attended by the Khedive at Koubbeh mosque and
                        a salvo of twenty one guns heralded his Highness's departure from the
                        Mosque. Shortly before 8 o'clock the Khedive drove up to Abdeen, and the
                        reception began a quarter of an hour afterwards with the arrival of the
                        ulems. The reception continued throughout the mroning. The large attendance
                        at this morning's reception was an eloquent testimony to his Highness's
                        popularity. The Khedive, who looked in the best of health, received
                        all-comers with his usual graciousness.</p>
                    <p>The Khedivah also held a reception this morning at Abdeen Palace from 9 to 11
                        30 o'clock, which was numerously attended by the Princesses of the Khedivial
                        family and native ladies. Her Highness will also hold a reception from 3 to
                        4 30 o'clock this afternoon for the ladies of the Diplomatic Corps and other
                        European ladies. </p>

                    <p>The S.S. Eosom, which was ashore in the Cnanal, was inflicted, and traffic
                        was free again yesterday morning after a stoppage of about 20 hours. While
                        the Epsom was ashore, a tug, having in tow a barge laden with stones,
                        attempted to pass her, and owing to the strong S.W. wind the barge struck
                        the steamer's canal rudder and sank, fortunately on the side of the canal.
                        To-day traffic was again stopped for the operations to lift the sunken
                        craft, but was clear again about 1 p.m.</p>

                    <p>WHO REVEALED ITS EXISTENCE</p>
                    <p>We are informed that the person who discovered the plot of the three Russian
                        revolutionaires to blow up a steamer in Alexandria harbour, was a member of
                        the secret police, David Markovitch by name, a Russian Jew, who has been for
                        many years in Egypt. He was formely employed as a cigarette-maker by the
                        "Khedive" Cigarette Company. Afterwards he entered the service of the
                        Egyptian Hafis, and from his knowledge of Russian was of great use in
                        watching the movements of Russian arrivals. It was he who, according to the
                        Russian Jews, informed the Russian Consulate of the alleged plot. Markovitch
                        was married twice and has a family resident in Moharrem Bey. Fearing
                        reprisals, he has fled to Port Said. It is said that he came orginally from
                        Odess, but for many years he had lived at Alexandria, where he was known to
                        have anarchistic tendencies.</p>
                    <p>A meeting of Socialists was held at the Nouveates Theatre Cairo, yesterday on
                        behalf of the three Russian prisoners. Vigorous resolutions were passed, and
                        a demand for British intervention on behalf of the accused was, we
                        understand, sent to the British Agency. We hear that Lord Cromer has since
                        replied to this numerous other petitions that have reached him, but the
                        tenour of the replies has not been publisehd.</p>
                    <p>In Cairo all is quiet at present, but there is an uneasy feeling that we have
                        not seen the last of the manifestations.</p>

                    <head>A MEMORIAL.</head>
                    <p>The following is the substance of a memorial presented yesterday morning by
                        Maltres Rossi and Chalom, spokesman of the manifestations, to SIr Malcolm
                        Mellwraith and addresed to the Minister of Justice, Ibrahim Fuad Fasha,
                        relative to the case of the three Russians. Acopy was also sent to the
                        Khedive. The delegates afterwards called on Lord Cromer who promised to
                        examine their petition. It is stated however, that his Lordship gave the
                        delegates to understand that the Egyptian Government does not share their
                        views.</p>
                    <p>After briefly recapitulating the recent events, the memorial
                        reads:-"Extra-territoriality in the lands of the Capitulations does not
                        extent to political crimes. If the Russo Turkish Treaty of 1774, which has
                        here to be specially considered, does not contian the distinctions made in
                        favour of such crimes, that was only afterwards introduced by the progess of
                        the science of international law; it has enver the less experienced, in
                        practice, at a later period an essential modification inspired by new
                        principles that motived the memorable fefussal of Turkey in 1849 to
                        extradite to Russia and Austria Russian and Hungarian refugees. If,
                        therefore, the Egyptain Government is bound by no treaty to deliver up a
                        person accused of a political crime, such extradition would constitute a
                        free act of soverignty which it could carry out only after it had qualified
                        the crime alleged."</p>
                    <p>The delegates therefore call for a judicial enquiry to determine the
                        existence and nature of the act attributed to the three Russians. Moreover,
                        according to the memorial, the Russo-Turkish Treaty of July 21, 1774 leaves
                        of another the choice of their immediate delivery or expelling the,. The
                        subscribers to this petition therefore pray the Egyptian Government to
                        decide upon the expulsion of the Russians to appease the public
                        conscience.</p>

                    <p>Sheriffs Zenah bint Soy Samuel Murghani, wife of Sayid Guafer el Murghani,
                        died here on the 11th inst, a few days after giving birth to a child. Both
                        being descendants of the Prophet Mohamed, the Sayed did not think it right
                        to allow a doctor to see his wife even while he knew that she was dying.
                        Suakin is now in mourning for 14 days and the population will not feast

                    <p>Upon the hearing of an application for discharge yesterday week by Mr. Cecili
                        Shrager, a partner in the firm of Messrs. Shrager Brothers, formely trading
                        as merchants in London, also at Calcutta, Alexandria, Singapore, Colombo,
                        and elsewhere, it appeared from the trustee's report that the total
                        liabilities of which he had been notified would amount to 153,252 that the
                        assets had realised or would realise 5,533,12s., and that a dividend of not
                        more than 2s in the pound would be paid to the creditors. The failure
                        occurred in November, 1905 and was attributed to shortage in the jute crop
                        and to the withdraw. The discharge was suspended for three years from June
                        13 last, when the applicant's examination was concluded.</p>

                    <head>K.S.C. SECOND WINTER MEETING</head>
                    <p>Unfortunately a cold biting wind prevented many people from attending the
                        first day of this meething y sterlay. The weather was much more typical of
                        England than Egypt, and it is to be hoped that we shall have a change soon.
                        The attendance was dissappointing, but those who came were rewarded with
                        some good racing. Once race especially, the Century Stakes, was worth going
                        a long way to see; it is the best race we have seen this year, and Shour
                        proves himself on this form about the best horse in Egypt, giving over a
                        stonoe and a beating to Abou Nadara, and carrying same wights and defeating
                        Roi de l'Air,- a splendid performance. Tridall had a nsaty fall in the Grand

                        Punch, who is generally a very safe jumper clean overjumped himself. The
                        course was in excellent condition. The new jockey standd was a useful, but
                        at present not ornamental improvement. The Pari-Mutual did big business,

                        looked bery like winning, but Frour Frou (late Bulkeley) caught him at the
                        turn for home, and in spite of Fields losing ground at the turn, he won by

                        <p>A strike of music-hall artistes and employes has taken place. This is due

                        <head>THE "EGYPTIAN STANDARD." EXTRAORDINARY STORY.</head>
                        <p>No newspaper has ever been launced in Egypt, about which there has been
                            so much discussion as the "Egyptian Standard." Even in America the Press
                            is full of the strangrest tales about the incubation of the organ of
                            <persName>Mustapha Pacha Kamel</persName>. As a specimen o the world-wide interest taken in
                            the "Patriots" latest journalistic venture we may cite the following
                            from a Roumanian correspondent of the "New York American." The news that
                            the King of the Belgians is concerned in the paper will add a new
                            interest to our contemporary, when it does appear. It will be remembered
                            that the Pasha paid some visits to Brussels in the summer. Our
                            contemporary's Brails correspondent writes:- </p>
                        <p>"With reference to your disclosures about King Leopold's corruptive
                            crusade in the Unites States, of which I have received small cable
                            extracts, I beg to infrom you of an analgous propaganda by King Leopold
                            in Egypt against the British cooperation. </p>
                        <p>"A certain Egyptian Prince. <persName>Mustafa Kamel Pasha</persName>, apparently made a
                            donation of 500,000 francs ($100,000) to launch in Cairo an anti English
                            paper in French and English, and it appears that the real donor is in
                            reality King Leopold, while Mustafa Kamel Pasha is only the straw man. </p>
                        <p>"If the United States Government will not take prompt and vigorous action
                            against King Leopold, I should not be surprised that very soon as native
                            anti-American proganda shall be on foot in the Phillipines."</p>

                    <head>MONTGAGES IN EGYPT. AN INTERESTING REPORT</head>
                    <p>We have received comparatively recently an extract from the report of the
                        Belgian Consulate dealing with the various facts and phases connected with
                        the past and present state of mortgages and mortgage debts in this country
                        (Recueil Consulaire de Belgiqae. Annie 1906, Tome 136).</p>
                    <p>The part treating of the mortgage debt has been compiled by Dr. Alfred Bid,
                        and it is obvious that in its compilation the author has taken infinite
                        pains in collecting the various figures and statistics and in arranging them
                        in a clear and concise manner, with the result that notwithstanding the
                        somewhat severely statistical appearance ot the work the brochure must prove
                        of the greatest interest to all who feel a real concern in the welfare and
                        prosperity of the country. As the author explains in his introduction, the
                        collection of the figures and statistics showing the total amount of the
                        mortgage debt of the country at any given moment is not so simple a matter
                        as might be supposed. To ths average individual it would epje*r a i task of
                        no great difficulty. All mortgages, he ' will argue, are registered
                        compulsorily at one of the three greffaa at Cairo, Alexandria, and
                        Mansonrah, and the official publication ot jibe** in »he annual report of
                        the Ministry ot Jastioe should give all the reqnired information. But
                        nnfortnnately in the annual report thsre is merely made known the number of
                        entries in the registers and no aooonot is taken of mortgages that are
                        extiogni«hed, of sums annually amortised, or even of the actual area of the
                        property mortgaged.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Eid therefore has made personal enquiries, and in giving us his results
                        he divides his work into the four parts into which it naturally falls: 1.
                        The fixing of the amount of mortgage debt; 2. A brief account of its past
                        and present state and an analysis of the factors that have led to its
                        increase; 3.  Its bearing on the economic situation and on the future of
                        Egypt; 4. His conclusions after a brief comparison with the principal
                        countries in Europe. </p>
                    <p>And we for our part cannot do better than give a brief resume of the results
                        of his labour and research. In the first place it becomes necessary to
                        separate and keep separate the amount of the mortgage debt properly so
                        called from the amounts remaining owing on land sold on the instalment
                        system (ventes a terme) where the vendor retains a lien on the land until
                        fully paid. And further, the mortgage debt properly so called must be
                        subdivided into two classes, (1) that contracted with banks and mortgage
                        companies or institutions de credit foncier and (2) that contracted with
                        private individuals or private companies: for in the former subdivision the
                        publication of annual balance-sheets and accoutns makes it simple to trace
                        the mortgage operations, wheareas in the latter they remain largely a matter
                        of conjecture or at best approximation. Three public banks and mortgage
                        companies, of each of which Dr. Eid gives us a brief history amount in his
                        estimation to five namely, Le Credit Foncier Egyptien, the Land and Mortgage
                        Companyt of Egypt, la Caisse Hypothecaire d'Egypte the Land Bank, and last
                        but by no means least, the Agricultural Bank of Egypt. Of these, the Credit
                        Foncier is the oldest and most important, having a capital of L.E. 7,715,000
                        of which one-half is now called up, and a debenture capital of L.E.
                        15,189,685. Up to the 1st January, 1906, it had advancced on loan L.E.
                        11,139,913 of which sum over halt at that date had been paid off, and it was
                        to the Credit Foncier Egyptien that the Daira Sanieh granted the right to
                        collect the moneys due on the centes a terme of its properties amounting in
                        all to L.E. 8,000,000. The next in age is the Land Bank of Egypt was only
                        started in 1905, but its total resources at the 31st December last reached
                        the figure of nearly L.E. 2,000,000. Lastly, the Agricultural Bank of Egypt
                        deserves and obtains a special mention, being as it is a quasi-official
                        undertaking sided by a guarantee of a 3% dividend and by the concession of
                        other privilege from the Government. Founded in 1902 it has now a capital in
                        shares anda debentrues of over L.E. 6,00,000. This is employed in loans of
                        amounts varying from L.E. 1- to L.E. 500 to the small agriculturist on the
                        usual mortgage terms or in advances varying from P.T. 50 to L.E. 20 on the
                        guraantee of his crop. WIth the introduction of this institution a heavy
                        blow was dealt at the excessive usury practised up till 1902 by the village
                        money lenders whose wealth increased in proportion as that of the fellaheen
                        decreased: for the poorer and more straightened the position of the fellah
                        the higher the rate on the money which he was forced by stress of
                        circumstances to borrow from these notorious Shylocks.</p>
                    <p>Disregarding the balance sheet for 1903, saying that it included seven months
                        of 1902 and counted in loans transferred from the parent stem, the National
                        Bank of Egypt, in the year 1904, roughly speaking, 50,000 loans were
                        granted, amounting to nearlyt L.E. 2,000,000 making the averagew amount of a
                        loan L.E. 40, and in 19095 58,432 loans were granted at an average of L.E.
                        42 per loand amounting to L.E. 2,459,987, as against 1991 loans, at an
                        average amount of L.E. 3,690 amounting to L.E. 7,421,488, advanced by the
                        other four "etablissements de credit foncier". So a very cursory examination
                        of these figures will show the difference in the class of clients seeking
                        the aid fo the Agricultural Bank and of those requesting advances from the
                        other four institutions.</p>
                    <p>A table of statistics that Dr. Eid gives us here shows the increase of the
                        mortgage debt of the country since 1901 and proves that dsince that date,
                        withoiut taking the loans of the Agricultural Bank into consideration, the
                        mortgages have increased from about L.E. 5,000,000 in amount to over L.E.
                        20,000,000 and from 2,840 in number to 5,219 that is to say, have doubled in
                        number and quadrupled in amount.</p>

                    <head>THE ANNALS OF ISLAM.</head>
                    <p>Towards the close of the sixth century Western Asia and the greater part of
                        Europe were divided between Rome and Persia. The Roman Empire, seated at
                        Byzantium had recently undergone the great revival of the earlier years of
                        Justinian's reign, followed by the equally important but as yet unnoticed
                        decadence that resulted from the Emperor's efforts to recapture the Western
                        portions of his dominions, whereby he brought the rich Eastern provinces to
                        the verge of ruin. The Persian Empier, splendid as it still as to the
                        outward eyes had been rocked to its foundations by the Mazlakite schism, and
                        had been obliged to stretch its military resources to the utmost in the
                        effort to guard its northern frontiers against the white Hans. Morever,
                        Greeks and Persians alike were weakened by the disastours internecine wars
                        which they waged ceaselessly upon each other. Justinian died in 565
                        surviving by a few months only the most famous of his generals, Belissarius;
                        Narses, the other distinguisehd military leader of the reign, died in 567;
                        Chosroe Nushirwan, the last great figure in the annals of the Sassanian
                        Emperors of Persia in 579. It was as though Destiny had cleared the decks of
                        the world for action, knowing that the time was ripe, for the Prophet of
                        Islam was born at Meccain in the year 470 Tradition has been busy with the
                        signs and portents that accompanied his birth and surrounded his early
                        years, but of historic facts none have been preserved, not even his true
                        name, that of Mohamed being probably a cognomen. We know only that he was an
                        orpham, a member of the merchant tribe of Qurayah (though, indeed, critical
                        examination shows the links in the chain of his lineage to be singularly
                        untrustworthy), brought up in the house of his grandfater, and as little
                        considered by the busy society of traders and pilgrims that surrounded himi
                        as he would have been in Byzantiu or Ctesiphou, if the news of his existence
                        could have reached those two capitals of civilisation. He died at the age of
                        sixty-two having laid the foundations of a new Empire as wide embracing as
                        either of those which he found, and more durable than either.</p>
                    <p>It is the story of this achievement, together with the history of the
                        Mohamedan Empire for nine hundred years, until the overthrow of the Mameluke
                        Sultans of Egypt by the Turks in 1517, that Prince Tesno has set himself to
                        write,- a colossal task if it is to be accomplished with the same minute
                        care that he has expanded upon the first volume. He permits no aspect of his
                        subject-social, moral, political, or religious- to escape him; he
                        intersperses his chronological record with critical notes which show great
                        learning and sound judgment, and with long digressions in which he weighs
                        cause and result and sums up the general bearing of the events which he
                        relates. His toil is lightened by the fact that he can draw upon the labours
                        of famous Orientalists who have, in the past fifty years, covered the ground
                        with chich he now deals, but he does not spare himself the toruble of
                        examining anew the texts upon which their work was founded, and he brings to
                        the study of his authorities, both ancient and moderm, an acute criticism
                        combined with the true historic sense. Such a book as this (the first volume
                        racs to seven hundred and forty large quarto pages, and we are promised
                        eleven volumes more) may not be read consecutively by a wide audience; but
                        the conclusions at which the author arrives will help to form the verdict of
                        students upon one of the most astonishing phenomena in the world's history,
                        the birth and power of Islam. It is a phenomenon which enters largely into
                        our own problems of governmentm and therefore the successive volumes of
                        Prince Tesno's book will be of great interest to us. By throwing the light
                        of the past upon the difficulties of the present he may clear the way to the
                        solution of many doubtful points, and lay bare the origin and strength of
                        many a force with which we still have to contend.</p>
                    <p>The figure of Mohamed is like a touchstone upon which to test the insight of
                        historians. Few views are sufficiently comprehensive. If Mohamed did not
                        find a martyr's end, it was not because the spirit to meet such a solution
                        was lacking. There can be no doubt of his sincerity during the early years
                        of his mission; the chapters of the Koran revealed at Mecca before the
                        Flight are good and sufficeinet evidence. WIth an ardent eloquence and an
                        admirable simplicity, he preached during these years of obscurity and
                        struggle the religion of the one true God. He wa not occupied with the
                        posistion of His rasul, His prophet; it was a role that it had not occurred
                        to him to assume. Nor was he concerned with kingdoms of this world; conquest
                        by arms was an idea that had not entered his mind. He was but the mouthpiece
                        of the Divine Spirit, calling upon his own tribe, and upon any other Arab
                        tribe whom he could induce to lilstem to relinquish the worship of stocks
                        and stones and lift their eyes to that which was eternal. From what source
                        Mohamed drew his conception of divine unity is a question of the deepest
                        signifigance Jews and Christians were both to be found at Mecca; from them,
                        and particularly from the Jews he must have learnt. He grasped the main idea
                        of both faiths, monotheism and that was enough. Perhaps, as Prince Teano
                        points out, if the Qurayeh had listened to him he would have been content to
                        go no further; it was their obstinate refusal that forceed him into the
                        wider field, and turned Islam into a world-religion. Hiss life was not in
                        danger at Mecca; according to Arab custom, he was under the protection of
                        powerful members of his own family, and his murder would have brought the
                        perils of blood-feud about the ears of those who had laid hands on him. But
                        he and his small band of followers were exposed to constant annoyance, and
                        the faith made no progess. It was at this moment that the intolerable
                        confusion that reigned at Median induced the inhabitatnts of that city to
                        look round for some means of restoring order. During their pilgrimage to the
                        shrine at Mecca they heard Mohamed's preaching, they observed the
                        organisation and the spirit of obedience that ruled among his converts, they
                        elected him as a political leader, and adopted in large numbers his
                        religion. </p>
                    <p>Prince Teano gives us in this volume the history of the first six years at
                        Medina. We see Mohamed, by force of circumstance changed into a statesman a
                        lawgiver a leader of armies courting favour coursting success by every means
                        known to statecraft, his personal authority growing day by day, and with it
                        his estimation of himself, until we find him no longer preaching the
                        religion of God, but that of Mohamed, the Propjhet of God, He met with
                        opposition in plenty,- from the rich Jewish colony, whom he tried at first
                        to mollify, and then turned upon in a very passion of pitiless revenge; from
                        the Quaryah who led strong and sometimes successful armies into the field
                        against him. But there was no real union between the forces of his enemies.
                        The Jews hated the Arabs, and the Arabs hated each other, as they do to this
                        day, and one by one the Prophet triumphed over them all. </p>
                    <p>The Prophet's hold uupon the personal devotion of his followers never
                        weakened, and wiser still to bear in mind Prince Teano's prfound reflection
                        that it is easier to die a saint at the stake than upon a throne. "The
                        figure of Mohamed," says he, "loses in beauty, but it gains in strength; all
                        the process of evolution which his spirit traversed has a quite peculiar
                        interest, for possibly no man before or after him had a life like his. He
                        began his career when he had already reached the age of forty as an honest a
                        sincere preacher, fightning in the name of a great truth, not for his own
                        material interests, but for the moral interests of the society in which he
                        lived. He died the absolute and supreme head of a theocratic Empire, founder
                        of a militant religion which laid claim to the dominion of the world; both
                        these results were direct products of his moral and intellectual
                        vigour."</p>
                    <p>Mohamed, then, was much more than the prophet of a new creed; he was the
                        creator of a social entity of which his countnryment had had no conception.
                        He welded the Arab tribes into a nation,- a nation of warriors who subdued
                        half Asia, a nation of rulers who founded capitals in Mesopotamia and in
                        Spain where the torch of learning burnt through the darkness of the early
                        Middle Ages. It may be that Prince Teano is right, when he says that to the
                        Arabs the political aspect of Islam was more important than the religious,
                        and that it was the subject-peoples, reft of all hope of wordly supremacy
                        and by nature inclined to metaphysical speculationm who developed the
                        doctrinal side of Mohamed's teaching. His empire, which he had first
                        conceived as being one of the spirit, passed after his death through all the
                        phases of mundane greatness and decline, and has ended as a powerful moral
                        force, governing the thoughts and acts of men very different from one
                        another in race but united by the bond of the faith. How strong that union
                        is, and whether it could again be given the vital spark of common political
                        purpose, are questions that present themselves continually, in these days of
                        Pan-Islamism, for our practical consideration.</p>

                    <head>MR. ROBERTSON M.P.</head>
                    <p>Mr. Robertson's visit still continues to occupy the attention and fill the
                        columns of our local contemporaries; to such extent, indeed that as the
                        following controv ray shows, they are using him as the innocuous shuttlecock
                        o a plemical battledore. Lorth as we are to join in the game, we cannot
                        refrain from gently rebuking the rather too forcible language employed by
                        "Al Minbar" in its retort to the "Mokattam." Says "Al Mokattam:" "We have
                        been asked why we say nothing about Mr. Robertson while the other papers,
                        and especially those of the Opposition, do not fail to record his least
                        doings and sayings. Our reply is that Mr. Robertson's goings and comings do
                        not concern us at all. THere are a number of English tourists in Egypt just
                        now who are far more important than him, socially, scientifically, and
                        politically; there are also others who have infinitely more influence in
                        their own country and yet for all that we have never thought to record their
                        words and acts. The fact of other newspapers concerning themselves there
                        with does not necessarily imply that we are obliged to do the same. True, we
                        visited and interviewed Mr. Robertson in London. It was to know his opinion
                        on the Denishwai affairs. The Opposition papers had made such a lot of noise
                        about his name, that we thought it our duty to report to our readers his own
                        statements."</p>
                    <p>To this "Al Minbar" retorts: It is a lie; a pure invention. Mr. Robertson at
                        first refused to be interviewed, and then to be led by a man of no
                        importance in Egypt (e.g., Drz Fair Nimr, of the "Mokattam"); this man is
                        niether Egyptian nor English; he is a salaried interloper. After the
                        proposals he had made and the refuasal he received he has the audacity to
                        declare that Mrs. Robertson does not worry him abit. To conclude, we inform
                        this interloper that Mr. Robertson does not pretend to expel the English
                        from Egypt, nor to upset the world, that the Egyptians who associate with
                        him do not believe or hope so. We respect him because he sees that it is not
                        to the interest of his own country to govern by fear and violence."</p>

                    <p>As the ordered civilisation which it has been our privilege introduce into
                        modern Eygpt is extended and more southwaeds "fax into the remote Sudan" it
                        becomes more necessary that the forces which have been instrumental in
                        planting that civilistaiton in those parts should be enlarged. Progress has
                        been made by means of the Army; and the Army, now of the fine national
                        standard that is led by British officers, is extending its operations into
                        all those parts of the Sudan where the last of the insurgents have taken
                        refuge, as did the Findari and Mahratta chiefs after the great campaigns of
                        Marquees Hastings in India. The cost of maintaining peace is not excessive;
                        but it grows heavier as the circle of operations enlarges; the Egyptian War
                        Budget for 1907; as announced by the "Times" Cairo correspondent, shows an
                        increase of nearly 130,000. It cannot be said that this is extravagant, when
                        we consider the work that is done for it. The earliest frontier outposts
                        were of little use since the garrison two years ago represented but one
                        soldier for three hundred square miles of territory. Against Arab and
                        Dervish raids, such puny defences could do nothing effectual, especially
                        since the mountainous haunts of the plunderers were almost unknown to
                        Europeans, and a system of terrorism was hung over the heads of the luckless
                        wretches who might have been tempted to betray them. The Dongola and White
                        Nile provinces are now at peace: in Eout-East Kordofan, however in the wild
                        districts even more remote, and in the Babr-el Ghazal, there is still much
                        to be done. But when it is remembered that ten years ago the battle of Omdun
                        man was not yet fought, there will be few associations of slackeness
                        levelled at the Egyptain Army. ("The Globe")</p>

                    <p>The Samos Question is one that is likely sooner or later to attact European
                        attention, and particularly Great Britain, thorugh whose good offices it was
                        that in 1840 the island was granted its autonomy. Faction, however, the
                        canker of Greek political life, has checked the progress of the isle, and
                        more than once led to riot in which blooshed occurred.</p>
                    <p>Recently, as the result of the attack of the Soufouli party the Bey, Janko
                        Effindi Bithyonos, tendered his resignation. He was succeeded by Prince
                        Constantine Caratheodory, brother of the celbrate Ottoman statesman who
                        signed the Treaty of Berlin; but clever diplomatist as he is there is no
                        knowin gwhen his time for going may come. THus far the torubles of the isle
                        have been strictly internecine, but a recnt affair in which Greeka and
                        Turkish toops were killed has compellled the Porte, as the Suznair, to
                        interfere in the Principality's affairs, much to the annoyance of the
                        Samians. With a view to restoring and guaranteeing order the Porte has
                        signified to the Constitutional Assembly its intentiono of appointing a
                        Turkish military governor to Samos. To this the islanders have as a man
                        objected and a strongly worded protest so we understand has been sent to
                        Constantinople on the subject. It is probable that Great Britain may
                        intervene, in the event of a revolt.</p>

                    <p>“ ‘How pale and bloodless she looks’ was the expression I often heard as I
                        passed through the streets,” said Mrs. Annie Preston, who when interviewed
                        at 26, Wellington street, Stott Hill, Bradford, recalled the time of intense
                        suffering that darkened her existence yet to day Mrs. Preston is well, happy
                        and ective, and for this restoration she gives every credit to Dr. Williams’
                        Pink Pills.</p>
                    <p>"As a girl,: she said, "I was always-pale and delicate, so muchh so that when
                        in company I became quite ashamed of my deathly pallor</p>
                    <p>“But this was not my worst trouble. My eyes became sunken and glassy, my gums
                        white, and my tongue discoloured. Then I lost all vitality and strength; my
                        breath was short and painful.</p>
                    <p>Stabbing Pains of Indigestion</p>
                    <p>attacked me in the chest after every meal until eventually I dreaded the
                        sight or smell of food even such simple diet as bread and butter produced a
                        distressing fulness, followed by a lurking sensation.</p>
                    <p>“My head was racked with pains across my forehead, and my right grew dim;
                        many times during the day I felt a reeling sensation overcome me.</p>
                    <p>‘My whole body became weak and languid and the slightest exertion excited
                        pain. My deep at night was broken, and in the morning I would rise feeling
                        dead tired and unfit for anythin. Breakfast was always left untouched except
                        perhaps a cup of tea.</p>
                    <p>‘All interest in life disappeared, and anemia so ravaged my system that I
                        really </p>
                    <p>Looked years older than I was.</p>
                    <p>My nerves became unstung, and my hands tumbled so violently that I could not
                        hold a tea cup.</p>
                    <p>“If I went upstairs I was attacked by cruel palpitation of the heart and loss
                        of breath, and felt so puffed out that I frequently collapsed and remained
                        there until assistance came.</p>
                    <p>“So seriously did these symptoms develop that at last I was red iced to a
                        skeleton, and inked like a girl in the last stages of commotion.</p>
                    <p>“It was only when I was verging on despair that my mother insisted tha*. I
                        should try Dr. Williams Pink Pills. I began them, and after a time I could
                        tell that slowly but surely a marvelous change was coming over me. When I
                        had emptied ths third box I even began to take a little solid food, which I
                        digested readily. Then I found my strength was being built up rapidly I
                        regained my height my origin spirits and lost my haggard appearauoe. I
                        continued to mend, and in two mouths felt</p>
                    <p>Quits Myself Again.</p>
                    <p>with my nerves so strong that I always felt well. Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
                        for Pale People dispersed all traces of anemia with the terrible
                        palpitations and feeling of utter exhaustion ; more than that they built up
                        my health and strength until 1 became as hearty and active as you see me
                        now.”</p>
                    <p>Destitute of Good Red Bloodd— that is the one trouble that stands betwoen
                        thousands of sufferers and the possesion of splendid health. Dr. Williams
                        Pink Pills for Pale People actually make Rich new blood, and in that way
                        cure all the disorders that arise from too little or bad blood. In both
                        sexes they have cured not only anemia but General Weakness, idigestion,
                        Eczema, Rhenmaism, Sciatics, Neuralgia, St. Vitus’ Dance, Paralysis; in
                        ladies special ailments they are invaluable. Sold by all dealers, but see

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                    <head>SWITZERLAND.</head>
                    <p>Switzerland, the heart of Europe, has been described as "A cluster of
                        delights and grandeurs."</p>
                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M. de Caprino.and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO, may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town, situated at the top of lake Maggiore has a mild climate and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, “Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and ‘Tho Flight into Egypt,” by Bramantion.</p>
                    <p>LUCERNE—A striking picture on the Lake of Lucerne facing the Rigi and Pilatus
                        and the snow-clad Alps.</p>
                    <p>In and around the town the walks are charming, and the excursions to be made
                        from Lucerne by boat, rail, etc., are very numerous.</p>
                    <p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful excursions, those to the Rigi,
                        Pilatus, Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other
                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
