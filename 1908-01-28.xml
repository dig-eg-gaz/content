                    <head>ELECTIONS IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>The recent elections for the General As- sembly and the Lgislative Council
                        have been far more keenly watched than on any previous occasion. Jt appears
                        that this increase in interest was due tu the various political parties, who
                        have lately appeared in Egypt, and were eager (0 secure thé election of
                        their own candidates. The only exception to this general interest was at
                        Helouan where everybody forgot the date of the election and nobody conse
                        quently voted. The recent elections have once more shown the necessity for
                        reforming the representative machinery. Lord Cromer was of this opinion and
                        in his last report (Egypt, N° 1, 1907’, p. 28,) he says :—</p>
                    <p>“As regards the elected members both of the Council and of the Assembly, it
                        is obvions that, under the existing system, the question of how far they are
                        really representative ot Egyptian public opinion depends io a great degree
                        on the interest taken in the election of the Delegates (‘Electeurs
                        Délégués”). Lord Dofferin’s fundamental idea was to free the fellaheen from
                        the power of the village Sheikhs, whom he regarded as the “inveterate
                        oppressors” of the people. ‘The community,” he wrote, should be at least
                        given a free choice of the person with wh0m the suffrage of the hamlet is to
                        be deposited.” The conception was statesmanlike, but its realization
                        involved the possession by the mass of the voters of qualities to which they
                        have not yet attained. In Egypt, village politics centre on the affairs of
                        the village. The number of those who take an interest ia events outside this
                        narrow circle is very limited. Asa general rule either the Omdeh of the
                        village, or some rival who aspires to he Omdeh, is elected to act as
                        Delegate on behalf of the community. I should add that, althongh I am far
                        from saying that there is no further room for improvement, at the same time
                        the village authorities are now under much more effective control than was
                        the case in Lord Dofferin'’s time. The objections to intrusting them with
                        the suffrages of their villages have, therefore, diminished.”</p>
                    <p>The advantages of abolishing the present system and of having direct
                        representation are obvious. It would lead to for greater interest being
                        taken by the pnblic in the elections, would foster a sense of responsibility
                        as yet unknown and aid more than anything else the political education of

                        <p>A few days ago a large consignment of Roumanian cattle arrived at
                            Alexandria from Constanza, and after passing the usual time in
                            quarantine they were despatched to the Cairo slaughter honses under a

                            very good price at Cairo The importers of these cattle, who have the
                            animals sent on by the AngloRoumanian Company, are not at all satisfied
                            with the first cousignment and it the next two or three consignments are
                            not better, they will send their own buyers from England or Egypt to

                    <p>CAIRO MIXED TRIBUNAL</p>
                    <p>SOCIETE EGYPTIENNE DE PUBLICITE v. CAFFARI'S CO-OPERATIVE MARKETS</p>
                    <p>This case is of interest in view of certain rumours which are being
                        circulated as to the financial position of the defendant company. It
                        appeared that a contract had been made between Mr. J. B. Caffari and the
                        plaintiffs, in February 1907, by which the latter were</p>
                    <p>to receive £ 280 for advertising the pros. I pectus of the defendant company
                        then in course of formation, and the question for decision was whether Mr.
                        Caffari had contracted on his own behalf or as agent for the company. Me.
                        Fatica sought to show that his clients the defendants were not liable as the
                        company was not then in existence, and objected to the seizures of his
                        clients' property in August last by M.M. Spezzeropoulo and Koression. The
                        Court however found that the company was in fact 'born' before the date of
                        the transaction, and that Mr. Caffari acted on its behalf, and condemned
                        defendants to pay the amount claimed together with costs, and fees amounting
                        to L.E. 4. Tne saisiearrêts of August 21, 1907, were converted into
                        saisie-excentoires. A notable comment was evoked by or request that the
                        hearing of one of to day's cases should be deferred. In reference to the
                        dilatory tactics of Egyptian litigants and their legal advisers Judge Tuck
                        observed that out of 39 cases down for hearing last Wednesday only one was
                        pleaded, the others being renvoyés for one reason or another Counsel, he
                        added, take longer to ex plain their reasons for delay than is occupied by
                        the actual hearing of the cases. On counsel's origin that his case would
                        only occupy 2 minutes, the President replied that it could not be pleaded in
                        so short a time, and Me. Bacum (for the other side) could not resist adding
                        "especially in the case of my learned friend" whereupon he was rebuked, amid
                        laughter.</p>
                    <p>THE GHORBAL CASE.</p>
                    <p> On Saturday last the case brought by the Helouan Development Company Limited
                        Against the Egyptian Land and General Trust Limited and the group, who
                        purchased the Gborbal Estate from the latter company and sold it to the
                        Helouan Company, was down for hearing before the Alexandria Mixed Civil
                        Court. The hearing was adjourned until the 8th February</p>
                    <p>"The Ghorbal Estate at Alexandria was sold by the Egyptian Land and General
                        Trust Limited a group consisting of Messrs. Rossano, Bondi, Fumaroli Riches
                        and Co., and Kamel Bey Teymour for LE 130.000. This group paid L.E. 500.000
                        down and were to pay the remainder in three instalments of L E. 26,769 each
                        on May 24th, and November 24th, 1907. and May 24th, 1908. Meanwhile the
                        group sold the estate to the Helouan Development Company Limited, with the
                        instalments to be paid by the Helouan Development Company to the Egyptian
                        Land and General Trust. The Helouan Development Company paid one of the
                        instalments last May and in November asked for time to be granted for the
                        payment of the other instalment. The Helouan Development Company at the same
                        time made various offers, which were not accepted. The Helouan Development
                        Company, within one day within the year of the expiration of their contract,
                        went to law and objected to the measurements of the land, which was the
                        subject of the sale, demanded back the money that had been paid and asked
                        the court to grant that the contract should be resisted.</p>
                    <p>SOCIETE DES CONCERTS</p>
                    <p>The Société des Concerts showed what they really could do on Sunday. The
                        Dvorak New World symphony was a revelation in the hands of Mr. Marsick. The
                        full sonority of the orchestra was revealed, every least phrase was given
                        its full significance, every effect and every point made. It is a great
                        symphony The strange beauty of the first movement, its theme taken up by one
                        instrument after another, and woven into the fine many-coloured texture of
                        the whole, the delicacy, and calm breadth of the largo, the perfect scherzo,
                        and the finale with its superb minor phrase beating and cleav. ing its path
                        through a mass of splendid sound,</p>
                    <p>—these in the hands of a master give a striking impression,--the strange pain
                        of old Hangary wondering at the confusion and din of the New Continent.</p>
                    <p>The César Franck - Redemption' was impressive, it had certain fine depths,
                        and a melodious solemnity of its own, but there was throughout the
                        suggestion of some want of cohesion, as it were an organist following his
                        own thoughts as they came alone, in some dark church, beautiful but chaotic.
                        Mme Baron sang Saint-Saëns La Cloche and a Handel, not without charm and
                        skill.</p>
                    <p>There the concert--quả concert-ended. W. were treated to a weird parody of
                        the 'Café Egyptien, as one hears it, passing swiftly in a cab, &amp;
                        symphony of misdirected platitudes. A listener near me suggested it as an
                        effort to describe a day at the home for lost dogs. It is the work of one M.
                        Charpentier and is, I hear, played at times in France, but M. Marsick was
                        overheard on his way out, to describe it as 'une soie' ! -I understand the
                        reason-pot excuse :-for its appearance was the refusal of the orchestra to
                        play any. thing else as a final piece, and the reluctance of the committee
                        to repeat any one of the 1-infinitely preferable--items that bad figured in
                        former concerts. Yet it seems a pity to have indulged the orchestra, and
                        wasted M. Marsick's and our time and patience on what almost served to
                        obliterate the impression of I the whole of the rest of the concert,</p>

                    <p>SAVOY HOTEL</p>
                    <p>As might have been foretold, the dance at the Savoy on Saturday night was by
                        far the most crowded one of the present season, and as brilliant a spectacle
                        as can be witnessed at any European capital. Every table available in the
                        dining room and restaurant was occupied, and it was hardly possible to dance
                        with any degree of comfort during the first half of the programme. Beautiful
                        women and beautiful toilettes were to be seen on every side: the newcomers
                        being so numerous that any attempt to chronicle them is impossible; and it
                        would be far easier to mention those who were absent than those who were
                        present.</p>
                    <p>The Princess de Teado retired from the scene at a fairly early hour, but she
                        was present among the dinner party given by Sir Ernest Cassel which also
                        included Baroness Schey, Count Berchem, Baron von Spiege, Mr. Webb Mr. and
                        Mrs. Jacob Sobiff, Mr Paget, Count Leyder, Mrs. Wilfred Ashley, General
                        Thorneyssen Pasba, Birch Pasba, Mr. Rowlatt, and Mr. Hamilton. Guests of

                        Oppenheim, Captain and Mrs. Schreiber, Captain and Mrs Dunbar, Count and

                        Gaiffier d'Hestroy, and Mr. de Martino.</p>
                    <p>Miss Cochrane's party included Major and Mrs. Freger, Major and Mrs. Knight,
                        Mrs. and Miss Fitz Clarence, Colonel Aylmer, Miss Balfe, Mr. Cyye, Mr.
                        Tollemache, and Mr. Orred. Mme Sursock bad a party of eight, Mr and Mrs.
                        Percy one of ten, Mrs. Hunting Powell had six at her table, that of Mrs.
                        Laffary held the same number. Mrs. Scott Dalgleish, Mrs. Ezchaley, Mr and
                        Mrs. Converse were also among the hosts and hostesses of the evening: no
                        less than sixty tables being occupied by the various people who were
                        present.</p>
                    <p>As for those who attended the ball, they included all the best known
                        residents who are usually to be found at the Savoy on dance nights, very
                        nearly all those staying in the house and the greater proportion of those
                        staying in Ghezireh Palace and the other well known hotels. Small wonder
                        then that we cannot keep a record of either individuals or their garments,
                        as they fitted by in such hopeless numbers. Of the few impressions which
                        still remain distinct was the lovely frock worn by Miss York, a filmy grey
                        chiffon veiling an under diess of pink, with tiny tight sleeves of steel
                        network outlining the upper arm; and the gorgeous white cotton robe of Mme
                        Jacques Cattaui with its clinging girdle caught high at the back with an
                        enormous cabochon emerald. Miss Barnes Lawrence was wearing if we remember
                        rightly &amp; satin frock lightly draped with pink</p>
                    <p>TRAMWAY WIRE BREAKAGE</p>
                    <p>One of the overhead wires of the Cairo Tramway Company fused this morning in
                        the Sharia el Boulac opposite the Egyptian State Telegraph office, and
                        burning for a few moments with extraordinary brilliance, the wires parted
                        and fell to the ground, one of them narrowly missing a passer by. A few
                        minutes later a private carriage drove up and the horse coming into contact
                        with the wires was killed instantly. A large crowd immediately began to
                        collect, and it was only by the efforts of one or two men to whom the danger
                        was apparent many of these were prevented from sharing the fate of the
                        horse, or at the least being subjected to a nasty shock, for the solitary
                        policeman who had arrived when the crowd began to collect evidently knew
                        nothing at all of the disaster which would overtake any one who was
                        unfortunate enough to touch the wire. It is only due to bim to remark,
                        however, that as soon as the danger was pointed out to him he exerted
                        himself in trying to keep the people clear. The other naked end of the wire
                        was left entirely unguarded. Apparently not more than one policeman could be
                        spared in the town. Officers made their appearance but the fact that an
                        exposed enit of charged wire was lying on the pavement some dozen yards
                        further up the street apparently passed unnoticed, and those who among the
                        crowds, were ignorant of the danger, have only luck to thank that they
                        escaped it, for not the slightest attempt was made to either warn or
                        safeguard the public by the persons responsible for the safety. And not only
                        were the police guilty of unpardonable negligence in the matter, but we
                        would also like to know what excuse the tramway company can offer for having
                        continued to allow a powerful current of electricity to run through the
                        fallen wires for fully twenty minutes after they were advised of the
                        accident. We trust that the affair will be enquired into by the two
                        departments concerned. The utter incompetence of the police force to deal
                        with this matter was a revelation indeed, or perhaps we should say that the
                        revelation lay in the inability of the force to supply sufficient men at a
                        critical moment for the men on the spot acted with energy, though these
                        efforts were somewhat misapplied. The loss of the horse was of course
                        unfortunate but the blame for this can hardly be laid at anyone's door, for
                        it occurred within a few moments of the breaking of the wires. The absence
                        of a sufficient force of police to keep the crowds off and the delay of the
                        tramway company in cutting off the current are matters however which will
                        need a deal of explaining away.</p>

                    <p>"I PESCATORI DI PERLE.”</p>
                    <p>Of the five operas composed by Biset during his all too short career, for he
                        died at the early age of 37, "Les pecheurs des perles” was one of his latest
                        efforts, and was first produced at the Paris Opera House in 1863, where it
                        was fairly well received, although it has never been what could be
                        considered a popular opera; this may in some degree perhaps be accounted for
                        from the fact that there are only four principals in the cast ; these
                        however have an abundance of opportunities throughout the opera, and the
                        choruses are quite up to the standard of those occurring in his masterpiece,
                        and last composition, "Carmen," which was produced some twelve years later.
                        The plot contains nothing of extraordinary interest, being one of the
                        familial stories of love and the natural attendant jealousy.</p>
                    <p>The scene of the opera, laid in the beautiful island of Ceylon, lends itself
                        to gorgeous stage settings and this was folly taken advantage of in last
                        evening's production. The costuming of the chorus, however, left very great
                        room for improvement. Egyptian headdresses and pink tights are scarcely
                        likely to be favoured by the dusky residents of Ceylon. The ballet costumes
                        were exceedingly becoming, but why again the pink tights and the very, very,
                        pale faces. These possibly small defects detracted some what from the
                        general success of the production, more especially as the principals' make
                        ups were very Indian indeed.</p>
                    <p>For the principals we have nothing but praise, Signorina G. Finzi Magrini
                        gave, 29 she always does, a conscientious interpretation of her role,
                        "Leila," on whom most of the hard work devolves, and she was very capably
                        supported by Signor Narciso Del Ry as Nadir. Signor Oreste Benedetti
                        appeared to great advantage as Purga, and Signor Francesco in the small role
                        of Nurabad, made an excellent impression. The orchestra in the hands of

                    <p>The Clayton system is a great improvement on the hitherto existing methods,
                        owing to its simplicity, effectiveness and economy, and we trust it may

                            working in complete harmony in the direction of ensuring greater

                            the war of extermination among the Christians in Macedonia and commented
                            on the failure of the Turkish authorities to protect them against

                    <head>EGYPT'S VISITORS.</head>
                    <p>MR. HALL CAINE</p>
                    <p>A London contemporar; in announcing the departure of Mr. Hall Caine for Egypt
                        says : -</p>
                    <p>The principal object of his visit is to gather further material for A new
                        novel and a new play.</p>
                    <p>"To help me to write a novel and a play which I have been trying to work upon
                        for some time," be said, "I am going back to Egypt for a little more study
                        of that fascinating and inexhaustible country, which is, I think, at this
                        moment more important to the nations in general and to England in particular
                        than any other part of the world."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Caine, who visited Egypt last year, will be away three or four months,
                        dividing his time between Cairo, the centre of Lord Cromer's administration,
                        and Khartoum, the scene of Gordon's martyrdom."</p>
                    <p>The above is not quite exact. Mr. Hall Caine left Cairo yesterday for
                        Khartoum where he expects to stay about a week. He will probably be back in
                        Cairo in three weeks and stay on another two or three weeks in Cairo. His
                        new book and play will be of startling interest to Egypt and the most
                        earnest and dramatic of all Hall Caine's works. He has made a most profound
                        study of his subject.</p>
                    <p>EARL AND COUNTESS OF SEFTON.</p>
                    <p>While the daily papers at home are still reporting that the Earl and Countess
                        of Sefton are leaving England "very shortly" for Egypt, they are in reality
                        well on their way up the Blue Nile, en route for Abyssinia, having spent
                        Christmas at the Palace, Khartoum, as the guests of the Sirdar and Lady
                        Wingate. The object of their expedition to the land of the Negus is sport,
                        and they are accompanied by a well known Highland sportsman, Major the Hop.
                        Hugh Fraser of Lovat. Major Fraser, who is in the Scots Guards, has for
                        several years been seconded as adjutant of the Lovat Sconts, com nanded by
                        his brother but he has now vacated that appointment, and has since been
                        doing duty with his regiment at Aldershot.</p>
                    <p>Lord Sefton himself, who will be seven and thirty next month, was formerly in
                        the 2nd Lite Guards, and a keen soldier, but retired from the Service in
                        order to look after the family estates when his elder brother was invalided
                        for life by a terrible accident in the hunting-tield. He has the love of
                        sport, which is characteristic of the Molyneuxes, and the present Prime
                        Minister appointed him Master of the Horse when he came into office, but
                        political differences with the Government obliged him to resign the office
                        last year. When at home at Croxteth Park, his big ugly house in South
                        Lancashire, he hunts regularly with the Cheshire packs. His friends know him
                        as "Obby," an inharmonious abbreviation of his pretty Christian name of
                        Osbert. Lady Setton was Lady Helena Bridgeman, third of the four daughters
                        of the Earl and Countess of Brad tord.</p>

                    <p>Fir (Joseph West Ridgeway P.C, GCMG. K.C.B., KCSI, etc. etc., who is staying
                        with Lady Ridgeway at Ghezireh Palace, has had innumerable honours showered
                        upon him at various times during his long and distinguished career. Born in
                        1844, he entered the Indian Army seventeen years later: he served in the
                        Afghan war of 1879, and was under secretary to the Government of India in
                        the Foreign Department between the years 1880-84. The following year he was
                        appointed Commissioner on the frontier question between Russia and
                        Afghanistan ; in 1886 he was sent on special duty to St. Petersburg. For his
                        services on the Afghan frontier commission he received the thanks of the
                        Viceroy and the English Government, and in consideration of his
                        distinguished services he was promoted Colonel in 1887. That same year he
                        was appointed under secretary for Ireland. In 1892 he was sent as Envoy
                        Extraordinary to the Sultan of Morocco : on his return he became Governor to
                        the Isle of Man. From 1895-1903 he was Governor of Ceylon, and in 1906 he
                        acted as chairman of the committee on the Constitution of the Transvaal and
                        Orange River Colonies.</p>

                        <p>To the EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                        <p>Sir,--On Sunday afternoon I had the unique experience of watching the
                            total destruction of &amp; sailing vessel from the windows of the
                            Windsor Hotel. About midday the vessel was sighted first making for the
                            Eastern Harbour, apparently without control owing to the tremendous
                            force of the burriacpe blowing. The flag of distress was then flying
                            from the ship. The Captain, finding himself in a most dan gerous
                            position, dropped his anchor to prevent running ashore. The cable,
                            however, parted almost immediately afterwards. Apparently on recognising
                            that position was hopeless, the boat was lowered and the vessel was left
                            to her tate. The onlookers, who had gathered on the quay to witness the
                            tragic spectacle, had their interest transferred to the ill-fated crew.
                            The little boat seemed to have small chance of reaching a landing place.
                            Exposed to the fall fory of the awful gale, buffeted and harled hither
                            and thither by the gigantic waves, she was ever and again quite lost to
                            sight amidst the mountainous seas.</p>
                        <p>It was impossible to conceive a more barrow ing spectacle, especially as
                            we were all conscious of our utter helplessness to render any
                            assistance. However, fortune favours the brave fellows, who were at last
                            landed safe and sound on shore, but in a very exhausted state I have no
                            need to enter into any further details of this incident, but what I want
                            to refer to is the complete lack of any lite boat service in Alex
                            andria, although it is the Mediterranean port, which ranks after
                            Marseilles and Genoa. For hours the ship, which eventually dashed itself
                            to pieces against the rocks of the headland of Fort Silsileh, had
                            hoisted the flag of distress. Yet nothing was done by the Ports and
                            Lights Administration nor by the Coastguards Service to render the
                            slightest assistance. In my humble opinion had a powerful tug come to
                            her aid, even an hour and a half after the first signal of distress was
                            hoisted, she might have been easily saved Doubtless the Ports and Lights
                            Administration is too much occupied with her internal scandals to care
                            about the lives of a few seamen, but when I consider that the Director
                            Generalship of that Administration has been in the hands of an
                            Englishman for many years past, I am almost ashamed to disclose my
                            nationality by signing myself.</p>

                        <p>Sir. - I don't know who is responsible for the disgraceful neglect of not
                            providing a lite-boat for the port of this city ; perhaps we all are,
                            more or less "Jack" is certainly not without many friends in Alexandria,
                            as is evidenced by the fact that, on certain occasions, be is regaled
                            with tea, buns, cakes and the sympathetic smiles of his many lady
                            friends. This is all very well, but, can't we do something more for
                            him</p>
                        <p>This question leads me to suggest that the fund, which have been
                            inscribed for the purpose of a memorial to Lord Croner might be well
                            applied to the purchasing and endow. ing of a lifeboat. I am sure that,
                            if Lord Cromer were consulted, he would approve of the money being so
                            applied. In all sincerity, who really cares one straw about a Khartoum
                            scholarship. Lord Cromer was essentially cosmopolitan : we are all
                            foreigners, in a sense, though we are deeply attached to the country of
                            our adoption, let us, then, band together, under Lord Cromer's flag. and
                            do something really effective and necessary to help the brave seamen of
                            all nations to whom we owe so much, Once started, the scheme would meet
                            with the support of the unfailing generosity of our fellow citizens.</p>

                        <p>Sir,--Having just read in the "Phare d'Alexandrie" or to day the column
                            of shocking abuse of me and my creators based on the misconception that
                            the "Cleopatra" in leaving the Port on Saturday struck on a rock within
                            my limits, I must beg you to allow me to reassure my patrons and clients
                            as to the secure passage through me they have been guaranteed.</p>
                        <p>No, Sir, I am really a pags and not an impasse as the "Phare" would have
                            you and the | public believe. The "Cleopatra" neither could nor did
                            touch bottom in any portion of me, and the full depth of 35 feet at low
                            water will still be found throughout my limits as promised to you and to
                            be "Phare d'Alexandrie when you did me the honour to celebrate my

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.”</p>
                        <p>Dear Sir,- In the last three numbers of the Egyptian Standard" I
                            published a series of articles, three in number, I believe, on the
                            Oasis</p>
                        <cb n="4"/>
                        <p>of Al-Kharged, and in which I dealt likewise of the prospects attending
                            the Corporation of Western Egypt's endeavour reclaim to fertile land
                            from the vast covering of ever-shifting</p>
                        <p>Band</p>
                        <p>These articles were to be five in number and consequently I had planned
                            out my work in accordance with the requirements of the case.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday, to my surprise, I received the visit of Osman Sabry Effendi,
                            the "Responsible Secretary" of the "Egyptian Standard," who politely
                            informed me not to continue my series as the Director of the paper did
                            not wish to advertise the Corporation ! I leave it to the judgment of
                            any reader of my articles to decide whether the accusation is true. What
                            be, the reader, will have discovered, is an unprecedented display of
                            misprints and such alterations as "eity rage" for "city rags," "black
                            cartridges" for "blank cartridges" and other incomprehensible
                            concoctions of a like nature, for the drawing up of which I am at a loss
                            to determine the responsible person or persons.</p>
                        <p>My object in sending you this letter for publication is simply to justify
                            the apparently unfinished or incomplete nature of my observations in the
                            basis. Strictly speaking, both as regards politeness and justice, the
                            editor of the "Egyptian Standard" ought to have announced the
                            interruption of the articles and have alleged some real or fictitious
                            reasons. I doubt very much whether this has been done.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I may state that personally I think the leader of the
                            National Party is making a big mistake in not favouring the opening up
                            of the oasis. From what I have seen and have been able to judge by
                            myself there is a future in store for these fertile desert valleys.
                            Unfortunately, however, the leader of the National Party gives a rap for
                            the social and economic progress of his country as long as they are not
                            in agreement with his own politics. al ideals Neither Egyptians nor
                            Frenchmen started the idea of opening up the Libyan Oases, and that is
                            why it must be combatted even if proving beneficial to Egypt</p>
                        <p>Of course, this statement only holds good in case the instructions
                            remitted to me by the responsible secretary really emanated from
                            Mustapha Kanel Pasha, which is very doubtful. It is so easy to make a
                            gick man responsible for the doings of his entourage. I am, Sir,
                            sincerely yours,</p>

                            GAZETTE."</byline>
                        <p>Sir. A correspondent in to day's issue of the "Gazette" declares that
                            "Lord Cromer departed from Egypt about the middle of April last, and the
                            Party was only proclaimed late in September ; 80 there is no truth in
                            your insinuation in its worst sense) that "ay soon as Lord Cromer
                            departed this "Party of the People" entirely changed its program me. The
                            Party has got only one programme which was announced on the 1st of
                            September last, and since then no modifications have been therein
                            introduced."</p>
                        <p>The complete inaccuracy of this criticism of your paragraph is evident
                            from Lord Cromer's appreciation of the original aims of this Party
                            contained in the following passage in his last Report :--</p>
                        <p>"Petore leaving the question of the Egyptian National movement, I have
                            yet one further remark to make. Besides those who have assumed the title
                            of Nationalist, there exists a girl but increasing number of Egyptians
                            of whom comparatively little is heard, but who deserve that title quite
                            as much as their competitors of a different school of thought and
                            action. I allude to the party which, for the sake of brevity, I may call
                            the followers of the late Mufti, Sheikh Mohamed Abdou. I have in
                            previous Reports frequently alluded to the opinions held by this section
                            of Egyptian society-opinions which are very analogous to those advocated
                            by the late Seyyid Ahmed, who founded the Aligarh College in India.
                            Their fundamental idea is to reform various Moslem institutions withoat
                            shaking the main pillars on which the faith of Islam rests. They are
                            truly Nationalist in the sense of wishing to advance the interests of
                            their countrymen and coreligionists, but they are not tainted with
                            Pan-Islamism. Their programme, if I understand it rightly, involves not
                            opposition to, but co-operation with Europeans in the introduction of
                            Western civilization into the country. The main hope of Bgyptian
                            Nationalism, in the only true and practicable sense of the word, lios,
                            in my opinion, with those who belong to this party. In the past they
                            have not, for reasons on which I need not dwell, but for which the
                            British advisers of the Egyptian Government are in no way responsible,
                            received all the encouragement they deserve."</p>
                        <p>To declare that the party was only constituted last September and that
                            only from that date did it have a programme is nonsense, as everybody
                            knows that the Party came into being through the late Sheikh Abdou and
                            the official organ of the Party, "Al Garidah,” was started before Lord
                            Cromer left and took lig policy at the beginning under inspiration from
                            the British Agency</p>

                    <p>(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT)</p>
                    <p>Port SUDAN, January 22 This week has been quite an eventful one; the French
                        cruiser "Surprise" arrived from Suez The Commander made a tour of inspection
                        round the Port and the vessel sailed the following morning at daylight for
                        Masowa,</p>
                    <p>During the Bairam Holidays, the Atbara team, headed by Bimb. Newoorbe, came
                        down to Port Sudan to play the Sports Club at cricket. At the end of the
                        first day, the scores stood in favour of Port Sudan. There were &amp; great
                        many people present and quite a number of ladies, the latter being
                        passengers of the 83. "Langdale". In the evening &amp; smoking concert was
                        given on behalf of the Atbara teain, which was held in the band room of the
                        new barracks and passed off with great success. Kaim Drury Bey who took the
                        chair made a short speech, to which Bimbashi Newcombe replied on behalf of
                        his team. Quite a number of people volunteered to do something : amongst the
                        items on the programme were a banjo and guitar duet by Messrs Cole and
                        Watkins, comic songs by Mr Pool, who also gave a most amusing turn as a
                        champion heavy weight lifter. He was introduced to the audience under some
                        foreign Dame, and being disguised in his stage attire nobody recognised bim
                        The usual tale was told about him appear. ing before Kings and Princes, etc
                        Not only did he go in for heavy weight lifting, but feats of strength in the
                        shape of tearing two packs of cards, breaking chains with the muscle of his
                        arın, etc., After lifting 750 lbs above his head, he asked any member of the
                        audience to come up aod challenge him. Kanakam Drury Bey was not backward,
                        and immediately proceeded to the stage and after many desperate struggles
                        gave it up. Another gentleman proceeded to test his strength and with great
                        surprise to all present be lifted a pair of dumbells weighing 300 lbs above
                        his head, but in placing same on the ground they broke, much to every one's
                        surprise, and this revealed that they were made of glass and the whole show
                        was a hoax. He then carried the remainder of the heavy weights to be the
                        total of about 2 tons of the stage.</p>
                    <p>Resuming the cricket match the next day, there was some very smart playing on
                        the part of Port Sudan, and the game finished up as p.m. with a tie.</p>
                    <p>The launch "Clysma" was very kindly placed ai the teams disposal by Kaimakam
                        Drury Bey and an interesting trip up and down the harbour was enjoyed during
                        the cool of the evening. The team proceeded later to their train at the
                        station and received a cheery send off</p>
                    <p>Reports are just to hand of a serious accident caused by heavy seas outside
                        Suakin harbour The Sudan Government tug "Hawk", with Capt P. V. Draper at
                        command, was towing abreast a lighter laden with coal to Port Sudan Having
                        encountered some very heavy seas, be decided to put back into port and it
                        was at this moment that three heavy seas were shipped, causing the lighter
                        to become full of water and it sank in less than half a minute, with one
                        hand, a native, on board, whose body has not yet been recovered Capt. Draper
                        grasping the situation, gave orders for the ropes to be cut away, and by
                        doing this was just able to save the "Hawk" from the same fate</p>
                    <p>A horse owned by the Chief of Police, was</p>
                    <cb n="6"/>

                        80 yeards away. The assaliant has not been found but it is belived to be the
                        work of an Egyptian Policemnan, who may have had some grievance againt his

                        <p>Referee Sgt. Richardson, Coldstream Guards.</p>
                        <p>Quite a large and distinguished gathering witnessed the replay between
                            the above teams at Ghezireh, last Saturday, amongst whom we noticed,
                            Major General Bollock, The Hon. Mr. and Mrs. Iddings and Colonel
                            Markham.</p>
                        <p>There would be 1200 spectators present when the Borderers kicked off
                            against a strong gusty wind. Play immediately became fast, each end
                            being visited in turn. From the loose the Rifies took the aggressive and
                            Blacktin run. ing down the wing centered to Flemming who netted the
                            initial goal after 10 minutes of the start. Assisted by the wind the
                            Rifles were able to keep the Borderers on the defensive and Flemming
                            added a second goal ten minutes later</p>
                        <p>Play, became of a give and take nature, and on two occasions it was only
                            the excellent defence of the Rifles custodian that averted disaster. The
                            wind had somewhat abated when the second half was commenced and the
                            Borderers played a splendid upbill game and assisted by the wind gave
                            the Rifles plenty of work. Indeed they had the best of the second half
                            and were unlucky not to have soared thrice in the early stages. From a
                            melee in front of goal, Ingles secured and with a swift low sbot, scored
                            the first goal</p>
                        <p>Continuing the pressure, Priestly sent in several shots which Grimes did
                            well to save. Shortly before time Lee sent in a shot which struck the
                            crossbar and rebounding to Miller that player netted the equalizer</p>
                        <p>An extra half hour was resorted to, but neither side scored.</p>
                        <p>Although the game ended in a draw, the Borderers were far superior to
                            their opponents and should have won by at least three goals. Jones,
                            Priestly and Ingles played a hard sound game and it was only the
                            splendid display of Grimes which saved the situation. He is the finest
                            goalkeeper we have seen for some time. Pean is the only man of the
                            Rifles front division who played with prominence.</p>

                    <p>TERRIBLY SWOLLEN WITH DROPSY.</p>
                    <p>CREW HY DOAN BACKACHE KIDNEY Pills.</p>
                    <p>Over four years after bis cure, Mr. Geo. E Chapwan, 12, Chamberlain Road,
                        West Ealing, London, W., said :-"It is just upon five years since I began to
                        suffer with the dropay and kidney disease of which Doan's Backache Kidney
                        Pills cured me, and when I say cured me I mean it, as my health has been as
                        well as I could wish ever since-no sign whatever of the illness, although I
                        have been driving about in all weathers.</p>
                    <p>"I well remember how the trouble started - it was with pain right across the
                        back, and it grew so bad that once I was down I could hardly get up again.
                        Later I noticed swellings in my ankles, which spread up my loge 90 rapidly
                        that I had to cease work and take to bed. The swellings quickly came up into
                        my body. arms, hands, and face-my hands were more like boxing-gloves than
                        anything else. In short, I was terribly swollen all over, and must have been
                        an enormous weight. I was quite twice the size that I am now, and everyone
                        who saw me thought I could not possibly get over it. I, too, thought the
                        dropsy would be the end of me, for I felt fit to burst.</p>
                    <p>"I read of what Doan's Backache Kidney Pills had done in aes of dropay and
                        kidney disease, and then made up my mind to give them a good trial. It was
                        nothing short of marvellous what the pills did. It did not surprise me that
                        the progress was slow-knowing the seriousness of my illness- but it was very
                        sure. I could feel the swellings gradually going down. I stuck to Doan's
                        Backache Kidney Pills right through, and they absolutely cured me. I doubt
                        whether I should have been alive now had it not been for them</p>
                    <p>"I am as right and fit now as anyone couid wish to be, thanks to Doan's
                        Pills. (Signed),</p>
                    <p>GEORGE EDWARD CHAPMAN."</p>
                    <p>And again four and half years after his Irura-Mr. Chapman said to a
                        representative: "I am glad to see you, and more glad to say I am still the
                        same as ever-first-rate I look upon myself as cured for all time."</p>

                    <head>BULLETIN DE LA BOURSE</head>
                    <p>Mardi, 28 Janvier Comme hier, il n'y a presque pas eu d'affaires ce matin, et
                        c'est plutot la faiblesse qui a pré. dominé. Cette allure peu satisfaisante
                        est at tribuéo au calme régnant au Stock Exchange dont les ordres d'achat en
                        valeurs égyptiennes ont cessé. De plus, la ligne téléphonique du Caire
                        n'étant pas encore réparée, ce contre temps &amp; contribué pour sa part au
                        ralentissement des arbitrages. Mais ce ne sont là sans doute que des
                        circonstances aggravantes de La situation ; la cause principale de l'inertie
                        semble résider dans le tait que les positions surchargées n'ont pas encore
                        pu s'alléger et tant qu'une partie des paquets n'aura pas changé de mains,
                        comme nous l'avons déjà dit, il y a toujours lieu de redouter une réaction
                        au moindre événement détavorable. Le marche des cotons, qui est également
                        faible, &amp; contribué a la mauvaise humeur dans la corbeille des
                        titres.</p>
                    <p>C'est au milieu de ce désarroi que la spécu. lation s'est emparée de la Delta
                        Land pour la pousser de 1 5/32 à 1 1/4 acheteurs. Cette soudaine rentrée en
                        faveur n'a paralt il, aucun motif. On acbète, voilà tout. La demande
                        provient principalement du Caire.</p>
                    <p>Il a été fait un peu de Cassa di Sconto et d'Agricole. Ce qu'il y a de
                        surprenant pour la Cassa, c'est qu'en dépit du bilan et de tous les bruits
                        favorables mis en circulation, le prix a fléchi de 58 a 56. En ce qui
                        concerne l'Agricole, on a observé de la demande, surtont en clôture qui a eu
                        lieu à 7 27/32, en hausse do 1/16.</p>
                    <p>La National est loin d'être en aussi bonne tenue. Elle tombe de 21 13 16 a 21
                        9 16 vendeurs, sur des offres persistantes.</p>
                    <p>Plus faibles aussi la Delta Light qui recule de 9 21/32 9 5/8, l'Obligation
                        ancienne Crédit Foncier de 299 à 298, et le Crédit Fran00 Egyptien de 4 5/32
                        à 4 1/8.</p>
                    <p>En Crown Brewery la dégringolade parait De plus vouloir s'arrêter. C'est
                        encore 3 francs qu'elle perd &amp; 92.</p>
                    <p>L'Ordinary Khedivial Mail rétrograde de 18/3 à 18, la Building Lands de 1 1/2
                        à 1 7 16, la Port Said Salt de 10/10} á 10,6, la Levant de 17 32 à 12, et
                        l'U'nited de 1/4 à 7 32.</p>
                    <p>D'autre part, la Salt and Soda se relève de 14/9 &amp; 15/, les Nungovich
                        Hotels de 18 à 13}, le Banco di Roma de 108 A 1081, et la Zariffa de 2 3/4 A
                        2 7/8.</p>
                    <p>Sur le reste de la cote il n'y a pas de change ments a signaler. Quant à la
                        tendance, elle est plutôt faible pour le moment. Mais ce qui paralt
                        extraordinaire en cette saison, qu'on était habitué à voir ai animée, c'est

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. </p>
                    <p>Many people leave Egypt far too early in the year, for as a rule the weather
                        in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt is
                        Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list shewing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short ones are as
                        follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers of the P.&amp;O., the Egyptian Mail S.S,. Co., North German
                        Lloyd, Orient, and Messageries Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor,
                        British India, Bibby and Henderson Lines are also excellent, and their
                        steamers are largely patronised by travellers to Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said can now be made without change
                        in 4 ½ hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O. Brindisi express
                        from Port Said, by the Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., from Alexandria to Marseilles
                        and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe. The Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., have
                        also made arrangements whereby luggage can be collected and sent to any
                        address.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail<cb n="6"/> Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to Brindisi. One of these
                        leaves Port Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian
                        mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. <hi rend="italic"
                            >Giardini</hi> is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to
                        Taormina is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the
                        town is much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                        restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of
                        Etna, and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic
                        remains that are found all over the island, are an endless sources of
                        pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a Greek city,
                        which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in
                        B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be seen. The cathedral
                        was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with about 300,000 inhabitants,
                        is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful climate. Much of
                        interest is to be found in this fine city. <hi rend="italic">The Palazzo
                            Reale</hi> is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of <hi
                            rend="italic">S. Giovannia degli Eremiti</hi> with its picturesque
                        cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal
                        Park are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                            bay—<hi rend="italic">Castellamare</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Sorrento</hi>. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento [you can
                        drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                            <hi rend="italic">City of Flowers</hi> and its surrounding country. In
                        Florence itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst
                        the local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. <hi rend="italic"
                            >The Cascine</hi> is the most attractive and fashionable promenade in
                        Florence, whilst the <hi rend="italic">Viale dei Colli</hi>, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to <hi rend="italic">Vallombrosa</hi>, with its <hi
                            rend="italic">Monastery</hi> 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is
                        made first by ordinary train from Florence to <hi rend="italic">St.
                            Ellero</hi>, thence by cog-wheel railway to <hi rend="italic"
                            >Saltino</hi>. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                        striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo

                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea. No hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi> you make the tour of the
                        beautiful Italian lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come <hi rend="italic"
                            >Tremezzo</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Cadenabbia</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Menaggio</hi> with the prettily-situated town of <hi rend="italic"
                            >Bellaggio</hi> opposite. The walk from <hi rend="italic">Tremezzo</hi>
                        along the shore of the lake to <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> is most
                        enjoyable. A steam tram runs from <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> to <hi
                            rend="italic">Porlezza</hi> on Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour,
                        then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M. de Caprino.and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town, situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, “Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and ‘Tho Flight into Egypt,” by Bramantion.</p>

                    <p>Many people visit Greece after wintering in Egypt, as it is so easily reached
                        from Alexandria ; the climate in April is charming. The best steamers are
                        those of the Khedivial Mail Co. and the Russian Steam Navigation Co.</p>
                    <p>It is hardly necessary to point out to Tourists the extraordinary interest of
                        a visit to Athens from an artistic, historical and archaelogical point of
                        view, and if possible tourists should average to be in Athens for the
                        Orthodox Easter in order to witness the Good Friday and Easter Eve
                        ceremonies, and to be present at the dancing on the Easter Tuesday festival
                        held at Megara, for which a special train is run from Athens.</p>
                    <p>It is worth while to spend a few days in CORFU on account of the beauty of
                        the scenery. There is also good snipe and quail shooting to be had.</p>

                    <p>THE WORLDS' GREATEST RESTORATIVE.</p>
                    <p>Coleman's Wincarnis should be taken in every case where strength is needed.
                        To the whole this splendid tonic wine means prolongation of life; the
                        convalescent, quick recovery; to the ana mic, new blood; and to all who are
                        "rundown," the speedy regaining of metal and bodily fitness. </p>
                    <p>Wincarnis Creates Energy and Stamina.</p>
                    <p>Whenever there is prolonged strain, either mental or physical, and especially
                        when too great a totx is being placed on the nervous system, Wincarnis is
                        essential for preventing the breakdown in health which tends to follow
                        over-exertion. Wincarnis makes the weak strong, but it is just as necessary
                        for retaining the health of the robust when there are thekening influences
                        at work. </p>
                    <p>Wincarnis Braces the Nervous System.</p>
                    <p>Over 8,000 Doctors have written to testify their appreciation of Coleman's
                        Wincarnis, and his is only a fractional part of the members of the medical
                        profession in all parts of the world who daily prescribe this an excellent
                        restorative for all cases where weakness and malnutrition have to be
                        overcome.</p>
