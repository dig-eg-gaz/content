                    <p>Made in 70 Colors</p>
                    <p>An artistic wall covering.</p>
                    <p>This celebrated water paint is made in two qualities for Inside and Outside
                        work</p>
                    <p>HALL’S SANITARY WASHABLE DISTEMPER is rapidly superseding wall papers in all
                        tastefully furnished homes. It is made in 70 artistic tints, and only
                        requires the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is quickly and
                        easily applied with a whitewash brush, with half the labour and at one third
                        the cost of paint. HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures cleanliness, and is pleasing to
                        the eye. It appeals alike to artistic and practical house decoration. HALL’S
                        DISTEMPER is of special value in hot climates. Owing to its cool, pleasing
                        colours, great weather-resisting and germ-destroying properties, it lends
                        itself to every kind of wall, wood, brick or stone coating, possessing all
                        the advantages of paint, colour- wash, and disinfectant at one third the
                        cost of oil paint. It never blisters in the hottest sun, and the fact that
                        it can be washed adds greatly to its sanitary advantages.</p>

                        a policy which they hate. In the opinion of many, both in Germany and
                        England, who have studied the oversea expansion of the Empire, the aafety of
                        the nation at home is being jeopardised : and it is freely admitted that,
                        while a great people might be oontent to run some risks if they oould see
                        any prospect of each a future snocesa as has attended the British colonial
                        policy, the results at present achieved do not give any reason for hope. The
                        stream of German emi- gration still flows mainly to the United 8tatee; and
                        though the young man who crosses the Atlantio holds fast to his family
                        connections in Europe, and preserves a cer- tain sentimental affection for
                        the Fatherland, he qniokly loses all interest in, or beoomee an
                        onoompromiaing opponent of, the dreams of a Greater Germany that are
                        cherished at home. As to that Greater Germany itself, the ideal was
                        oonoeived by a few University professors, strong in their belief of the
                        moral power of the Tentonio people, and regretful that the foroe of the
                        nation was dissipated in internal quarrels. It was changed into action by
                        Bismarck and the present Emperor, who enoonraged emigration to Booth America
                        and the Australasian Islands. The Monroe dootrine stopped the former; the
                        intense patriotism of the Bagliah in Australia showed the danger of the
                        latter : and Germany was foroed to tarn elsewhere. At the present day there
                        are three oolonial projects on hand. There is the movement for closer
                        colonisation of Afrioa, assisted by Imperial subsidy, and the development of
                        trade with the still in- dependent parts of that oontinent, until a
                        Protectorate beoomee possible that wiU secure German oommeroe to the
                        cxolasion of all others. There is the hope of expansion in China, which a
                        few years ago was hailed by the more sanguine spirits as a land destined to
                        fall to Germany, as India hat fallen to Eagland; the Japanese victories and
                        the fear of a Chinese Benasoenoe have, however, ended all thoughts of an
                        Eastern Empire. Finally, there is the very curious project that aims at Aria
                        Minor. This latter, has been ventilated of late in some of the German
                        newspapers; and it apparently prooeeds from the idea, that in the event of
                        the Turkish Empire be- coming disintegrated, Germany would And her
                        opportunity in stepping forward as the up- holder of Mohamedan unity in all
                        parts of the worid—reoriving, not unnaturally, a fall quid pro qao for
                        services rendered. In Germany itself; there is a noisy section of the pnblio
                        whioh explains and applauds such schemes to that mass of the nation whioh
                        cares for none of these things. At Berlin, indeed, the oracles are dumb; the
                        Emperor seldom alludes to oolonial expansion ; bnt the expo- nents of “World
                        Politics” are not slow to intsr- pret his silenoe. Assisted perhaps by a j
                        ndidoua hint from headquarters, they deolare that Ger- many is now the
                        determining voioe in Euro- pean affaire; that in the world at large her
                        ship- ping has already^ rpaased that of Franoe, and is beginning to ran a
                        neok-and-neok reoe with England; and that Germanism, whioh has spent
                        oenturies in maturing, is now ripe for the con- quest of the world. We do
                        not believe that the German people will be oarried away by such wild talk.
                        We are oonvinoed that the moat advanoed and most educated parts of the
                        Gorman oommunity have no love for the “mailed fist” whioh has been too
                        freely in evidenoe. The dream of a Greater Germany has intoxioated many
                        worthy persons; and it ia not surprising that after the "great years,” when
                        the victories over Austria, Den- mark, end Franoe bad been accomplished,
                        some should believe that all paths wonld be easy for the oonqnering Teutons.
                        Bat disillu- sion has followed. The sterility of the colonies that have been
                        aoquired, the impossibility of inducing farmers to settle there, and the
                        enormous oost of maintaining them, added to the heavy taxation at home, made
                        many grumble before the Herero rising. When this happened, there was a loyal
                        oo-operation to end the rebellion, and not a little joy that foreigners
                        would have an opportunity of seeing the calibre of the Army. But now that
                        nothing brilliant has been done, and the guerilla warfare drags on from
                        month to month, a reaction has set in that may turn the trend of thought
                        from expansion abroad to reform at home.</p>

                        <p>The complete absence of enthusiasm is the most striking feature of the
                            Russian press comments regarding the Assembly project. There are no
                            signs of rejoicing anywhere. The high rental qualification of the town
                            voters excludes the majority of the educated classes. Only 5,000
                            inhabitants in St Petersburg are qualified. Rioting took place at
                            Kichineff following the publication of the project Several thou- sand
                            demonstrators were dispersed by the mounted police. (Reuter)</p>

                        <p>This bulletin issued by the Ministry of the Interior for the week ending
                            last Saturday again shows a very considerable decrease in the area of
                            land in which the cotton-worm still exists. The following are the
                            reports from the four affected provinces. </p>
                        <p><placeName>Gharbieh</placeName> :—<measure>825</measure> feddans,
                            belonging to <measure>68</measure> proprietors, have been affested by
                            the worm, and <measure>811</measure> of these have been cleared by
                                <measure>718</measure> children. </p>
                        <p><placeName>Behera</placeName> :—<measure>2,396</measure> feddans,
                            belonging to <measure>48</measure> proprietors, have been affected, and
                                <measure>2,804</measure> have been cleared by
                                <measure>6,641</measure> children. </p>
                        <p><placeName>Dakahlieh</placeName> :—<measure>109</measure> feddans,
                            belonging to <measure>45</measure> proprietors, have been affected, and
                                <measure>102</measure> cleared by <measure>810</measure> children. </p>
                        <p><placeName>Damietta</placeName> :—<measure>9}</measure> feddans,
                            belonging to <measure>9</measure> proprietors, have been affected, and
                            have all been cleared by <measure>61</measure> children. </p>
                        <p>Comparing the above with the report of last week, we find that the number
                            of affected provinces is reduced by one,
                                <placeName>Kalionbieh</placeName> being now entirely free from the
                            worm. In the <placeName>Gharbieh</placeName> province tho number of
                            affected feddans shows a decrease of 814, in
                                <placeName>Dakahlieh</placeName> a decrease of
                            <measure>13</measure>, in <placeName>Damietta</placeName> a decrease of
                                <measure>11}</measure>, and in <placeName>Behora</placeName> an
                            inorease of <measure>1,141</measure> feddans. The increase in the number
                            of feddans attacked in the Behera provinoe must in no way be taken to
                            indicate a general increase, for it must be remembered that this
                            provinoe has suffered much more severely, not only during the present
                            year,but also in former ones, than any other, and in the reports ofeaoh
                            week we have noted a considerable numerical difference between the areas
                            attacked and those cleared. It is obvious that the insect is much more
                            strongly established in this province than in any other. Those who know
                            the Prodenia littoralit find it one of tho commonest of the moths whioh
                            fly round lamps or eleotrio lights at night in

                        rails in the future but those of the •Ph«nix’ type of 68 kilogrammes per
                        metre, and to replace the rails at present in use by the above mentioned

                        in use between Kasrel Nil and Mena House. Of the tramways the Saptieh and
                        Shoubra lines are to be completed and working within two Cof the signature
                        of the oonoession (i.e. July 18, 1906), the Sahel (Rod el Fang) line within

                        abora date. The doubling of the old Cairo line is to be completed by the end
                        of this month, greatly to the relief, we imagine, of all who live near the
                        Kasr el Aini Road. The line from Foum el Khalig to the Southern bridge over
                        the small branch of the Nile will be constructed oonourrently with the
                        widening of the road by the Tan rim. The Ghizeh line across Rodah Island and
                        the new bridges will be completed as soon as the bridges are open to heavy
                        traffic, and the Imam-el-Shaffdi line is to be completed within fifteen yean
                        from the 18th ult. The minimum radius of all ourves is fixed at 25 metres,

                        The speed of the trams is not to exceed twelve kilometres an hour and must
                        be reduced at all points where the Ministry of Publio Works oonsiden a lower

                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gaxhte. Sir,—I was glad to read in a reoent
                            Dumber of your esteemed journal that the little Anglican Church, at
                            Niooaia, Cyprus, haa been greatly improved, as regards deoorations. It
                            is a nioe little church and what puzzles me, is why no steps have ever
                            been tafan to organise a proper choir. Probably they have one by now,
                            but when I was these last-nr no snoh thing existed. On my enquiring why
                            they did not have one, I was told that then were not enough people, or
                            some such excuse. Surely there must be four gentlemen and four or five
                            ladies in Niooaia who oan zing 1 If they were to pnetioe onoe a week, as
                            is ifong at the English Churoh here, I believe they would be able to
                            oonduot the servioe chorally, whioh is always nioe, and I am sore the
                            dwp- lain would prefer it Very often the choir at St. Mark’s only
                            numbers about six pessons, and yet they are able to oonduot tho servioe
                            very well I do not therefore see why no steps should be taken to furnish
                            the ohurok at Nioosia with a choir. The late Ven. Archdaaoon 8penoer,
                            very often mentioned that it was a pity no ohoir existed—only it seems
                            he did not try to get one np. The climate is very healthy, and I am
                            surprised to find snoh a comparatively small British oommunity. I am
                            told that nothing goes ahead in Cyprus, and that all who have from time
                            to time establish- ed businesses there had to sell np and leave. I am
                            always interested in anything that deals with Cyprus. 1 am, Sir, etc, A

                        <p>Te the Editor of the Egyptian Qaam. Sir,—As there may be soma holders of
                            Credit Foncier Egyptian thane here whom it interests, I would oall
                            attention to a very oariont feature in the quotations of their shares
                            reoently issued in Paris. There appears to be an attempt to lower their
                            prioe until after the new issue. Within the test ten days Paris
                            quotation was frs. 815. An order sent to eight brokers in Paris to buy
                            at 8l8gaveno execution, but the prioe row to 822, than on no order being
                            sent prioe was redwood to 816. An order was sent to bay at 819, and a
                            few shares wertf given and prioe was raised to 821, again no order was
                            sent and prioe went np to 816, orders sent at 818 but no shares sold,
                            and we dose at 891. A Haves rumour rays a great financier is striving to
                            make the Credit Fonder shareholders abstain from tbs new issue, ao that
                            the Daira 8anieh shareholders may get a big interest in the Credit
                            Fonder, and thow who had Daira interest may retain an interest in
                            Egyptian affaire, instead being paid off in otah. Henoe this oonstant
                            marking down of prioes without sales. Perhaps this note may save a

                        Medical Officer with statistics (Tables XV. to XIX.) will be found in the
                        appendix. Dr. Kirton has at my request dealt at considerable length with the
                        various causes tending to increase sickness and mortality in the Central
                        Prisons and has anal>sed the returns practically from every point of view. I
                        think that the tables he has worked out are well worth the attention of
                        Medical and Sanitary experts. Mortality. It will be seen that the mortality
                        has drop- ped to 19.8 per thousand mile, with one excep- tion (1901 with
                        17.3) to the lowest yet reached. Tuberculosis is still the cause of a large
                        ncmber (32) of deaths,and may, I suppose, be attributed to the •
                        overcrowding throughout this and previous years, notwithstanding that little
                        or no fault can now be found with the ventilation. In fact if it had not
                        been for the practically perfect ventilation it would have been impossible
                        to haveaooom- modated all the prisoners committed to prison daring the year.
                        Deaths stated to be due to diseases of the digestive system, diarrhoea, eta,
                        amount to 85, the largest number yet recorded in any one year. In this
                        respect it is rather remarkable that September (when the Nile is in full
                        flood) was the most unhealthy and January, February and March the healthiest
                        mnntha An outbreak of typhus occurred in Beni- Suef during the spring and
                        aooounted for 12 deaths, otherwise the prisons have been free from any
                        epidemia I agree with Dr. Kirton that consideriug that typhus has been pre-
                        valent in Egypt more or less throughout the year and that every prison has
                        been very muoh overcrowded, it shows great care on the part of the Medical
                        Offioera that no other serious outbreak occurred. The health oj newly
                        admitted prisoners. An appreciable percentage of the deaths occurred within
                        the first month of imprison- ment, thirty, per oent. within first six months
                        and fifty per sent, within the first year. It may be argued therefore that a
                        large percentage of the deaths occurred amongst prisoners who were in bad
                        health on entering a prison. On the other hand the fact that a prisoner’s
                        mode ol life is entirely changed on imprieoment must not altogether be
                        ignored, and in some instan- ces at all events this sadden change is
                        probablj itself the cause of a prisoner’s health breaking down. Personally I
                        am inclined to think that sleep- ing on straw mats, with asphalt floors and
                        thorough ventilation must be very trying to a prisoner aooastomed to bedding
                        or even to the mud floor of an ill-ventilated hut But the queition is
                        whether any change in this respeot would not make the prisons too popular.
                        As it is with the ameliorated diet we are danger- ously near the line when
                        imprisonment will altogether oease to be deterrent to the lower classes.
                        Severity of imprisonment f or weUdo do persons. In Egypt one law for both
                        the rich and poor works out very unfairly, as the modes of life vary so,
                        that what is little short of torture to one may be comparative luxury to
                        another, yet it cannot be weU left to a prison official or ' vdn to a judge
                        to discriminate. It is some satisfaction to feel that if in the case of th.
                        well-to-do the punishment is relatively very severe, he is as a rule lees
                        deserving of sym- pathy and has not the same motive for oom- pri-ting crime
                        as one from the lower classes. (To be continued.)</p>

                    <head>THE BONMARTINI TRIAL.</head>
                    <p>(From a Corrrbpohdkht.) At last 1 After dragging its slow length along for
                        but one month short of three years, tho Bonmartini case has come to an end,
                        and the verdict is given. The story is a curious one and phsyoo- logists
                        have found interesting matter for study in the characters of the people
                        concerned. It will be remembered that on the 2nd September, 1909, the body
                        of Count Bonmar- tini was found lying in the ante-room of his apartment in
                        Bologna. Although no less than seventeen wounds were oounted on thebodr,
                        proving the savage ness of the attaok, it was evident that there bad been no
                        straggle, for the dead man’s clothes were in perfect order, wherever the
                        assassin’s knife had not penetrated. The Count had evidently been
                        overpowered before he had been able to make any defenoe and, from the nature
                        of the wounds, the experts were of opinion that two if not more, were
                        oonoerned in the murder. A letter found on the table, the disorder of the
                        apartment, and the fact that the Coun- tess's jewellery had been stolen,
                        seemed to leave no possibility of doubt that the Count has fallen a victim
                        in a guet-apens laid for him by some woman and her aooomplioea. The
                        Countess, and her brother Tullio Murri, added evidenoe that oonfiimed this
                        view. Count Bonmartini had married in 1892 the daughter of Professor Murri,
                        a physioian whose name is famous all over Italy. The first six years of
                        their married life were spent happily enough in Padua, but, when in 1898
                        they settled in Bologna, where Bonmartini wished to study medicine,
                        differences broke out between husband and wife, in which Bologna society
                        took the wife’s side so strongly that the Connt soon found himself looked
                        upon askanoe by most of his former friends. Not knowing what reports his
                        wife was spreading about him, we eee in the poor man's diary how puuled he
                        was by the attitnde of those around him. Meanwhile Conntess Linda was being
                        proclaimed a saint and martyr, a dovoted mother, and an injured wife. At
                        last a separa- tion was decided on. This lasted three years, at the end of
                        which time the Count threatened to go to law if his children, a boy and
                        girl, were not restored to him, and his wife, knowing he must gain his
                        cause, consented, to the poor man's grest joy, to resume life with him under
                        certain oouditions. This was in April 1902. Towards the end of July,
                        Bonmartini finding life, intolerable in Bologna, determined to return to his
                        nativo town of Padna. Thereupon he was denounced by all his wife’s family as
                        the would-be murder- ed of the unfortunate Linda, and Tnllio says he felt
                        his blood boil when he heard of this intolerable oraelty. Such language was
                        some- what exaggerated when it is remembered that Bologna is within a lew
                        hours of Padua, and that the Connt had offered his wife a season ticket to
                        enable her to be with her family as muoh as she liked. This was at the end
                        of July.and on the 28th August, Bonmartini was murdered. The Coun- tess was
                        at Venioe with her ohildren at the time, and that very day she had
                        aooompanied her husband to the station after a lunch “en fmille” to
                        oelebrate his birthday. Linda had annoncoed her husband’s arrival to one
                        Rosina Bonetti, a woman of the lowest extraction, her brother Tallio’s
                        mistress, to whom Linda wrote in terms of affectionate intimacy I Daring the
                        first few days the police made one important disoovery. In the house in
                        whioh the Bonmartinia lived, they found a small apartment, let to a
                        mysterious individual who had never been seen to enter it The polioe found
                        there some tattles of wine aim lar to one left behind by the assassins in
                        the Counts apartment, and, among some rubbish, two torn envelopes addressed
                        to a Dr. Secchi, who is well-known in Bologna. Two days after the disoovery
                        of the body, Linda, after a short and harried examination, had left for
                        Switzerland with her ohildren and brother, not even waiting for her husbands
                        funeral. The polioe oontinued their researches, but without any very
                        definite results, when on the 11th September all Bologna was startled by
                        hearing that Professor Murri, had handed to the police a letter from his son
                        Tullio in which he deolared himself not guilty of the mordsr of his brother
                        in law, but of having killed him in self-defence. He related how on the
                        evening of the 28th August he had met the Connt in his house and had
                        expostulated with him on the way he treated Linda, that the Connt had
                        thereupon rushed at him with a knife whioh, he, in self-defence, had tamed
                        on the Connt, and with whioh he had killed him. In a fit of fary, he ooald
                        not aoooaat for he had straok Again and again at the dead body. Whan he had
                        reoovored his self oontrol he had forged the letter found, broken open the
                        drawers and taken his sister jawellery away in order to mislead the police.
                        The next day Rosina was arrested, and two days later the Countess herself,
                        who mean- while had returned to Bologna as saddenly as she had left. No ore
                        knew where Tullio was. but on hearing of his sister's arrest be gave himself
                        up on the 18th. The disoovery of the envelopes addressed toSeoohi had
                        started the polioe on a new trail of evidenoe. They discovered that the rent
                        of the snail apartment had been paid by Tire Borghi, a servsnt of Seoohi’s,
                        who said the money h»d been given her by the Conntess !l In a small town
                        like Bologna, where the Mnrris were known to all, it was no mystery that
                        ye>r« before, when Linda was a girl of 16 there bad been certain love
                        passages between her and 8eosbi, nipped in the bud by her- parents’ d
                        reppronl, Tie*, now, in oross examination, deolared that suoe the Bonmar
                        -inis had returned to Bologna the lovers had met again, and that she,
                        Tisa,had acted as go- between, and that the little apartment had been taken
                        by them as a convenient meeting place.. Linda confronted with this evidenoe,
                        denied nothing. She even acknowledged it with the womanly dignity of whioh
                        she is so perfect a mistress. "I am oonvinoed”, she said, "that no one cam
                        blame anything in my oonduot as sinoeour reconciliation my husband allowed
                        me entire liberty of action" 111 Some days before Tullio had given himself
                        up, the polioe had made another arrest, that of an oubat-elbows doctor,
                        gambler, good-for- nothing, ready to do anybody’s dirty work at the lowest
                        prioe. This man, a friend of Tullio's, and seen with him several times on
                        the days proceeding the murder, had left Bologna suddenly on the night it
                        was oommitted and as it was ascertained, in possession o^ior him a
                        considerable sum of money. Naldi at once 11 acknowledged that he knew Tullio
                        had deter mined to get rid of his brother-in-law, and had fried to persuade
                        him to give him a help- ing hand, but this Naldi had not only refuted to do,
                        but raised every argument to prevail on Tullio to renounce his intention. He
                        accounted for the money in his possession in different j ways. His last
                        version being that he had stolen throughout having any aooompUoes. Tho next
                        few months brought nothing of special interest in the way of evidenoe. then,
                        that against Dr. Seoofai was not yet strong enough to justify his arrest
                        but, bsfore the 23rd June, 190*. the polioe had piooed together what they
                        required, and Seochi was in prison.</p>
