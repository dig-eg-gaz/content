<head>ONE HOUR’S UPROAR. SITTING ADJOURNED.</head>

<p>London, May 22.</p>
<p>House of Commons. - Mr. .Campbell Bannerman moved an adjournment to draw attention to the statement of Mr. Balfour that the question of Colonial preference might be submitted to a Colonial Conference in 1906. He maintained that this was inconsistent with Mr. Balfour’s Edinburgh proposals and subsequent pledges, involving two general elections, first on the question of a Colonial Conference and second on the decisions of the Conference, and that its policy was a safeguard against any sudden change.</p>

<p>Mr. A. Lyttelton rose and stood 10 minutes attempting to speak, the opposition meanwhile shouting: "Balfour! Balfour!" till finally he sat down in face of the terrible din. Mr. Winston Churchill then rose and was received in turn by a deafening uproar from the Ministerialists, and not a word he said was audible. After a few words from Mr. LloydGeorge, Mr. Lyttelton rose again, evoking a renewal of the confusion. Several members appealed to the Deputy-Speaker to adjourn. Mr. Campbell Bannerman appealed to Mr. Balfour to speak. Mr. Austen Chamberlain and Mr. Brodrick vainly attempted to address the House, and the Deputy Speaker was finally obliged to adjourn without putting the question. The “scene” lasted over an hour.

<div type="item"><head>THE COTTON WORM</head>

<head>OPERATIONS AT KAFR KHADR</head>

<p>The worm reported at Kafr Khadr, Tantah markas, is pronounced to be the Labhyema esigua. The full-grown worm is considerably smaller than the Agrodis and is green in colour, with a dark line running horizontally along each side. The eggs are laid in the bersim on various kinds of grass, and on the lower side of the cotton leaf. When the eggs are first hatched, the young worms remain together and feed in groups, but after the first few days they stray all over the plant, eating the epidermis of the leaf, which rapidly turns brown and frizzles away. It appears that the worms do not feed during the heat of the day, but go down to the ground, where they take shelter from the sun.</p>

<p>At Kafr Khadr the area of 300 feddans, which was badly attacked, has now been cleared by some hundreds of boys, who proceeded to shake the worm off the plants and then pick them off the ground. The young plants, which have suffered considerably, will probably revive, and the crop need not ultimately suffer.</p>

<p>The entomologist of the Khedivial Agricultural Society of opinion that these worms, which have now been found among the young cotton, belong to the third brood, and considers it possible that later broods may combine with the true cotton worm in the attack on the cotton plants at a later stage.</p>

<p>Careful observation and hand picking, as prescribed for the Prodenia littoralis, or cotton worm proper are necessary, as it is evident that this worm, if neglected, is capable of inflicting very serious damage.
</p>
<p>In compliance with a request from the Ministry of the Interior, the Imperial Ottoman Bank have placed the services of Mr. Wortabet at their disposal for cotton worm duty.
</p>
<p>Mr. Wortabet, who had considerable experience in locust plague in Cyprus, was very successful in performing similar work during the locust plague in Egypt last year.

<div type="item"><head>CAIRO WATER FAMINE.</head>

<p>A Cairo correspondent writes . — We are being visited by one of those heat waves which dwellers in Cairo are accustomed to expect at this season of the year, and it is obvious that at such periods water for domestic purposes becomes our most precious commodity. But as usually happens in this country, when a thing is most urgently needed it it not to be had. It is therefore hardly strange that our water supply has diminished to almost vanishing point. Today (21st) I find there is no water at all. I might mention that daring the last spell of heat a week or so ago the price of ice was quadrupled. I have been frequently told by persons living on the second and third floors of houses in Cairo that habitually and under ordinary circumstances they can only get water during certain hours of the day. They find it useless to complain to the company. That a company earning such enormous profits as the Cairo Water Company, and with a Government representative on the board in the person of Sir Horace Pinching, should thus be permitted to neglect its duty and imperil the health of Egypt’s Capital with impunity, is extraordinary.

<head>Suakin, May 17.</head>
<p>The weather here has been almost unbearable for the last few days. It is very hot and damp. Notwithstanding, only a few miles away from here it has been raining heavily, and much damage has been done to the railway line. In some parts the line has been washed away tor a length of several miles through the heavy rainfalls coming from the mountains into the khors, over which bridges will have to be erected. All the available men of the Railway Battalion are on the line repairing the damage done.</p>

<p>The Rev. E. H Blyth, Church of England Chaplain, left for Suez by the S.S “Mahallah" on tho 9th inst. He has requested Mr. Mackenzie, superintendent, Eastern Telegraph Company, at Suakin, to continue the Sunday prayer meetings,in the evening, which are now carried on at the Eastern Telegraph Company's office. An organ belonging to Mr Jenkins of the Sudan Government Railways, has been kindly lent by him for the Sunday services.</p>

<p>The Italian steamer “Ciampa," belonging to a Venetian company, arrived here yesterday with a full consignment of timber planks, &amp;c., for Suakin merchants.</p>

<head>Port Said, Saturday.</head>
<p>At dawn yesterday the North German Lloyd S.S. “Rhein" arrived here having on board, in addition to a few ordinary passengers, 1,170 German bluejackets, who proceed to Kiao Ghau to relieve the crews of men-of-war there in commission. Throughout the day, bands of 200 or so, in charge of an officer, roamed about the town evidently much interested in all they saw. They were mostly all young men, apparently going East for the first time. The vessel entered the Canal at midnight.</p>

<p>The Rennie Line S.S "Inkula" arrived the same day. This vessel is chartered by the Russian Government as a hospital ship, and had on board 1,147 wounded and sick for Odessa, for which port she sailed at dawn today. I was struck, on boarding her, by the seeming comfort with which the men were surrounded. Amongst other things, Russian ladies had provided 400 long cane chairs, and numerous swinging cots were slung about the upper deck</p>

<p>The quickest route to Europe from Egypt is destined to be the Pineus, Demirli and Frontier Railway, the construction of which is proceeding steadily, and is in the hands of the “Societe de Travaux pour L’Etranger”. (a Franco British oombination). In Thessaly work is now proceeding on the sections between Pintamilos and Skavamitza, a distance of 13 miles, and between Skavamitza and Demirli, a distance of 10 miles. Later on the line will be continued from Demirli to Larissa, a distance of 28 miles, permission having been already granted by the Greek Government. This section is expected to be completed within about two years. Eventually it is intended to carry the line from Larissa through the Vale of Tempe to connect with the Ottoman railway system. It is not yet, however, definitely settled at what spot the junction will be effected, but it is hoped that the entire undertaking will be completed within five years. The “Societe de Travaux pour L’Etranger” holds a concession from the Greek Government to work the entire line for a period of 50 years.

<div type="item"><head>THE SUEZ CANAL SHARES.</head>

<p>We published Mr. Greenwood's statements on Friday last on the subject of Sir R Stanton and the Suez Canal shares, and in connection with this matter a correspondent writes as follows to a London contemporary:-
</p>
<p>No one who has any knowledge of the eminent services of Gen. Sir. E. Stanton as Consul-General of this country in Egypt during the administration of the Khedive Ismail willful to do justice to the filial efforts of Gen. Stanton's son to protect the memory of his distinguished father from any imputation upon the record of one of the most admirable representatives of the best type of the British soldier and gentleman that was ever employed by the State, in the extraordinary difficulties and embarrasments of a complicated diplomatic position. This position Sir E. Stanton was called upon to fill at Cairo at a period to which Mr. Greenwood directed the remarks which he appears to have modified subsequently. In the troublesome epoch of the dual control I know that the intelligence, honesty and admirable directions of Sir E. Stanton's consular action were regarded with confidence by those who, like myself, were acquainted with him and his work.
