                    <p>House of Commons. - Mr. .Campbell Bannerman moved an adjournment to draw
                        attention to the statement of Mr. Balfour that the question of Colonial
                        preference might be submitted to a Colonial Conference in 1906. He
                        maintained that this was inconsistent with Mr. Balfour’s Edinburgh proposals
                        and subsequent pledges, involving two general elections, first on the
                        question of a Colonial Conference and second on the decisions of the
                        Conference, and that its policy was a safeguard against any sudden
                        change.</p>
                    <p>Mr. A. Lyttelton rose and stood 10 minutes attempting to speak, the
                        opposition meanwhile shouting: "Balfour! Balfour!" till finally he sat down
                        in face of the terrible din. Mr. Winston Churchill then rose and was
                        received in turn by a deafening uproar from the Ministerialists, and not a
                        word he said was audible. After a few words from Mr. LloydGeorge, Mr.
                        Lyttelton rose again, evoking a renewal of the confusion. Several members
                        appealed to the Deputy-Speaker to adjourn. Mr. Campbell Bannerman appealed
                        to Mr. Balfour to speak. Mr. Austen Chamberlain and Mr. Brodrick vainly
                        attempted to address the House, and the Deputy Speaker was finally obliged
                        to adjourn without putting the question. The “scene” lasted over an hour.

                        <p>Three Lelamaim Bedouins have been sentenced to hard labour for life for
                            killing a seller of cotton goods on the 20th August last year. As the
                            deceased was walking from the village of Abou Khalil to Beni-Rafr in
                            company with his servant, they were attacked by these three Bedouins.
                            The cotton-seller was killed and the servant fainted. The Bedouins took
                            all that they could lay their hands on and escaped but were soon
                            captured in Abou Khalil village. Said Hasaan, omdeh of Benii Rafr, on
                            hearing of the murder, promptly surrounded Abou Khalil village (although
                            this was not within his jurisdiction) with bis ghaffirs, and succeeded
                            in arresting the murderers and recovering the stolen property. The ease
                            was tried at Assiout and the Court, on the conclusion of the case,

                    <head>THE COTTON WORM. OPERATIONS AT KAFR KHADR</head>
                    <p>The worm reported at Kafr Khadr, Tantah markas, is pronounced to be the
                        Labhyema esigua. The full-grown worm is considerably smaller than the
                        Agrodis and is green in colour, with a dark line running horizontally along
                        each side. The eggs are laid in the bersim on various kinds of grass, and on
                        the lower side of the cotton leaf. When the eggs are first hatched, the
                        young worms remain together and feed in groups, but after the first few days
                        they stray all over the plant, eating the epidermis of the leaf, which
                        rapidly turns brown and frizzles away. It appears that the worms do not feed
                        during the heat of the day, but go down to the ground, where they take
                        shelter from the sun.</p>
                    <p>At Kafr Khadr the area of 300 feddans, which was badly attacked, has now been
                        cleared by some hundreds of boys, who proceeded to shake the worm off the
                        plants and then pick them off the ground. The young plants, which have
                        suffered considerably, will probably revive, and the crop need not
                        ultimately suffer.</p>
                    <p>The entomologist of the Khedivial Agricultural Society of opinion that these
                        worms, which have now been found among the young cotton, belong to the third
                        brood, and considers it possible that later broods may combine with the true
                        cotton worm in the attack on the cotton plants at a later stage.</p>
                    <p>Careful observation and hand picking, as prescribed for the Prodenia
                        littoralis, or cotton worm proper are necessary, as it is evident that this
                        worm, if neglected, is capable of inflicting very serious damage. </p>
                    <p>In compliance with a request from the Ministry of the Interior, the Imperial
                        Ottoman Bank have placed the services of Mr. Wortabet at their disposal for
                        cotton worm duty. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Wortabet, who had considerable experience in locust plague in Cyprus, was
                        very successful in performing similar work during the locust plague in Egypt
                        last year. </p>

                    <head>CAIRO WATER FAMINE.</head>
                    <p>A Cairo correspondent writes . — We are being visited by one of those heat
                        waves which dwellers in Cairo are accustomed to expect at this season of the
                        year, and it is obvious that at such periods water for domestic purposes
                        becomes our most precious commodity. But as usually happens in this country,
                        when a thing is most urgently needed it it not to be had. It is therefore
                        hardly strange that our water supply has diminished to almost vanishing
                        point. Today (21st) I find there is no water at all. I might mention that
                        daring the last spell of heat a week or so ago the price of ice was
                        quadrupled. I have been frequently told by persons living on the second and
                        third floors of houses in Cairo that habitually and under ordinary
                        circumstances they can only get water during certain hours of the day. They
                        find it useless to complain to the company. That a company earning such
                        enormous profits as the Cairo Water Company, and with a Government
                        representative on the board in the person of Sir Horace Pinching, should
                        thus be permitted to neglect its duty and imperil the health of Egypt’s
                        Capital with impunity, is extraordinary. </p>

                    <p>At dawn yesterday the North German Lloyd S.S. “Rhein" arrived here having on
                        board, in addition to a few ordinary passengers, 1,170 German bluejackets,
                        who proceed to Kiao Ghau to relieve the crews of men-of-war there in
                        commission. Throughout the day, bands of 200 or so, in charge of an officer,
                        roamed about the town evidently much interested in all they saw. They were
                        mostly all young men, apparently going East for the first time. The vessel
                        entered the Canal at midnight.</p>

                        and sick for Odessa, for which port she sailed at dawn today. I was struck,
                        on boarding her, by the seeming comfort with which the men were surrounded.
                        Amongst other things, Russian ladies had provided 400 long cane chairs, and
                        numerous swinging cots were slung about the upper deck</p>

                    <p>The quickest route to Europe from Egypt is destined to be the Pineus, Demirli
                        and Frontier Railway, the construction of which is proceeding steadily, and
                        is in the hands of the “Societe de Travaux pour L’Etranger”. (a Franco
                        British oombination). In Thessaly work is now proceeding on the sections
                        between Pintamilos and Skavamitza, a distance of 13 miles, and between
                        Skavamitza and Demirli, a distance of 10 miles. Later on the line will be
                        continued from Demirli to Larissa, a distance of 28 miles, permission having
                        been already granted by the Greek Government. This section is expected to be
                        completed within about two years. Eventually it is intended to carry the
                        line from Larissa through the Vale of Tempe to connect with the Ottoman
                        railway system. It is not yet, however, definitely settled at what spot the
                        junction will be effected, but it is hoped that the entire undertaking will
                        be completed within five years. The “Societe de Travaux pour L’Etranger”
                        holds a concession from the Greek Government to work the entire line for a
                        period of 50 years. </p>

                    <head>THE SUEZ CANAL SHARES.</head>
                    <p>We published Mr. Greenwood's statements on Friday last on the subject of Sir
                        R Stanton and the Suez Canal shares, and in connection with this matter a
                        correspondent writes as follows to a London contemporary:- </p>
                    <p>No one who has any knowledge of the eminent services of Gen. Sir. E. Stanton
                        as Consul-General of this country in Egypt during the administration of the
                        Khedive Ismail willful to do justice to the filial efforts of Gen. Stanton's
                        son to protect the memory of his distinguished father from any imputation
                        upon the record of one of the most admirable representatives of the best
                        type of the British soldier and gentleman that was ever employed by the
                        State, in the extraordinary difficulties and embarrasments of a complicated
                        diplomatic position. This position Sir E. Stanton was called upon to fill at
                        Cairo at a period to which Mr. Greenwood directed the remarks which he
                        appears to have modified subsequently. In the troublesome epoch of the dual
                        control I know that the intelligence, honesty and admirable directions of
                        Sir E. Stanton's consular action were regarded with confidence by those who,
                        like myself, were acquainted with him and his work. </p>

                    <head>THE IMPENDING BATTLE.</head>
                    <p>Captain Mahan, U S.N., has a long article in the "Times", in which he
                        discusses the problem that Rodjestvensky and Togo must solve. In the course
                        of it he says:-</p>
                    <p>We do not know where Togo is; but we may be sure that, wherever he is, he is
                        thinking hard now, and that his present position is the result of very hard
                        thinking in the past three months, or more, that the Baltic Fleet has been
                        reported coming, and the fall of Port Arthur has left him free. No one of
                        us, deeply interested, but not vitally responsible, can rival the mental
                        processes through which that man, calm, capable, self-possessed, and heroic,
                        must be passing, as he scans in imagination the enemy's designs, and in
                        imagination provides the means of counteracting them.</p>
                    <p>Necessity stimulated invention. He knows that the Russian fleet is in the
                        China Sea; he is assured that it must go to Vladivostok—if it can -aid
                        "that," I can fancy him saying, as Nelson the night before Trafalgar, "that
                        they shall not do, if it be in the power of Nelson and Bronte to prevent
                        them." </p>
                    <p>He "guesses" that the Japanese Admiral is waiting at Kelung, a port on the
                        north coast of Formosa, and that Rodjestvonsky, on his way to Vladivostok,
                        will prefer to pass by daylight in the southern of the two principal
                        channels between Luzon and Formosa, making thence a wide sweep to the
                        eastward of the Japanese islands, where probably the Japanese will be on
                        hand to profit by opportunities, He continues:—</p>
                    <p>The character of the Japanese force, embracing a great superiority of torpedo
                        vessels, and probably of squadron speed, should enable them in many ways to
                        chose the times and Manner of attack ; to refuse their battleships, in which
                        they are inferior, and perhaps to utilise the swiltness of their armoured
                        cruisers, by concentrating them upon a flank of the enemy’s column, and
                        withdrawing them when menaced by the rest of his force.</p>

                    <head>RECORD COTTON SUPPLY.</head>
                    <p>The chances of continued cheap cotton are very favorable. The experts are
                        looking for ward to a big, and even a record, stock in farmers hands at the
                        beginning of the new season on September 1 next. In their latest circular
                        Messrs. Neill Bros', arrive at the conclusion that, even with-this year's
                        commercial crop at over 13,000,000 bales, "everything tends to show, that
                        even this enormous delivery would leave in the country nearly a million
                        bales still undelivered on August 31 next, to swell the total of next
                        season’s crop. And one of their correspondents, Mr. J. W. Soady, writes:-
                        "It is quite possible that over 2 millions of bales will remain in farmers'
                        hands." This view is fortified by that of Mr. Degener-Boning, of Frankfort,
                        who predicts that the stock will reach 2 1/2 million bales, against 458,000
                        bales on September 1 last. If this estimate, be realised, and American
                        production be normal next year, the trade may make up its mind to see
                        considerably lower prices oven than have been touched recently. The only
                        disadvantage attaching to such a state of affairs, from an English point of
                        view, is that it will, perhaps, check somewhat the nascent Imperial cotton-
                        growing industries. </p>

                    <head>FOREIGN AND NATIVE SPIRITS IN INDIA</head>
                    <p>With the excellent object of diminishing drinking habits among te indian
                        masses, the Abkari Department has almost continuously raised the duty on
                        native spirits. In itself, that was wholly laudable, the drink being so
                        cheap; that any native who had a mind to get drunk could manage the debauch
                        for two or three coppers. But the reform unhappily played iuto the hands of
                        the importers and manipulators of foreign intoxicants. A Bombay paper
                        asserts that awful concoctions, labelled brandy, gin, or rum, can now
                        purchased at lower prices than their indigenous rivals, to which the imports
                        are very inferior in wholesomeness and parity. The result is that any gain
                        to temperance concequent on making native spirits dearer is more than
                        balanced by the increased consumption of foreign stimulants. There is a
                        peculiar brew of so-called "champagne” which particularly wins popular
                        favor. It is both sweet and potent, with plenty of effervescence to tickle
                        the native palate, and as the stuff can be bought at lower rates than good
                        toddy or "rasee," those ancient favorites of the Indian bon vivant seem
                        likely to pass entirety out of vogue. When properly manufactured-everything
                        depends that—toddy does not deserve the bad reputation it has acquired among
                        Europeans. Jos Sedley, no mean judge, appears to have regarded it as the
                        finest of all spirits for conversion into punch, and although he
                        occasionally suffered after taking too much, there is no evidence of any
                        permanent injury to his constitution.</p>

                    <head>GERMANY'S NEXT NAVAL PROGRAMME.</head>
                    <p>The "Preussische Korrespondenz." learns from a trustworthy source that the
                        German nival programme which is to be published next autumn will not
                        contain, proposals for the reconstruction of the present battleships, and
                        that there is no intention to change the type of the German battleships. But
                        the loading naval circles in Germany are unanimous in the view that it is
                        absolutely necessary German warships should be built with more speed, and
                        that a larger type of warship should be laid down for the German Navy, as it
                        is agreed generally that in both respects Germany will have to follow sooner
                        or later the example set by other Powers. However, a reform of the Imperial
                        finances is necessary before there can be any question about extending the
                        naval programme as laid down by law already. In pointing out that while it
                        takes a German yard about 35 months to build a battleship of 13,000 tons’
                        displacement, an English shipbuilding yard can turn out a large battleship
                        of about 20,000 tons' displacement iN ten months, the journal referred to
                        says that the time required for preparing the building material is not taken
                        into account in England, while it is in German yards. Hence the great
                        difference.</p>

                    <head>A ROYAL SECRET.</head>
                    <p>An extraordinary law suit was decided in Paris on Saturday week, in the
                        strictest sense, in camera. As might have been expected, the secret—that of
                        a dead king—which it was desired to keep, was blown to the public, almost
                        before the decision was given. The late King Alfonso XII. of Spain left, it
                        appears, two natural sous, whose mother was the celebrated Spanish singer
                        Senorita Elena Sauz. At the late King's death, a sum of £20,000 was placed
                        in a certain Paris bank, and the interest was to be paid for the benefit of
                        the two sons, who are now known as M.M. Fernand and Henri Sanz Martinez de
                        Aruzala. They are French citizens. The mother, as a condition of this
                        subvention, agreed to keep secret the paternity of her sons, and did so
                        until recently, when the bank ceased to pay the interest. Then the sons took
                        action, the bank was ordered to pay as before, together with all
                        arrears.</p>

                    <p>Bubonic plague has recently broken out in Rangoon, Burmah. Hitherto Burmah
                        has remained entirely free from this disease owing to the stringent measures
                        which are adopted to prevent any case of plague entering its ports
                        undetected. Passengers arriving there from Indian ports are subjected to a
                        rigorous medical examination, and are compelled to pay daily visits to a
                        medical officer for a period of ten days after their arrival. </p>
                    <p>It is interesting to note that the deaths from plague are almost entirely

                        to perpetrate inhuman and revolting acts upon the native Chinese. Upon one
                        occasion the prisoner ordered them to roast a Chinese baby in the street at
                        Pao-ting-fu. Some adult natives were buried alive up to the waist and then
                        flogged to death. Tbe prisoner smiled while these and similar horrors were

                    <p>Geologists are puzzling over an iron bolt ten inches long, and an inch in
                        diameter, which has been discovered in the fossil beds near where the
                        diplodoens, presented by Mr Carnegie to the Pittsburg Museum, was found. It
                        is not of modern manufacture, and it give, a peculiar silvery ring when
                        struck. The suggestion that it has been placed in the mesozoic formation, in
                        which it was found, by human agency, is scouted as impracticable The
                        presence of the bolt is difficult to reconcile with the accepted theories of
                        the first appearance of man on earth, as the formation goes back for

                    <p>The war is the Far East is absorbing so much attenttion that the evolution
                        which is going on in China is (says "Egineering") apt to be overlooked. The
                        war itself is rapidly changing conditions, and unless British engineers and
                        merchants adapt themselves to the altered circumstances, they will find
                        themselves left out in the cold. This is specially true of the Upper Yangtse
                        Provinces which have always been looked upon as the part of China in which
                        Britain had its greatest interests. For some time past, however, a great
                        deal of attention has been paid to these provinces by Continental mining
                        engineers. Some six weeks before the expedition with which Lieutenant
                        Colonel Manifold was connected, two French engineers pissed through the same
                        districts, and ten months before that a party of three had also visited the
                        district. Subsequent to the British expedition, separate parties of Belgian,
                        American, and French engineers have been prospecting. Lieutenant Colonel
                        Manifold hass expressed the hope that those interested in British mining
                        enterprises in China wonld investigate into the prospects which those
                        regions hold out, for there appears to be little doubt that the prospects of
                        mineral wealth are worthy of their attention. </p>

                    <head>REFORM IN RUSSIA.</head>
                    <p>It is worthy of note, as a correspondent of the "Times" recently pointed out,
                        that while the Russian censorship is supposed to have been relaxed, not a
                        word has been suffered to appear about the Zemstvo Congress. Not even a
                        quotation has been published regarding it from the foreign papers. Yet we
                        hear day by day of outrages, workmen's risings, and other symptoms of
                        agitation. The correspondent in question takes the fact as bearing, on the
                        whole, a favorable significance. The outlook, he thinks, though gloomy, is
                        not as desperate as it appears to foreign critics. "Unless the Government
                        introduces sweepingly coercive and repressive measures, the chances are in
                        favour of evolution, not revolution." This is what the best friends of
                        Russia would hope to see coming to pass, but the coercion and repression
                        which forbid the expectation are just what appears to most of us to be in
                        evidence just now. The events which have occurred, and are occurring every
                        day, in Warsaw and other towns in Poland are unmistakable signs of it, and
                        we may well believe that much as comes to our knowledge, it is not by any
                        means the whole. It is doubtless but a small proportion of the outbreaks of
                        disorder and the ruthless measures of repression adopted which find their
                        way into the paper. There is no sign, so far as the ordinary sources of
                        information may be relied upon, that a new policy has come into favor. In a
                        word, we can discern no indication that evolution is likely to take the
                        place of revolution. The optimists admit that exiled labour leaders continue
                        to spread Social Democratic doctrine in the villages, and by means of lying
                        proclamations to divert popular opinion against the Jews and reformers.</p>

                    <head>THE KAISER’S BOMBSHELL.</head>
                    <p>Some stir was caused by the Kaiser's latest speech, in which he was reported
                        as having said very unkind things about the debaucheries of Russian officers
                        as a factor in their defeats by the Japanese. All things considered, it
                        seemed unlikely that even the Kaiser would have put things quite in that
                        way. But the reports published by the German newspapers do not alter the
                        case materially. The Emperor's remarks, claims the semi-official
                        "Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung," have some of them been distorted, others
                        are an invention. But in the 'Strassburger Post" his words, though more
                        allusive, are none the less definite. Officers, he is stated to have said,
                        should work hard and go early to bed instead of seeking enervating
                        pleasures. The present war exemplifies this— the Russian officers' corps has
                        completely failed. "My son,” he added, "has told me how the Russian officers
                        bought up all the champagne at Kiao-chan”. That is a German account, written
                        under the fear of all the pains and penalties that hang over the head of an
                        editor in the Fatherland. The language is less lurid than in the first
                        reports, but the meaning is identical, and the Kaiser must, it seems, be
                        credited once and for all with one more of his characteristic bombshells.
                        The result remains to be seen.</p>

                    <p>A shocking accident has befallen the Spanish hamlet of Villa Manregne, in New
                        Castile. The children of the village were at play, and formed a procession,
                        which marched along the wide plain towards the mountains, where they were
                        espied by a herd of young bulls being reared for the arena. The brutes,
                        about 200 in number, at once charged in a body upon the little intruders,
                        who were swept in their terror-stricken flight into a narrow defile, where
