                    <p>Some time has elapsed since Cairo was termed 'the Grave of the Soul,' and
                        before attending the obsequies of our own morals, we wish to flute a wild
                        carol. The division of upper Cairene society into hostile circles is a
                        touching tribute to its own vitality, and day by day the lines of each
                        become more clearly marked. That these circles are fully outlined</p>

                    <p>is obvious. In many cases restless spirits may be seen who would intrude into
                        an alien circle, if their own efforts could give them sufficient momentum.
                        If it were ordained that these circles could be self-supporting, lighted
                        with a kindled flame of brotherhood and Christian feel-ing, each might
                        revolve in hostile ecstacy. But the demands of actual life are constantly
                        bringing these circles into rude conflict, in which sanctimonious tact alone
                        prevents a sharer shock. The construction of dinner parties is a severe
                        trial of calculating powers, as the position of each entity must be
                        established. When contamination and moral repining result from a confusion
                        of circles, when the enemy of a circlr is this far outcast to all within in,
                        surely the irony is grim. Many a tear has bedewed this fair city, many a
                        bitter word has floated into the genial air, through a mistaken introduction
                        and a momentary slip. 'Hinc illae lacrimae.'</p>
                    <p>The strain of the hidden warfare is intense. Is our natural intelligence so
                        great that it can be appied undimished to these tortuous problems ? By all
                        means let us cut ourselves off from inferior circles, but let there not be
                        dissensions in the higher spheres; let us be rude to each in a cheerful and
                        brotherly spirit, neither sparing not looking for mercy. Let us not twist
                        our tongues and gibe unseen, but rather exchange grimaces before all men.
                        Lus us all race and shriek together, when once admitted to these higher
                        circles. Let us not cluck and chatter in chosen haunts, but rather flutter,
                        however helplessly, along the high-ways of existance. It is not a question
                        of frantic affections and wild enthusiasms but of rational disinterestedness
                        and fellow-feeling. Our doors need not be open to all, but those who enter
                        need not clothe themselves with smooth veneer and rigid rectitude of mein.
                        Use the pitchfork only when nature is impossible. "Know thyself and thou

                    <head>Turkish Reform and Finance</head>
                    <p>The Porte has just informed the Powers of Europe,through the medium of the
                        Austrian and Russian Ambassadors, that the partial execution of the reforms
                        demanded has caused a deficit in the finances of Macedonie. It, therefore,
                        proposes to raise the Customs duties from eight to eleven per cent, and
                        Austria and Russia have agreed to consent to this is the Porte will accept
                        the scheme of financial reform which was put forward, and will employ the
                        money as the Powers desire.If it is once realised in Europe that finance is
                        the key of the whole Near Eastern Ques-tion it is possible that some advance
                        may be made. It is the miserable state of the Otto-man treasury which has
                        brough about the whole affair, and the extortions of the tax collector are
                        the root of all evil and dis-content. The Governer of a province has to
                        remit a certain sum to Constantinople every year, and also to pay his
                        oficials and his soldiers, and,what is moe important to him, himself. He
                        farms out the rvenues of his province to men who exact far more than they
                        ought, and who make a very good thing out of it. The Vali Pasha sends the
                        necessary amount to Constantinople, helps himself liberally, and assigns the
                        rest to his officers and officials, the troops, as a rule, coming off with
                        next to nothing. The conse-quence is that two parties are dissatisfied; the
                        peasants, who are exorbitantly fleeced, and the petty officials and soldiers
                        who cannot get their pay. If once the Turkish finances were, like the
                        Egyptian, placed on a sound basis, all this discontent would dis-appear. But
                        as this would run counter to the policy of Austria and Russia, the needed
                        reform will never take place.</p>

                        Florio- Rnbattino Company, advised by telephone, went at once to the Port

                        for Bombay at 7 a.m. to day. She is the fourth B.I. turbine steamer that has
                        passed through the Canal, destined for the company's mail service on toe
                        Indian ooast. Her speed is 18.6 knots.</p>
                    <p>The Danish steamer "Excellence Plesca," which grounded in the Canal last
                        Monday afternoon, is still fast in spite of toe efforts of tug "Titan" to

                    <p>Congdon a Houghton</p>
                    <p>This morning, the oivil aotion brought by Mr. Congdon of Cairo qgainst Mr.
                        Wm. Houghton on aocount of an alleged malicious and libellous artiole which
                        appeared in the "Egyptian Graphio," cam* on for hearing before Mr. A. D.
                        Alban at H.B.M.'s Consular Court. Maitre Cuppa appeared for the plaintiff,
                        while Mr. Houghton oondneted his own de­fence. £500 damages were
                        claimed.'</p>
                    <p>On the opening of the proceedings the judge stated that in all civil actions
                        of £500 dama­ges or over, the provincial oourt was obliged to report the
                        commencement of the aotion to the Supreme Court, which would decide whether
                        it should hear the case itself or leave it to be heard by assessors at the
                        provincial oourt.</p>
                    <p>The defendant then put in a complaint that oounsel for plaintiff bad visited
                        a number of barristers and had shown them a scurrilous broadsheet, with a
                        view to prevent them from giving him legal assistance. Counsel for the
                        plaintiff stated he had only approached Mr. Rizzo, and in that case merely
                        as a friend, to see if any honorable settlement oon Id be arrived at. Mr.
                        Rizzo stated that Maitre Cuppa had seen him as a friend and had endeavoured
                        to obtain an amicable settle­ment</p>
                    <p>The judge ruled that Maitre Cuppa had done nothing that oould in any way be
                        regarded as unprofessional After some further protests by defendant, the
                        judge asked him to state the main lines of his defenoe. Defendant asked the
                        judge to dismiss the case on the ground that no demand had been made for an
                        apology. Thi 8 was deqlined.</p>
                    <p>Defendant went on to object to the wording of the writ, whioh, he contended,
                        did not obarge him with publishing the alleged libel, and did not state that
                        the words were written of or oonoerning the plaintiff. He further con­tended
                        that the oontext of the alleged libel which was not set out, substantially
                        a'ters the nature of the words set forth in the statement of claim. In
                        addition, he stated that the case should be barred as it had already been
                        heard criminally. He quoted Mr. Blake Odgers' standard work (3rd edition) on
                        the law of libel in support of this.</p>
                    <p>The last contention was disallowed.</p>
                    <p>Defendant then stated the remaining heads of his defence, saying that he
                        relied on a notice dated 14th March, and sent tfi Mr. Congdon on that date,
                        and dnly received by him. He denied the publication of the alleged libel and
                        did not admit having written it. He further offered to show that it got into
                        the paper by aocident, having been pnt on the deferred file, and that he had
                        no control over its insertion, having already decided to leave the staff of
                        the "Egyptian Graphio," and having already written a letter giving his
                        resignation.</p>
                    <p>These being the main heads of Mr. Hough­ton's defenoe, the case was then
                        adjourned pending the receipt of instructions from the Supreme Court at
                        Constantinople, until Saturday, April 15.</p>
                    <p>At the close of the proceedings, defendant accused plaintiff and his counsel
                        ot having sent a copy of the broad-sheet oomplained of to a prominent
                        Government officiaL This was denied by Mr. Congdon and his counsel, and the
                        accusation was withdrawn.</p>

                        the! (inclusions shown in toe following note, and a appendices, submitted by
                        Sir William larstin, Adviser to the Ministry of Publio forks:—</p>
                    <p>The question of raising the Assouan dam, and hereby increasing the volume of
                        water stored i the reservoir, has, for some time, engaged be attention of
                        the Irrigation Servioe.</p>
                    <p>In my recent report upon the Upper Nile lasin, (1) I discussed Sir William
                        Willoocka's reposals regarding this point, and agreed with im in
                        reoommending that the existing dam bonld be raised, so as to enable it to
                        hold up rater to R.L 112, or six metres above the resent maximum level
                        permitted in the re- srvoir. In the report in question, I gave my aasons for
                        making this reoominendation, and eed not, consequently, recapitulate them
                        ere. Before making this proposal I had itisfied myself, through the
                        calculations y Mr. Webb and his engineers, that according > all accepted
                        theories regarding dan construe- on, the footer of safety was sufficient to
                        permit f the dam being raised to the height proposed, ithout risk of failure
                        to the struoture.</p>
                    <p>I say "according to .all acoepted theories sgarding dam construction," as, at
                        the time rhen I wrote my report, and Mr. Webb work- d ont his calculations,
                        neither of us had been affirmed that any new theory regarding the tability
                        of masonry dams had been put for­ward. We consequently applied, in this in-1
                        tanoe, that made use of by the International lommission of
                        Engineers—appointed in 1894 J</p>
                    <p>o examine the Nile reservoir projects and]</p>
                    <p>rdinarily adopted in the case of dams, namely bal if the resultant of the
                        forces lies well rithin the "middle third" of the base—so that, nder the
                        assumed theory, no tension will ocur on the masonry—and if the weight of he
                        dam is sufficient to guard against sliding, afoty will have been
                        assured.</p>
                    <p>Several months after my report had been ublished, and Mr. Webb's calculations
                        had een submitted to Sir Benjamin for</p>
                    <p>erification, we were informed that the lathematiciana had brought forward a
                        new heory regarding the stresses upon masonry am8 and that the question had
                        *wnniftfl &amp; ew aspect</p>
                    <p>The whole matter is one of great imporance to every one in Egypt, and I
                        have ome to the conclusion that the best plan o follow is to take the public
                        into our oon-1 idenoe, so to speak, and to frankly state how he case
                        stands.</p>
                    <p>Sir Benjamin Baker's report, attached to his note, folly explains his views
                        regarding he state of the existing dam ftlMf tk^, [uestion of raising
                        it.</p>
                    <p>I think, however, that I had better go , little further in my explanations
                        than he ias done, and briefly relate the circumstances rhioh have impelled
                        him to advise us to uspend the raising of the Assouan dam for he present</p>
                    <p>I will consequently go back to the beginning f the matter. The first
                        intimation that we eceived of the existence of any new theories egarding the
                        stability of masonry dam. wa8 .private letter from 8ir Benjamin Baker, lated
                        October the 14th, 1904. This merely tated theta new theory had been brought
                        orward by the mathematicians, and that the natter was under consideration.

                    <p>espondence followed ; with the result that </p>
                    <p>rith the approval of the Egyptian Government -I requested Sir Benjamin Baker
                        to come ont o E/ypt, and after a personal study of the iffect of two years'
                        regulation on the Assouan lam—give ns the benefit of his experience, ind
                        advise us as to what should be done. The ■eeult of hia examination is the
                        report attached o my present note. Before I discuss it, I will mry briefly,
                        attempt to give an idea of what he new theoiy regarding dams actually
                        is.</p>
                    <p>It has been bronght forward by Mr. L. W. \tcherley, Demonstrator in applied
                        mechanics so University CoUege, London, and by Mr. Karl Pearson, F.R.8.,
                        Professor of applied mathematics and mechanics of the same Institu­tion.
                        (2)</p>
                    <p>The very high reputation attained by both these gentlemen as mathematicians
                        is suffi- lient wairant that any theqry advanced by them must merit toe most
                        serious attention.</p>
                    <p>Briefly stated, their theory is:—that the vertical sections of a dam, under
                        water pres- mre, are more severely strained than the horizontal sections,
                        and that, while a dam, designed under the rules hitherto applied,' may be
                        safe as regards cracking horizontally, it may nevertheless be liable to do
                        so verti- sally.</p>
                    <p>The calculations brought forward by Messrs. Atcherlejt and Pearson, to prove
                        their theory, are extremely abstruse, and difficult to follow. Any one
                        wishing to study them can do bo by obtaining the pamphlet in question.</p>
                    <p>The matter is now engaging the study and attention of the principal
                        mathematicians and hydraulic engineers in England and in Franoe| and no
                        doubt will give eanse to much discus­sion. Eventually, it is to be supposed
                        that the specialists, in both countries, will arrive at a conclusion upon
                        this most important theory which affects all existing dams, and which</p>

                        calculations y Mr. Webb and his engineers, that according > all accepted
                        theories regarding dan construe- on, the footer of safety was sufficient to
                        permit f the dam being raised to the height proposed, ithout risk of failure
                        to the struoture.</p>
                    <p>I say "according to .all acoepted theories sgarding dam construction," as, at
                        the time rhen I wrote my report, and Mr. Webb work- d ont his calculations,
                        neither of us had been affirmed that any new theory regarding the tability
                        of masonry dams had been put for­ward. We consequently applied, in this in-1
                        tanoe, that made use of by the International lommission of
                        Engineers—appointed in 1894 J</p>
                    <p>o examine the Nile reservoir projects and]</p>
                    <p>rdinarily adopted in the case of dams, namely bal if the resultant of the
                        forces lies well rithin the "middle third" of the base—so that, nder the
                        assumed theory, no tension will ocur on the masonry—and if the weight of he
                        dam is sufficient to guard against sliding, afoty will have been
                        assured.</p>
                    <p>Several months after my report had been ublished, and Mr. Webb's calculations
                        had een submitted to Sir Benjamin for</p>
                    <p>erification, we were informed that the lathematiciana had brought forward a
                        new heory regarding the stresses upon masonry am8 and that the question had
                        *wnniftfl &amp; ew aspect</p>
                    <p>The whole matter is one of great imporance to every one in Egypt, and I
                        have ome to the conclusion that the best plan o follow is to take the public
                        into our oon-1 idenoe, so to speak, and to frankly state how he case
                        stands.</p>
                    <p>Sir Benjamin Baker's report, attached to his note, folly explains his views
                        regarding he state of the existing dam ftlMf tk^, [uestion of raising
                        it.</p>
                    <p>I think, however, that I had better go , little further in my explanations
                        than he ias done, and briefly relate the circumstances rhioh have impelled
                        him to advise us to uspend the raising of the Assouan dam for he present</p>
                    <p>I will consequently go back to the beginning f the matter. The first
                        intimation that we eceived of the existence of any new theories egarding the
                        stability of masonry dam. wa8 .private letter from 8ir Benjamin Baker, lated
                        October the 14th, 1904. This merely tated theta new theory had been brought
                        orward by the mathematicians, and that the natter was under consideration.

                    <p>espondence followed ; with the result that </p>
                    <p>rith the approval of the Egyptian Government -I requested Sir Benjamin Baker
                        to come ont o E/ypt, and after a personal study of the iffect of two years'
                        regulation on the Assouan lam—give ns the benefit of his experience, ind
                        advise us as to what should be done. The ■eeult of hia examination is the
                        report attached o my present note. Before I discuss it, I will mry briefly,
                        attempt to give an idea of what he new theoiy regarding dams actually
                        is.</p>
                    <p>It has been bronght forward by Mr. L. W. \tcherley, Demonstrator in applied
                        mechanics so University CoUege, London, and by Mr. Karl Pearson, F.R.8.,
                        Professor of applied mathematics and mechanics of the same Institu­tion.
                        (2)</p>
                    <p>The very high reputation attained by both these gentlemen as mathematicians
                        is suffi- lient wairant that any theqry advanced by them must merit toe most
                        serious attention.</p>
                    <p>Briefly stated, their theory is:—that the vertical sections of a dam, under
                        water pres- mre, are more severely strained than the horizontal sections,
                        and that, while a dam, designed under the rules hitherto applied,' may be
                        safe as regards cracking horizontally, it may nevertheless be liable to do
                        so verti- sally.</p>
                    <p>The calculations brought forward by Messrs. Atcherlejt and Pearson, to prove
                        their theory, are extremely abstruse, and difficult to follow. Any one
                        wishing to study them can do bo by obtaining the pamphlet in question.</p>
                    <p>The matter is now engaging the study and attention of the principal
                        mathematicians and hydraulic engineers in England and in Franoe| and no
                        doubt will give eanse to much discus­sion. Eventually, it is to be supposed
                        that the specialists, in both countries, will arrive at a conclusion upon
                        this most important theory which affects all existing dams, and which</p>
                    <p>must influence all future design, for ,uoh Meanwhile, nothing oan be done
                        but awaitthe resnhs of further investigation.</p>
                    <p>I will now briefly dismiss Sir Benjamin Ba- ker s report upon the Assouan</p>
                    <p>Firstiy, that no raising of the dam should be undertaken, until, at least two
                        saaatta' experience of the effect of the protective JET (now in

                        dam due to the rush of the water through the</p>

                    <p>Another cause for satisfaction in his renort is toe statement that the
                        oaloulatio^S nutted to him by the Government^Lrin«« for the raising of the
                        dam, woe all respects, and that, according to past pr^ tu», the water might
                        have been Proposed, withal oldinary factor of safety.</p>
                    <p>Before alluding to the questions entailed by the delay m raising the dam, I
                        will very briefly desonbe what it is proposed to d^ during the next two
                        seasons, in the wav if protecting the rook, downstream of the din! from the
                        scour caused by the terrific rushof the water through the *ln.«tm 01</p>

                        current year,and previous to Sir arrival, Mr. Webb submitted to protect
                        works alone, for which the necessary credit was granted scale, and that it
                        shaU be oompfoSfoS 8horta space of time aa is possible. TWh these
                        recommendations will be follow. That such protective oessaiy is not
                        surprising. Anyone whTh« watched the volume of water tearirur thro™k</p>
                    <p>have wondered that any material could W stand snchasuooeseion .of knock, and
                        as do the rocks below the dam. The water must inevitably fiud out any
                        figures „ crevices in the rook-eurfaoe, and, if the latter is not absolutely
                        sound throughout, speedily force its way through the weak point*, and
                        disintegrate the superincumbent imlm.</p>
                    <p>There is, however, not the slightest cause for snxmty in the future. The
                        mason* apron wdl be so constructed, that the surfoce, fipon which the water
                        folia, wiR be as smooth aTit</p>
                    <p>11^ £mSl" ^ ne rnsh of water will be distributed over a great length and
                        width of apron, audit wdl be pomible, by mani- pula ting the sluices, to
                        inspect aU portions of the apron continually, throughout the winter and
                        summer months-when the aotion is at its greatest</p>
                    <p>The only other recommendation made by Sir Benjamin consists of certain m.»H
                        modi­fications in some of toe lower sluice gates, by which their working
                        will be fimilitat work will be earned out in aooordanoe with his Hews.</p>
                    <p>I have now to treat of a subject of much importance, namely, the effect that
                        the post­ponement, and the possible abandonment, of the project for raising
                        the dam will produce upon irrigation development in Egypt and the Sudan.</p>
                    <p>We are folly satisfied that the existing dam is secure and safe under all
                        oomUtionTbut a perusal of Sir Benjamin Baker's report will, I think, point
                        to the oonolusion that it is doubt­ful whether, taking into aooount the
                        theorise lately brought forward regarding the stability of masonry dams, he
                        will ever ~r—intend its being raised at all, or at any rate, that ha will
                        only advise that this be done to a very limited extent Under any
                        oiroumstanoee, four yean at least most elapse before any additional water
                        oan be provided for Egypt (8)</p>

                    <p>In my last year's report pjwti the Upper Nile, I outlined sundry projects'
                        for study, by which this end might be attained—notably those for preventing
                        the present wastage of water in the White Nile swamps. A special staff is
                        now at work in the Sudan, studying these different projects. That some one
                        or other of ifeem wil£4vfttuaUy be oarried out I feel confident, but both
                        the studies and the execution of the works must, of necessity, re­quire a
                        long period of time. If then we do not raise the Assouan dam, Egypt will
                        have to wait for several years before any large inoreaso of summer
                        water-supply oan be obtained. It ognapt be maintained that this will
                        seriously affeot the prosperity of the country. It will merely retard
                        its.present phenomenal rate of advanoe. In the meantime, there are many ways
                        in which money oan be beneficially spent., besides the execution of large
                        irrigation sche­mes. One of the most important is the com­pletion and
                        perfecting of the railway system, so as to enable it to take full ad
                        ?antaga»of the large inotaaae pf-produce that yrill, in the near future,
                        hare to be transported.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, I would strongly urge that, for the present, sales of Government
                        land, upon any large scale, should be altogether suspend­ed. In some three
                        years' time, the remodelling werks in Middle Egypt will be completed. These
                        works will result in a very large increase of the area under perennial
                        irrigation, and there will be, practically, no surplus water available for
                        land reclamation elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>No harm can be done by a postponement of the sale of land. The latter will
                        not decrease in value, in fact, by waiting, it will probably rise in price.
                        There is no urgent necessity for raisiog money by this means, and I can see
                        no object in selling it before water is available for its irrigation. I am
                        aware that many in- tendingpurchasers are wilting to make it a oondition of
                        the sale, that, if the land be deli­vered to them now, they will make no.
                        olaira for summer water, and will wait until the Government is io a position
                        to give it to them.</p>
                    <p>I consider, however, that sales, under such conditions, should not
                        beenoouraged. It can­not be pretended that they are to the advan­tage of the
                        Government—-they must necessa­rily introduce an element of speculation into
                        the bargain—and they will largely inorease the difficulties of the
                        Irrigation Service.</p>
                    <p>In the Sudan, the same difficulties, as regards irrigation, will be
                        experienced as in Egypt. No summer water oan be given to that country beyond
                        the quantity, agreed upon by the authorities concerned, which pan be spared
                        from Egypt. I am not talking here of lands lying within the rainy zone,
                        where the periods of cultivation are different from those in Egypt, and
                        where irrigation will not interfere with the water supply of the latter
                        country.</p>
                    <p>As it is necessary to consider the question in all its aspects, I am of
                        opinion that it will be wise now to thoroughly study the cataracts of the
                        Nile, from Wady Haifa to Shablnka, and investigate whether a suitable site
                        for a second dam and reservoir can be fonud in that region, by which means
                        the extra amount of water required could be sfaftsd) supposing that the
                        Assouan dam is not -to be raised. I recommend then that a pro­perly equipped
                        party be despatched for this purpose, at the commencement ot next winter,
                        -and that a detailed, levelled survey be made .of the oataraots. 8uch a work
                        will take at least two yean, and possibly longer, and Should be oommenoed as
                        soon ae possible.</p>
                    <p>As lot^ a* we considered it probable that the Assouan dam would be
                        raised,there was no necessity for suoh a study, but now that there is a
                        doubt of this, it beoomes, to my mind, a matter of urgency. Even after we ha
                        vq, succeedad in'bringing down more water from the Upper Kile, we shall
                        require a power of storing it, as &lt;Baar as possible to the point where it
                        will be required.</p>
                    <p>In the month of February, 1897, I made a summary examination of the cataracts
                        between Wady Haifa and Hannek. My report was pub­lished-in |he shape ofa
                        Blue Book,and I append an eutract from it, to the present note. (4)</p>
                    <p>I therein briefly discussed the different pos­sible sitee.There were
                        objections to all of them, bnt'none of them were insurmountable, and it is
                        almost certain that, somewhere between the aSpond and sixth oataraots, a
                        suitable site— teith good possibilities of stora ge—will be found.</p>

                        with transport and labour. At-the same time; if we renounoe the projeot of
                        rais­ing the dam at Assouan,there is no Other alter­native, and I
                        consequently recommend that -these studies shall be put in hand at an early
                        date.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, although the delay is oerfainly disappointing, and although,
                        if the Assouan dam be not raised, an economical and speedy means of
                        increasing the water supply will be 'lost to Egypt, it oanndt be pretended
                        that any ■serious obstacle will have been caused to the progress of the
                        country. This has been, and continues to be, exceptionally rapid, aud a few
                        years of comparatively slow development need hatfHy be taken into account.
                        -</p>
                    <p>Egypt has got fall value for the money ex­pended upon the Assouan dam, and
                        can, with­out any exceptional hardship, await the time When our studies
                        shall show us which of the different projects is most advisable for
                        execu­tion, as a means of still further increasing the cultivated area.

                    <head>The Discovery at Theben</head>
                    <p>royal treasures of the 18th dynasty</p>
                    <p>Egypt lias ouce more surprised us with an archicological discovery of the
                        first importance. Mr. Theodore M. Davis,whose discovery at the tombs of
                        Thothmes IV. and Queen Hatshepsu at Thebes has already been described in the
                        "Times" of Nov. 24, 1904, has been patiently pursuing his work of removing
                        the mounds of debris in the Valley of the Tombs ol the Kings, nd has just
                        made a discovery there such as not fallen to the lot ot any ex'plorer since
                        .ngypt was opened to European research. He has tound a tomb which has never
                        been visited or plundered since the age of the 18th Dynasty, and is still
                        filled with the royal treasures of a time when Egypt was the mistress of the
                        East and the source of its supply of gold.</p>
                    <p>On Sunday, February 12, ins workmen came ..cross the descending steps of a
                        tomb, midway between the well-known sepulchres of Ramses IV. and Ramses XII.
                        At ihe loot of the steps was a door cut in the rock and blocked with large
                        stones. One or two of these having been removed,a boy was sent through the
                        opening,and quickly emerged with a gaily-painted wand of office in, one hand
                        and the yoke of a chariot, thickly plated with gold.ui theother.Theopeuiug
                        was thereupon widened, and Mr. Davis himself stepped into the space beyond.
                        There he found himself at the head of another flight of rock- cut steps, 20
                        in number, at the end of which was a second door, also blocked vith stones.
                        Here, however, the outer face of the stones wiy still plastered with the mud
                        on which were impressions of a Royal seal with rows ol fe' tered captiVes,
                        while On one of the lower steps the two basins of coarse red ware were
                        lying, &lt;mt of which the mud plaster bad been taken. Higher up, on one of
                        the steps, was a superb pectoral scarab, while on another step was a broken
                        writing palette of alabaster. It was evident that the tomb had been eutered
                        by robbers shortly after its construction; that, having been surprised in
                        their work of plunder, they had fled hastily, leaving some of the objects
                        they had stolen in the vestibule ; and that since that day it had never
                        again been visited by man.</p>
                    <p>Professor Maspero, who happened to be at Luxor at the time, was at ouce
                        communicated with, as well as other museum authorities, and, although the
                        next day was the beginning of the Bairam .holidays, Mr. Davis arranged to
                        have the work of opening the tomb carried on to its completion. It was
                        accordingly opened the following (foy, in the presence of the Duke of
                        Connaught and his suite, and a marvellous sight met the eyes of the
                        fortunate discoverer. The tomb itself was not large, and its walL had never
                        been smoothed or decorated, but it was filled from one end to the other with
                        the Untouched and richest spoil of ancient Egypt. Mummy cases eucrusted with
                        gold, huge alabaster vases of exquisite form, chairs and boxes brilliant
                        with paint and gilding, even a pleasure chariot with its six-spoked wheels
                        still covered fcy their wooden tires/ were lying piled one upon the other in
                        bewildering pro fusion. It was some days belore the band ol exploj-ers qould
                        even a>ce--taiii the full extent of the Jfeasures which the tomb
                        contained.</p>
                    <p>The Sepulchral chamber is about 30 ft. long and 15 ft. wide, the height being
                        no more than 8ft. On the left-hand side ol the eutrance were the two great
                        wooden sarcophagi, painted black and gold, within which the mummy-cases of
                        the occupants of the tomb, a man and woman, had been placed. The cases
                        themselves were double, the outer case beiug completely plated with gold on
                        the outside, except where the face of the mummy was realistically
                        repre­sented, while the,inside was lined with silver. The second case was
                        similarly plated with gold externally, but inside gold-leaf was used instead
                        of silver. On one of the mummies a few objects were discovered such as were
                        usually buried with the dead—a ' heart-scarab" made to imitate lapis-lazuli,
                        another scarab of black-painted wood, a gilded "dad," the model of a hoe,
                        and the like. Over a gilded mask, which must have belonged to one of the
                        mum­mies, a veil of black muslin, or rather crape, was drawn. It is the
                        first time that anything of the kind has been met with in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>The inscriptions on the cases, as well as on other objects found in the tomb,
                        showed to whom it had belonged. It was the burial-place of Yua and Thua, the
                        parents of the famous Queen Teie, the wife of Amon-hotep III. and the mother
                        of the "heretic-King" Amon-hotep IV., of the 18th Dynasty. It was to her
                        teach ing that the religious revolution attempted by her son seems to have
                        been due, and since the disoovery of the cuneiform tablets of Tel el-
                        Amarna, the Assyriologists have believed that she was of Mesopotamian
                        descent This belief is confirmed by the inscriptions found in Mr. Davis's
                        tomb. In these the itiunee of her parents are written in various ways,
                        indicating that there was no fixed spelling of them, and that the Egyptians
                        of the 18th Dynasty had the same difficulty in pronouncing and repro ducing
                        foreign names as their descendants have to-day.</p>
                    <p>'No light, however, is thrown by the inscrip tions upon the parentage of
                        either Yua or his wife. Thua is merely "the chantressof Amon," and it is
                        clear that she and her husband were not of noble, much less of Royal, birth.
                        They</p>
                    <p>post have lived, however, at Thebes with theii</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>daughter after her elevation to the position of "chief wife" of one of the
                        greatest of the Egyp­tian Pharaohs, and here they died while Amon- hotep
                        III. was still on the throne, and the wealth and power of Egypt were still
                        un- ■ liniinished. Queen Teie, with all her influence, hud been unable to
                        overcome the jealousy of the Egyptian aristocracy and include her parents in
                        its ranks, but she revenged herself at their death by giving them the honors
                        of a Royal funeral.</p>
                    <p>Beyond the coffins, at the western end of the tomb, the ground was covered
                        with large sealed jars of wine or oil, and shell-like boxes of black-painted
                        wood, each of which contained a piece of cooked meat, neatly wrapped in
                        black muslin. Planted on the top of them was the chariot, broad enough to
                        hold two parsons, richly painted and enorusted with gold. The leather-work
                        belonging to it is still as fresh as when it was first made. Here also were
                        found the four canopio jars of alabaster in which the entrails of the
                        deceased were deposited. It would be difficult to match them as regards
                        either size or fineness of workmanship. The heads which form their covers
                        are in the best style of Egyptian art, and on being lifted were found to
                        have under them a second set of heads, tli6 latter being of plaster coated
                        with gold. At the eastern end of the tomb two other alabaster vases were
                        discovered, each of them with handles and of exquisite workmanship.</p>
                    <p>This eastern end of the tomb contained a large number of small objects. There
                        were among them seven pairs of sandals, most of them of papyrus, but one of
                        them was of stamped yellow leather and another had been gilded. On the door
                        were numberless boxes, each of them occupied by an "ushebti" figure of
                        considerable size. Many of the "ushebtis" were of wodd, but some were of
                        alabaster, and there were two of gold and two of silver. Here, too, was a
                        second wand of office, together with vases and boxes of gaily-painted wood.
                        Among the boxes perhaps the most interesting is a large "clothes chest" of
                        palmwood and papyrus; it is lined inside with papyrus, has two fasten­ings
                        of string, and contains a second case or shelf with papyrus daps. Apertures
                        have been made in the sides_ for the sake of ventilation.</p>
                    <p>Some of the objects bore the names of Amonhotep III. and his Queen. This was
                        the case, for instance, with a large vase of alabaster, as well as with a
                        sort of box-stool, resplendent with gold and blue enamel, on the cover of
                        which the Kiug is represented as sitting on the hieroglyphic of "gold." On
                        another box, which is fashioned like a small table with legs, the Pharaoh is
                        depicted in the same attitude, yellow paint taking the place of gold on a
                        third box of smaller size. Among minor objects, one of the most beautiful is
                        a Kohl-case of blue faience with the cartouches of the King. Near the latter
                        the gilded handle of a mirror was picked up, together with a stone box,
                        painted white and stuffed with cotton, the lid of which represented a
                        recum­bent mummy with a winged soul on the breast. lu another part of the
                        tomb were two large wigs. (</p>
                    <p>At its eastern extremity there was also a small armchair, the back of which
                        is formed by the dgures of the god Bes and a monkey on either siue of him.
                        Two other armchairs were discovered in the western portion of the tomb. The
                        largest of these, with its seat of inter­laced palm-fibre, is profusely
                        oruameuted with tigures in black and geld. At the back is a double
                        representation of "the eldest daughter of the Kiug, Amon-sit" ; in each
                        representa­tion she is seated on a throne, with a winged solar disk above,
                        and a female slave bringing her the offeriug of a golden collar, while under
                        each arm of the chair are three other female slaves holding up their
                        offerings of rings of gold. An Ascription tells us that the gold had been
                        brought from "the lands of the south." The legs of the chair are modelled
                        after those of an ox, and above each of the front legs is a boss in the form
                        of a human head. There is a second and rather smaller armchair which also
                        belonged to Amon-sit, who was a daughter of Amon-hotep III. On the back of
                        this the Princess is represented sitting with a cat under her chair and a
                        female fan-bearer on either side, while under the arms of the chair is the
                        figure of Bes between two monkeys. The picture of the Princess and her
                        attendants is lined on either side by the so- called Greek tret, an
                        interesting illustration of the intercourse that existed at the time
                        be­tween Egypt and the iEgean. The two chairs of Amon-sit might have been
                        regarded as pre sents from the Princess to the occupants of the tomb, were
                        it not that three funeral biers, and not two ouly, have been found in it.
                        This seems to indioate that the tomb ofYuaand Thus had already been the
                        burial place of s member of the Royal family, and that when al the objects

                        fact—the ostentatious, not to saj vulgar, display of wealth which
                        distinguish© Egyptian society in the later days of the 18tl Dynasty. We had
                        learned from the Tel el Amarna tablets that Egypt was at the time the
                        California of the civilised world—a lam where, as the foreign correspondents

                        was ! nothing, however mean or insignificant, which was not ii'cfu'.ly
                        plated with the gold of the , desert mines. Even the Pharaoh is represent- |
                        ed as seated upon the symbol of "gold,'' and the goddess Isis at the foot of
                        Thua's coffin is pictured in the same position.</p>
                    <p>A pathetic relic of a dead world is a mat of palm fibre on which the figure
                        of Osiris was delineated in soft mould. Seeds were then sown in the mould,
                        and in the green grass which sprung from them after the tomb had been closed
                        and sealed the Egyptians saw an image and earnest of the resurrection. A
                        similar "bed of Osiris" had already been found in the tomb of Amon-hotep II.

                    <p>Although some of the individual objects discovered by Mr. Davis may be
                        matched in previous finds, the discovery, as a whole, far surpasses any that
                        has yet been made in Egypt, and is in the fact the most important ever made
                        there, whether we regard the art and richness of the coffiu&amp;^nd other
                        sepulchral furniture, or the wealth of precious metal that has been lavished
                        upon ' them. The chariot alone, for completeness and beauty of form, is
                        unique. The discovery will not only increase our knowledge of the history
                        and customs of the 18 th Dynasty of Egypt; it must also materially enlarge
                        our conception of the artis­tic taste and skilful workmanship of the ancient

                        shed with 1,000 looms is making a profit of £6,000 a year —something never
                        heard of before in the staple trade of the County Palatine. Opera­tives'
