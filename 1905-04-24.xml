                    <p>This morning’s telegrams state that all the Baltic fleet left
                            <placeName>Kamranh Bay</placeName> on Saturday morning and that in the
                        afternoon of the same day a violent cannonade was heard off the bay. It is
                        believed that the engagement was between the Russians and the scouts of
                            <persName>Togo's</persName> fleet. If so we are on the verge of the
                        greatest naval battle which has been fought for just one hundred years.
                        Since the French and Spanish fleets went down to destruction, before the
                        genius of Nelson, and the valour of British sailors, off <placeName>Cape
                            Trafalgar</placeName> in the Autumn of 1805, there has been no pitched
                        battle on the seas between two first-class navies. Navarino, in 1827, when
                        the Turkish squadron was destroyed by the combined Western fleets, hardly
                        counts, for one of the combatants was so hopelessly overmatched. The
                        fighting at sea in the American Civil War, though interesting, was not very
                        important, because it occurred in the infancy of the steamship. Nor was
                        anything of serious moment achieved on the water in the Crimean War or the
                        Franco-German War. The battle of Lissa, between the Austrians and Italians,
                        in 1866, was the only example of a considerable naval conflict, before the
                        battle of the Yalu eleven years ago, when the Japanese crushed the Chinese
                        marine, and that of Santiago, when the Americans disposed of the Spaniards
                        off the Cuban coast.</p>
                    <p>None of these transactions, however, will in the least compare with the
                        impending engagement for which the world is waiting with bated breath. Here,
                        at last, we may witness a collision between two great fleets of first-class
                        battleships and armoured cruisers, both equipped in the latest fashion, and
                        commanded by officers thoroughly familiar with the handling of modern
                        weapons of destruction. The spectacle maybe appalling, but it is assuredly
                        fascinating. Most people believe that when the battle does take place it
                        will end in a victory for the Japanese. If the Russian fleet were wiped out
                        completely, nobody would be greatly surprised. Yet there is an element of
                        uncertainty which must not be altogether ignored. The Russians are brave
                        men, and though their fleet has been strategically mishandled throughout the
                        war, the achievements of single ships have done something to redeem its
                        reputation. Courage the Russians do not lack, nor obstinate endurance in the
                        face of danger. There is some sturdy seamanship among the Baltic sailors
                        under <persName>Rodjestvenaky's</persName> pennants, and it is of course
                        possible that he may have a naval genius or two, some Paul Jones or
                        Dundonald among his captains. On paper his fleet is formidable enough. His
                        four great ironclads are pretty nearly equal to the best of<persName>
                            Togo's</persName>, and the actual weight of metal, discharged by those
                        of his ships which can “lie in the line,” is superior to that of his
                        opponent. But as this war has shown, it is the man behind the gun, and the
                        man in the engine room, who count. <persName>Togo's</persName> vessels are
                        commanded by officers who thoroughly understand their buisness and manned by
                        crews of unequalled discipline and determination, it will be strange indeed
                        if this magnificent force, full of energy and patriotism, does not reproduce
                        on the sea the triumphs won for the banner of the sun-rays by land. We are
                        at any rate on the eve of another of those memmorable historic events with
                        which we have been almost sated during the past twelve months.</p>

                        <p>—The recent heat wave, which, fortunately, was of short duration, was
                            greatly felt in <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>, where on Saturday the
                            registered shade temperature reached 38 deg. Centigrade, or a shade over
                            100 deg. Fahrenheit. The night of Saturday was an exceedingly oppressive
                            one, and at half-past nine o’clock an outdoor temperature of 91 deg. was
                            registered, while indoors the thermometer stood at 77, necessitating a
                            reversal of the usual practice of opening the windows to obtain a breath
                            of fresh air. The temperature in other parts of Egypt may be seen by
                            reference to our daily weather report. Compared with
                                <placeName>Cairo</placeName> and many places in Upper Egypt, the

                            will be obtained. There is also to be added a new and spacious
                            dining-room capable of seating comfortably from 50 to 60 guests. We
                            understand that those improvements are shortly to be taken in hand, and
                            that precautions will be taken for the work to be done without any

                        during the heat wave we have had for the last four days deserves to be made
                        public. At 5 p.m. to-day (Saturday) I rang up the company informing them
                        that the supply to my house had been cut off since 10 a.m. The prompt but
                        calm reply was, “Vous n'etes pas le seul.",.. “(Cesta cause des tortes
                        chaleurs.” Nor was there a promise of our quarter getting water soon...
                        "peut-etre peudant la nuit; ou demain matin." Under the circumstances, it
                        was hopeless to appeal to such utter indifference. I bad not bad any ice for
                        three days either, although I had written and telephoned to the Ice Company.
                        I therefore went in person to the Ice Company’s office, but I soon realised
                        the situation when I saw the number of idle carts and men waiting with empty
                        bags. The situation was still more strongly impressed upon me when I heard
                        the telephone messages. Finally, when I got a hearing, the reply was, ‘
                        Monsieur ; e'est la laute de la Cie des Eaux" etc. I did not stay there much
                        longer; the air was too hot all round.</p>

                    <head>BANDMANN OPERA COMPANY. ‘‘A COUNTRY GIRL."</head>
                    <p>Saturday night was torrid : the khamseen blew as vigorously as ever and the
                        collapse of some of the actors and many of the audience would have
                        astonished no one. None the less the Khedivial Opera House at Cairo was
                        crowded, and the actors and actresses survived a terrific heat and an
                        inconsiderate number of encores, though it would be carrying compliment too
                        for to say that none of the voices remained unaffected by the heat,
                        especially towards the end of the first act.</p>
                    <p>“A Country Girl” is perhaps the weakest of recent Edwardesian musical plays.
                        The plot is naively simple, and the music, while including a few catchy
                        airs, is of no particular merit, and as the piece was written for a group of
                        well-known actors and actresses,— we need only mention <persName>Mr. Huntley
                            Wright</persName>, <persName>Mr. Rutland Barrington</persName>,
                            and<persName> Miss Evie Green</persName>,— it is obvious that it can
                        only be made a success by sheer “ go ’’ on the part of the performers. Given
                        the requisite amount of vigour and voice on their part, good staging and
                        pretty dresses, the most childishly simple piece will attain a considerable
                        success, and if critics urge that the music or the plot or both are weak,
                        the answer is obvious. The Englishman as a rule regards theatre-going as a
                        sedative: he wants to hear something that will allay and not stimulate
                        thought, and in the meantime please his eye and tickle his humour, and for
                        such purpose the “musical comedy" is a most effective weapon. It follows
                        that in the average musical comedy— we are not discussing Gilbert and
                        Sullivan— the acting is everything, and the actors who make the piece a
                        success are paid the sincere compliment of painstaking and often successful
                        imitation by all who follow them. The brief life of such pieces, and the
                        fact that a popular favorite sets the fashion, make it hopeless to expect an
                        original reading of a part, and with this we have no quarrel; all of us have
                        not the chance hearing <persName>Miss Erie Greene</persName> or
                            <persName>Mr. Rutland Barrington</persName> in their latest successes,
                        but when a good travelling company visits us, we have at least the
                        satisfaction of watching a good imitation of their methods.</p>
                    <p>So on Saturday night <persName>Mr. Sinclair Cotter</persName>, modelling his
                        style on that of <persName>Mr. Huntley Wright</persName>, kept the house
                        hugely amused, showed an activity with the thermometer at 94 % that would
                        have done credit to one who had spent a lifetime under the Equator, and
                        responded to encores which were really heartless with the utmost good nature
                        and readiness. <persName>Mr. Lester</persName>, as the <persName>Rajah of
                            Bhong</persName>, had evidently watched <persName>Mr. Rutland
                            Barrington</persName>, and <persName>Mr. B. Roberts</persName> gave a
                        capital rendering of <persName>Sir Joseph Verity</persName>.
                            <persName>Geoffrey Chaltoner's</persName> part does not give much scope
                        for action; no doubt <persName>Mr. O’Connor</persName> did his best and his
                        singing was decidedly good; his voice carries well, and he never let himself
                        go at the wrong moment. <persName>Miss Corlass</persName> and <persName>Miss
                            Carkeeh</persName> were both a little out of voice at the start, and the
                        same remark applies to <persName>Miss Marie Elba</persName> (The Princess),
                        but there was every excuse for that, and they acted and looked well,
                        especially <persName>Miss Corlass</persName>, whose enunciation, by the way,
                        was particularly clear and graceful Miss Morra (Mme. Sophie) also made a
                        very pleasant impression on the audience, and her "Chicken Dance" with Barry
                        was capitally done. Before we end these notes we must not forget to mention
                        that “<persName>Lady Anchestor</persName>,” whose name we cannot find on the
                        programme, sang us “Scenes that are brightest," an interpolation from
                        Maritana, and sang it charmingly.</p>

                        communicants. The music was excellent. Indeed, <persName>Mr.

                        heartily joined in by the congregation. The church was decorated with palms,

                    <head>EGYPTIAN COTTON MILLS WINDING UP SUGGESTED.</head>
                    <p>The sixth annual general meeting of the shareholders of the Egyptian Cotton
                        Mills Ltd. was held on the 14th inst. in Wineheiter House, Old Broad-street,
                            <placeName>London</placeName>, RC.</p>
                    <p>The Secrecy (<persName>Mr. H. Spedding</persName>) read the notice convening
                        to meeting and proceeded to say that he had-to report that the
                            Chairman,<persName> Mr. Isidor Ellhegan</persName> was absent from the
                        owing to illness. - The other directors were in
                        <placeName>Cairo</placeName>, and nose of their were therefoe, available. It
                        was accordingly necessary the appoint a Chairman of the meeting, and,
                        therefore he had to move, as a shareholder, that <persName>Mr. Thomas
                            Stoker</persName>, a former director, should take the chair.</p>
                    <p><persName>Mr. T. Sheppard</persName> seconded the motion, which was agreed
                        to.</p>
                    <p><persName>Mr. Thomas Stoker</persName>, having taken the chair, said that
                        this was an honor which had been thrust upon him. Whan he came to the
                        meeting that day he had no idea whatever that he should be asked to assume
                        the pest and dignity of Chairman. As it appeased there was no other member
                        of the company available for the post, he bad agreed to occupy the position
                        in order to get through - the formal business of the meeting. Owing to the
                        unfortunate illness of <persName>Mr. Ellbogen</persName>, and to the
                        circumstances that the other directors were all resident in
                            <placeName>Cairo</placeName>, the Board was entirely unexpected, and he,
                        himself; was set in a position to other any remarks or, he feared, to answer
                        any interrogatories. He could, therefore, only undertake to dispatch the
                        merely routine buisness for which the meeting had been called and which they
                        had heard read by the secretary in the notices convening the meeting. The
                        first matter that fell upon him to do was to call upon toe secretary to read
                        the certificate of accounts by the auditors.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then read the auditors’ certificate, which was as follows: -
                        "We report to the shareholders that we have examined the above
                        balance-sheet, with the booked vouchers of the company in England, and with
                        the audited balance-sheet received from Egypt, and that it is, in our
                        opinion, properly drawn up so as to exhibit a true and correct view of the
                        state of the company’s affairs, as shown by such books and audited
                        balance-sheet. No provision has been made for depreciation upon plant and
                        machinery. — (Signed) Price Waterhouse and Co.”</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said the next buisness was to move : "That the directors’ report
                        and balance. sheet for the year ended 30th September, l904, be adopted,” and
                        he had pleasure in moving that resolution.</p>
                    <p><persName>Mr. G. W. Dennis</persName> said he rose, not for the purpose of
                        seconding the resolution, but to suggest, that an expression should go forth
                        from this meeting to the effect that this company be wound up.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said <persName>Mr. Dennis</persName> would be more in order if
                        he permitted the resolution he had moved to be seconded, and after wards he
                        could address the meeting.</p>
                    <p><persName>Mr. Spedding</persName> said he would second the motion.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman remarked that they were now ready to hear any remarks from
                        shareholders.</p>

                    <p>SUGGESTION TO WIND UP.</p>
                    <p><persName>Mr. Dennis</persName> said he had to propose, although be did not
                        know if anyone would second it, that this meeting considered it advisable to
                        wind up the company, seeing the disastrous state in which the company at
                        present stood.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman was afraid that <persName>Mr. Dennis'</persName>. resolution,
                        though it might be a proper matter for discussion, was out of order, in as
                        much as he could not put it to to the meeting, no notice having been given
                        of it This was merely an ordinary meeting, conveyed for special purposes.
                        Such a resolution, having for its object the winding-op of the company,
                        would require an extraordinary meeting and a special resolution.</p>
                    <p><persName>Mr. Dennis</persName> said that what he desired was an expression
                        of opinion on the part of the shareholders for the information of the absent
                        directors. </p>
                    <p><persName>Mr. Sheppard</persName> said that if <persName>Mr.
                            Dennis</persName>' motion was in order, he should, be very happy to
                        second it.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman repeated that no such resolu- tion could bo entertained, but an
                        expression of opinion might go forth from the shareholders as suggested by
                            <persName> Mr. Dennis</persName>. He had taken the advice of the
                        solicitor of the company, who was present, and his views entirely concurred
                        with those of himself—namely that they could only entertain <persName>Mr.
                            Dennis'</persName> suggestion as an expression of opinion of the
                        shareholders present.</p>
                    <p><persName>Mr. Dennis</persName> said he would put it to the meeting as to
                        whether it was the generalopinion that the company be wound up.</p>
                    <p>On a show of hands being called for, it was found that <persName>Mr.
                            Dennis</persName> was supported by <persName>Mr. Sheppard</persName>
                        only.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman asked if any other share-holders desired to make any remarks,
                        and proceeded to say that the vote which <persName>Mr. Dennis</persName> had
                        called for committed the meeting to nothing. He would now put the resolution
                        to the meeting.</p>
                    <p>The resolution was then put and carried.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said the next matter before them was the election of directors,
                        concerning which the secretary would make an announcement.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then stated that the present directors, <persName>Mr. Isidor
                            Ellborgen</persName>, <persName>Mr. S. Arbib</persName>,<persName> Mr.F.
                            Back</persName>, <persName>Mr.S.R. Cookson</persName> and <persName>Mr.
                            M. Roemer</persName>, all retired at this meeting in accordance with the
                        company's articles of association, but all of them were eligible and offered
                        themselves for re election as directors.</p>
                    <p><persName>Mr. Dennis</persName> at this point asked if the Chair man had
                        adopted his suggestion as to the winding-up of the company.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said he had no doubt the suggestion of the two members present
                        would be communicated to the directors as an expression of opinion. They had
                        been informed by the secretary that the present five members of the</p>

                        gentlemen named be elected members ot the Board.</p>
                    <p><persName>Mr. Spedding</persName> seconded the motion, which was agreed
                        to.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said the next matter before the meeting was the re-election of
                        the present auditors. It was necessary that this resolution should be moved
                        by a shareholder who was not a member of the Board. He himself was a
                        shareholder only, but as he was occupying the chair, perhaps some gentleman
                        in the body of the room would kindly move the appointment of the
                        auditors.</p>
                    <p><persName>Mr. Sheppard</persName> then moved : "That Messrs. Price Waterhouse
                        and Co., London, and Messrs. Hoare and Russell, Cairo, be appointed
                        auditors."</p>
                    <p><persName>Mr. Spedding</persName> seconded the motion, which agreed to.</p>
                    <p>ADDITONAL REPORTS FROM MILLS.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said that concluded the business of the meeting with one
                        exception. An additional report had been received from the mill manager in
                        Cairo. He had not read it himself as it had just been handed to him. It
                        seemed to be of a technical nature, and if it was the pleasure of the
                        meeting he would ask the secretary to read it to the meeting.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then read the following report, dated 6th April, 1905, from
                            <persName>Mr. A. H. Pratt</persName>, manager, Egyptian cotton mill: —
                        "Since the past mill year closed the cotton trade has generally increased in
                        prosperity. The company had great hopes of sharing in this improvement for
                        the current year. At the time the last report was made up the company was
                        carrying rather large stocks and these had been made out of high priced
                        cotton. The greater part of this stock was made up of yarns, and it was
                        thought advisable to curtail our production in this article for/short time,
                        and part of the machinery was stopped accordingly. In December and January,
                        through the enormous American cotton crop, prices dropped fully 2d. per lb.
                        for the raw material. This caused customers to stop buying, as they were
                        afraid of being caught in a dropping market, as our competitors were forcing
                        goods on the market, made at high prices, and selling at any price to get
                        them off, in view of cheaper goods coming round. Owing to this, and credit
                        being bad in the country, our agents were unable to stop a big loss being
                        made on the value of these stocks. This unlucky loss heavily handicapped us.
                        We found that we were unable to pay the Government the Excise duty due for
                        past year's sales on the 1st January, and also we have not been able to pay
                        the debenture interest, due at the end of February, for six months. We have
                        since made an arrangement with the Government to pay the arrears of Excise
                        duty off at the rate ol £E. 200 per month, but we have been given to
                        understand that future payments will have to be made twice yearly, the 1st
                        July and 1st January, and not as before, once a year. The productiom of the
                        mill has increased as concerns the looms and the cloth made in them is very
                        well liked, and is selling on to-day's basis of cotton at very good prices
                        indeed. In our yarn trade we have heavy compotition with English and Indian
                        goods, which causes it to be a very unsatisfactory and unreliable business.
                        We regret that our additional report is not more hopeful.""</p>

                    <head>THE TRADE CRISIS.</head>
                    <head>IMAGINARY CREDITS.</head>
                    <p>A trade crisis of some severity, but of a purely temporary sad partial
                        character, is prevailing in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, and as evidence of
                        its stress we may mention that last month ovedue bills representing over
                        £100,000 were protested in the Mixed Courts. The crisis is chiefly confined
                        to native traders, through whose hands most of the direct transactions with
                        the inhabitants of the interior are carried on. As to Europeans, the crisis
                        is only felt in so far as they, in their capacity as manufacturers,
                        wholesale merchants, or agents, are engaged in supplying the native
                        traders.</p>
                    <p>The crisis deserves careful consideration, for its various causes, all of
                        which have a certain relation to one another, go deep down to the basis on
                        which the Egyptian trade system rests. One of these causes is the general
                        system of supplying on credit, either monthly accounts in the case of
                        Government officials and others in similar positions outside the Government,
                        or yearly accounts until the cotton is sold in the case of landowners and
                        cultivators. Another contributory cause is the system so much in vogue in
                        Egypt of giving big credits to native traders by manufacturers and others.
                        Traders are induced to make use of the big credits offered to them and they
                        have bought goods in excess of their requirements. Agents and travellers vie
                        with one another in forcing a great amount of stock on the traders. The
                        continental firms are now eagearly pressing for payment, although a little
                        liberality and patience, as it is the habit of British firms to practise,
                        would enable the native tradors to tide over their difficulties. These
                        traders at the present moment find extreme difficulty in obtaining payment
                        from their customers for goods ordered and delivered, owing to the heavy
                        fall in cotton or their losses by the cattle plague.</p>
                    <p>The general vogue of the native trade to allow monthly or yearly credit
                        accounts to customers makes the crisis sorely felt by a very wide class,
                        and, although the crisis is purely temporary, it may have results of a
                        permanent character, which will be disastrous to the growth of native trade,
                        as owing to the severe action taken by continental firms against these
                        traders, the trade will be to a great extent removed from the hands of
                        natives to Europeans. The former suffer far more than the European trader,
                        who can more easily obtain temporary assistance, such as bills of
                        convenience from his books or postponements in paying, etc. Some persons
                        consider that the Government should be appealed to to step in in the
                        interests of the natives. But, while admitting the difficulty of State
                        interference in such a case, we are of opinion that an official enquiry and
                        report into the circumstances attending the present crisis would be very
                        useful. It could be conducted quite informally, and might well be entrusted
                        to two officials, one Anglo-Egyptian (<persName>Mr. Roussin</persName> for
                        example) and one native. The result of their enquiry ought to be of the
                        greatest value, more especially for the future guidance of the native
                        trader. Among the recommendations of such an enquiry the following, in our
                        opinion, would occupy a prominent position:—</p>
                    <p>A complete modification in the system of supplying goods on credit.</p>
                    <p>That subordinate officials and similarly circumstanced employes should have
                        the option of drawing their salaries weekly instead of monthly.</p>
                    <p>A Government order forbidding officials from obtaining goods on credit.</p>
                    <p>The last of these recommendations would never be enforced, but it would be a
                        useful reminder to the smaller fry of officialdom that the Government takes
                        a parental interest in their well being.</p>
                    <p>Another recommendation should be that native traders in placing their orders
                        for goods would do well to give preference to those firms wbd do not unduly
                        press them in bad times. This recommendation should have a good result by
                        drawing the attention of the traders to the forbearance of British firms, as
                        compared with the severity exercised by the majority of continental houses.
                        British firms have a great deal of money owing to them at the present time,
                        but it will be found that they have refrained to a great extent, from
                        protesting, while their rivals on the continent are most-eager in pressing
                        for their pound of flesh.</p>
                    <p>The whole of the question of credit is of extreme importance to
                            <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, and if we had a Department of Commerce in
                        Egypt like the Board of Trade at home, it would receive, careful
                        attention.</p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN COMPANY FLOTATION LONDON PRESS OPINION.</head>
                    <p>The "World," in its City article says that there are signs that the
                        continuous flotation of companies for the development of
                            <placeName>Egypt</placeName> is in danger of being overdone, and the
                        prices of the shares of some of those formed since the beginning of the year
                        have been falling off during the past few Hays. The shares of one such
                        company, regarding whose future operations practically nothing was known
                        beyond the fact that they were to be carried out under the auspices of men
                        well-connected with former Egyptian enterprise, were pushed np to a premium
                        of something like 150 per cent, so that it is natural that the increase of
                        competitive concerns should bring them down. In these circumstances there
                        may be some who, wishing to participate in Egypt's prosperity, are yet
                        unwilling to incur the risk attendant upon the new ventures, and would
                        rather turn their attention to investments already well established.</p>
                    <p>The "Daily Express," in commenting on the fact that the capital of the
                        Egyptian Trust and Investment had been subscribed for fifty-three times
                        over, remarks —This is a record in company subscriptions. There were special
                        reasons for the success of the flotation. The proepects of business in
                            <placeName>Egypt</placeName> for well managed companies are excellent,
                        and it is agreed that the management of this company is exceptionally
                        strong. Quite apart, however, from the success of a particular company, the
                        weight of the applications tells a satisfactory and encouraging tale. It
                        means that <placeName>England</placeName> has recovered from the bad time
                        which followed the war, and that the period of retrenchment is over. The
                        seccess of the Egyptian enterprise will doubtless lead to the flotation of a
                        large number of companies in the near future.</p>
                    <p>The "Financier” remarks: — The announcement that no less than £8,000,000 had
                        been subscribed for the issue of £200,000 by the Egyptian Trust and
                        Investment, limited, naturally excited a good deal of discussion; but I am
                        positively assured, on reliable authority, that the announcement was an
                        under-statement, not an exaggeration. I am told that actually a round
                        million of application money has been banked—that amount at the rate of 2s.
                        per £1 share representing total subscription of £10,000,000! The one thing
                        to be desired is that such an experience may not tend to wildcat speculatipn
                        or induce a flood of undesirable flotations. The future of British
                        enterprise in <placeName>Egypt</placeName> lies in steady development, and
                        excessive stimulation or injudicious booming would only be mischevious to
                        the best interests of a very promising country.</p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN MINING. NORTH NILE.</head>
                    <p>It is not surprising, having regard to the report just issued by Messrs. Lake
                        and Currie, the well-known mining engineers, that North Niles should have
                        had a heavy fall. This is the portion of the document which has struck the
                            <placeName> London</placeName> market most unfavorably:— "Adit No. 1.—In
                        Adit No. L Winze, No. 1 N., has been carried down to a depth of 150ft., the
                        rich ground extending to 120ft, and yielding the bulk of some 200oz. of
                        rough gold, which has been obtained during the present season's operations.
                        Drives N. and S., at the point where this rich ground came in, have proved
                        disappointing, tending to the conclusion that the winze has gone down on a
                        narrow chute or chimney. In the winze itself a change occurred in the
                        country rock at 120ft, and the quartz died out. Stopping from the sides of
                        this winze should result in appreciable returns but it is impossible to
                        forecast the quantity of payable stone that will be obtained. Winze S., Adit
                        No. 3, has been connected with Drive N., Adit No. 1, by a drive along a
                        cross vein. This cross vein, however, proved valueless. Adit No. 3.—In this
                        Adit Winze No. 1N. has been carried down to 59ft; here again the vein has
                        pinched and the results are not encouraging. The present season's work, so
                        far, has failed to disclose any appreciable extension of the rich stone
                        discovered during the preceding season's operations. Furthermore, no
                        additional rich patches or chutes have been met with.”</p>
                    <p>As speculation in these shares has been on a comparatively large scale,and as
                        the slump has been unexpected and heavy, it may be worth while to print what
                        the Board now say. Among other things they declare it to be a misconception
                        to suppose that the company is in any want of money. The truth is that there
                        are some thousands of pounds in hand, irrespective of bullion. The mauager,
                        moreover, has been instructed to energetically push on with the exploratory
                        work on the lines laid down by Messrs. Lake and Currie in their report.
                        Simultaneously, with this work, instructions have been given that the
                        stoping of any rich ore available be at once proceeded with. As for those
                        who ask for advice as to what to do with their shares (many bought at £2 and
                        over), we can only refer them to the glorious uncertainty of mining, and
                        advise them to hold for a recovery, which is by no means unlikely, although
                        it may not be rapid.</p>

                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette. Sir,—While cordially endorsing the
                            utility of institutes both at <placeName>Cairo</placeName> and
                                <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>, I must protest against the
                            somewhat hyaterical tone of<persName> Mr. Henry C. Sims's</persName>
                            letter on the subject. The letter in to-day's issue does for more credit
                            to <persName>Mr. Sims’s</persName> heart than to his head, for he surely
                            exaggerates the evil prevalent in Cairo. From my own experience as a
                            resident both in <placeName>Cairo</placeName> and
                                <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> I venture to state that both
                            cities compare favorably with the state of things prevailing in
                            similarly great centres of population in <placeName>Europe</placeName>.
                            The triumph of the “Spirit of Evil" is in fact for less in evidence in
                            the cities of Egypt than in London, for example.
                                <placeName>Cairo</placeName> in this respect compares favorably with
                                <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>, for in the Capital the evil is
                            chiefly congregated in one quarter of the town instead of being
                            promiscuously scattered over every quarter. The Trinity of Evil, drink,
                            gambling, and impurity, everywhere exists, but
                                <placeName>Cairo</placeName> and <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>
                            are far more free to all appearances from these evils than the cities of
                            Europe, and I fail to see we are in any way worse off in Egypt as
                            regards the moral character of our big towns.—Truly yours,</p>

                        <p>To the Editor or the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                        <p>Sir,—In your interesting leading article in yesterday’s issue on the
                            Capitulations and their history, you conclude with the remark that the
                            undoubted success of the modifications of the Capitulations by the
                            establishment of the Mixed Courts in 1874 "should prevent the most
                            conservative Europeans from taking a gloomy view of the consequences of
                            any further modifications in the Capitulations in 190—”. As an old
                            European resident in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>- I should like to give
                            my own view on this question, which has now been placed in the arena of
                            practical local politics by <persName>Lord Cromer’s</persName> statement
                            that "the only solution which can produce really satisfactory results
                            would be that the Powers should transfer to <placeName>Great
                                Britain</placeName> the legislative functions which they now
                            collectively possess.” For my part I think that few unprejudiced persons
                            will be disposed to dispute that theoretically such a reform would be a
                            good thing for <placeName>Egypt</placeName>. Intelligent native opinion
                            would welcome it and there could not be a better instance of the "unity
                            of opposites” than is seen by <persName>Mostapha Pasha Kamel</persName>
                            seeing eye to eye with the British Representative in this matter. But
                            the footer of importance in this case is not the native but the
                            European. We possess very great privileges in virtue of the
                            Capitulations, and we naturally ask ourselves why we should suffer such
                            privileges to be given up because the Government consider that the
                            present system is “wholly incompatible with the present condition of
                            affairs in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>” Why should respectable
                            Europeans lose such precious privileges as protection from arbitrary
                            arrest and from certain forms of taxation, inviolability of domicile,
                            etc., etc., merely because fraction of the European residents in Egypt
                            use these advantages as clokes for gambling, smuggling, and keeping
                            disorderly houses? I may be one of those indolent but well-meaning
                            conservatives, "whose easy and prosperous life in a sub-tropical country
                            has taken from them a little of their moral energy and their critical
                            faculty,—" bat I confess that I do not consider the present system
                            should be abolished in favor of "the creation of some local machinery
                            which would take a part in the enactment of laws applicable to
                            Europeans," which is, it should be noticed, the only hint of the
                            institutions to supplant the actual system, that Lord Cromer suggests.
                                <persName>Mr. Brunyate</persName>, in his note on the working of the
                            Capitulations, elaborates this apparently intentionally vague remark by
                            the statement that there are "a number of corporate, or semi-corporate,
                            bodies already in existence, which are more or less representative of
                            various classes of opinion.” He evidently refers to such institutions as
                            the Alexandria Exporters’ and Importers’ Association, and the varous
                            Chambers of Commerce. In my opinion it would be impossible to find
                            corporate bodies more unsuitable for forming the groundwork of the
                            “local machinery,” which <persName>Lord Cromer</persName> speaks of.
                            They are bodies based solely on a purely selfish foundation, and are
                            quite incapable, taken collectively, of taking wide, general views. An
                            official of the Railway Administration, for example, informed me that
                            when the Railway Commission went to Alexandria, <persName>Lord
                                Farrar</persName> and his colleagues were unable to obtain any
                            general opinions from either the Importers’ or Exporters’ Association,
                            as these institutions confined themselves to displaying a petty jealousy
                            of one another’s aims. In the case of the Chambers of Commerce, which
                            are strictly national bodies, no harmony should be found among them
                            collectively, while individually their leading members are for too busy
                            men to take upon themselves the duties of Justice of the Peace, which
                            would be exceptionally invidious in such cities as
                                <placeName>Cairo</placeName> and <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>.
                            We are then thrown back upon the Ministry of Justice! This is no doubt
                            what it will come to in the end. But that Ministry does not fulfil one
                            of the two guarantees which <persName>Mr. Brunyate</persName> lays down
                            as required for the protection of the foreign community, namely: "A
                            personnel, both judicial and administrative, ...who, for the duties they
                            are called on to perform, shall inspire a sufficient degree of public
                            confidence.” Now there is no Ministry which inspires, I regret to say,
                            less confidence than the Ministry of Justice. How can it when such high
                            poets as that of —I need not specify it — are occupied by men destitute
                            of any professional legal training! The Mixed Courts Bar represents the
                            most intelligent European opinion in Egypt, and they are well aware of
                            the cases of young Englishmen, who, after a more or lees unprofessional
                            practioe for a few years, are suddenly for no satisfactory reason made
                            judges in the Ministry of Justice. The Blariaux case created a very
                            unfavorable opinion among the best class of European opinion as to the
                            independence of that Ministry over the executive. On the whole,
                            therefore, it would be an unwise stop to entrust any powers over
                            Europeans to that Ministry. As the Mixed Tribunals are rules out of
                            court by Lord Cromer, who declares against the proposal to transfer
                            criminal jurisdiction over Europeans from the Consular to the Mixed
                            Courts, the only conclusion is that an entirely new system must be
                            created. But in view of the violent cross currents in public opinion,
                            the inability of the local machinery to form a groundwork, and the lack
                            of respect entertained for the Ministry of Justice, it will be some time
                            before any practicable scheme can be evolved. But no scheme can be
                            considered satisfactory, which does not afford the fullest guarantees
                            against the interference of the Executive, and therefore it is better to
                            be content with things as they are than to sacrifice the Magna Charta of
                            Europeans in <placeName>Egypt </placeName>for the convenience of the
                            Egyptian Government.—Truly yours,</p>

                        <p>To The Editor of The Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                        <p>Sir,—I have been greatly interested in the remarks of<persName> Mr.
                                Frederick Greenwood</persName> on the occasion of the entertainment
                            offered him at the Trocadero Restaurant on Saturday, the 8th instant
                            relative to the purchase by Great Britain of the Suez Canal shares. I
                            happened to be at Shepheard’s in Cairo at the time the transaction was
                            consummated, and had frequent conversations with <persName>Col.
                                Stanton</persName>, the British Agent and Consul General, upon that
                            subject. In fact, I was considered by <persName>Col. Stanton</persName>
                            as favoring an adverse interest.</p>
                        <p>I think <persName>Mr. Greenwood</persName> is in error as to the desire
                            of the French Government or in foot any group of French capitalists, to
                            acquire the shares. The opinion prevailed in
                                <placeName>France</placeName> that they had already quite enough of
                            that stock and sorely did not seek an investment which would produce no
                            income for seventeen years.</p>
                        <p>The fact is that the real rival of the British proposal was an American
                            group represented by <persName>Mr. Samuel Remington</persName>, of the
                            Remington Arms Company. <persName>Mr. Remington</persName> was then
                            stopping in<placeName> Egypt</placeName> and had very close business
                            relations with <persName>Ismail Pasha</persName>. He was sailing large
                            quantities of arms to Ismail and had contracted to build an extensive
                            arms manufacturing plant near Cairo (for which, including a large
                            quantity of useless machinery, the Egyptian Debt Liquidation Commission
                            had to pay). It is quite true that the proposed sale was kept from the
                            knowledge of <persName>Colonel Stanton</persName> until under
                            instructions by Lord Derby he went to the Khedive and bluntly asked "Is
                            it true that you are engaged in negotiations for the sale of your
                            shares?" Ismail did not wish them to go to
                                <placeName>England</placeName>, and at first he had broached the
                            subject to Lesseps for a sale to French financiers. At the time he
                            offered them to <persName>Mr. Remington</persName> and actually came
                            very near passing them to the American syndicate.</p>
                        <p>I had frequent conversations with <persName>Mr. Remington</persName> on
                            the progress of his negotiations, they had gone so for as to secure the
                            pledge by cable of the necessary four millions, but the funds were not
                            forthcoming; the group in Paris (there were contributors in
                                <placeName>New York</placeName>, <placeName>London</placeName>, and
                                <placeName>Paris</placeName>, mainly through American banking
                            houses) made default.<persName> Col. Stanton</persName> knew of this and
                            told me he hoped to get his authority before
                                <persName>Remington</persName> could "repair his breach.” Hundreds
                            of pounds were expended by <persName>Remington</persName> in cabling to
                                <placeName>London</placeName>, <placeName>Paris</placeName>, and
                                <placeName>New York</placeName>, and he was anxiously awaiting
                            responses when <persName>Col. Stanton</persName> came to me manifesting
                            great excitement, waving a telegram and declaring "I have got it, the
                            victory is mine.” Although quite late in the evening he left at once for
                                <placeName>Abdeen Palace</placeName>.</p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Remington</persName>, greatly chagrined, acknowledged
                            himself defeated. The next day he told me he could have accomplished the
                            purchase. <persName>Col. Stanton</persName> was only a few hoars in
                            advance! <persName>Ismail</persName> sold to
                                <placeName>England</placeName> as a dernier retort. He was, as
                                <persName>Lord Derby</persName> declared, “very hard up.” He wanted
                            money for his proposed “Abyssinian conquest” (1) and he gladly took the
                            proffered cash, although he had schemed to sell out to the American.</p>
                        <p>I do not think <persName>Mr. Greenwood</persName> is quite correct in
                            intimating that <persName>Col. Stanton</persName> was in disgrace for
                            his ignorance of <persName>Ismail's</persName> secret negotiations to
                            sell, for <persName>Col. Stanton</persName> showed me telegrams of
                            thanks and congratulation from <placeName>London</placeName>, and if I
                            mistake not, instead of bring "quietly removed from his post and retired
                            to some consulate on the <placeName>Black Sea</placeName>,” he became
                            British Minister at <placeName>Munich</placeName> and received all

                            it due to <persName>Mr. Davis</persName> to give the curiosity of the
                            world a proper orientation. I have, of course, requested the paper in
                            question to correct its announcement.</p>
                        <p>There are those who may see in the attention which the public has
                            bestowed on this find, a proof of its enlightened interest in historical
                            research. I am not so optimistic. <persName>Mr. Davis</persName> has
                            been most fortunate, and the tourist will talk of it till his steamer
                            leaves, and even afterwards. But when <persName>Mr. Davis</persName> has
                            really earned, as he earned last year, the thanks of the world, by
                            producing a volume containing adequate representations of the beautiful
                            objects found, with a description of the intact burial, and an estimate
                            of its archeological and historical value by the professional gentlemen
                            who supervised the excavations, I hope that it will recieve due
                            recognition. If not, he will probably appreciate the intelligent
                            gratitude of the few more than the envious congratulations of the many
                            who find their very human instincts for treasure-hunting sanctified by a
                            thin veneer of respect for science and the long history of man.</p>
                        <p>I beg to tander my own thanks to him in advance, and remain.—Yours
                            respectfully,</p>
