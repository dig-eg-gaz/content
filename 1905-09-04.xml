        <head>SUGAR TRADE SENSATION.</head>
        <head>M. CRONIER'S TRAGIC SUICIDE.</head>
            <p>(From our own Correspondent).</p>
            <p>London, August 29.</p>
            <p>The European bonnes and the London 8tock Exchange were yesterday staggered by the sensational news of the sadden death of M. Cronier, the great sugar magnate. The effect was felt more especially on the Paris and Hamburg bonnes, where the chief dealings in sugar shares take place.</p>
            <p>M. Ernest Cronier, Ingenieur Principal do Ponts et Chviriee, Officier de la Legion d'hon-nenr, had enormous commitments in sugar, which, according to report, showed differences of over £2,000,000. The exact amount of the losses cannot be ascertained, however, until his accounts have been liquidated, so that the above figures must be accepted with reserve.</p>
            <p>M. Cronier has for years been more or less connected with the sugar interests of Egypt and Egyptian finance. In 1892 he formed the societe Generale des Sucreries et de la Raffi-nerio d'Egypte in conjuction with Messieurs' Suares, and at the time of his death he was president of the company. Not only was be president, but he was the ruling spirit of the concern. The interests of both the Say and Suares families came under the direct control of this very strong-willed man, who, like Langrand Dumonean in the sixties and Bon-teux in the seventies, dealt with all his companies as if they wore branches of his own estates. </p>
            <p>In 1898 he, in conjunction with Sir Ernest Cassel, Messieurs Sanies and Cattani, purchased the Daira Sanieh estates from the Egyptian Government, and in 1902 he bought from the Daira Sanieh administration the various sugar factories tor nearly £1,000,000 sterling. In order to carry out the financing of this operation the Daira Sanieh Sugar Corporation was founded with a total share and debenture c vital of £1,573,000, and was the go between of the Daira Sanieh and the sucreries et Raffinerie Co.</p>
            <p>The tragic suicide of M. Cronier (it appears he shot himself with a revolver at his dwelling in the Rue de Lisbonne, Paris), caused a heavy fall in the sugar shares on the Paris bourse. The Say Company's stock fell from 950 francs to 580 frances, and that of the Sucreries Raffinerie d’Egypt from 152 francs to 107 francs ; and although it is early yet to obtain accurate information, there seems to be an opinion that this tragic event will involve some form of reorganisation of the latter company. Daira Sanieh deferred shares have also reacted several points and leave off this afternoon at 178.</p>

A journey that should take ten hours was only performed in forty five, so many wore the halts on the way.</p>

        <head>THE SOLAR ECLIPSE.</head>
            <head>FURTHER DETAILS.</head>
                <p>Our special correspondent sends us the following further account of the solar eclipse as viewed from the zone of totality which had been virtually turned into a huge observatory: -The garden of the Savoy Hotel was the scene of action, and there most of the instruments of the various commissions were erected. At the north end of the garden Professor Turner of the English contingent had taken up his position. He had erected two large cameras fitted with two very fine reflectors, especially ground so as to give no distortion ; the lenses of this instruments were made by 8ir Howard Grubb. Professor Turner managed to take fourteen photographs of the eclipse. To the west of the English contingent, the two Russian professors from St. Petersburg had placed themselves. These scientists like wise used a large reflecting telescope in connection with a very fine camera, and they succeeding in obtaining four photographic records. The Russians had set op a magnetic observation camp on the west bank of the Nile near Grenvell's tombs and on the west side of the island the American observers had up their posts under Professor Hussey of the Lick Observatory, and Professor West of the American College at Beyrout. The members of this commission had erected two cameras, one of. enormous length measuring forty feet With this instrument Professor Hussey obtained ten exposures, which varied from half a second to ten seconds, and one of sixty-four seconds. The second instrument consisted of four lenses in one camera, so that four photographs might be taken of the corona at the same time and at different parts; with this instrument eight exposures were made. Here also Dr. Myer of Germany had set up a small but powerful telescope, which bad been made by the great German optician, Carl Leiss of Jena, and the lens of his camera was very rapid, the longest exposure with this instrument being only ten seconds. Dr. Myer, who made ten exposures, chiefly interested himself in photographing the extreme edge of the corona.</p>
                <p>At the railway station Mr. J. H. Reynolds of Birmingham had erected a huge reflecting telescope 120 feet long. There were great difficulties in erecting this instrument, but thanks to the kindness of the railway authorities, it was eventually placed in position. Mr. Reynolds secured two exposures. One incident occured which might have had a disastrous effect. As the total eclipse was approaching, the train from Luxor was seen to be coming in the distance, but loud and continued shooting happily succeeded in bring-ing the train to standstill outside Assouan station, and a great dilemma was averted.</p>
                <p>Three magnetic stations had bean erected by the Egyptian Government, one at Assouan station under Mr. Wade, another at Dakka, 70 miles south, another at Edfu, 70 miles north.</p>
                <p>The total eclipse started as follows, from Winnipeg Lake across the Atlantic ocean to to Spain, then through the Balearic Isles, Algiers, Tunis, Tripoli, Egypt, across the Red Sea, and ended in the south east of Arabia. The total eclipse rone measured two degrees, and the longest time daring which it was visible was at Burgos in Spain, where it lasted for about three minutes.</p>
                <p>Most of the astronomers busied themselves with taking photographs of the sun's corona, and doubtless when they have returned to their respective countries, developed their photographs, and made their measurements, they will give the scientific results to the world. Many of the professors were in gnat hopes that at this eclipse, some new planet might be discovered, but for this result we must wait with patience. In Egypt very few spectroscopic observations were taken. Two perfectly constructed spectroscopes had been made by Zeiss for the Spanish government, one of them to be used at Burgos in an observatory, the other to be used from a balloon. The day here dawned quite clear, not a vestige of a cloud was to be seen any where, and all the astronomers were early astir, fingering their instruments lovingly, and having full dress rehearsals. In the morning about thirty people turned up to view the eclipse, and at lunch time, one might have imagined the season had already begun. The first contact took place at 3 h. 26 m. p.m. exactly, and all were at their respective stations. The roof of the hotel was crowded with people, and the natives on the bank of the river beat furiously on tom-toms. Totality commenced at 4 h. 33 m. 6 secs, but fifteen minutes before this it had began to get quite dark, and the conditions reminded one exactly of twilight Just before the totality began, the shadow of the moon was seen moving across the hills on the east bank ; in an instant the sun was obscured, and the rays of the corona shot out from all sides, one extremely long stream being seen low down on the left Totality lasted exactly two minutes twenty four seconds; directly the sun re- appeared the natives beat their tom-toms more furiously than ever, and cries of delight were heard on all sides.</p>
                <p>The eclipse was a groat success ; no clouds, rendered observation difficult though it was a little hazy. The corona sphere was brilliant and at least two well-marked prominences, were seen. The outer corona was very faint, considering that sun spots were at their maximum. There is much speculation as to whether the largest streamers can be associated with the sun spots, but this is moat difficult to ascertain by a momentary glance.</p>
                <p>The longest streamer may have been over a sun spot, which has been recently visible. The stars were distinctly visible, also the planet Mars, but Mercury was not seen. The largest streamer noticed was about two diameters of the sun in size. During the whole eclipse the wind was hardly noticeable, and the temperature seemed to drop considerably.</p>
                <p>Professor Turner and his colleagues wish to thank Captain Lyons and all the other members of the Survey Department for their kind help, without which they could not have secured such success. They are also exceedingly grateful to the Railway Administration for the advantages granted them, and to Mr. Hazel, of the Ministry of the Interior, for the excellent way in which the grounds of the hotel ware policed. Mr. Reynolds alto wishes to express his thanks to Mr. Kieling for his invaluable assistance. Last, but not least, all the astronomers are unanimous in expressing their satisfaction at the way in which the Savoy Hotel placed everything at their disposal; the basement was turned into a dark room, the garden into an observatory, and on the day of the eclipse they stopped their steam water pump from working.</p>
                <p>The following is a list of the different commissions who took observations</p>
                <p>England—ProfesrorTurner and Mr. Bellamy.</p>

            <head>KHEDIVIAL YACHT CLUB.</head>
                <p>THE ABOUKIR RACE.</p>
                <p>One of the most popular races of the season took place yesterday. The course was to Aboukir, (round "Nelson's Island") and back, a total distance of nearly 50 miles, constituting the longest open sea race that baa ever been bald under the auspices of the Yacht Club.</p>
                <p>Eight boats started at 10.30 a.m. from the Club House at Ras el Tin, and presented a very pretty spectacle as they all crossed the line together. Six of them finished ; of the other two, Leman returned, as, being a small boat, she was unable to do the distance in the heavy sea which was running. The other boat, Jenny, apparently bad enough of the run down and dropped anchor in the shelter of Aboukir Bay to wait a more favorable opportunity of returning to Alexandria. The order of the six arrivals was as follows.</p>
                <p>Although tbe boats finished in the above order, the Ironie won the handsome cup given by his Highness Prince Aziz on her time allowance, as will be seen by consulting the handicap published in lest Saturday’s "Gazette."</p>
                <p>The Beltia sailed the wrong course so that her time cannot be taken as indicating her speed.</p>
                <p>The handicap was a very good one, the difference between the Ironie and Tantah being only 11 minutes, and between the Tantah and Masr 40 seconds only, on the 8 hours course.</p>
                <p>The speed of the Masr, the first boat in, averaged about 8 knots, which is exceedingly fast for a boat of her type and size, and would be beaten with difficulty if at all by a European built boat of the same rating, and great credit to due to the native builder.</p>
                <p>After the race Prince Asia was “at home” to the Club members. Lady Blomfield kindly presented the prise to the winner.</p>
                <p>The race is a record one in every way inasmuch as throughout the whole of the long distance and amongst all the boats not a single accident of any kind occurred ; all the boats reaching port safely. Snob a contingency was, however, carefully provided against by the kind offer of a tug boat to follow the race by Admiral Blomfield, the posting of one of Prince Aziz boats at Aboukir itself, and the loan by Mr. Sergeant of an ample number of life belts, so that no one in the race was without one.</p>
            <p>ALEXANDRIA SWIMMING CLUB.</p>
                <p>The members met on Saturday last for the usual weekly sports.</p>
                <p>Some high diving was witnessed, and the success attained by some members was a proof of the improvement they had made since they joined the club.</p>
                <p>The diving exhibited by the juniors also showed a decided and vast improvement</p>
                <p>In a few days the date of fixture for the 3rd annual aquatic sports will be announced, and also a list of the events.</p>
                <p>Members' times for the 60 yards club hand-icap will be taken on the 23rd instant</p>
            <p>BRITISH RIFLE CLUB (ALEX.)</p>
                <p>Members are reminded that the last spoon competition of the season will take place on Saturday next at Mustapha rifle range. Shooting will commence at 3 p.m.. There will also be a target for practice.</p>
