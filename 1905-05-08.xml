                        <head>EGYPT’S ENGINEERING TRIUMPHS.</head>
                        <p>One of the most interesting sections in Lord Cromer’s Report for 1904
                            deals with the results of recent irrigation works, and notably of the
                            construction of the Assiout and Assouan Reservoirs. It is difficult to
                            avoid hyperbole in discussing these results, which have, as far as can
                            be judged, insured the continual prosperity of Egypt for many years to
                            come, and the Egyptian and European publics have apparently grasped the
                            most remarkable fact connected with these and other great productive
                            works which have been completed or commenced by the Government.
                            Countries more happily situated than Egypt have been able to raise loans
                            which enabled them to obtain the sums necessary for productive works
                            intended for the benefit of posterity, and at the same time to make
                            posterity pay in part for the blessings handed down to it. Egypt has not
                            been in this fortunate position, haring no full financial liberty of
                            action, and the numerous and highly remunerative works constructed have
                            in consequence caused considerable in- convenience to the present
                            generation of Egyptians who have paid heavily that posterity may
                            benefit.</p>
                        <p>At the same time it is evident that the present generation will benefit
                            to a consider- able degree from some at least of the works of public
                            utility which have recently been completed. The Assouan and Assiout
                            Barrages must hold a record among such works for the speed with which
                            they have become remu nerative. They cost L.E. 3,297,000, and up to the
                            end of 1904 a sum of L.E. 1,757,000 had been expended on subsidiary
                            works in Middle Egypt, which enabled the best result to be obtained from
                            the construction of the two great dams. The increased annual rental of
                            the lands affected by the dams and sub- sidiary works is estimated at
                            L.E. 1.553,000, their increased sale value at L.E. 16,780.000. By the
                            end of 1908 a further million and a halt in round figures will have been
                            spent, and the rental of these lands will have been increased by L.E.
                            2,687,000, their sale value by L.E. 26,570,000, and this without
                            counting the benefits to the Delta.</p>
                        <p>This remarkable success, achieved in the teeth of constant difficulties,
                            is probably without parallel in the history of engineering work, and
                            Lord Cromer's tribute to the engi neers under whose auspices these great
                            re sults have been won is right well deserved At the same time it is
                            pleasing to know that the Egyptian Government and the great statesman to
                            whose able guidance so much of the present prosperity of the country is
                            due, have shown a readiness to listen to the advice of experts, and a
                            determination to make the best use of their talents, that the
                            Governments and statesmen of greater and more advanced nations would do
                            well to imitate.</p>

                        <head>THE REVOLT IN YEMEN.</head>
                        <p>The announcement in this morning's tele- grams, that sixteen Redif
                            battalions, belonging to the First Army Corps in Turkey, have been
                            called to the colours for service in Yemen shows that the Porte is
                            becoming alive to the gravity of the situation in Southern Arabia. The
                            present revolt against the Sultan’s authority in these regions is, we
                            believe, due to the chronic grievance against Turkish exactions and
                            Corruption, which keeps rebellion simmering—when it is not actually
                            boiling over—in that country. There seems to be grave danger that the
                            revolt may spread north- ward from Yemen to the Hodjaz. If that were to
                            happen, and if the Turks were to be worsted in the very cradle of Islam,
                            the Caliph would lose his one claim to be regarded as the de facto Head
                            of the Mohamedan world — the guardianship of the Holy Places of Mecca
                            and Medina. That would, obviously, be an event of world-wide importance,
                            which might have con- sequences of incalculable gravity.</p>

                        there were only two newspapers in Egypt. One of these was published in the
                        Turkish, and the other in the Arabic language. Both Were offi- cial. In
                        1868, a private French newspaper was, for the first time, published at
                        Alexandria There are now 30 daily papers, 67 weekly or fortnightly, and 52
                        monthly or bi-monthly periodicals, making in all a total of 149. Of those,
                        96 are published in Arabic, 22 in French, 15 in Greek, 7 in Italian, 5 in
                        English, 3 in Armenian, and 1 in Hebrew.</p>
                    <p>Merchant Seamen's Home. — A concert arranged by Mrs. Roberts was given on
                        Friday evening last. There was a large gathering of seaman present, and Rev.
                        H. P. Reid presided Miss MunGavin’s songs, “The River of Year” and “Faithful
                        unto Death," showed off her fine voice to perfection, and as an encore she
                        gave “Three fishes went sailing." Mrs. Baylis’s pretty song and the duet
                        with Mr, Johnson from “Veronique” were enthusiastic- ally encored. Mr.
                        Johnson also sang “The Yeomen of England” and “Gallop away” in an artistic
                        style, and his encore "Devotion’ was splendidly given. Mr. Plank’s musical
                        recitations, “The Lesson of the Water Mill” and “An Old Bachelor," were
                        quite a nice change in the programme, and “Domestics’ Asides" and "Otto and
                        the Auto" were very amusing. Mr. Heaton sang briskly “Anchored” and also
                        accompanied some songs, as did Mrs. Roberts, who also played two lively
                        pianoforte solos, "Autumn Pastime" and "Moore’s Irish Melodies," by A. F.
                        Smith. She did not sing owing to a cold. Several others who were to have
                        taken part were prevented through indis position. Among those present we
                        noticed Mrs. A. Ward, Miss Harbord, Grafton Bey, Capt Thomas, Milburn Bey,
                        Mrs. and Miss Milburn, and several others.</p>

                    <p>( From our Correspondent. )</p>
                    <p>Medinet-el-Fayoum, Saturday. Something akin to a reign of terror prevails in
                        this province just now. The country is being overridden by a formidable band
                        of brigands. These men, who number about a hundred, have got clever leaders
                        and are well organised. They are armed with the best guns, and have made
                        their head-quarters on the cultivated spots round the desert and hills that
                        separate the Fayoum from the Beni Souef province. They have moreover got
                        secret agents in the various villages of the province. They generally commit
                        their depradations on dark nights, when they make organised descents on the
                        residences of the wealthy inhabitants.</p>
                    <p>The night before last, members of the gang formed a cordon round the village
                        of Bishoun, some of the men being stationed at each bridge and main
                        thoroughfare to prevent help being sought by the inhabitants from the neigh-
                        bouring villages. The omdeh of the village was besieged in his house by
                        twenty armed men. There were only four ghaffirs in the vicinity, the others
                        being out on duty with the molahiz of police, and these four men were
                        utterly powerless to cope with the armed marauders.</p>
                    <p>Another cordon was formed round the resi- dence of the omdeh’s cousin,
                        Soliman el Sayed, who is reputed to have considerable wealth at bis house.
                        More than a hundred shots were fired by the brigands, the ghaffir of the
                        house being killed and three servants wounded.</p>
                    <p>On their entering the house Soliman el Sayed was threatened with immediate
                        death unless he gave up the keys of his safe. This he promptly did, and the
                        robbers made a clean sweep of all the money and valuables they could lay
                        their hands on, including a quantity of jewellery belonging to the omdeh’s
                        wife and sister. They afterwards made good their escape, and are in safe
                        hiding.</p>
                    <p>On hearing of this extraordinary occurrence, I immediately proceeded to the
                        village of Bishoun on behalf of the "Gazette” and there found the Moudir,
                        the Chief of the Parquet, the Commandant of Police and tho district mamour
                        engaged in conducting an enquiry. It was a case, however, of “locking tho
                        stable after the horse is stolen," as the robbers had left the village a
                        long time before they arrived on the spot. I think it would have been better
                        if the Moudir had also sent a detachment of police and ghaffirs to cut off
                        the retreat of the band before they could get across the desert. It would
                        likewise have been advisable to send detectives to find out where the
                        members of the band come from, and to keep their eyes on the brigands, in
                        order to find out what they are going to do beforehand, and not what they
                        have already done.</p>

                    <head>PUBLIC v. PRIVATE EXECUTION</head>
                    <p>(From our Correspondent).</p>
                    <p>Medinet el Fayoum, May 2. Three shocking crimes have taken place here lately,
                        and it does not seem as if the new sys- tem of private executions is working
                        well. Few of the criminal classes read the newspapers, and as a rule they
                        hear nothing about the carrying out of capital sentences. Fayoum people do
                        not see the hoisting of the black flag at the prison in Cairo, and those who
                        read about the execution of a murderer are not the criminals who would be,
                        perhaps, deterred from crime if they witnessed a public execution on the
                        spot where a murder had been committed. This might act as a deterrent, which
                        should be the main object of punishment</p>
                    <p>ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN SCHOOLS</p>
                    <p>I visited the Government school the other day, and spoke with some of the
                        pupils, who are making very satisfactory progress in learn ing English. The
                        headmaster graduated in England, and is therefore proficient in the language
                        of that country. In addition to the Government school, there are three
                        others —one for boys and two for girls—where all the pupils learn English.
                        In a few years' time the language should become almost universal in Egypt,
                        enabling the natives to read good English books and learn the lessons in
                        moral ity, good behaviour, etc., that they cannot find in the Arabic books,
                        which are so hard to understand.</p>

                    <p>Mr. D. P. McGillivray, of the National Bank of Egypt, returned to Cairo on
                        Friday morning, via the White Nile and Khartoum, from his big game hunt in
                        Abyssinia. His bag consists of a concession granted by the Emperor Menelik
                        to the National Bank for the establishment of an International Bank of
                        Abyssinia, and about one hundred head of big game, amongst which are some
                        record heads. Mr. McGillivray suffored considerably towards the latter, part
                        of his journey from inflammation of the eyes, but we are happy to hear that
                        he is now pro- gressing towards speedy recovery. We beg to tender him our
                        hearty congratulations at such a successful issue of his expedition, which
                        is as largely due to his indomitable will as to his financial capacity and
                        Skill with the rifle.</p>

                        on Friday under the presidency of Mr. George Walker chairman of the

                        of all pic-nic places, the Barrage. A special train, provid- ed free by the
                        Railway Administration, left Cairo at 9 a.m., and arrived at the Barrage
                        shortly before a quarter to ten. Some seven hours of enjoyment were spent by
                        the party before the return at 5.35 p.m. The manage- ment and catering were
                        in the hands of Mr. Ben Defrece, manager of the institute and the greatest
                        compliment we can pay him is to say that everything went off without a
                        hitch, and that everyone agreed that a greater success could not be
                        attained. A excellent lunch and tea were provided and all the provisions,
                        which were brought from Cairo, were of the very best, and not even the
                        ice-chest was forgotten. Beverages of al- most every description were
                        provided and the bar was well patronised, for the day was some- what warm.
                        Members and guests alike vied with each other in their efforts to make the
                        outing a success, and it was unanimously agreed that should future
                        excursions be run on the lines of this one, failure would be impossible.</p>

                    <p>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT).</p>
                    <p>Port Said, Sunday. The whole of the damaged cargo is now out of this vessel.
                        The official estimate of the loss sustained as regards cargo alone, and
                        excluding the damage done to the ship herself which is considerable is
                        between £18,000 and £19,000. The necessary repairs to the hull of the ship,
                        inasmuch as they apparently do not affect her seaworthiness, are to be
                        carried out in England. She will sail in a fortnight’s time.</p>
                    <p>NEW BRITISH TORPEDO DESTROYERS.</p>
                    <p>At dawn to-day the destroyers “Dee,” “Erne," and "Ettrick" arrived from
                        England on their way out to Colombo. These vessels, and three others which
                        are due to-morrow morning, the. "Arun," "Exe," and “Itchen,” are remarkable
                        in their way, as they mark quite a new epoch in naval construction. Included
                        in the 1903 Estimates, they are quite new, steam 25.6 knots, and having a
                        displacement of 540 tons, appear to be an improvement on the old type Up
                        till 1902 no destroyers afloat exceeded 280 tons; the behaviour therefore of
                        this new class will be watched with interest.</p>

                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette. Dear Sir,—We notice in your issue of
                        the 3rd inst. a paragraph headed "Pumps in Egypt" referring to some
                        observations made in “The Times" concerning the alleged superiority of
                        Continental-made, and especially French, pumps, as compared with those of
                        British manufacture. A correspondent writes you disputing-the accuracy of
                        some of the statements made by “The Times” correspondent above, and has
                        repeated the same in the paper "African Commerce".</p>
                    <p>We have had a very large experience during the last forty years in the sale
                        of centrifugal pumps in this country. For some years we were the agents of
                        Messrs. J. and H. Gwynne, of Hammersmith, subsequently we took up the agency
                        of the late firm of Messrs. Gwynne and Co., Essex works, Strand, London, and
                        we have now for many years represented Messrs. Ruston Procter and Co.,
                        Limited, of Lincoln, in the same line.</p>
                    <p>It is a fact that until lately Continental pumps have been increasingly in
                        demand in Egypt, not on the score of price, for they are considerably dearer
                        than British, but upon that of superior mechanical efficiency. So constantly
                        was this brought to our notice that we induced Messrs. Boston Proctor and
                        Co., Limited, to purchase several French pumps by the best makers and carry
                        out a series of experiments with electric drives and measured tanks,
                        &amp;c., the results of which completely bore out the ver- dict of the
                        poblic. The efficiency of some of these pumps was very good, and much in
                        advance of what British makers are as a rule disposed to guarantee. Messrs.
                        Ruston Proctor and Co., Limited, decided to at once re-design their pumps,
                        combining the best points in both British and French makes, and brought out
                        their new pattern helical pump, with which when tested in a similar manner
                        they obtained as high an efficiency in some cases as 84%. We are prepared to
                        guarantee in all sizes about 80% mechanical efficiency with these pumps and
                        are glad to be able to report that all our customers who have tried them are
                        more than satisfied.</p>
                    <p>We feel sure you will consider the above facts of interest, as it is
                        constantly stated that British manufacturers will not move with the times,
                        and an instance such as the above shows that however true the reproach may
                        occasionally be it is not of universal application.—Yours obediently, for
                        Allen Alderson &amp;Co., Limited, F. Allen, Director. Alexandria, May 6.</p>
