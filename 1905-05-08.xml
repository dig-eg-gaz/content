                        <head>EGYPT’S ENGINEERING TRIUMPHS.</head>
                        <p>One of the most interesting sections in Lord Cromer’s Report for 1904
                            deals with the results of recent irrigation works, and notably of the
                            construction of the Assiout and Assouan Reservoirs. It is difficult to
                            avoid hyperbole in discussing these results, which have, as far as can
                            be judged, insured the continual prosperity of Egypt for many years to
                            come, and the Egyptian and European publics have apparently grasped the
                            most remarkable fact connected with these and other great productive
                            works which have been completed or commenced by the Government.
                            Countries more happily situated than Egypt have been able to raise loans
                            which enabled them to obtain the sums necessary for productive works
                            intended for the benefit of posterity, and at the same time to make
                            posterity pay in part for the blessings handed down to it. Egypt has not
                            been in this fortunate position, haring no full financial liberty of
                            action, and the numerous and highly remunerative works constructed have
                            in consequence caused considerable in- convenience to the present
                            generation of Egyptians who have paid heavily that posterity may
                            benefit.</p>
                        <p>At the same time it is evident that the present generation will benefit
                            to a consider- able degree from some at least of the works of public
                            utility which have recently been completed. The Assouan and Assiout
                            Barrages must hold a record among such works for the speed with which
                            they have become remu nerative. They cost L.E. 3,297,000, and up to the
                            end of 1904 a sum of L.E. 1,757,000 had been expended on subsidiary
                            works in Middle Egypt, which enabled the best result to be obtained from
                            the construction of the two great dams. The increased annual rental of
                            the lands affected by the dams and sub- sidiary works is estimated at
                            L.E. 1.553,000, their increased sale value at L.E. 16,780.000. By the
                            end of 1908 a further million and a halt in round figures will have been
                            spent, and the rental of these lands will have been increased by L.E.
                            2,687,000, their sale value by L.E. 26,570,000, and this without
                            counting the benefits to the Delta.</p>
                        <p>This remarkable success, achieved in the teeth of constant difficulties,
                            is probably without parallel in the history of engineering work, and
                            Lord Cromer's tribute to the engi neers under whose auspices these great
                            re sults have been won is right well deserved At the same time it is
                            pleasing to know that the Egyptian Government and the great statesman to
                            whose able guidance so much of the present prosperity of the country is
                            due, have shown a readiness to listen to the advice of experts, and a
                            determination to make the best use of their talents, that the
                            Governments and statesmen of greater and more advanced nations would do
                            well to imitate.</p>

                        <head>THE REVOLT IN YEMEN.</head>
                        <p>The announcement in this morning's tele- grams, that sixteen Redif
                            battalions, belonging to the First Army Corps in Turkey, have been
                            called to the colours for service in Yemen shows that the Porte is
                            becoming alive to the gravity of the situation in Southern Arabia. The
                            present revolt against the Sultan’s authority in these regions is, we
                            believe, due to the chronic grievance against Turkish exactions and
                            Corruption, which keeps rebellion simmering—when it is not actually
                            boiling over—in that country. There seems to be grave danger that the
                            revolt may spread north- ward from Yemen to the Hodjaz. If that were to
                            happen, and if the Turks were to be worsted in the very cradle of Islam,
                            the Caliph would lose his one claim to be regarded as the de facto Head
                            of the Mohamedan world — the guardianship of the Holy Places of Mecca
                            and Medina. That would, obviously, be an event of world-wide importance,
                            which might have consequences of incalculable gravity.</p>

                            only two newspapers in Egypt. One of these was published in the Turkish,
                            and the other in the Arabic language. Both Were offi- cial. In 1868, a
                            private French newspaper was, for the first time, published at
                            Alexandria There are now 30 daily papers, 67 weekly or fortnightly, and
                            52 monthly or bi-monthly periodicals, making in all a total of 149. Of

                            Death," showed off her fine voice to perfection, and as an encore she
                            gave “Three fishes went sailing." Mrs. Baylis’s pretty song and the duet
                            with Mr, Johnson from “Veronique” were enthusiastic- ally encored. Mr.
                            Johnson also sang “The Yeomen of England” and “Gallop away” in an
                            artistic style, and his encore "Devotion’ was splendidly given. Mr.

                            Asides" and "Otto and the Auto" were very amusing. Mr. Heaton sang
                            briskly “Anchored” and also accompanied some songs, as did Mrs. Roberts,
                            who also played two lively pianoforte solos, "Autumn Pastime" and

                    <p>( From our Correspondent. )</p>
                    <p>Medinet-el-Fayoum, Saturday. Something akin to a reign of terror prevails in
                        this province just now. The country is being overridden by a formidable band
                        of brigands. These men, who number about a hundred, have got clever leaders
                        and are well organised. They are armed with the best guns, and have made
                        their head-quarters on the cultivated spots round the desert and hills that
                        separate the Fayoum from the Beni Souef province. They have moreover got
                        secret agents in the various villages of the province. They generally commit
                        their depradations on dark nights, when they make organised descents on the
                        residences of the wealthy inhabitants.</p>
                    <p>The night before last, members of the gang formed a cordon round the village
                        of Bishoun, some of the men being stationed at each bridge and main
                        thoroughfare to prevent help being sought by the inhabitants from the neigh-
                        bouring villages. The omdeh of the village was besieged in his house by
                        twenty armed men. There were only four ghaffirs in the vicinity, the others
                        being out on duty with the molahiz of police, and these four men were
                        utterly powerless to cope with the armed marauders.</p>
                    <p>Another cordon was formed round the resi- dence of the omdeh’s cousin,
                        Soliman el Sayed, who is reputed to have considerable wealth at bis house.
                        More than a hundred shots were fired by the brigands, the ghaffir of the
                        house being killed and three servants wounded.</p>
                    <p>On their entering the house Soliman el Sayed was threatened with immediate
                        death unless he gave up the keys of his safe. This he promptly did, and the
                        robbers made a clean sweep of all the money and valuables they could lay
                        their hands on, including a quantity of jewellery belonging to the omdeh’s
                        wife and sister. They afterwards made good their escape, and are in safe
                        hiding.</p>
                    <p>On hearing of this extraordinary occurrence, I immediately proceeded to the
                        village of Bishoun on behalf of the "Gazette” and there found the Moudir,
                        the Chief of the Parquet, the Commandant of Police and tho district mamour
                        engaged in conducting an enquiry. It was a case, however, of “locking tho
                        stable after the horse is stolen," as the robbers had left the village a
                        long time before they arrived on the spot. I think it would have been better
                        if the Moudir had also sent a detachment of police and ghaffirs to cut off
                        the retreat of the band before they could get across the desert. It would
                        likewise have been advisable to send detectives to find out where the
                        members of the band come from, and to keep their eyes on the brigands, in
                        order to find out what they are going to do beforehand, and not what they
                        have already done.</p>

                    <p>Three shocking crimes have taken place here lately, and it does not seem as
                        if the new sys- tem of private executions is working well. Few of the
                        criminal classes read the newspapers, and as a rule they hear nothing about
                        the carrying out of capital sentences. Fayoum people do not see the hoisting
                        of the black flag at the prison in Cairo, and those who read about the
                        execution of a murderer are not the criminals who would be, perhaps,
                        deterred from crime if they witnessed a public execution on the spot where a
                        murder had been committed. This might act as a deterrent, which should be
                        the main object of punishment</p></div>

                        <p>ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN SCHOOLS</p>
                        <p>I visited the Government school the other day, and spoke with some of the
                            pupils, who are making very satisfactory progress in learn ing English.
                            The headmaster graduated in England, and is therefore proficient in the
                            language of that country. In addition to the Government school, there
                            are three others —one for boys and two for girls—where all the pupils
                            learn English. In a few years' time the language should become almost
                            universal in Egypt, enabling the natives to read good English books and
                            learn the lessons in moral ity, good behaviour, etc., that they cannot
                            find in the Arabic books, which are so hard to understand.</p>

                        Friday morning, via the White Nile and Khartoum, from his big game hunt in
                        Abyssinia. His bag consists of a concession granted by the Emperor Menelik
                        to the National Bank for the establishment of an International Bank of
                        Abyssinia, and about one hundred head of big game, amongst which are some
                        record heads. Mr. McGillivray suffored considerably towards the latter, part
                        of his journey from inflammation of the eyes, but we are happy to hear that
                        he is now pro- gressing towards speedy recovery. We beg to tender him our
                        hearty congratulations at such a successful issue of his expedition, which
                        is as largely due to his indomitable will as to his financial capacity and

                        of all pic-nic places, the Barrage. A special train, provid- ed free by the
                        Railway Administration, left Cairo at 9 a.m., and arrived at the Barrage
                        shortly before a quarter to ten. Some seven hours of enjoyment were spent by
                        the party before the return at 5.35 p.m. The manage- ment and catering were
                        in the hands of Mr. Ben Defrece, manager of the institute and the greatest
                        compliment we can pay him is to say that everything went off without a
                        hitch, and that everyone agreed that a greater success could not be
                        attained. A excellent lunch and tea were provided and all the provisions,
                        which were brought from Cairo, were of the very best, and not even the
                        ice-chest was forgotten. Beverages of al- most every description were
                        provided and the bar was well patronised, for the day was some- what warm.
                        Members and guests alike vied with each other in their efforts to make the
                        outing a success, and it was unanimously agreed that should future
                        excursions be run on the lines of this one, failure would be impossible.</p>

                            damage done to the ship herself which is considerable is between £18,000
                            and £19,000. The necessary repairs to the hull of the ship, inasmuch as
                            they apparently do not affect her seaworthiness, are to be carried out
                            in England. She will sail in a fortnight’s time.</p>

                        <head>PUMPS IN EGYPT.</head>
                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette. Dear Sir,—We notice in your issue
                            of the 3rd inst. a paragraph headed "Pumps in Egypt" referring to some
                            observations made in “The Times" concerning the alleged superiority of
                            Continental-made, and especially French, pumps, as compared with those
                            of British manufacture. A correspondent writes you disputing-the
                            accuracy of some of the statements made by “The Times” correspondent
                            above, and has repeated the same in the paper "African Commerce".</p>
                        <p>We have had a very large experience during the last forty years in the
                            sale of centrifugal pumps in this country. For some years we were the
                            agents of Messrs. J. and H. Gwynne, of Hammersmith, subsequently we took
                            up the agency of the late firm of Messrs. Gwynne and Co., Essex works,
                            Strand, London, and we have now for many years represented Messrs.
                            Ruston Procter and Co., Limited, of Lincoln, in the same line.</p>
                        <p>It is a fact that until lately Continental pumps have been increasingly
                            in demand in Egypt, not on the score of price, for they are considerably
                            dearer than British, but upon that of superior mechanical efficiency. So
                            constantly was this brought to our notice that we induced Messrs. Boston
                            Proctor and Co., Limited, to purchase several French pumps by the best
                            makers and carry out a series of experiments with electric drives and
                            measured tanks, &amp;c., the results of which completely bore out the
                            ver- dict of the poblic. The efficiency of some of these pumps was very
                            good, and much in advance of what British makers are as a rule disposed
                            to guarantee. Messrs. Ruston Proctor and Co., Limited, decided to at
                            once re-design their pumps, combining the best points in both British
                            and French makes, and brought out their new pattern helical pump, with
                            which when tested in a similar manner they obtained as high an
                            efficiency in some cases as 84%. We are prepared to guarantee in all
                            sizes about 80% mechanical efficiency with these pumps and are glad to
                            be able to report that all our customers who have tried them are more
                            than satisfied.</p>
                        <p>We feel sure you will consider the above facts of interest, as it is
                            constantly stated that British manufacturers will not move with the
                            times, and an instance such as the above shows that however true the
                            reproach may occasionally be it is not of universal application.—Yours
                            obediently, for Allen Alderson &amp;Co., Limited, F. Allen, Director.
