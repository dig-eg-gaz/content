                        deliciously cool feeling to the skin.</p>
                    <p>Its unique properties are due to Icilma Natural Water so that it may well be
                        called <hi>Nature’s Skin Food </hi> and the skin requires nothing else to give
                        it the necessary vitality, to preserve it from sunburn, heat, cold or the
                        effects of hard water, to prevent and cure the minor irritations due to
                        overheated blood, and to preserve the youthful fresh look to which hot climates

                    <head>The Future of Spain</head>
                    <p>The approaching marriage of the King? of
                        Spain has thrown an unusual degree of interest
                        on the young ruler of that ancient kingdom
                        Those who would forecast the future and
                        predict the fate of King? Alfonso have do-
                        gularly little material to work upon. "Bourbon
                        child of a Hapsburg mother,” he is the repre-
                        sentative of the two great lines which have
                        ruled Spain through such extraordinary vicissi-
                        tudes of fortune for nearly four centuries.
                        Charles the Fifth was King of Aragon and
                        Casille before the conquest of Mexico or Peru;
                        the minority of Alfonso the Thirteenth saw
                        the last shred of its American Empire torn
                        from the grasp of Spain. But of his personal
                        characteristics and his mental and physical
                        endowments, the world knows little. Born in
                        the purple, he has been denied that training
                        which falls to the lot of the Heirs apparent of
                        the Royal Houses of Europe. Foreign travel
                        has been impossible for him, equaly so has
                        been that free association with his future
                        subjects of equal age and congenial tastes,
                        which is the lot of a Prince of Wales, a Prince
                        of Naples, ora Crown Prince of Germany. And
                        in his case the affectionate care of his mother,
                        placed herself in a position of duel responsi-
                        bility, has been pushed to extremes. We do
                        not know if the Spanish language has any
                        equivalent for oar word "coddled,” and we
                        would not use it for worlds if it is in any
                        degree disrespectful. Let us rather describe his
                        education as akin to "that fugative and
                        oloistered virtue” of which Milton wrote, and
                        let us hope that the young King may find
                        advisers round the Throne who will help and
                        guide him as wisely as Queen Victoria was
                        gaided through the opening years of her
                        ’glorious reign.
                        Ever since the close of the Peninsular War
                        Spain has been the shuttlecock of despotism
                        and revolution alternately. Oat of the chaos
                        has been evolved one of those parodies of
                        Parliamentary and party Government which
                        ware the craze of the Nineteenth Century. It
                        has not brought much prosperity to Spain, and
                        the war of 1898 was the finishing touch to a
                        long series of disasters. It must be added
                        that that country has been singularly unfortu-
                        nate, with rare exceptions, in the personality of
                        its Sovereigns ; and that it has been caused
                        through the greater part of the century with
                        a disputed succession and with a “Legitimist ’
                        party which still issue manifestoes from its
                        eyrie at Venice. The Carlists have been a
                        muoh more dangerous thorn in the side of
                        Spain than were ever the Jacobites in that of
                        Hanoverian England; The Civil War, which
                        was put down on the accession of Alfonso XII,
                        was a far more serious affair than either the
                        "Fifteen” or the 'Forty five.” The reign of
                        the late King was too short for his persons!
                        influence to have fair trial, bat it remains to
                        be seen what a Sovereign of marked individua-
                        lity of character, with the ability to make
                        himself popular and the resolve to place the
                        good of bis country before selfish indulgence,
                        may effect. The young King has a clean
                        slate before him. The loss of the colonies,
                        though a cruel blow to the national pride, has
                        removed an intolerable harden from the na-
                        tional finance and from the military system.
                        For many years past they had been little more
                        than an open sore, and the drain of men and
                        money had been increasing at an appalling rate.
                        It will be interesting to see whether Spain will
                        bow to the blow or will attempt territorial
                        expansion in another direction. It will be extre-
                        mely regrettable if the attention of the nation
                        is one more diverted from its own development
                        to projects of conquest over-seas. We believe
                        that there is still a great future before the land
                        of the Cid if only its great natural resources
                        could ever be utilized and its people taught to
                        forego some of their inveterate habits. It is
                        extraordinary that with vast mineral riches at
                        their very door the rulers of Spain should have
                        contented themselves with exploiting the
                        treasures of the Incas and the mines of Potosi.
                        Spain possesses an invaluable national asset
                        in its country population, hardy and frugal Its
                        extraordinary history has shown it to be un-
                        conquerable by any foreign Power, and to pos-
                        sess in its invincible national pride a force
                        which, under proper direction and with suit-
                        able guidance, might give it once again a voice
                        in the councils of Europe Yet there is an
                        apathy, an ind donee, a blind conservation
                        about the people themselves which seems to
                        render them impervious to the modern spirit.
                        What the country needs is wealth, and yet it
                        neglects one obvious source which could not,
                        one would think, be hurtful to its ‘amour
                        propre,” and which would entail little labour or
                        thought. The coast of Spain might become one
                        of the great tourist resorts of Europe if the
                        innkeepers would only take the trouble, and
                        such a stream of gold might flow into the
                        country as Alva once promised Philip the
                        Second he would wring from the merchants of
                        the Low Countries. The Spanish Riviera is
                        infinitely superior in every point of natural
                        beauty and attraction to its French rival i yet
                        it is unknown and unknowable became there
                        is scarcely a single hotel in it at which a civi-
                        lised passenger can stay. It is the same all over
                        the country, which, with its great natural
                        beauty and wonderfully interesting associa-
                        tions, is practically a terra incognita even
                        to the travelled citizens of the world. The
                        Spaniard, with all his reserve and pride, is not
                        averse to the dollar of the tourist It rests with
                        him whether it is to be permanently withheld.</p>

                        plans for the installation of a drinking water
                        supply at Ras el Bar. Mains will be laid from
                        Damietta, whence the supply will be derived,
                        to Ras el Bar. It is hoped to have the water

                        diers' Institute proved a great sucess, the

                        amply illustrated alike by Mr. R. Williams'
                        remarks and by his lantern slides. We shall
                        deal with the lecture more fully at a later date.

                        at Masserini's Menagerie, which is performing
                        behind the G.P.O., by the appearance of 
                        Mme Masserini in the "Dance of Fire," accom-
                        panied by her pet lion and lioness, Sultan and
                        Gyptis. The performance was witnessed by a
                        large crowd on Sunday also. Two intrepid
                        Alexandrian youths have been entertaining
                        the audiences by entering the lions' cage alone.</p>

                        the British S.S. Braemar, of Leith. The vessel
                        signalled the letters "F.T.R.," meaning "Light
                        in ballast," and the Ports and Lights tug Megd
                        was immediately sent to her assistance and took
                        her in tow from the Braemar, bringing her
                        into the harbour, while the latter vessel pro-
                        ceeded on her way.</p>

                        <p>A "relic" of the famous Empire which
                        Jacques Lebaudy dreamed of founding in the

                        she has made a very successful debut at the 
                        Ambassadors. Lebaudy jilted her two years
                        ago for an artiste of the Nouveautes during
                        his stay in Egypt, and she was naturally
                        indignant with his when he returned to
                        Austria. Her remonstrances, however, elicited
                        revolver-shots, which touched her slighlty and
                        led to the "Emperor" being accorded the hospi-
                        tality of the State. So after visiting several
                        capitals, including Constantinople, the ex Em-
                        press has decided to try her luck on the Cairo
                        stage, as a means of support.</p>

                        <p>NEXT SEASON'S OPERA PROSPECTS</p>
                        <p>Friday night, Fra Diavolo; Saturday night,
                        Zaza: both good but not so satisfactory as
                        Figoletto. Fra Diavolo had not been learnt
                        and rehearsed so fully as would be La Boheme
                        or such pieces. But it is most of it very pretty
                        music, and amusing comedy. Signor Battani
                        and Signa. di Spada were excellent. He has
                        certainly a splendid voice and can command
                        the utmost delicacy and ease, or if wanted
                        great sonority, far more than enough even for
                        the large hall of the Abbas Theatre. If only
                        tbe Khedival Opera would engage such sin-
                        gers! for Signora di Spada was charming in
                        the 2nd act, and the part could not have been
                        sung better.</p>
                        <p>Zaza is, we think, new to Cairo. The play
                        one knows: it is more or less a Traviata in
                        lower life, the music-hall favourite insead of
                        the high demi-mondaine. One cannot but say,
                        however, that it is far more consistent, and
                        powerful, and free from the maudlin element
                        of Dumas' production. The music! Well; what
                        could it be but a rechuffe of Tosca &amp;c., with
                        snatches of Wagner, notably one long phrase
                        straight from the 'Venus Berg' motif? All
                        through the effect is rather coarse and "oppor-
                        tunist," but one has to admit that it is in a 
                        way appropriate. Signor Carpi and again Siga.
                        di Spada were the best, Siga. di Spada
                        was particularly ecellent in her acting,
                        and certainly in the first two acts in her
                        dress and manner and everything else she
                        bit the exact note. The chorus was very bad
                        in the 3rd act behind the scene, but lively and 
                        natural in the first act. Signor Barterra is
                        perhaps the only really unsatisfactory singer:
                        he showed this in Lorenzo in Fra Diavolo as
                        well as on this occasion as Malardot: his voice
                        is thin and he sings flat, with far too much
                        effort. Signor Arrighetti (Cascar) would be
                        effective but for the persistent prolongation of
                        his notes, which is very trying.</p>
                        <p>Yet on the whole company is more than
                        satisfactory, and the Theartre Abbas is well
                        worth going to. It would be well to say a word
                        as to next year's prospects at the Khedival
                        Threatre. Probably great promises will be held
                        forth, but we heard on fairly good authority
                        that as yet no dircetor has been engaged, and
                        that no engagement will be made till the end
                        of July result: not a single good artiste will
                        be availabale, all having been engaged elsewhere
                        long ago. It is said that the one most capable
                        director who had offered his services refused
                        for this very reason. So we must make up our
                        minds to a repition of last year, - one or two
                        "half" stars, anda  crowd of others, doubtless
                        worthy people in themselves, but quite un-
                        known, and very far below the first or even
                        the second class. When, if ever, shall we be 
                        allowed to have a voice in these matters? If
                        we cannot have something good, at least, we
                        might be told so at once instead of being lulled 
                        into accepting the pretentious and nondescript
                        stuff for which we have the pleasure of paying,
                        and out artistic patrons of receiving, such
                        exorbitant sums.</p>

                        vise the relations between Egypt and the
                        Sultan of Turkey, and it so whether they
                        would consider the desirability of terminating
                        the Tribute.</p>
                        <p>Sir E. Grey: The Government do not desire

                        <p>QUESTIONS REGARDING THE TARIFF</p>
                        <p>In the House of Commons last Tueesday, Mr.
                        Gooch asked whether, in view of the present
                        temper of the Porte, His Majesty's Govern-
                        ment would resist the increase of the Turkish
                        Tariff till Lord Lansdowne's conditions involv-
                        ing the administratice control of Macedonia
                        by the Powers had been accepted</p>
                        <p>Sir Edward Grey replied that the question
                        of the administration and control of Macedonia
                        was settled by the institution of Internatio-
                        nal Finanacial Commission which was accepted 
                        by the late Government. The assent of his 
                        Majesty's Government and the other Powers
                        to the proposed increase of the Turkish Tariff
                        would only be given subject to a sufficient
                        guarantee that the proceeds would be applied 
                        to making goof the deficit on the Macedonian

                        OUR CONSULAR SERVICE.
                        REPLY TO “XENOS.”
                        To the Editor of the “Egyptian Gazette.”
                        Dear Sir,—Here area few observations in
                        regard to “ Xenos’ ” letter as far as the Levant
                        is concerned:— The necessary qualifications
                        for a Consol are more numerous than he would
                        appear to imagine. Mere commercial knowledge
                        is nothing—if it is rot backed by a know
                        ledge of the language and history of the
                        locality to which he is appointed, as wide
                        an education as he can acquire, and certain
                        qualities, such as tact and good manners,
                        which are valuable even in these days of
                        strenuous and uncultured efficiency.
                        As to the Consoler reports, “Xenos” will
                        find, if he takes the trouble to study recent
                        reports from various towns in the Ottoman
                        Empire, a great improvement in the com-
                        mercial information which they contain. Mach
                        remains to be done in this respect, but
                        good beginning has been made.
                        Then comes the question, should a Consul
                        he a diplomatist or not ? “Xenos” remarks
                        that the Turkish authorities have more than
                        once regarded Consular interference in the
                        Lebanon, Armenia, and Macedonia “in the
                        light if political intrigue.” Well, Sir, what
                        does it matter if they do so regard it ? If
                        sensible Consul can stop a riot, mitigate
                        the cruelty of the local authorities, or protest
                        against some peculiarly scandalous act of
                        oppression or corruption on their part, so
                        mnoh the better. Really, after the recent
                        performance's of the Porte, “Xenos” is a little
                        too considerate for the feelings of that sublime
                        abstraction which takes the responsibility for
                        Sultan Abdul Hamid’s acts
                        Personally I think one might solve the
                        difficulty by appointing a certain number of
                        purely commercial consular assistants to each
                        consulate-general, if our trade is really in
                        each a bad way. But I am a little sceptical ;
                        and if there is any menace to our com-
                        merce in the Levant it appears to me to
                        be largely the fault of our home merchant?,
                        who send out travelers who often cannot
                        speak any language but English—and that
                        often incorrectly -and then do not trouble
                        act on the recommendations of these
                        worthies. Finding themselves losing ground
                        through their own slackness and want of
                        imagination they then howl to the Govern-
                        ment to help them.	Civis.

                    <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE “EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.”
                        Sir, -A few weeks ago you published an
                        extract from L^rd Cromer’s Report quoting
                        the opinion of an English Railway Director as
                        to the working of the State Railways. We have
                        had some experience of the delays on these
                        lines and have suffered and arp still suffering
                        loss in consequence. It takes three, four, and
                        , even five days to get delivery of goods from
                        Alexandria. There is no sense in such delays
                        —no third-rate Railway Company in England
                        or even on the Continent would be tolerated
                        to so delay delivery. As the E.R.A. holds the
                        monopoly it should be compelled to give effi-
                        cient service. We protest against the English
                        Railway official referred to whitewashing the
                        E.R.A. and do not believe that he had enquir-
                        ed of any traders at Cairo or elsewhere or he
                        would not have reported so favorably. Every-
                        body depending for their supplies on the rail-
                        way transit has had to suffer owing to its
                        inefficient management. John Jones &amp; Co.

                    <head>Port Said Sporting Club</head>
                    <p>To the Editor of the “Egyptian Gazbtti.”
                        I Sir, — Many readers of your valuable paper
                        were pleaded to see this mild protest of “The
                        Woman who Knows” in your last Satarday’s
                        issue re the feature(?) New Sporting Club of our
                        town. But, Mr. Editor, there is no valid
                        reason why there should be a Sporting Club
                        of this character at Port Said, when we are so
                        much in need of a public garden in which our
                        children, and even the parents, could find some
                        recreation, which would somewhat break the
                        monotony of the everlasting walks upon the
                        sand. A Sporting Club would only mean—not
                        merely a delight to Schweppe’s —but a standing
                        advertisement for the leading whisky firms, and
                        also entertainment for a few selfish residents.
                        The ridocuous idea of a Sporting Club
                        emanated from the brain of a former Govern-
                        ment official, and on his departure it was hoped
                        the scheme would have been abandoned. To
                        some extent a douche was applied, but agree-
                        ing with the sentiment of ‘'The Woman who
                        Knows,” it would take a tidal wave to stir up
                        any same enthusiasm here, and as yon no doubt
                        are aware snob a phenomenon as a tidal wave
                        is unknown in the Mediterranean. It remains
                        to be seen whether the Red Sea could afford
                        os any assistance in this line.
                        The Government were kind enough to pre-
                        sent the inhabitants with the land, and it was
                        first suggested to raise public subscriptions
                        with a view to establishing a Sporting Club,
                        bnt it is understood the subscriptions aid not
                        come along an freely as was anticipated.
                        To have anything worthy of consideration at
                        all, whether it be a Sporting Club, or a public
                        garden, it would require an outlay of say
                        £2/3,000 at a minimum and this amount will
                        never, I venture to say, be collected from the
                        residents at Port Said as most of them are
                        here with the one idea of making as much
                        money as possible with the final aim to leave
                        and enjoy the remainder of their lives in their
                        native countries and therefore do not take
                        more than a passing interest.
                        In my opinion the test thing possible would
                        be for the Government to take the entire affair
                        in hand, and erect a public garden under their
                        control. I feel confident that the expressions
                        contained in this letter have the full sym

                        TO PROTECT THE SUEZ CANAL.
                        Althongh it has been decided by the Admi-
                        ralty to abolish the naval command of the
                        Cape of Good Hope and West Coast of Africa
                        Squadron, and to reduce the naval strength
                        in the waters from the Red Sea to the Cape,
                        yet in view of the dangers to which, in time
                        of war, the Sort Canal mast be exposed, it
                        will be essential to keep the dockyard at
                        Simonstown—upon which large sums have
                        been spent—in such a condition that its
                        staff may be expanded without delay in case
                        of hostilities occurring of a character likely
                        to lead to its being required for the docking
                        and repair of the largest men-of war whioh
                        extended operations may take into these waters.
                        As no other nation keeps any men-of-war
                        in the vicinity of the Cape of Good Hope,
                        the possibility of naval actions thereabouts
                        is remote. The nearest foreign squadron is
                        a small French one based on Madagascar.</p>

                <head>LAND &amp; MORTGAGE OF EGYPT</head>
                <p>The twenty-sixth annual general meeting of
                    the shareholders of the Land and Mortgage
                    Company of Egypt, Limited, was held on the
                    18th inst. at the Cannon-street Hotel, E.C.,
                    under the presidency of Sir Edward Leigh Pem
                    berton, K.C.B. (the chairman of the company.)
                    The Secretary (Mr. J. Chisholm) having read.
                    the notice convening the meeting and the
                    report of the auditors,
                    The Chairman said : It often happens that
                    the chairman of a company has to apologise to
                    his shareholders for the dulness and monotony
                    of his annual addresses, bat it is seldom tho
                    case that he can excuse that monotony by
                    attributing it to uninterrupted success ; but
                    that is my position. I don't suppose that at any
                    time in the chequered career of Egypt that
                    country has been in a better state socially or
                    financially than at the present moment. You
                    arc aware that quite recently the Sultan at
                    Constantinople was said to be very aggressive
                    and to threaten to annex some part of the
                    property of Egypt ; but I think his attention
                    was confined to the peninsula of Sinai, and
                    there is no reason to think that any of the
                    lands in mortgage to our company are in dan-
                    ger, and we may consider our position in that
                    respect tolerably secure. The position of Egypt
                    muBt be very satisfactory to you an Englishmen
                    and not less so as shareholders in this company
                    and, though its flourishing condition has
                    attracted an enormous volume of adventure,
                    including, of coarse, much competition with
                    oar own enterprise, there is still, we think,
                    room for us all, and we are glad to see attention
                    given to business in Egypt.There has never been
                    so much speculation in land—sales and re-sales
                    are constantly made, and each time at an
                    advanced price. How loDg the advance may
                    be, nobody can tell ; but we don’t buy land ;
                    we only help others to buy it, and help those
                    to develop it who have already got it ; and, if
                    coarse, the increased value of the land enhan
                    ces the margin of our security. I believe we
                    could advantageously place a larger amount of
                    capital than we have got, but as our funds are
                    limited we have endeavored to make the most
                    of what we have got. We hive therefore deter-
                    mined, as you are aware, to convert, as far as
                    we can, the existing debentures, which are paid
                    off by annual drawings and bear interest at 4$
                    and 5 per cent, into debenture stock bearing
                    interest at 4 per cent.,and to issue the balance
                    over the total of the existing debentures, and
                    amounting to £17,200, as debenture stock.
                    This sum was very largely oversubscribed aDd
                    has been allotted, and the amount converted is
                    satisfactory ; and as each annual drawing takes
                    place, the sam paid will be re-issued at 4 per
                    cent., instead of 4.5 or 5 per cent I think 1
                    told you last year that the amount of capital
                    then invested was £593,64$, being the largest
                    sam employed by the company since its founda-
                    tion -that was on March 81, 1905 ; on March
                    31, 1906, it was £598,232, showing an increase
                    of £1,584. The new loans, as well as the old
                    ones, are, as Mr. Hari reports, safe and on very
                    good security, and the general condition of the
                    business is as good as it was in the record year,
                    1905. As to the rate of interest on oar invest-
                    ments, it has, as we anticipated, diminished
                    bat in a very trifling degree, and it still amounts
                    to something over 7 per cent. Of course, we
                    could not expect to maintain oar old rate in
                    face of the competition we have to meet ; but
                    we look to the increased volume of business
                    and to the reduced rate of interest we onrsel-
                    ves pay to restore the balance and enable us to
                    continue the payment of £10 per cent, to oar
                    shareholders. I am sorry Mr. Hari is not here
                    to-day, as he was at our last annual meeting ;
                    but he is busy at work on the spot, where all
                    our real work is done, and where I daresay be
                    is better employed ; but I am sure that the
                    shareholders will feel and express, as the direc-
                    tors do, their deep sense of the gratitude they
                    owe to him for the continued satisfactory con-
                    dition of their affairs. (Applause.)
                    
                    I will now turn to the accounts. You will see
                    that the gross earnings for the year amount to
                    £45,900, as against £44,291 last year, being an
                    increase of £1,609. The net earnings this year
                    were £18,196, as against £17,089 last year,
                    showing an increase of £1,113. From the gross
                    earnings of £45,900 we have deducted the
                    total expenditure, which includes the interest
                    on the debenture bonds. To the net earning-! of
                    the year, £18,196, is to be added the balance
                    brought forward from last year of £2,139 odd,
                    making together a total of £20,335 19s, 6d.
                    From this we deduct the interim dividend paid
                    last November at the rate of 10 per cent.,
                    amounting to £7,500, leaving a credit balance
                    of £12,835 19s. 6d. Oat of this we have placed
                    £3,000 to reserve for contingencies, leaving
                    available a balance of £9,835 19a. 6d. We
                    recommend a dividend of 5 per cent, for the
                    past six months, which, with the 5 per cent,
                    paid in November, will make up a dividend
                    of 10 per coat, for the year This wi'l absorb
                    £7,500, leaving the sum of £2 335 19s. 6d. to
                    be carried forward. I think you will consider
                    this a very satisfactory state of affairs, and
                    if you are good enough, as I hope you will
                    be, to pass the report and accounts, the
                    dividend will be issued to day. I now beg
                    to move :	"That	the report and accounts
                    submitted to this meeting be, and are hereby,
                    received and adopted, and that, as recom-
                    mended by the board, a dividend of 10 per
                    cent. per annum on the paid-up share capital
                    of the company for the year ended March
                    31 last, consisting of the interim dividend of
                    5 per cent, for the six months ended September
                    30 paid by the board on account in November
                    last and 5 per cent, for the six months ended
                    March 81 last, be, and is hereby, declared,
                    free of income tax.” (Applause.)

                    Mr. Skeel : You said yoa could easily place

                    and, as one of the original shareholders who</p>

                <cb n="2"/>
                <p>thoroughly appreciates the fact that yon
                    have taken us out of troublous times and
                    brought us into a happy condition, I should
                    like to say that I have got confidence in you,
                    and if you wanted additional capital I think
                    you have only got to say so and the share
                    holders will subscribe all that may be requir-
                    ed. Then I should like to say 1 think yon
                    might rest and be thankful with the amount
                    you have placed to reserve, and that if things
                    go on as they appear to be doing, if yon
                    do not like to raise the dividend of 10 per
                    cent, you might pay us a bonus.
                    Sir Walter F. Miéville, K.C.M.G. (director):
                    We are quite with you about the reserve ; but
                    this year you must take the result as excep-
                    tional. In the old days, and with the auditors’
                    consent, we used to put on the credit side
                    of the balance sheet the expenses for the issue
                    r>f debentures, and write them off little by
                    little, aDd I am afraid that, as a share
                    holder, not then being a director, I used to
                    say that it was a bogus asset We have had
                    to pay 2 1/2 per cent, and 2 per cent, to people
                    who have come in with the five per cents,
                    and two and-a-half per cents., and we want to
                    pay off the expenses connected with the de-
                    bentures, so that when the time comes—if
                    it does come—that the rate of interest goes
                    down in Egypt, we should be in a position to
                    borrow money at 4 per cent, net, without any
                    "bogus assets” on the other side. We have
                    got the cleanest balance-sheet possible, and
                    we want to keep it.
                    The Chairman : It is only a matter of se-
                    curity, as you see.
                    The motion was then pat and unanimously
                    agreed to.
                    The Chairman moved the re-election of
                    Viscoant Hampden as a director, remarking
                    that he was one of the original directors.
                    Mr. R. C. Johnston seconded the motion,
                    which was carried unanimously, and, on the
                    motion of the Chairman, seconded by S r
                    Walter Miéville, Mr. N. Stanhope Stott, the
                    other director retiring, was also re-elected.
                    Messrs. Dartnall moved the reappointment
                    of Messrs. Price, Waterhouse and Co., as
                    auditors, which was seconded by Mr.West and
                    carried unanimously.
                    A vote of thanks was accorded the chairman
                    and directors for their services during the year,
                    and a similar compliment was paid to the staff,
                    with special mention of the service! of Mr.
                    Hari.</p>

                    cela avait été annoncé avant-hier par suite,
                    assurément, d’une erreur de transmission télé-
                    graphique.
                    Samedi passé, aa Stock Exchange, le Con-

                    à la fermeté. L’ouverture de la séance a été
                    très animée, spécialement sur les Delta Land

                    la fusion des deux Sociétés.

                    alors que celui de la Nungovich Hotels Co. n’a
                    été que d’environ la moitié de cette somme.

                    Grand Continental.
                    Il ressort du rapport da conseil qn’apres
                    prélèvement d’une somme d’environ L.E. 15.000

                    Un actionnaire a demandé des explications
                    sur les rameurs propagées relativement à la
                    venta da Grand Continental, les dispositions
                    spéciales qui auraient été prises pour le Mena
                    House et l’Hôtel Casino de SanStefano, le pro-
                    jet de transformation de la Société, etc.
                    Le président a habilement répondu que si
                    qaelqne résolution avait été prise sur ces
                    points, le conseil n’eût pas manqué de la corn

                    nant la situation monétaire :
                    "Malgré toutes les apparences contraires, la
                    tention monétaire persiste ici, car non seulement
                    la place de New York est toujours mal ponrvue,
                    mais on s’y attend à la prolongation de cet
                    état do choses. La preuve en est qu’une des plus
                    grandes et des plus fortes Compagnies amé

                    offrir à un prix légèrement inférieur an pair.
                    "En dépit des abaissements transitoires

                        GERMANY AND HER COLONIES.
                        REBUFF TO GOVERNMENT.
                        Berlin, May 28.
                        The Reichstag has practically rejected the
                        whole of the Supplementary Estimates for
                        South West Africa and subsequently refused
                        the Government the necessary money to estab-
                        lish a Ministry of the Colonies. This severe
                        rebuff to the Government is mainly due to
                        a hectoring speech of Colonel Deimling, who
                        has just been appointed to the command in
                        South Africa. He lectured the Reichstag in
                        a stentorian voice as if he were giving orders
                        to troops on the drill-ground, declaring his
                        determination to ignore certain recommenda-
                        tions of the Budget Committee unless otherwise
                        directed by the Emperor, who, he said, alone
                        bad to decide. A tremendous uproar ensued.

                        in this country during recent years, affords
                        another proof of the high standard of know

                        England seems at the present time to he
                        keeping somewhat in the background, and we
                        have only to instance the fact that it was an
                        Italian professor who was recently appointed to

                        and that the history of the Cairo Museum

                        siderably in the work of unveiling the glories
                        of Egypt’s past history. Professor Breasted not
                        only presents his Hots in a very attractive
                        and interesting manner, bat as he says in his
                        preface, he has aimed above everything at
                        accuracy. noting that “although many ex-
                        haustively accurate publications of hiero-
                        glyphic documents now appear with every
                        year, it is nevertheless true that the large
                        majority of standard Egyptian documents
                        access la in publications exhibit a degree
                        of incompleteness and inaccuracy not, in
                        the author’s judgment, to be found in any
                        other branch of epigraphic science.
                        “Under these circumstances the author’s
                        first obligation has been to go behind the
                        publications to the original monument itself
                        in every possible instance. This task has
                        consumed years and demanded protract-
                        ed sojourn among the great collections of

                        How far the author has succeeded in making
                        ancient Egyptian history clearer than hereto-
                        fore only a savant can pretend to say, but the
                        many exquisite photographs taken direct from
                        the temples at Thebes and other places should
                        certainly be of great value to the Egyptologist,
                        and these form one of the most valuable
                        features of the work.
                        “Egyptian arcbæology,” says the author, “is
                        in its infancy, and but few of the fundamental
                        studies and researches already completed in
                        classical arohæology have been made in this
                        province.” And, referring to early forms of
                        religion he says, “The study of Egyptian
                        religion has but began, and decades will pass
                        before even the preliminary special studies
                        shall have been completed.........” To the
                        author’s contributions on the subject of reli-
                        gion we shall refer later on.
                        It was with some feeling of disappointment
                        that we found on opening the hook and read
                        ing its early chapters, no attempt to elucidate
                        the story of Egypt in prehistoric times. Pro-
                        fessor Flinders Petrie gave us in the first
                        volume of his History of Egypt much valuable
                        information in this direction, and we hope
                        that some day we shall know far more than
                        we do at present of the Stone Age and the
                        races who fashioned the carved stones lying
                        about everywhere which still bear traces of
                        the original designs made on them in the
                        remote ages. This by the way. Our author
                        evidently considers the historic ages as of
                        more importance and devotes himself to them,
                        making but slight reference even to the early
                        pottery of the remote ages or the anceint
                        burial p'aces found in the valley of the Nile.
                        But from the point from which he takes up the
                        history of the country np to the fall of
                        Psamtik III., with which the volume ends, the
                        author gives us fact on fact of the utmost
                        interest to the tourist, the Bible student, and
                        the professional scholar, embodying as he does
                        the results df the very latest researches. The
                        following passage is deeply interesting, giving
                        as it doss an insight into the science of
                        “Earliest Egypt:” —
                        Already in the forty third century B. C
                        the men of the Delta had discovered the
                        year of three hundred and sixty five days
                        and they introduced a calendar year of this
                        length beginning on the day when Sirius
                        rose at sunrise, as determined in the lati-
                        tude of the southern Delta, where these
                        earliest astronomers lived, in 4241 B. C
                        It is the civilization of the Delta, therefore
                        which furnishes us with the earliest fixed
                        dates in the history of the world. The in-
                        vention and introduction of this calendar
                        is surprising evidence of the advanced col-
                        tore of the age and locality to which it
                        belongs. No ration of antiquity, from the
                        earliest times through classic European
                        history, was ab!e to devise a calendar,
                        which should evade the inconvenience re-
                        sulting from the fact that the lunar month
                        and the solar year are incommensurable
                        quantities, the lunar months being incon-
                        stant and also not evenly dividing the
                        solar year. This earliest known calendar,
                        with an amazingly practical insight into
                        the needs to b9 subserved by a calendar
                        abandoned the lunar month altogether and
                        substituted for it a conventional month of
                        thirty days. Its devisers were thus the
                        first people to perceive that a calendar
                        must be an artificial device, entirely di-
                        vorced from nature save in the acceptance
                        of the day and tho year. They therefore
                        divided the year into twelve of those
                        thirty day months, and a sacred period
                        of five feast-days, intercalated at tho end
                        cf tho year. The year began on that day
                        when Sirius first appeared on the eastern
                        horizon at sunrise, which in our calendar
                        was on the nineteenth of July. But as
                        this calendar year was in reality about</p>

                        year, it therefore gained a fall day every

                        years, only to begin the revolution again.
                        An astronomical event like the heliacal
                        rising of Sirius, when dated in terms of
                        the Egyptian calendar, may therefore be
                        computed and dated within four years in
                        terms of our reckoning, that is, in years
                        B. C. This remarkable calendar, already
                        in use at a remote age, is the one introduc-
                        ed into Rome by Julius Cæsar, as the
                        most convenient calendar then known, and
                        by the Romans it was bequeathed to us.
                        It has thus been in use uninterruptedly
                        over six thousand years. We owe it to the
                        men of the Delta Kingdom, who lived in
                        the forty-third century B. C. ; and we
                        should notice that it left their hands in
                        much more convenient form, with its twelve
                        thirty day months, than after it had suffer-
                        ed irregular alteration in this respect at the
                        hands of the Romans.
                        It would he scarcely fair to Prof. Breasted,
                        even did oar limited space permit us to do
                        so, to quote at length mach of the inte-

                    <head>THE RECENT DISCOVERIES AT
                        OXYRHYNCHUS.</head>
                    <p>Referring to the recent discoveries at
                        Oxyrhynchus, the “Daily Telegraph” says :—
                        Once more Dr. Grenfell, and Dr. Hunt have
                        made valuable discoveries in the mounds of
                        Oiyrhynchus, quite equal in importance to
                        those which so fascinated the world of schelar-
                        ship nine years ago. The Egyptian Exploration
                        Fund has done wonders already, especially in
                        reference to those so-called “Logia”—“the
                        sayings of our Lord”-one of which at least
                        has a strange and unique value. In 1897, out
                        of a mass of papyri dog out of the rains of
                        Oxyrhynchus, which was one of the chief early
                        Christian centres in Egypt, and is situated
                        some one hundred and twenty miles sooth of
                        Cairo, was extracted a fragment containing
                        eight sayings of the Lord. What exactly they
                        constituted has been much debated by scholars
                        since. Harnack maintains that they come from
                        the lost Gospel of the Egyptians ; others suggest
                        that they are excerpts from a primitive Gospel
                        —probably written in Hebrew in the first in-
                        stance ; while others, again, speak of them as
                        though they formed part of a sort of original
                        nucleus of the four canonical Gospels. Most of
                        the eight ‘‘sayings” added little or nothing
                        to what we possess, bat the one numbered
                        five was of first-rate interest and importance
                        a strange text, in which Christ, possibly in a
                        spirit of Pantheism, says, “Raise the stone
                        and there thou shalt find Me, cleave-the wood
                        and there am I.” To these “sayings” is now
                        added a fresh and highly-interesting contribu-
                        tion. Amongst the newest finds of Doctors
                        Grenfell and Hunt is a vellum leaf, forty-five
                        lines in all, from the manuscript of a lost
                        Gospel. The subject, we are told, is a visit of.
                        Jesus, with his disciples, to the Temple at Je-
                        rusalem, and an encounter with a Pharisee who
                        rebukes Christ and his followers because they
                        have omitted the necessary and proper cere-
                        monial of purification before entering the Holy j
                        Place, and our Lord replies with a discourse
                        on the difference between external and in-
                        ternal parity. This, of coarse, is not dissi-
                        milar from what we already have, both in
                        the Gospels of Matthew and Luke ; bat we are
                        told that in the new fragment there are several
                        words not found in the New Testament,
                        while the writer displays a considerable fami-
                        liarity with Jewish customs, and also with
                        the topography of the Temple at Jerusalem.
                        The nature and value of the Gospel from which
                        this passage comes we do not know, nor can
                        more be said on the subject until the fresh
                        Oxyrhynchus papyri are published next year.
                        But this is not the only valuable element in the
                        new discoveries. There la a fragment from
                        Pindar—a novel form pf composition for the
                        Theban bard, for it consists of odes of suppli-
                        cation or thanksgiving, addressed to a god, and
                        not a pæan, such as those with which tire are
                        familiar, in honour of some athletic victor.
                        There is also a part of a tragedy on the subject
                        of Hypsipyle, supposed to be by Euripidies;
                        and strangely enough, a part of a new history of
                        Greece has been unearthed, which, it is hoped,
                        will throw fresh light on the Pelopnnesisan
                        war. Some of these manuscripts, dating from
                        the second or third century, but thrown away,
                        apparently, in the fifth century, belonged, it is
                        clear, to an owner of a library, an among them
                        are, we are told, fragments of Sappho and
                        Bacchylides. So strange and wonderful has
                        been the harvest of treasures due to the unre-
                        bitting care and zeal of these modern dis-
                        coverers, that we find ourselves, in the opening
                        years of the twentieth century, not only adding
                        to the scanty store of Greek literature, but, in
                        some cases, actually revising the literary judg-
                        meant of old classical scholars.</p>
