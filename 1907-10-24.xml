                    <p>In the "London Magazine" Dr. Redolf Mar tin, whinee book om "The Age of
                        Airship reviewed in valmns some months ay writes a most optimistic article
                        on the fut f airships Most optimistic, we say. for | evidently did not doabt
                        the saecess of Vi Wellmau's expedition and by this time we « know what
                        happened to that He ip probe! right, however, in thinking that the geners
                        pablie do not realise how mech the sir ha heen already conquered, and that
                        military authorities and state officials do not realise the importance of
                        aerial navigation. He reminds us of Thiers a remark about the first train
                        "The Parisians must have loved this plaything, but it will never carry a
                        traveller or a piece of luggage". Exactly similar remarks are being made
                        to-day about the airship</p>
                    <p>Dr. Martin seems quite convinced that the airhip is fast tending to become
                        "the most terrible engine of destruction the mind of ma: oan conceive."
                        Pranes, of course, first seized on the ides of airships, apd used balloousin
                        bettie im 1784. In the singe of Patis sixty-five bal loons made an ascent
                        from the town ; but as they were not steerable balloons they were of little
                        use. France, however, then realised he possibilities of ballons, if they
                        were but steer able, and granted a naval engineer 1,600 for the purpose of
                        constructing one. At present France has two battle-airships, the "Lebaudy"
                        (1905) and the "Patrie" (1906) and five in construction , Geermany, of
                        course, not to be behindhand, has had a Prussian aeronact battalion since
                        1906 busied with the construction of an aérial fleet, and this year a little
                        motor airship, beld by ropes, with two men on board, waa sent up repeatedly
                        by the aéronact battalion at Tegel. It is the mode! of s larger
                        battle-airship, which will be som what of the semi-flexible type of airship
                        of the brothers Lebaedy. The successful ascent of the German battle-airship
                        im July last over Berlin will be remembered. Germany, moreover, pos senses
                        the services of two of the greatest aéronaats—Count von Zeppelin and Major
                        von Parseval. The former has a rigid aleminiam airship, whieh can go at
                        thirty miles an hour agninat the wind , the latter a flexible airship Count
                        von Zeppelin's airship is "the most ter rible engine of aérial warfare yet
                        constructed,' wing able to rain thirty torpedoes of 22 Ibs weight each upon
                        the enemy. Illustrations of all these wondertal airships are The two French
                        battle-eirships are said, on the best authority, to be capable of carrying
                        thirty, and short joumeys even fifty, torpedioe- of more than 22 lbs.
                        each.</p>
                    <p>The appallingness of war in the age of air ships, the annihilation of
                        frontiers, the sailing mm the air harmless over neutral territory chartered
                        libertinism, in fact, of the new engines of war, and their inexpensiveness

                        review of Dr Martin's book. What was not so well done in his book was
                        answering the objections usually urged against airships</p>
                    <p>Objection 1 The airship is easily dispo ed of.</p>
                    <p>Answer At 2,000 metres it is practically safe from the fire of even heavy
                        artillery At present no one can shoot up to more than 1,50U metres, and only
                        the infantrymea can do this, At present, bowever, gums for aizehip« are
                        being constructed. and cannons for balloons may also be constructed. Dark
                        fog, and cloud moreover, are constantly reckoned upon by airship enthusiasts
                        to come to the aid of the battle-airshipa, and help them unscathed to do
                        untold damage.</p>
                    <p>Objection 2: Pierce an airship and all is up with it</p>
                    <p>Answer A single ball carries with it no: great danger for an airship If it
                        should go through the gas balloon of a flexible or sem flexible airship with
                        a capacity of about 3,000 ubtc metres, the aéronauts have still plenty tiwe
                        to retreat with the aitship before it sinks to the ground The gas escapes
                        only ver slowly from the holes made by the bullet.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, it is decidedly diffienlt to bit an airship</p>
                    <p>Objection 3 The aerial fleet ix almost use less for battles fought out at
                        sea, as enough henzine cannot be taken</p>
                    <p>Answer They do not art from a fixed land hase, bat from a movable base —the
                        fleet and small, flexible airships can easily be carried in battleship and
                        inflated on board with compressed gas. The battle-sirship will be part of
                        the equipment of a modern battleship, lke heavy guns. The Zeppelin airship
                        can travel 530 miles and back again without tohing any benzine.</p>
                    <p>Objection 4. Guns can never be used from the cars owing to the danger of an
                        explosion This is the objection of one of the great aero nautic experts.</p>
                    <p>Answer: Probably a ngid aluminiom airship could be guaranteed against such
                        danger, in time it will be got over Flexible and sem: flexible airships,
                        having only one gas-bladder, while sleminiom airships have sixteen or
                        missile charged with phosphoras solution would explode the gas envelope. The
                        opposing air ships will, of course, always aim at ripping "p each other's
                        envelopes</p>

                    <head>WALKER AND MEIMARACHI.</head>
                    <p>ENGLISH AND CAIRO BOARDS</p>
                    <p>An extraordinary general meeting of Wal- ker and Meimarachi, Limited, called
                        in pur- snance of a requisition made by certain share- holders, was held on
                        the 17th Oct. 1907 at Salsibury House, Finsbury-circus</p>
                    <p>At the commencement of the meeting Mr. J.E. Drower took the chair. Before the
                        pro ceedings commenced, however, Mr. Carton de Wiart objected to Mr. Dowers
                        presiding, and claimed that he himself was chairman of the company. It was
                        true, he said, that a portion of the board, at a meeting to which neither of
                        the Egyptian members was called, declared, on a technicality, that he was no
                        louger qualified to be a director, or, therefore, technicality no longer
                        existed, and therefore he thought he was ipso facto reinstated as
                        chairman.</p>
                    <p>After some discussion Mr. Drower consented to an independenr gentleman being
                        appointed and Mr. W. T. Western, on being asked, co sented to preside.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said the meeting had done him the honour to pvt him in s very
                        diffeult position. He was not pecuniarily interested to a large extent, bet
                        he represented one or more of the largest shareholders, and last year, at
                        their request, he went to Cairo, and there had the opportunity of making
                        himself acquainted with some of the persons who had charge of the
                        business.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary (Mr. H.C. Hood) having read the notice.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rau moved the first resolution - "That it is desirable to adjust the
                        differences between the English and the Egyptian members of the board as
                        speedily as may be." He complained that the board had refused to receive
                        amend- ments of which notice had been given, and then went on to express
                        disapproval of the board having, a few days ago, elected George Walxer to
                        fill the vacancy in number. He dealt at some length with the disagreements
                        which had arisen between the London directors and those in Egypt, which had
                        as long as a year ago led the London directors to change the whole basis on
                        whieh the basiness was started ten years ago. It was started on the fact
                        that it was M. Meimarachi's business, and, bet for bis hame, many would not
                        bave subscribed. The London directors about eighteen months ago superseded
                        Mr Meimarachi as managing director without informing the shareholders, and
                        no information was given to the shareholders even at the last general
                        meeting, though after the meeting there was a sort of informal
                        commanication. He urged that in consequence of the action of the board in
                        depriving the business of its snccessful head the trade showed onmistakable
                        signs of falling off. It was urgently mecessary that Mr Meimarachi should be
                        reinstated.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Macandrew seconded the resolution, and said that im all bis experience he
                        had never found more well-grounded causes for complaint</p>
                    <p>Mr Javal asked when Mr. Walker was ap pointed director</p>
                    <p>The Chairman read the minutes, which showed that on September 20 last Mr.
                        Walker was appointed, subject to his acquiring the necessary
                        qualification</p>
                    <p>In answer to further questions it was stated that Mr Walker had since
                        acquired the shares bet there had been no further resolution of the board
                        with regard to his appointment.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Barrington said that ander Article 80 the directors should only appoint
                        "a qualified member As Mr. Walker was not then qoalifi led, and he had not
                        been appointed since jobtaiming his qualification, he (the speaker held that
                        the appointment wes illegal</p>
                    <p>Mr. Payne (solicitor to the company), being Jasked for his opinion, replied
                        "I do not think he is a director of the company."</p>
                    <p>Mr Barton Kent said he was elected a di rector a little overs year ago. The
                        beginning of all the trouble was the decision not to Jreappoint Mr
                        Meimarachi as managing director when bis term of office expired in Joly last
                        He entered the board with a perfectly open mind. He began to work very hard
                        for peace, and did his best to bring matters to satisfactory Jeonclusion,
                        when at a board meeting in Sep- tember last the London directors (Mr.
                        Drower, Mr Laning, and himself) agreed that Mr Meimarachi was to retarn as
                        director to Cairo, as chairman of the committee of management but,
                        unfortunately, when Mr. Meimarachi got back that agreement was not carrried
                        out. It taen became practically impossible to go on as they were. He
                        suggested the appointment of a committee of shareholders to investigate the
                        differences that existed, and moved an amend ment to that effect</p>
                    <p>Mr. Harrison said he was a resident of Cairo, aod was acquainted with the
                        circomstances. The suggestion made was a good one, and he would second
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Barrington opposed the amendment, which he characterised as a "death bed
                        repen tance and conteasion." It was too late now to appoint a committee as
                        the busy season in Egypt was approaching, and the trouble would not be
                        cleared up in time to present its effect on the season's business</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rau said that whatever changes were made mast be made st once, or they
                        would lose the season, and a committee of inquiry would mean delay.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Barton Kent objected to the tern "death bed repentance," and reminded the
                        meeting that the London board did take some ot the principal shareholders
                        into their conf- dence at a conference which was held on May 16 last</p>
                    <p>Mr. Nungovich said that for the last ten years he had been a friend to the
                        company, and two years ago he was induced to buy shares for £90,000, which
                        were only really worth on the market £50,000. A sum of £1,500 was <cb n="4"
                        /> voted to hime by the Cairo direction, and after some time the London
                        directors said that is washeld to be illegal. He had always been, and was
                        now, ready to return the money if he was advised that it was illegal. Under
                        his agreement with the company he held that he was entitled to it as
                        brokerage.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Drower said that the auditors of the company refused to pass the payment,
                        and the directos asked for the money to be returned, on the ground that no
                        brokerage could be paid except that was set forth in the prospectus.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Nungovich said the prospectus could not over-ride his contract with the
                        company</p>
                    <p>The ammendment was put to the meeting and lost, 17 voting for 28 against</p>
                    <p>The orginal resolution was then carried unanimonsly.</p>
                    <p>Count de Germainy moved: "That it is desir able to secure again the services
                        of Mr. C. G. Meimarachi as general manager in Egypt, with a seat on the
                        board".</p>
                    <p>Mr. Adams seconded the resolution.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman in answer to a question as to what view he formed when he went
                        to Cairo, sadi he came to the conclusion, that Mr. Meimarachi was an
                        admirable salesman and manager of his department, but that it would be
                        better to have someone else in financial control of the company. He thought
                        th financial control should be in the hands of the principal shareholders,
                        and as these were in England, London was the proper place for lay ing down
                        the roles under which the managers should act.</p>
                    <p>'The resolution, on being pot to the meeting, was carried nem. con.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Strong proposed : "That it be a regula tion of the company, prescribed by
                        it in this meeting, that, until after the next ordinary general meeting, no
                        casual vacancy be filled up by the directors, except by the appointment of
                        persons approved by this meeting, and thta Mr. C. G. Meimarach be approved
                        accord ingly."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Drower objected to Mr. Meimarachi be ing appointed a directo, and after
                        some further discussion, the resolution was carried nem. con.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rau said he took it for granted that Mr Walker was not a director now</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said that question was not before them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Drower said that if it was found that Mr. George Walker was not a
                        director then they were bound to elect Mr. Meimarachi at the next meeting.
                        They were not going to elect anyove else in face of the decision of that
                        meeting. They would take legal opinion as to the position with regard to Mr.
                        Walker</p>
                    <p>The meeting then terminated</p>

                        <p>To the editor of the "Egyptian Gazette"</p>
                        <p>Sir- Having read with some intrest the various letters that have been
                            appearing of late in the columns of your popular paper under the above
                            heading, I beg leave to add a few remarks, which occur to me from the
                            onlookers point of view</p>
                        <p>To start with, there are many solid factors why the Government should
                            turn a more kindly eye to Helouan than it has done during the last
                            decade. Surely its population of say approximately 5,000 in the summer,
                            and of 12,000 in the winter season, is enough in itself to command some
                            consdierationfrom the de partmental decrees, whereas the miserable pit
                            tance of some L.E. 2,000 per annum which the Tanzim Department now have
                            to cover all ex penditure incidental to the town of Helouan is
                            ludicrously inadequate for a town that boasts of fine houses and many
                            rich inhabitants.</p>
                        <p>The laying out of Helouan was so well cared for in the first instance
                            with its 20 metre road space all over, to say nothing of its general
                            cleanliness, quite apart from its geogrpahical advantages over all other
                            places in Egypt, led the inhabitants to hope that when the time comes
                            for developing Cairo city's environs, that Helouan would be the first
                            claimant and the first to recieve such benefits as the Govern ment had
                            to bestow, therefore it is in no way surprising to find that bitter
                            discontent reigns and rankles in the minds of many of the oldest
                            inhabitants, when they look round and see that other and newer suburban
                            areas, are re cieving a full complement of favour from the powers, while
                            they nad their attract ive town are totally ignored. The backing that
                            the heliopolis Oasis company has recieved from the Government is only a
                            bone of conten tion that ranks equally with the project for connecting
                            up Ghezireh district by construct ing a very costly bridge across the
                            Nile within half a mile of the existing bridge, thus creating and
                            inaugurating new suburbs, the popularity of which being problematic,
                            inasmuch is it has yet to be proved, while Helouan's po pularity cannot
                            be gainsaid after an existence and steadily continuing growth, without a
                            shimmer of official favour, over a period of some fifteen years.</p>
                        <p>Further, and with much reason, the inhabi tants of Helouan considered
                            themselves ne- gleoted indeed, when some two to three years ago the
                            Delts Light Railways were given » concession to work the line of railway
                            from their terminus to the capital, which has onl: led to greater dismay
                            as time advances, how can as system, which was initiated and brought
                            into existence for the needs transport of merchandise in the interior of
                            Egypt, by menas of a narrow gauge line, reconcile itslef to the
                            requirements of a broad gauge passenger traffic over a matter of 95
                            kilometres; that it cannot, has been amply proved of inte, by the fact
                            of its rolling stock conmstently failing to meet the demands made upon
                            it, for it is an every day occarvence that the axle bomes get hot after
                            every two journeys made by its new 1906 coaches, and there are none to
                            replace them , the result being that many intending visitors to Heloean,
                            decide on some other locality, simply and solely for the reason that thé
                            train service is made too utterly disagreeable, furthermore the cousins
                            and friends of the local inhabitants, who may be Jiving at Zeitown or
                            elsewhere on the Matarieh line, point with derision at their less
                            fortunate Helouan aquaintances, boasting as they do of their express,
                            and 15 minutes service on the ESR; where every thing possible is done
                            for the comfort and |pleine convenence of passengers</p>
                        <p>Had the ESR taken over the Helouan section of rail from the Snares group,
                            there would not have been the continous outcry that has prevailed, with
                            what one mast re luctantly admit too real justification, nor would there
                            be need now for the "Sop to Cerberus" held out to the Helouan public,
                            that the line will be electrified. This of course means time in any
                            case, but with the Delta Light Railways it means much time, and time to
                            spare, meanwhile the stem of the tide is stayed and warded off from
                            Helowan in the matter of advance in p polarity as far as possible, for
                            thé extremely simple reason that transit i# so fobtase a question, which
                            the several suggéstions for « road would some what mitigate against the
                            fragrant neglect. not to speak of wrongs, that Helouan has saf- fered
                            from.</p>
                        <p>In order to achieve some better method of commenication than what already
                            exists, many of the residents have expressed their willing- ness, if the
                            Government will make some more, to asmst in either defraying some
                            considerable proportion of the cort of a vehicular highway, or else
                            towards the upkeep of same, which would not be onerous when the number
                            of inhabitants is taken into consideration. That in days to come
                            difficalties for the construction of a road will not decrease, isa
                            matter for the Ministry to ponder over, and when all is said and done
                            who woald be the greater gainer. The answer admitted by al! and every is

                        leyée a L. E 2,081,047 contre LE 2,097,768 pendant le méme mois en 1906, ce
                        qui montre une dimi nation de L.B 66,721. Par contre, durant les neuf

                    <p>Si l'on compare ces chiffres, on voit des l'a bord que malgré les difficultés

                        considérablement accru son commerce d'exportation, ce qui dénote une

                        résulte que ses enga gements étaxt rédgits, tandis que ses créances ont
                        augmenté, rétablit ainsi parla force des choses une "balance des comptes" en
                        sa faveur.</p>
                    <p>Il faut noter de plus que le mouvement de cotons, a la date indiquée plus

                            £1,000,000 which had been paid by the Bank of Indian Bills, gave a very
                            easy tone to the money market, and the supplies of floating credit were
                            further increased by th release of a certain amount of dividend money.

                            firmer tone, large ly due to the Bank removing money from Lombard Street

                        <p>Japanese have been weak, and on balance show declines of about a point,
                            the 2nd series having shed 1 3/8 up to last night. Japanese have been
                            firmer to-day. The 2nd 4 1/2 are 3/8 better.</p>

                        <p>The Council of the Railway Companies Association has now definitely
                            declined to meet the men's official in conference, and the next
                            development of the orisis is being awaited with no little anxiety.
                            Appeals are being made to the Government from certain quarters to
                            intertere to prevent a strike, but so far Mr Lioyd George, the President
                            of the Board of Trade, has refused to take any steps im the matter
                            Meanwhile the ballot of the men is proceeding, bot the result will not
                            be known antil about the end of the month.</p>
                        <p>With feeling at such a tension, the present flatness of the market for
                            railway shares is quite natural. It would be futile to expect investors
                            to have any dealings with this section antil the crisis is past. "The
                            Times" in a leading article to-day says there will not be a general
                            strike in which we quite agree. Another depressing feature this week had
                            been the terrible disaster on the North Western Railway at Shrewsbury.
                            The shares of this company were last night quoted down 131}. Last Priday
                            they left off at 135. Great Western were also three points lower on the
                            week at 114</p>

                        <p>The effect of the critical financial position in New York on American
                            shares here has not been so marked as might have been sapposed The
                            reason is that operators in London have during recent months shown more
                            disinelina tion to deal in these stocks, the resalt being that at the
                            present time the American account is very small</p>

                            anxious that further mines should start work. Ievestors, he said, might
