                    <p>Col. Harrison's pigmies will leave Cairo direct for London in via Port Said
                        on the 18th inst. They are exceedingly well in health and have gained
                        considerably in weight. It is worthy of note that when Stanley first carme
                        upon the pigmies he was struck in quite an unwonted way. The first of them
                        that he beheld was a captive, some four feet high, "but more venerable than
                        the Memnonium of Thebes." Here was the oldest type of primeval man. Forty
                        centuries ago, the famous battle between these pigmies and the storks was
                        put into song. Think of it ' he is fain to ejaculate.</p>

                        expired." Well, yes. And if these little people, who run from three feet to
                        four feet six inches, and whose average weight is 9O lb., and whose most
                        marked talent, at any rate in Stanley's time, was tho poisoning of arrows,

                        interruption has occurred in the execution of tho great under- taking which
                        is intended to connect by rail the Mohauiodan places of pilgrimage with the

                        very slowly, while the important section of the line between Demand Haifa,

                        the Rod Sea, for it would facilitate the trans- port of troops of the Syrian
                        Army Corps into Arabia, and there would not be the dreary march across the

                    <p>We have received tho following official statement as to. the recent
                        disturbances at Mariout on Sunday last.</p>
                    <p>The Ministry of Finance despatched last week a sarraf, Ghirghis Effendi by
                        name, to Mariout in order to draw up a report ou the ownership of some laud
                        and crops in the Amrieh district. On Sunday last tho sarraf was in that
                        neighbourhood when he saw a number of fellaheen attesting to get to some
                        land belonging to Bedouins. The latter barred their way and told them that
                        if they persisted they would fight The fellaheen replied that the laud
                        belonged to them, and a discussion ensued which led to blows.</p>
                    <p>The sarraf was merely a witness of the fight and was not hurt at all. The
                        omdeh and sheikh and one mounted police man were with the sarraf, and this
                        escort was sufficient to protect that official.</p>
                    <p>The policeman belonging to the escort, on witnessing the disturbance, redo
                        off to the markaz to inform tho mamour, who at once saddled and bridled and
                        galloped off to the scene of the trouble. Ho arrived on the spot scarcely an
                        hour after the beginning of the engagement. When he arrived on the scene of
                        action he found three fellaheen slightly wounded with bows from nabouts.
                        About 12 of the combatants were then arrested and charged with riotous
                        conduct. They have been sent to Alexandria for trial.</p>
                    <p>There are now 30 police officers and men in the Mariout district Eighteen
                        months age there was a total of only seven police officers and men there.
                        Patrols are mode daily, and the Bedouins are gradually getting to reaped law
                        and order.</p>

                    <head>THE MADHOUSE MEMORIAL.</head>
                    <p>The scheme for erecting a madhouse to the memory of Mohamed Aly is meeting
                        with some criticism. In the first place, the idea of a madhouse as a
                        memorial is some- what bizarre, and it may well be doubted whether this
                        project, however useful it may be, is suited to the dignity of the occasion.
                        Moreover, in view of the fact that the Government intend building a large
                        lunatic asylum in Lower Egypt between Alexandria and Tantah, as is announced
                        in Lord Cromer's last Report, subscribers are hesitating, as they ask
                        themselves what is tho utility of giving donations towards building an
                        asylum when the Government has already decided to build one. Supporters of
                        the scheme may reply that the madhouse which is to be built by the
                        Government will not be actually situated in Alexandria itself. But as this
                        asylum is to be built on the "Villa Colony" pattern, it is far bettor to
                        construct it in a rural district. We may quote the actual words of Lord
                        Cromer on tho subject :—</p>
                    <p>"I am glad to be able to report that there seems at last to be a fair
                        prospect of providing adequate accommodation for lunatics in this country.
                        In the first place, LE. 21,000 is to be spent during tho current year and in
                        1906, on inclosing 75 acres of desert land adjoining the present asylum, and
                        on adapting and enlarging an existing building, now used as an army hospital
                        for the use of lunatics. Thus the number of bods will be increased from 500
                        te 820. In the second place, the construction ol another large lunatic
                        asylum is under conside- ration. Plans are being prepared, but the site has
                        not yet been chosen. It will probably be situated somewhere between Tantah
                        and Alexandra. The type of the new asylum will be that known as the "Villa
                        Colony." Ian informed that this system has been tried with great success in
                        Germany, and that it is eminently suited to the Egyptian climate."</p>

                        <p>Port Said, Wednesday. To-day at 8 a.m., the Messageries Maritimes S.S.
                            "Tonkin" arrived from Yokokama, having on board 24 Russian sailors, 4
                            military officers, and 84 refugees. The ship is to sail this after- noon

                            are to go to a sanatorium which has been specially prepared for them at

                            is rented by the Russian Government, and has a large medical and
                            surgical staff, principally of French nationality.</p>

                        <p>For some time past the Suez Canal Com- pany have employed a large number
                            (some 800) of Arabs on the now dockyard and workshops which are in
                            coarse of construc- tion so the Asian shore of the harbour. Arab town
                            being on the west shore, these work- men are brought over by boat every
                            evening about 6 o'clock I frequently see this horde of somewhat unruly
                            characters, in bands of 50 to 100, land at tho main passenger jetty.
                            Last evening they landed at the Custom House as usual and went up the
                            main street (Rue de Commerce) shouting and laughing, much to the alarm
                            of many lady passengers who had come ashore from the P. &amp;0.
                            "Mongolia," and who, fearing some sort of riot, took refuge in shops and
                            hotels. -Seeing that coal coolies are not on any pretext allowed to
                            traverse main thoroughfares, it is generally thought that the police
                            might well include these frequently equally dirty crowds in the
                            regulations, and so avoid such scenes. The name of Port Said is none so
                            good, though much improved, that this state of things can be allowed to
                            continue.</p>

                        <p>The Appeal Court of the Mixed Tribunals gave judgment in tho case of
                            Stagni v. Selinas on the 3rd inst, and as our readers are aware, the
                            text of this judgment appeared in foil in our columns a few days ago.
                            Mr. Salinm, the well-known Alexandria stockbroker, won the case both in
                            the Mixed Court of 1st Instance and in the Appeal Court But both Mr.
                            Luigi Stagni and Mr. Salinas are Italian subjects, and tho same case has
                            also pi-.es before the Italian Consular Courts and to the Appeal Court
                            at Ancona, where judgment was given in favor of Mr. Luigi Stagni. This
                            gentleman has naturally decided to abide by the decision of the court
                            which gave judgment in his favor, and two days ago levied an execution
                            on the furniture of Mr. Salinas, although the latter is the successful
                            suitor according to the Mixed Courts. Wo do not call to mind a more
                            striking instance of the conflict of jurisdictions pre- vailing in

                        <p>"A Native Landowner" (Helouan) writes:— Some merchants at Alexandria have
                            arranged a "corner" in May cotton and have artificially raised the price
                            by two dollars within the last three days. The price of May cotton is
                            now 15 3/4 dollars, while last Saturday it was only 13 3/4 dollars. What
                            is very strange is that while cotton is abundant in Alexandria, and
                            there is one hundred thousand cantars more than last year at this time,
                            still cotton at Alexandria is four dollars dearer than at Liverpool. Is
                            not such a comer illegal and prohibited by the law? And will the
                            Tribunals allow people to be robbed by such corners ?</p>

                    <p>London May 5 Awaiting the events ! The very largeness of the impending
                        struggle belittles all else. Mean time, rumors of peace negotiations are
                        persist- ent but no one knows through what channel they come. Hope is
                        perhaps "father to, the thought" that the Tsar may still have a grain of
                        sense left, and may use the factor of doubt yet remaining to obtain some
                        kind of terms. As yet there is no sign of activity in stock markets, and
                        moreover, there is little induce- ment to lead to an increase of public
                        business the position in the Far East being no clearer than it was a week
                        ago, though the somewhat strained feeling in European diplomatic circles as
                        reflected in financial circles seems to have almost passed away.</p>
                    <p>Japanese stocks have hardened a little, especially the new 4 1/2 per cent
                        issue, the special settlement in which took place today, Consols are dull,
                        and dealers in all quarters seem anxious to avoid having any position open,
                        until the horizon is clearer.</p>
                    <p>Egyptian stocks are steady, but inactive. Daira Sanieh shares are a trifle
                        lower at 285/8, ex a dividend of 3s.; and Bank shares are unchanged. In the
                        mining section the tone is dull. The market at the moment is a neglected
                        one, and suffers, in company with Booth Africans, from sheer want of
                        business. Specu- latively—i.e. for any intermediate improvement -there is
                        nothing tempting about this market, but, to take op and put away, prices are
