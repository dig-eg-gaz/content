                        on the 18th inst. They are exceedingly well in health and have gained
                        considerably in weight. It is worthy of note that when Stanley first carme
                        upon the pigmies he was struck in quite an unwonted way. The first of them
                        that he beheld was a captive, some four feet high, “but more venerable than
                        the Memnonium of Thebes." Here was the oldest type of primeval man. Forty
                        centuries ago, the famous battle between these pigmies and the storks was
                        put into song. Think of it ’ he is fain to ejaculate.</p>

                        expired." Well, yes. And if these little people, who run from three feet to
                        four feet six inches, and whose average weight is 9O lb., and whose most
                        marked talent, at any rate in Stanley’s time, was tho poisoning of arrows,

                        interruption has occurred in the execution of tho great under- taking which
                        is intended to connect by rail the Mohauiodan places of pilgrimage with the
                        Mediterranean. The extension of the projocted railway bejond Maau, an
                        Arabian town- 84 miles south coast of Jerusalem, is being carried out only
                        very slowly, while the important section of the line between Demand Haifa,
                        which is the real line of exit leading to the Mediterranean, has suffered
                        severely from inundations, and cannot be built as it was intended; while,

                        been giving up, greatly to the keen regret of a number of young and serious
                        officers in tho Turkish Army. The disorders in Yemon havo shown clearly the
                        great value of. such a linc/of railway leading southwards from Damascus\to
                        the Rod Sea, for it would facilitate the trans- port of troops of the Syrian
                        Army Corps into Arabia, and there would not be the dreary march across the

                    <p>We have received tho following official statement as to. the recent
                        disturbances at Mariout on Sunday last.</p>
                    <p>The Ministry of Finance despatched last week a sarraf, Ghirghis Effendi by
                        name, to Mariout in order to draw up a report ou the ownership of some laud
                        and crops in the Amrieh district. On Sunday last tho sarraf was in that
                        neighbourhood when he saw a number of fellaheen attesting to get to some
                        land belonging to Bedouins. The latter barred their way and told them that
                        if they persisted they would fight The fellaheen replied that the laud
                        belonged to them, and a discussion ensued which led to blows.</p>
                    <p>The sarraf was merely a witness of the fight and was not hurt at all. The
                        omdeh and sheikh and one mounted police man were with the sarraf, and this
                        escort was sufficient to protect that official.</p>
                    <p>The policeman belonging to the escort, on witnessing the disturbance, redo
                        off to the markaz to inform tho mamour, who at once saddled and bridled and
                        galloped off to the scene of the trouble. Ho arrived on the spot scarcely an
                        hour after the beginning of the engagement. When he arrived on the scene of
                        action he found three fellaheen slightly wounded with bows from nabouts.
                        About 12 of the combatants were then arrested and charged with riotous
                        conduct. They have been sent to Alexandria for trial.</p>
                    <p>There are now 30 police officers and men in the Mariout district Eighteen
                        months age there was a total of only seven police officers and men there.
                        Patrols are mode daily, and the Bedouins are gradually getting to reaped law
                        and order.</p>

                    <p>THE MADHOUSE MEMORIAL.</p>
                    <p>The scheme for erecting a madhouse to the memory of Mohamed Aly is meeting
                        with some criticism. In the first place, the idea of a madhouse as a
                        memorial is some- what bizarre, and it may well be doubted whether this
                        project, however useful it may be, is suited to the dignity of the occasion.
                        Moreover, in view of the fact that the Government intend building a large
                        lunatic asylum in Lower Egypt between Alexandria and Tantah, as is announced
                        in Lord Cromer's last Report, subscribers are hesitating, as they ask
                        themselves what is tho utility of giving donations towards building an
                        asylum when the Government has already decided to build one. Supporters of
                        the scheme may reply that the madhouse which is to be built by the
                        Government will not be actually situated in Alexandria itself. But as this
                        asylum is to be built on the "Villa Colony" pattern, it is far bettor to
                        construct it in a rural district. We may quote the actual words of Lord
                        Cromer on tho subject :—</p>
                    <p>"I am glad to be able to report that there seems at last to be a fair
                        prospect of providing adequate accommodation for lunatics in this country.
                        In the first place, LE. 21,000 is to be spent during tho current year and in
                        1906, on inclosing 75 acres of desert land adjoining the present asylum, and
                        on adapting and enlarging an existing building, now used as an army hospital
                        for the use of lunatics. Thus the number of bods will be increased from 500
                        te 820. In the second place, the construction ol another large lunatic
                        asylum is under conside- ration. Plans are being prepared, but the site has
                        not yet been chosen. It will probably be situated somewhere between Tantah
                        and Alexandra. The type of the new asylum will be that known as the "Villa
                        Colony.” Ian informed that this system has been tried with great success in
                        Germany, and that it is eminently suited to the Egyptian climate."</p>

                    <p>MORE RUSSIAN REFUGEES.</p>
                    <p>Port Said, Wednesday. To-day at 8 a.m., the Messageries Maritimes S.S.
                        “Tonkin" arrived from Yokokama, having on board 24 Russian sailors, 4
                        military officers, and 84 refugees. The ship is to sail this after- noon for
                        Marseilles direct.</p>
                    <p>I learn on good authority that those amongst the number who are wounded are
                        to go to a sanatorium which has been specially prepared for them at Nice.
                        The building, which from all accounts is magnificently situated, is rented
                        by the Russian Government, and has a large medical and surgical staff,
                        principally of French nationality.</p>
                    <p>P. &amp;0. PASSENGERS.</p>
                    <p>For some time past the Suez Canal Com- pany have employed a large number
                        (some 800) of Arabs on the now dockyard and workshops which are in coarse of
                        construc- tion so the Asian shore of the harbour. Arab town being on the
                        west shore, these work- men are brought over by boat every evening about 6
                        o’clock I frequently see this horde of somewhat unruly characters, in bands
                        of 50 to 100, land at tho main passenger jetty. Last evening they landed at
                        the Custom House as usual and went up the main street (Rue de Commerce)
                        shouting and laughing, much to the alarm of many lady passengers who had
                        come ashore from the P. &amp;0. "Mongolia," and who, fearing some sort of riot,
                        took refuge in shops and hotels. -Seeing that coal coolies are not on any
                        pretext allowed to traverse main thoroughfares, it is generally thought that
                        the police might well include these frequently equally dirty crowds in the
                        regulations, and so avoid such scenes. The name of Port Said is none so
                        good, though much improved, that this state of things can be allowed to
                        continue.</p>
                    <p>CONFLICT OF JURISDICTIONS. STRANGE CASE.</p>
                    <p>The Appeal Court of the Mixed Tribunals gave judgment in tho case of Stagni
                        v. Selinas on the 3rd inst, and as our readers are aware, the text of this
                        judgment appeared in foil in our columns a few days ago. Mr. Salinm, the
                        well-known Alexandria stockbroker, won the case both in the Mixed Court of
                        1st Instance and in the Appeal Court But both Mr. Luigi Stagni and Mr.
                        Salinas are Italian subjects, and tho same case has also pi-.es before the
                        Italian Consular Courts and to the Appeal Court at Ancona, where judgment
                        was given in favor of Mr. Luigi Stagni. This gentleman has naturally decided
                        to abide by the decision of the court which gave judgment in his favor, and
                        two days ago levied an execution on the furniture of Mr. Salinas, although
                        the latter is the successful suitor according to the Mixed Courts. Wo do not
                        call to mind a more striking instance of the conflict of jurisdictions pre-
                        vailing in Egypt.</p>
                   <p>A COTTON CORNER.</p>
                    <p>"A Native Landowner" (Helouan) writes:— Some merchants at Alexandria have
                        arranged a “corner” in May cotton and have artificially raised the price by
                        two dollars within the last three days. The price of May cotton is now 15
                        3/4 dollars, while last Saturday it was only 13 3/4 dollars. What is very
                        strange is that while cotton is abundant in Alexandria, and there is one
                        hundred thousand cantars more than last year at this time, still cotton at
                        Alexandria is four dollars dearer than at Liverpool. Is not such a comer
                        illegal and prohibited by the law? And will the Tribunals allow people to be
                        robbed by such corners ?</p>

                    <p>London May 5 Awaiting the events ! The very largeness of the impending
                        struggle belittles all else. Mean time, rumors of peace negotiations are
                        persist- ent but no one knows through what channel they come. Hope is
