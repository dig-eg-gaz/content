                    <head>RENTS IN CAIRO.</head>
                    <p>Some time ago our columns contained a correspondence in which the question
                        whether a young Englishman could live in Cairo at L10 a month was argued
                        with eloquence and vigour. We should now like to bring before the notice of
                        our readers the results of the raising of rents in Cairo as far as they
                        touch young British officials, and others of the same class, and whose
                        standard of life is the same. The average young Englishman of this type,
                        when he first comes to Egypt,goes to a pension for some little time and
                        then, if he can afford it, takes a flat with one or more friends. Well and
                        good if his pay allows of it, but there are plenty of young Englishmen whose
                        pay is not high and who cannot afford a comfortable and healthy flat. A man
                        drawing anything under L30 a month had better stay in a pension, for, if he
                        takes a cheap flat in the less-known quarters of Cairo, he runs a risk of
                        catching typhoid or of finding himself in an uncongenial neighborhoood. </p>
                    <p>As for the pensions,there are two or three good and thoroughly well-managed
                        English pensions, if not more; but in all the prices are rather high and
                        will never get any lower. The increased price of food, the rise in
                        rents,which forces those who manage pensions to heighten their charges, and
                        the growing demands of the native servant,all tell on the pocket of the
                        young man with a fixed income. Now if he wishes to go to a good pension of
                        the second order- we do not wish to name names or advertise any of these
                        establishments- he may fall on his feet. But he may also find that in his
                        pension are persons whom he does not care to know, and whose very presence
                        under the same roof may injure him. A young employe of any business or
                        commercial establishment has to be careful, not for social reasons, for,
                        snobbish though we are as a nation,the average Englishman does not suppose
                        that his subordinates are to be judged and condemned because they happen to
                        sleep under the same roof and to dine in the same room as undesirable
                        characters, but because Egypt posseses more than a fair share of
                        unscrupulous and needy persons of many nationalities- our own not excepted-
                        who are on the watch for the young man from home. The slightest
                        indiscretion, even a refusal to discuss a subject, may give the wily
                        enquirer a valuable "tip," and therefore the bank manager and his fellows
                        like to see their subordinates staying in establishments where the man with
                        an axe to grind is rare.</p>
                    <p>But these establishments, as we have pointed out, grow dearer and take more
                        of a man's pay. To the young permanent official this does not matter quite
                        so much, for he comes out to make a career and to retire with a pension, and
                        ought to be able to wait and at least simulate contentment, though if
                        promotion is slow or his Under-Secreatary of State or departmental chief
                        forgets to recommend that his pay be raised before the new financial year
                        begins- and once upon a time a chief forgot to recommend a single man in his
                        department and his staff fumed for months, having been promised mountains
                        and marvels- this simulation is hard to keep up. But the young employe of a
                        bank or business house, who has to keep up appearances like the rest, to pay
                        calls, dress,return bachelor hospitality, and join clubs, remarks with grief
                        that while rents and prices rise wages do not rise at all. The economic
                        books say they do; it may be true in Europe, and it may be true of certain
                        classes here, but it is not true of the class of which we speak. Can any of
                        our readers give a recipe for the "simple life" (with appearances saved and
                        thrown in) and a credit balance monthly, or is it impossible to eat your
                        cake and have it too?</p>

                    <p>Yesterday evening the prisoners in the gaol revolted en masse and set fire to

                    <p>The last of the Kronstadt mutineers have surrendered. The Holy Synod has
                        issued an address to the people begging them to cease attacking and
                        murdering landed proprietors and Jews, and to avoid civil war. It further
                        urges them to inaugurate an era of peace and tranquillity. Martial law has
                        been proclaimed throughout Poland, where the authorities fear that an
                        insurrection is being organised. M. Witte has received telegrams from
                        various parts of Poland demanding full autonomy, including a Diet at Warsaw,
                        elected by universal suffrage. M. Witte informed a Polish deputation that he
                        is in favor of autonomous administration, but opposed to political
                        autonomy.</p>

                            first-class compartments, which it is intended to place very shortly on
                            all the lines. There has been some delay in their delivery, but it is
                            expected that they will be running by the new year, These carriages,
                            which have a compartment for first-class passengers in front, another

                            into possession on the 15th November. During the four years that the
                            hotel has been in possession of the former gentleman he has succeeded in
                            forming a high-class clientele, which no doubt Mr. Chamoulleau will not
                            only retain but increase, since his reputation as an hotelier has long
                            been established. Daring the summer a large sum of money has been spent
                            on alterations and improvements at the Savoy Hotel, which will add
                            greatly to the comfort of visitors. The whole of the shops facing the
                            quay have been removed and replaced by a fine dining saloon and bar
                            opening on the sea front and supported by massive marble columns. The
                            additions include 32 newly-built bedrooms, which bring up the total to
                            74. Mr. Klingler lately obtained an extension of the lease from the
                            Messageries Maritimes, who are the owners of the whole large block of
                            buildings in which the hotel is situated.</p>

                        <head>PIRACY IN THE RED SEA. H.M.S. FOX’S MISSION.</head>
                        <p>Details of the fighting which occurred at Hodeida, in the Yemen, when the
                            British cruiser Fox was at that place a few weeks ago in connection with
                            the pursuit and punishment of the pirates who bad attacked British
                            dhows, have just been received. Claims were lodged with the Porte in
                            regard to these outrages, and the Pox was despatched to the Yemen coast
                            in order to see that the local authorities carried out the British
                            demands, arrested and punished the guilty persons, and destroyed the
                            pirate dhows. The British cruiser co-operated with the local Turkish
                            authorities in the accomplishment of these objects. It was found that
                            the pirates bad moored their dhows at a place called Khor Gbu’eifaka,
                            which was not easy for the Turks to attack and that the former had
                            mounted guns round the cove where the pirate chips were lying. A stiff
                            fight occurred, in which the pirates lost twenty-five killed and a large
                            number of wounded. A launch belonging to the Fox went aground and was
                            lost, and one British sailor was slightly wounded.</p>

                            Egyptian Gazette</head>
                        <p>Sir,—In your paper of yesterday you publish a letter under the above
                            heading signed "Alexandrian,” containing certain malicious statements,
                            which, if true, would not only reflect very seriously on me and my
                            colleagues, past and present, on the board of the Alexandria Water
                            Company, Ltd., but also on the character of many high officials of the
                            Egyptian Government, who, during a long series of years, have
                            represented the Government on the board of that company. Your
                            correspondent says "it was discovered " that the company were charging
                            the double of what they were legally entitled to for a " girbeh of
                            water.” This statement is absolutely false ; the Water Company never has
                            sold water at any higher price than they were legally entitled to. In
                            the autumn of 1878 the waterworks of Alexandria were offered for sale in
                            London, by a man of the highest integrity, then Minister of Finance to
                            the Egyptian Government, under certain conditions, and one of the most
                            attractive of these conditions was, that a certain branch of the service
                            known as the Sakkas, or water carriers, service, brought in a net
                            revenue of £12,000 a year ; this was not an estimated revenue, but one
                            which had been realised for many years by the Egyptian Government
                            itself, at the price at which it had sold the water, and proposed to
                            transfer and did subsequently transfer, to its purchaser, the Water
                            Company, by contract of sale, the right to continue the sale of water on
                            the same condition, and at the same tariff as that in use by the
                            Government during the many years it had worked the undertaking. Not only
                            is this confirmed by contract, but the gentleman to whom I above refer,
                            is still living, and not only can, but would contradict me, if anything
                            I say in this matter is not strictly true, The Water Company rotated
                            this right until 1894, when it gave it up not as your correspondent
                            says, because it was an extortion, but as the result of an agreement
                            with the Municipality of Alexandria, who offered in exchange for it a
                            new system of filtration subject only to a contribution of L.E. 10,000
                            by the Water Company, and not only this, but they gave the company the
                            right to sell water by meter, a right which led to complications,
                            reference to which would tale up too much of your space. Not only was it
                            the first duty of the Government representatives on our board to assure
                            themselves that the Water Company was acting in accordance with its
                            legal rights, bat I am in a position to say, without fear of
                            contradiction, that one and all of these gentlemen conscientiously did
                            their duty in this respect There are several other inaccuracies in the
                            letter under notice, which I could easily refute, but will not weary
                            your readers by doing so at present. I write only in my own name, and
                            without prejudice to any action in the matter which my colleagues may
                            decide to take ; they are men as well known as any in Alexandria, and it
                            requires no testimony of mine to defend them ; but in memory of those
                            with whom I formerly had the honor of being associated, and who have
                            gone from this world and are no longer able to defend themselves, I
                            will, say, that it is a disgraceful action to endeavor to sully their
                            names by such false insinuations; for they were honorable men, who,under
                            trying circumstances, did the best which could be expected of them for
                            the general good. I do not know who your correspondent "Alexandrian” may
                            be, nor have I the slightest wish to make his acquaintance, for, in my
                            opinion, a man who would publish the malicious statements he has made,
                            on a subject oh which be shows that he is profoundly ignorant, is
                            beneath contempt.—I remain, etc., E. Cornish, A director of the

                            of the lodge four initiations took place. Another friend was put on
                            proposition. The lodge deputy urged the officers to do their utmost to
                            keep the members together, and try and introduce new members to the
                            Order. He hoped members would use their influence In the several
                            departmental corps in Alexandria and swell the lodge. Work is required
                            and not words, and he had not the least doubt that if brothers and
                            sisters put their shoulders to the wheel, success would assuredly
                            follow. The programme for the evening was the reading of “Temperance

                            exchanged a few words with Lord Cromer, and was impressed with the power
                            of the man, even in so short an interview. As to the treatment of the
                            natives by the British Administration, M. Salessies regards it somewhat
                            in the light of mistaken kindness. The native is a child, and must be
                            treated as such. Occasionally it is necessary to show firmness. You
                            cannot apply all the ideas of Western justice to him. The judicial
                            branch must not bo separated from the political and executive. There is
                            no division of, labour amongst the native Africans. The potter digs his
                            own clay ; the bootmaker is a tanner. And so the Commissioner in charge
                            of a district should himself bo able to apply the law. Justice must be
                            swift The native does not understand being punished three months after
                            the commission of a crime. Three months is too long for his memory— he
                            has forgotten all about the offence.” M. Salesses shares the view of
                            Lord Cromer that the Cape-to-Cairo railway can very properly utilise a
                            steamboat service on the lakes and the White Nile to connect its
                            sections. He thinks that Germany should strike a bargain with England
                            over the lease of a atrip of land between Tanganyika and Victoria
                            Nyanza. Such a cession of territory would work no prejudice to German
                            interests; on the contrary, the communication afforded by the railway
                            would be highly profitable to the colony.</p>

                    <head>WALKER &amp;MEIMARACHI. AN INCREASE OF CAPITAL</head>
                    <p>The eighth annual general meeting of Walker and Meimarachi, Limited, was
                        heldon the 30th ult. at the offices,65, Londonwall, London, E.C., Mr. James
                        Greenlees (the chairman) presiding. </p>
                    <p>The notice calling the meeting having been read,</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said: It is with pleasure that I rise to address you to-day. All
                        those present have doubtlwss perused the dirctors' report to the
                        shareholders, and we will therefore take it as read. Those shareholders who
                        have attended our annual meetings have heard from my lips more about the
                        progress of the company since its inception, some years ago, than has
                        appeared in the formal reports, and they will therefore not have been
                        surprised when they learnt that the directors, in continuation of their
                        consistent policy of harbouring our cash resources, had decidedto advise the
                        shareholders to declare this year an ordinary dividend of 1 per cent.
                        increase upon that of last year; it is therefore proposedthat a five per
                        cent. dividend be declared, payable on January 15 next. Reference to the
                        balancesheet shows that the company could easily have paid more than this
                        amount; but it has been considered wiser to proceed with caution.As time
                        goes on and the prosperity of Egypt advances- and, let us hope, that of the
                        company likewise- increased divideds will doubtless be paid to the ordinary
                        shareholders. And this leads me to a few remarks upon the general condition
                        of the company's financial aspect. The accounts show that, in addition to
                        paying the usual 6 1/2 per cent. preference share dividend amounting to
                        L8,125, the board have written off the balance of L3,677 5s. 8d. stading to
                        the credit of fixtures and fittings and L787 13s. 5d. has been carried to
                        reserve. We are advised by the managing director that the value of the stock
                        is even greater than theamount at which it stands in our books. The amount
                        of sundry debtors represents a slight increase upon last year, which is to
                        be expected, considering the increased volume of trade.Without undue
                        self-congratulation, we venture to believe that there are few trading
                        companies outside the United Kingdom which can boast of so satisfactory a
                        financial position as Walker and Meimarachi, taking into consideration the
                        fiscal condition of the country in which the company carries on its trade.
                        The directors do not take the credit of this satisfactory state of affairs
                        entirely to themselves.Had they not had the active co-operation of both the
                        preference and ordinary shareholders in the past- and particularly of the
                        ordinary shareholders- this company could not have reached its present stage
                        of development. We recently had occasion to prepare account showing certain
                        aggregate returns of the amounts which the company has dealt with since the
                        shareholders first met together to pass the accounts. </p>
                    <p>It will probably surprise you, as it has suprised us, when we tell you that
                        the total amount of net profits of trading in Egypt since our incorporation
                        has reached the very respectable total of L125,941 8s. 6d., and we paid in
                        preference dividends L58, 570 5s. 9d. We have written off goodwill,
                        fixtures, and fittings and preliminary expenses L28,405.Our reserve fund
                        stands at L5,451 5s. 10d., and we have paid away some L16,062 in ordinary
                        dividends. It is true that in the years of depression following the Sudan
                        War the shareholders confirmed the policy of conserving the company's assets
                        and passed the ordinary dividend, and the company is now reaping the benefit
                        of your prudent policy. These figures speak more eloquently than any words
                        of mine as to the soundness of the business which has been built up. Perhaps
                        I may say that I now come to the most satisfactory, and at the same time the
                        personal, side of the affairs of the company, so far as the members of your
                        board are concerned. For years past your directors have been painfully
                        aware, as you all know only too well, that the company's operations and
                        extensions have been greatly hampered by want of adequate working capital.
                        Notwithstanding the most urgent instructions to the executive in Egypt to
                        curtail the stock and to reduce the amount of customers' outstanding
                        accounts, it has not been found possible to do so without great detriment to
                        the company's trade. Month after month the strongest representations have
                        been made to this effect to the managing director, who has at all times
                        shown the shareholders' representations the utmost courtesy and a desire to
                        conform to such a policy; but the fact remains that, so far as out customers
                        are concerned, credit, and very long credit, must bbe given,and we are
                        advised that without such credit Walker and Meimarachi might as well close
                        its stores and liquidate. It redounds greatly to the ability of the managing
                        director, the general manager, and other members of the staff that up to the
                        present the annual amount of bad debts has been surprisingly small. It may
                        be that in Mr. Meimarachi we have a man possessed of a quite unique
                        knowledge of the financial standing of every individual customer, or it may
                        be due to some other cause unknown to us; but we prefer to believe that it
                        is due to the able business ability and ever-constant supervision of our
                        managing director.</p>
                    <p>The large amount of stock carried has also had our consideration; but here,
                        again,our representatives definitely advise us that it can only be reduced
                        with the prospect of the greatest danger to the company's trade;
                        indeed,increased stock has always shown increased profits.These are indeed
                        weighty matters, and as such have had more than usual serious attention of
                        the board. Reports have from time to time reached the board from
                        shareholders and customers that the company's premises were inconvenient and
                        the stock inadequate, and so strong because the representations that it was
                        decided to ask Mr.Drower to visit Cairo, and report specially upon these and
                        other matters. Mr. Drower's report proved beyond a questioon of doubt that
                        more commodious premises must be forthwith acquired. The difficult,
                        however,was how this was to be accomplished. As, no doubt, most of you are
                        aware, the value of land in and around Cairo has risen to almost a
                        phenomenal extent, and during the last few years has doubled, and in some
                        cases even trebled, its value. Having regard to these facts,it was felt that
                        if additional working capital was to be forthcoming, it must be constituents
                        in Egypt who had participated in the extraordinary prosperity of the
                        country, rather than from our English shareholders. Our Cairo lawyer and one
                        of our largest shareholders (Mr. Carton de Wiart) attended the board, and
                        fully confirmed Mr. Drower's representations. The directors therefore
                        determined that Mr. Luning should proceed to Egypt for the purpose of
                        ascertaining the pulse of the capitalists on the spot. While in no way
                        wishing to minimise the efforts of Mr. Luning and his subsequent success,
                        still, the fact remains that had not the shareholders loyally seconded the
                        policty of your board in past years, in strengthening our financial
                        position, we believe that it would not have been possible to raise L100,000
                        additional working capital, except at very onerous rates. Still, it has been
                        done,and we congratulate the shareholders accordingly, as we are certain, in
                        our own minds, that without this capital the continuation of past successes
                        could not be accomplished. We shall therefore be asking you, at the
                        extraordinary general meeting to be held at the conclusion of the present,to
                        vote unhesitatingly for the proposed increase of capital.Mr. Nungovich, the
                        gentleman who has undertaken the responsibility of guaranteeing the
                        L100,000, stipulates that he shall have the option of subscribing yet
                        another L100,000 working capital at par, together with the right to claim
                        L100,000 debentures carrying 5 per cent. interest, the latter to be secured
                        upon the land and building which it is proposed to erect upon some central
                        and convenient site in the very centre of business Cairo. </p>
                    <p>We have been given to understand that Mr. Nungovich has associated with him
                        in the development of the present scheme some of the most able financiers in
                        Egypt, and, for certain, we know that he has with him heart and soul his old
                        friend and compatriot, your managing director (Mr. Meimarachi).The success
                        of the scheme, therefore, appears to be assured. But there is, as I have
                        already foreshadowed, another side of this matter,and that is eminently a
                        personal one. The introduction of so large an amount of worrking capital,
                        the value of which to the company at its present juncture we cannot
                        overestimate, has necessarily led to a demand on the part of those finding
                        such capital to acquire the control of the company's directorate. After we
                        had carefully examined our list of shareholders, we came to the conclusion
                        that,with the exception of but a very few- most of whom were resident in
                        Egypt, and directly or indirectly connected with our friend Mr. Nungovich
                        and his group- it would be quite out of the question to ask the shareholders
                        in England to provide the large amount of capital now necessary. We
                        therefore decided to face the music and agree to the demand of the
                        financiers, that upon the firm application for the 100,000 shares being
                        received we, as a board, were prepared to tender our resignations,having
                        previously made such arrangements as would enable the nominees of Mr.
                        Nungovich to join the board. It goes without saying that we dislike vacating
                        the position of trust that you have so long entrusted to us; but we feel
                        that in your own interests there is no other course open to us, more
                        particularly as Mr. Nungovich desires to be in the position, if necessary,
                        to hold the meetings of the directores in Cairo, which would be quite
                        impracticable for the present directors. It has not been officially
                        communicated tous that Mr. Nungovich desires our resignations; but, in view
                        of the recent trend of Egyptian thought, we are inclined to believe that
                        most if not the whole board, will be asked to retie.We cannot for a moment
                        blame Mr. Nungovich for making his own terms, but we do feel a certain
                        regret at the prospect of retiring from the board of a company with whose
                        shareholders in England we have always worked in complete harmony. We are
                        given to understand that the prospectus of the new issure is in a forward
                        state,and we have no hesitation in recommending your acive support to the
                        scheme. The Chairman then moved the adoption of the report. </p>

                    <p>Great interest has been aroused by a semi-official statement with regard to
                        the new German naval programme. </p>
                    <p>The "Kolnische Zeitung" announces that the displacement of the new
                        battleships and armoured cruisers will be 18,000 tons and 15,000 tons
                        respectively. The German Government considers it necessary to follow the
                        example of other navies, which, as the result of the lessons of the Battle
                        of Tsushima, have increased the size of their heavy artillery, thus
                        entailing a corresponding augmentation in the tonnageof the warships.</p>
                    <p>The Conservative Press welcomes the decision of the Government to bring the
                        navy up to the level of those of other Powers. At present the largest German
                        battleships have a displacement of 13,200 tons, and the displacement of the
                        largest cruisers is 11,000 tons,while the heaviest gun carried is the
                        28-centimetre (11in.) quick-firer.</p>
                    <p>The "Tagliche Rundschau" publishes an article by the well-known naval
                        publicist,Count Reventlow,who, while approving the action of the Government,
                        deplores the publication of the programme at the present juncture. He
                        declares that Great Britain has purposely delayed the launchof the first
                        representative of a new type of battleship, in order to obtain as much
                        information as possible with regard to the building programmes of other
                        nations.</p>

                    <head>KAISER'S CLEVERNESS IN CHINA.</head>
                    <p>An interview with General Yin Chang, the Chinese Minister in Berlin, who is
                        leaving his post to return to China, is published in the "Berliner
                        Tageblatt." General Yin Chang spoke in terms of the highest admiration of
                        the German Emperor,whose proposal to withdraw the foreign garrisons in
                        Pe-chi-li was, he said, an extremely clever diplomati move. The EMperor's
                        proposal had been greeted with great approval in China. General Ying Chang
                        declared, in conclusion, that the Powers made many mistakes in dealing with
                        his country, and were, in many respects, simply driving the Chinese into the
                        arms of Japan. The Japanese were taking part more and more in Chinese
                        commerce, and in the founding of newspapers with the intention of gaining a
                        political influence over the mass of the Chinese population. In his opinion,
                        too, Japan was becoming day by day more subservient to England. Japan's
                        policy was nothing but Great Britain's policy. He regarded England's
                        intention to fortify Singapore as a most important development,the full
                        significance of which was not fully realised in Europe. Great Britain's
                        power and influence in the Far East would be greatly increased by the
                        establishment of a first-class naval base at Singapore.</p>

                    <p>St. Louis, Nov. 5.</p>
                    <p>The Insurance Superintendent of Missouri has notified the officials of the
                        NEw York Life Insurance Company that on Tuesday next he will revoke the
                        licence of that company to carry on business in the State owing to the
                        mismanagement of the company's officers as revealed in the investigation at
                        present going on in New York.</p>
                    <p>This notice is in accordance with the previous intimation given to the
                        company by the Superintendent early last month that this action would be
                        taken unless the implicated officers resigned and the sums paid over to
                        Republican campaign managers were returned. </p>
                    <p>This is the first action of this kind to be taken, but it is believed that
                        the example will be followed in several other Western States, and that other
                        Eastern insurance companies will be treated in the same manner.</p>

                    <p>The German papers publish a weird story from Seirakrisza in the Crimea.</p>
                    <p>Owing to the harvest turning out badly the peasants suspected an old man
                        named Opiroff, who was a reputed wizard, to be the cause of the trouble, and
                        seized him.</p>
                    <p>They prepared a bonfire on the village green, and Opirofi, having been placed
                        upon it, a village elder set the pile alight and burned him to death. As the
                        famine continued it was decided to hold grotesque religious ceremonies over
                        the remains, which were disinterred in accordance with local
                        superstitutions. While these were going on Father Constantine, the village
                        priest, appeared, and rebuked them for their impious barbariam.</p>
                    <p>The peasants, who were mostly drunk, thereupon declared that he was the evil
                        genius, and seizing him flung him into Opiroff's open grave. Earth was
                        thrown upon him, and he was burid alive by his own parishionners.</p>

                    <head>ROME OVERCROWDED</head>
                    <p>The tourist who, among his impressions of Rome, has carried away the
                        remembrance of the staring windows of the great empty houses near St.
                        Peter's, and outside the Porta Pia- legacies from the building crisis fo
                        1887- is astonished to learn that there is difficulty in finding homes for
                        the inhabitants of the great city. The housing question, however, is rapidly
                        becoming a serious one. Since 1870 the population of Rome has more than
                        doubled itself, and since the frantic speculations of the mid-eighties,
                        comparatively few houses have been built, with the exception of villas
                        standing in their own gardens in the new Ludosvisi and Prati di Castello
                        quarters. These are chiefly taken at large rents by the foreign colony,
                        which becomes more and more numerous every year. The destruction of the
                        teeming Ghetto, and of some of the older streets that were removed in order
                        to make room for the tunnel road leading from the via Tritone, has made the
                        houses that remain more sought after, and has crowded the poorer districts
                        of Rome till they are full to overflowing. Four, and even five families in
                        one room is not unknown, and the numbers herded together in one great
                        tenement sometimes rise to four or five hundred.</p>

                    <head>THE ARABIAN REVOLT</head>
                    <p>Professor Vambery contributes to the current number of the "Contemporary
                        Review" an interesting but short paper on the revolt in Arabia, which, he
                        predicts, will be crushed by the Turks "like the previous one, and like all
                        the revolts of insufficiently armed and undrilled rabbles against a
                        well-armed and fairly organised army." He dismisses as undeserving of
                        credence the rumours circulated in Turkey that the English, anxious to push
                        forward the limits of the Aden Hinterland, are instigating the rising.
                        Professor Vambery disclaims any sympathy for the "nefarious regime" of the
                        present Sultan, but he does not attribute special importance to the present
                        rising: - "The Arabs will never submit complacently to the Turk; they will
                        always despise and hate their foreign ruler; but it would be a mistake to
                        see in this aversion a plan for an Arab national rising against the Ottoman
                        power, and for a restitutiion of the spiritual lead of Islam to the direct
                        descendants of the Prophet. Such a desire may lurk in the distant future,
                        but the present social, cultural and political conditions of the Arab race
                        do not admit of its realisation."</p>
