                    <head>RENTS IN CAIRO.</head>
                    <p>Some time ago our columns contained a correspondence in which the question
                        whether a young Englishman could live in Cairo at L10 a month was argued
                        with eloquence and vigour. We should now like to bring before the notice of
                        our readers the results of the raising of rents in Cairo as far as they
                        touch young British officials, and others of the same class, and whose
                        standard of life is the same. The average young Englishman of this type,
                        when he first comes to Egypt,goes to a pension for some little time and
                        then, if he can afford it, takes a flat with one or more friends. Well and
                        good if his pay allows of it, but there are plenty of young Englishmen whose
                        pay is not high and who cannot afford a comfortable and healthy flat. A man
                        drawing anything under L30 a month had better stay in a pension, for, if he
                        takes a cheap flat in the less-known quarters of Cairo, he runs a risk of
                        catching typhoid or of finding himself in an uncongenial neighborhoood. </p>
                    <p>As for the pensions,there are two or three good and thoroughly well-managed
                        English pensions, if not more; but in all the prices are rather high and
                        will never get any lower. The increased price of food, the rise in
                        rents,which forces those who manage pensions to heighten their charges, and
                        the growing demands of the native servant,all tell on the pocket of the
                        young man with a fixed income. Now if he wishes to go to a good pension of
                        the second order- we do not wish to name names or advertise any of these
                        establishments- he may fall on his feet. But he may also find that in his
                        pension are persons whom he does not care to know, and whose very presence
                        under the same roof may injure him. A young employe of any business or
                        commercial establishment has to be careful, not for social reasons, for,
                        snobbish though we are as a nation,the average Englishman does not suppose
                        that his subordinates are to be judged and condemned because they happen to
                        sleep under the same roof and to dine in the same room as undesirable
                        characters, but because Egypt posseses more than a fair share of
                        unscrupulous and needy persons of many nationalities- our own not excepted-
                        who are on the watch for the young man from home. The slightest
                        indiscretion, even a refusal to discuss a subject, may give the wily
                        enquirer a valuable "tip," and therefore the bank manager and his fellows
                        like to see their subordinates staying in establishments where the man with
                        an axe to grind is rare.</p>
                    <p>But these establishments, as we have pointed out, grow dearer and take more
                        of a man's pay. To the young permanent official this does not matter quite
                        so much, for he comes out to make a career and to retire with a pension, and
                        ought to be able to wait and at least simulate contentment, though if
                        promotion is slow or his Under-Secreatary of State or departmental chief
                        forgets to recommend that his pay be raised before the new financial year
                        begins- and once upon a time a chief forgot to recommend a single man in his
                        department and his staff fumed for months, having been promised mountains
                        and marvels- this simulation is hard to keep up. But the young employe of a
                        bank or business house, who has to keep up appearances like the rest, to pay
                        calls, dress,return bachelor hospitality, and join clubs, remarks with grief
                        that while rents and prices rise wages do not rise at all. The economic
                        books say they do; it may be true in Europe, and it may be true of certain
                        classes here, but it is not true of the class of which we speak. Can any of
                        our readers give a recipe for the "simple life" (with appearances saved and
                        thrown in) and a credit balance monthly, or is it impossible to eat your
                        cake and have it too?</p>

                            issued an address to the people begging them to cease attacking and
                            murdering landed proprietors and Jews, and to avoid civil war. It
                            further urges them to inaugurate an era of peace and tranquillity.
                            Martial law has been proclaimed throughout Poland, where the authorities
                            fear that an insurrection is being organised. M. Witte has received
                            telegrams from various parts of Poland demanding full autonomy,
                            including a Diet at Warsaw, elected by universal suffrage. M. Witte
                            informed a Polish deputation that he is in favor of autonomous
                            administration, but opposed to political autonomy.</p>

                            in the naval demonstration is not inspired by any ill-feeling towards

                    <p>This well-known hostelry has been sold by Mr. Klingler, the proprietor and
                        manager of the Continental Hotel in Cairo, to Mr. Henri Chamoulleau, former
                        proprietor of the Khedivial Hotel at Alexandria, who will enter into
                        possession on the 15th November. During the four years that the hotel has
                        been in possession of the former gentleman he has succeeded in forming a
                        high-class clientele, which no doubt Mr. Chamoulleau will not only retain
                        but increase, since his reputation as an hotelier has long been established.
                        Daring the summer a large sum of money has been spent on alterations and
                        improvements at the Savoy Hotel, which will add greatly to the comfort of
                        visitors. The whole of the shops facing the quay have been removed and

                    <p>Details of the fighting which occurred at Hodeida, in the Yemen, when the
                        British cruiser Fox was at that place a few weeks ago in connection with the
                        pursuit and punishment of the pirates who bad attacked British dhows, have
                        just been received. Claims were lodged with the Porte in regard to these
                        outrages, and the Pox was despatched to the Yemen coast in order to see that
                        the local authorities carried out the British demands, arrested and punished
                        the guilty persons, and destroyed the pirate dhows. The British cruiser
                        co-operated with the local Turkish authorities in the accomplishment of
                        these objects. It was found that the pirates bad moored their dhows at a
                        place called Khor Gbu’eifaka, which was not easy for the Turks to attack and
                        that the former had mounted guns round the cove where the pirate chips were
                        lying. A stiff fight occurred, in which the pirates lost twenty-five killed
                        and a large number of wounded. A launch belonging to the Fox went aground
                        and was lost, and one British sailor was slightly wounded.</p>

                        Egyptian Gazette</head>
                    <p>Sir,—In your paper of yesterday you publish a letter under the above heading
                        signed "Alexandrian,” containing certain malicious statements, which, if
                        true, would not only reflect very seriously on me and my colleagues, past
                        and present, on the board of the Alexandria Water Company, Ltd., but also on
                        the character of many high officials of the Egyptian Government, who, during
                        a long series of years, have represented the Government on the board of that
                        company. Your correspondent says "it was discovered " that the company were
                        charging the double of what they were legally entitled to for a " girbeh of
                        water.” This statement is absolutely false ; the Water Company never has
                        sold water at any higher price than they were legally entitled to. In the
                        autumn of 1878 the waterworks of Alexandria were offered for sale in London,
                        by a man of the highest integrity, then Minister of Finance to the Egyptian
                        Government, under certain conditions, and one of the most attractive of
                        these conditions was, that a certain branch of the service known as the
                        Sakkas, or water carriers, service, brought in a net revenue of £12,000 a
                        year ; this was not an estimated revenue, but one which had been realised
                        for many years by the Egyptian Government itself, at the price at which it
                        had sold the water, and proposed to transfer and did subsequently transfer,
                        to its purchaser, the Water Company, by contract of sale, the right to
                        continue the sale of water on the same condition, and at the same tariff as
                        that in use by the Government during the many years it had worked the
                        undertaking. Not only is this confirmed by contract, but the gentleman to
                        whom I above refer, is still living, and not only can, but would contradict
                        me, if anything I say in this matter is not strictly true, The Water Company
                        rotated this right until 1894, when it gave it up not as your correspondent
                        says, because it was an extortion, but as the result of an agreement with
                        the Municipality of Alexandria, who offered in exchange for it a new system
                        of filtration subject only to a contribution of L.E. 10,000 by the Water
                        Company, and not only this, but they gave the company the right to sell
                        water by meter, a right which led to complications, reference to which would
                        tale up too much of your space. Not only was it the first duty of the
                        Government representatives on our board to assure themselves that the Water
                        Company was acting in accordance with its legal rights, bat I am in a
                        position to say, without fear of contradiction, that one and all of these
                        gentlemen conscientiously did their duty in this respect There are several
                        other inaccuracies in the letter under notice, which I could easily refute,
                        but will not weary your readers by doing so at present. I write only in my
                        own name, and without prejudice to any action in the matter which my
                        colleagues may decide to take ; they are men as well known as any in
                        Alexandria, and it requires no testimony of mine to defend them ; but in
                        memory of those with whom I formerly had the honor of being associated, and
                        who have gone from this world and are no longer able to defend themselves, I
                        will, say, that it is a disgraceful action to endeavor to sully their names
                        by such false insinuations; for they were honorable men, who,under trying
                        circumstances, did the best which could be expected of them for the general
                        good. I do not know who your correspondent "Alexandrian” may be, nor have I
                        the slightest wish to make his acquaintance, for, in my opinion, a man who
                        would publish the malicious statements he has made, on a subject oh which be
                        shows that he is profoundly ignorant, is beneath contempt.—I remain, etc.,
                        E. Cornish, A director of the Alexandria Water; Company, Limited.

                    <p>The above lodge held its opening session list week under favorable
                        circumstances at Mustapha Pasha barracks, Alexandria, Bro. Charles Neill, V.
                        T., presiding. After the transaction of the ordinary business of the lodge
                        four initiations took place. Another friend was put on proposition. The
                        lodge deputy urged the officers to do their utmost to keep the members
                        together, and try and introduce new members to the Order. He hoped members
                        would use their influence In the several departmental corps in Alexandria
                        and swell the lodge. Work is required and not words, and he had not the
                        least doubt that if brothers and sisters put their shoulders to the wheel,
                        success would assuredly follow. The programme for the evening was the
                        reading of “Temperance Cuttings.” Several members contributed. A debate
                        followed in which Bros. Will, Ireland, Gervine, and Miller took part The
                        meeting was duly closed by Bro. Neill, V.T, at 9 p.m. A regular session will
                        be held on Tuesday next at 7 o'clock. Friends are cordially invited on the
                        "good of order” programme.</p>

                    <head>A FRENCHMAN IN THESUDAN. HIS IMPRESSIONS.</head>
                    <p>M. E. Sulesses, director of the railway in French Guinea, has just returned
                        to Paris from an official visit to Africa, during which be inspected all the
                        railways now working on this continent, and saw a good deal of the Sudan and
                        Egypt It is satisfactory to note for the future good relations of France and
                        England in Africa that M. Salesses is an Anglophila He was presented to all
                        the British officials in the course of his itinerary, and received the
                        greatest assistance from their hands. His speaks particularly well of Sir
                        Reginald Wingate— as, indeed, do all his compatriots. The Sirdar has known
                        how to make himself extremely liked by the French because of his tact and
                        consideration. M. Salesses exchanged a few words with Lord Cromer, and was
                        impressed with the power of the man, even in so short an interview. As to
                        the treatment of the natives by the British Administration, M. Salessies
                        regards it somewhat in the light of mistaken kindness. The native is a
                        child, and must be treated as such. Occasionally it is necessary to show
                        firmness. You cannot apply all the ideas of Western justice to him. The
                        judicial branch must not bo separated from the political and executive.
                        There is no division of, labour amongst the native Africans. The potter digs
                        his own clay ; the bootmaker is a tanner. And so the Commissioner in charge
                        of a district should himself bo able to apply the law. Justice must be swift
                        The native does not understand being punished three months after the
                        commission of a crime. Three months is too long for his memory— he has
                        forgotten all about the offence.” M. Salesses shares the view of Lord Cromer
                        that the Cape-to-Cairo railway can very properly utilise a steamboat service
                        on the lakes and the White Nile to connect its sections. He thinks that
                        Germany should strike a bargain with England over the lease of a atrip of
                        land between Tanganyika and Victoria Nyanza. Such a cession of territory
                        would work no prejudice to German interests; on the contrary, the
                        communication afforded by the railway would be highly profitable to the
                        colony.</p>

                    <p>The eighth annual general meeting of Walker and Meimarachi, Limited, was
                        heldon the 30th ult. at the offices,65, Londonwall, London, E.C., Mr. James
                        Greenlees (the chairman) presiding. </p>
                    <p>The notice calling the meeting having been read,</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said: It is with pleasure that I rise to address you to-day. All
                        those present have doubtlwss perused the dirctors' report to the
                        shareholders, and we will therefore take it as read. Those shareholders who
                        have attended our annual meetings have heard from my lips more about the
                        progress of the company since its inception, some years ago, than has
                        appeared in the formal reports, and they will therefore not have been
                        surprised when they learnt that the directors, in continuation of their
                        consistent policy of harbouring our cash resources, had decidedto advise the
                        shareholders to declare this year an ordinary dividend of 1 per cent.
                        increase upon that of last year; it is therefore proposedthat a five per
                        cent. dividend be declared, payable on January 15 next. Reference to the
                        balancesheet shows that the company could easily have paid more than this
                        amount; but it has been considered wiser to proceed with caution.As time
                        goes on and the prosperity of Egypt advances- and, let us hope, that of the
                        company likewise- increased divideds will doubtless be paid to the ordinary
                        shareholders. And this leads me to a few remarks upon the general condition
                        of the company's financial aspect. The accounts show that, in addition to
                        paying the usual 6 1/2 per cent. preference share dividend amounting to
                        L8,125, the board have written off the balance of L3,677 5s. 8d. stading to
                        the credit of fixtures and fittings and L787 13s. 5d. has been carried to
                        reserve. We are advised by the managing director that the value of the stock
                        is even greater than theamount at which it stands in our books. The amount
                        of sundry debtors represents a slight increase upon last year, which is to
                        be expected, considering the increased volume of trade.Without undue
                        self-congratulation, we venture to believe that there are few trading
                        companies outside the United Kingdom which can boast of so satisfactory a
                        financial position as Walker and Meimarachi, taking into consideration the
                        fiscal condition of the country in which the company carries on its trade.
                        The directors do not take the credit of this satisfactory state of affairs
                        entirely to themselves.Had they not had the active co-operation of both the
                        preference and ordinary shareholders in the past- and particularly of the
                        ordinary shareholders- this company could not have reached its present stage
                        of development. We recently had occasion to prepare account showing certain
                        aggregate returns of the amounts which the company has dealt with since the
                        shareholders first met together to pass the accounts. </p>
                    <p>It will probably surprise you, as it has suprised us, when we tell you that
                        the total amount of net profits of trading in Egypt since our incorporation
                        has reached the very respectable total of L125,941 8s. 6d., and we paid in
                        preference dividends L58, 570 5s. 9d. We have written off goodwill,
                        fixtures, and fittings and preliminary expenses L28,405.Our reserve fund
                        stands at L5,451 5s. 10d., and we have paid away some L16,062 in ordinary
                        dividends. It is true that in the years of depression following the Sudan
                        War the shareholders confirmed the policy of conserving the company's assets
                        and passed the ordinary dividend, and the company is now reaping the benefit
                        of your prudent policy. These figures speak more eloquently than any words
                        of mine as to the soundness of the business which has been built up. Perhaps
                        I may say that I now come to the most satisfactory, and at the same time the
                        personal, side of the affairs of the company, so far as the members of your
                        board are concerned. For years past your directors have been painfully
                        aware, as you all know only too well, that the company's operations and
                        extensions have been greatly hampered by want of adequate working capital.
                        Notwithstanding the most urgent instructions to the executive in Egypt to
                        curtail the stock and to reduce the amount of customers' outstanding
                        accounts, it has not been found possible to do so without great detriment to
                        the company's trade. Month after month the strongest representations have
                        been made to this effect to the managing director, who has at all times
                        shown the shareholders' representations the utmost courtesy and a desire to
                        conform to such a policy; but the fact remains that, so far as out customers
                        are concerned, credit, and very long credit, must bbe given,and we are
                        advised that without such credit Walker and Meimarachi might as well close
                        its stores and liquidate. It redounds greatly to the ability of the managing
                        director, the general manager, and other members of the staff that up to the
                        present the annual amount of bad debts has been surprisingly small. It may
                        be that in Mr. Meimarachi we have a man possessed of a quite unique
                        knowledge of the financial standing of every individual customer, or it may
                        be due to some other cause unknown to us; but we prefer to believe that it
                        is due to the able business ability and ever-constant supervision of our
                        managing director.</p>
                    <p>The large amount of stock carried has also had our consideration; but here,
                        again,our representatives definitely advise us that it can only be reduced
                        with the prospect of the greatest danger to the company's trade;
                        indeed,increased stock has always shown increased profits.These are indeed
                        weighty matters, and as such have had more than usual serious attention of
                        the board. Reports have from time to time reached the board from
                        shareholders and customers that the company's premises were inconvenient and
                        the stock inadequate, and so strong because the representations that it was
                        decided to ask Mr.Drower to visit Cairo, and report specially upon these and
                        other matters. Mr. Drower's report proved beyond a questioon of doubt that
                        more commodious premises must be forthwith acquired. The difficult,
                        however,was how this was to be accomplished. As, no doubt, most of you are
                        aware, the value of land in and around Cairo has risen to almost a
                        phenomenal extent, and during the last few years has doubled, and in some
                        cases even trebled, its value. Having regard to these facts,it was felt that
                        if additional working capital was to be forthcoming, it must be constituents
                        in Egypt who had participated in the extraordinary prosperity of the
                        country, rather than from our English shareholders. Our Cairo lawyer and one
                        of our largest shareholders (Mr. Carton de Wiart) attended the board, and
                        fully confirmed Mr. Drower's representations. The directors therefore
                        determined that Mr. Luning should proceed to Egypt for the purpose of
                        ascertaining the pulse of the capitalists on the spot. While in no way
                        wishing to minimise the efforts of Mr. Luning and his subsequent success,
                        still, the fact remains that had not the shareholders loyally seconded the
                        policty of your board in past years, in strengthening our financial
                        position, we believe that it would not have been possible to raise L100,000
                        additional working capital, except at very onerous rates. Still, it has been
                        done,and we congratulate the shareholders accordingly, as we are certain, in
                        our own minds, that without this capital the continuation of past successes
                        could not be accomplished. We shall therefore be asking you, at the
                        extraordinary general meeting to be held at the conclusion of the present,to
                        vote unhesitatingly for the proposed increase of capital.Mr. Nungovich, the
                        gentleman who has undertaken the responsibility of guaranteeing the
                        L100,000, stipulates that he shall have the option of subscribing yet
                        another L100,000 working capital at par, together with the right to claim
                        L100,000 debentures carrying 5 per cent. interest, the latter to be secured
                        upon the land and building which it is proposed to erect upon some central
                        and convenient site in the very centre of business Cairo. </p>
                    <p>We have been given to understand that Mr. Nungovich has associated with him
                        in the development of the present scheme some of the most able financiers in
                        Egypt, and, for certain, we know that he has with him heart and soul his old
                        friend and compatriot, your managing director (Mr. Meimarachi).The success
                        of the scheme, therefore, appears to be assured. But there is, as I have
                        already foreshadowed, another side of this matter,and that is eminently a
                        personal one. The introduction of so large an amount of worrking capital,
                        the value of which to the company at its present juncture we cannot
                        overestimate, has necessarily led to a demand on the part of those finding
                        such capital to acquire the control of the company's directorate. After we
                        had carefully examined our list of shareholders, we came to the conclusion
                        that,with the exception of but a very few- most of whom were resident in
                        Egypt, and directly or indirectly connected with our friend Mr. Nungovich
                        and his group- it would be quite out of the question to ask the shareholders
                        in England to provide the large amount of capital now necessary. We
                        therefore decided to face the music and agree to the demand of the
                        financiers, that upon the firm application for the 100,000 shares being
                        received we, as a board, were prepared to tender our resignations,having
                        previously made such arrangements as would enable the nominees of Mr.
                        Nungovich to join the board. It goes without saying that we dislike vacating
                        the position of trust that you have so long entrusted to us; but we feel
                        that in your own interests there is no other course open to us, more
                        particularly as Mr. Nungovich desires to be in the position, if necessary,
                        to hold the meetings of the directores in Cairo, which would be quite
                        impracticable for the present directors. It has not been officially
                        communicated tous that Mr. Nungovich desires our resignations; but, in view
                        of the recent trend of Egyptian thought, we are inclined to believe that
                        most if not the whole board, will be asked to retie.We cannot for a moment
                        blame Mr. Nungovich for making his own terms, but we do feel a certain
                        regret at the prospect of retiring from the board of a company with whose
                        shareholders in England we have always worked in complete harmony. We are
                        given to understand that the prospectus of the new issure is in a forward
                        state,and we have no hesitation in recommending your acive support to the
                        scheme. The Chairman then moved the adoption of the report. </p>
                    <p>Mr. J. Bristow seconded the resolution, which was unanimously agreed to, and
                        the dividends as recommended declared.</p>
                    <p>Mr. J.E. Drower was re-elected a director, and the auditors (Messrs. W.B.
                        Peat and Co.) were reappointed.</p>
                    <p>An extraordinary general meeting was then held, when thhe resolutions
                        authorising the increase of capital were duly passed.</p>

                    <p>Great interest has been aroused by a semi-official statement with regard to
                        the new German naval programme. </p>
                    <p>The "Kolnische Zeitung" announces that the displacement of the new
                        battleships and armoured cruisers will be 18,000 tons and 15,000 tons
                        respectively. The German Government considers it necessary to follow the
                        example of other navies, which, as the result of the lessons of the Battle
                        of Tsushima, have increased the size of their heavy artillery, thus
                        entailing a corresponding augmentation in the tonnageof the warships.</p>
                    <p>The Conservative Press welcomes the decision of the Government to bring the
                        navy up to the level of those of other Powers. At present the largest German
                        battleships have a displacement of 13,200 tons, and the displacement of the
                        largest cruisers is 11,000 tons,while the heaviest gun carried is the
                        28-centimetre (11in.) quick-firer.</p>
                    <p>The "Tagliche Rundschau" publishes an article by the well-known naval
                        publicist,Count Reventlow,who, while approving the action of the Government,
                        deplores the publication of the programme at the present juncture. He
                        declares that Great Britain has purposely delayed the launchof the first
                        representative of a new type of battleship, in order to obtain as much
                        information as possible with regard to the building programmes of other
                        nations.</p>

                    <head>KAISER'S CLEVERNESS IN CHINA.</head>
                    <p>An interview with General Yin Chang, the Chinese Minister in Berlin, who is
                        leaving his post to return to China, is published in the "Berliner
                        Tageblatt." General Yin Chang spoke in terms of the highest admiration of
                        the German Emperor,whose proposal to withdraw the foreign garrisons in
                        Pe-chi-li was, he said, an extremely clever diplomati move. The EMperor's
                        proposal had been greeted with great approval in China. General Ying Chang
                        declared, in conclusion, that the Powers made many mistakes in dealing with
                        his country, and were, in many respects, simply driving the Chinese into the
                        arms of Japan. The Japanese were taking part more and more in Chinese
                        commerce, and in the founding of newspapers with the intention of gaining a
                        political influence over the mass of the Chinese population. In his opinion,
                        too, Japan was becoming day by day more subservient to England. Japan's
                        policy was nothing but Great Britain's policy. He regarded England's
                        intention to fortify Singapore as a most important development,the full
                        significance of which was not fully realised in Europe. Great Britain's
                        power and influence in the Far East would be greatly increased by the
                        establishment of a first-class naval base at Singapore.</p>

                    <p>The Insurance Superintendent of Missouri has notified the officials of the
                        NEw York Life Insurance Company that on Tuesday next he will revoke the
                        licence of that company to carry on business in the State owing to the
                        mismanagement of the company's officers as revealed in the investigation at
                        present going on in New York.</p>
                    <p>This notice is in accordance with the previous intimation given to the
                        company by the Superintendent early last month that this action would be
                        taken unless the implicated officers resigned and the sums paid over to

                    <p>A prvident wife, says a philosophical contemporary, is an income in herself.
                        But a virtue may be carried to extreme. "Your husband'll be all right now,"
                        said the doctor. "What yer mean?" demanded the wife. "You told me he
                        couldn't live a fortnight." "Well, I'm going to cure him after all," said
                        the doctor; "surely you're glad!" The woman wrinkled her brows."Puts me in a
                        bit of an 'ole," she said. "I bin and sold all his clothes for his

                    <p>The German papers publish a weird story from Seirakrisza in the Crimea.</p>
                    <p>Owing to the harvest turning out badly the peasants suspected an old man
                        named Opiroff, who was a reputed wizard, to be the cause of the trouble, and
                        seized him.</p>
                    <p>They prepared a bonfire on the village green, and Opirofi, having been placed
                        upon it, a village elder set the pile alight and burned him to death. As the
                        famine continued it was decided to hold grotesque religious ceremonies over
                        the remains, which were disinterred in accordance with local
                        superstitutions. While these were going on Father Constantine, the village
                        priest, appeared, and rebuked them for their impious barbariam.</p>
                    <p>The peasants, who were mostly drunk, thereupon declared that he was the evil
                        genius, and seizing him flung him into Opiroff's open grave. Earth was
                        thrown upon him, and he was burid alive by his own parishionners.</p>

                    <head>ROME OVERCROWDED</head>
                    <p>The tourist who, among his impressions of Rome, has carried away the
                        remembrance of the staring windows of the great empty houses near St.
                        Peter's, and outside the Porta Pia- legacies from the building crisis fo
                        1887- is astonished to learn that there is difficulty in finding homes for
                        the inhabitants of the great city. The housing question, however, is rapidly
                        becoming a serious one. Since 1870 the population of Rome has more than
                        doubled itself, and since the frantic speculations of the mid-eighties,
                        comparatively few houses have been built, with the exception of villas
                        standing in their own gardens in the new Ludosvisi and Prati di Castello
                        quarters. These are chiefly taken at large rents by the foreign colony,
                        which becomes more and more numerous every year. The destruction of the
                        teeming Ghetto, and of some of the older streets that were removed in order
                        to make room for the tunnel road leading from the via Tritone, has made the
                        houses that remain more sought after, and has crowded the poorer districts
                        of Rome till they are full to overflowing. Four, and even five families in
                        one room is not unknown, and the numbers herded together in one great
                        tenement sometimes rise to four or five hundred.</p>

                    <head>THE ARABIAN REVOLT</head>
                    <p>Professor Vambery contributes to the current number of the "Contemporary
                        Review" an interesting but short paper on the revolt in Arabia, which, he
                        predicts, will be crushed by the Turks "like the previous one, and like all
                        the revolts of insufficiently armed and undrilled rabbles against a
                        well-armed and fairly organised army." He dismisses as undeserving of
                        credence the rumours circulated in Turkey that the English, anxious to push
                        forward the limits of the Aden Hinterland, are instigating the rising.
                        Professor Vambery disclaims any sympathy for the "nefarious regime" of the
                        present Sultan, but he does not attribute special importance to the present
                        rising: - "The Arabs will never submit complacently to the Turk; they will
                        always despise and hate their foreign ruler; but it would be a mistake to
                        see in this aversion a plan for an Arab national rising against the Ottoman
                        power, and for a restitutiion of the spiritual lead of Islam to the direct
                        descendants of the Prophet. Such a desire may lurk in the distant future,
                        but the present social, cultural and political conditions of the Arab race
                        do not admit of its realisation."</p>

                    <p>n'hésitent pas à se purger, quand elles en ont besoin. Elles ne craignent ni
                        le dégoût ni la fatigue, parce que, à l'opposé des autres purgatifs,
                        celui-ci n'opère bien que lorsqu'il est pris avec de bons aliments et des
                        boissons fortifiantes, telles que vin, café, thé. Chacun choisit, pour se
                        purger, l'heure et le repas qui lui conviennent le mieux, selon ses
                        occupations. La fatigue de la purgation étant annulée par l'effet de la
                        bonne alimentation, on se décide aisément à recommencer autant de fois que
                        cela est nécessaire.</p>
