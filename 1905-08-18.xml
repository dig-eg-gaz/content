                    <head>Army Reform</head>
                    <p>It is the opinion of many thinking soldiers, who observed with discernment
                        the trend of public feeling after the war in South Africa, that a golden
                        opportunity was then lost by the Government, and that, if we had possessed a
                        leader alert at the time to observe and resolute to seize the chances that
                        were offered, the British Army would not now have been in a situation which
                        we have all to deplore. Instead of being the Army accura-tely described by
                        Lord Roberts as unfitted for the purposes of a great war, it would have been
                        a force engaged in embodying and training a new Army based upon the
                        universal training of the nation. What is it that gives the British Empire
                        its weight in the councils of Europe at the present time—upon what do the
                        groupings of foreign politicsnow chiefly turn? That weight is gained from,
                        and those groupings turn upon the strength and efficiency of a great Navy
                        built up and organised to a specific and known purpose, with the effort of a
                        consistent and unchanging policy. Wherein, on the other hand, lies the
                        weakness that endangers our position, and that menaces us with the gravest
                        danger that can ever threaten any 8tate? State weakness lies in the failure
                        to provide an Army adequate for the enormous demands which may be summed up,
                        as a standard of strength, in the defence of Afghanistan against a
                        first-class military Power—a defence, be it remembered, to which we are
                        pledged. Bismarck is credited with having made the cynical but sagacious
                        remark that “les faibles sont faits pour etre manges par les forts,; and
                        little as we may like the brutality of such statements, they are
                        demonstrably and palpably true. There can be no further excuse,
                        therefore,for ignoring the Empire’s need, which, as Lord Roberts said at the
                        Mansion Housed is the sufficiency and organised efficiency of the armed
                        forces to undertake a prolonged war in support of our national interests
                        against a great Power. This we may describe as the root problem now before
                        the Government. It cannot be solved in the imminent breach. It must be
                        solved now, once and for all.</p>
                    <p>Ministers should not cherish any feeble illusion on this matter. Their
                        proposals have so far touched only the outermost fringe of a great subject,
                        but their opportunity is not altogether lost We do not believe it to be the
                        settled mind of the British public to reject a doty assumed by every other
                        great people. Englishmen are awakening to the national need. Let the
                        Government, therefore, go to the country with the great demand. They will,
                        at least, have acquitted themselves of a supreme duty, and have brought
                        universal service into the domain of practical politics. They have a case
                        that is unassailable. They have endeavoured without success to make an Army
                        out of what we already possess, and, failing, they ask for more. They have
                        the teaching of all history, and all experience to prove that only the
                        strong are secure. It is not a vast standing Army that we require. Invasion
                        we do not contemplate, but, with a trained nation, all fear of descents on
                        our shores would disappear. If we had the Army of our need there oould be no
                        questioning of the attitude of France at the present hour. France and
                        England, equally strong at sea and on land, could defy aggression, and
                        impose peace upon the world. With an Army based upon universal servioe we
                        should possess that power of military expansion which would enable ns to
                        mobilise reserve after reserve, strengthening and reinforcing the regular
                        forces in any part of the world, until the will of the nation was
                        enforced.</p>
                    <p>Though Lord Roberts has given the weight of his high authority to the demand
                        for an army capable of indefinite expansion, as he told his hearers at the
                        mansion House,</p>
                    <p>neither the Royal Commission nor other endeavours have so far had any real
                        effect. We do not desire to see Army matters made an affair of party
                        politics, but it seems to us dangerous to wait for any slow movement of
                        public opinion, and we see no other way than for the Government to take the
                        country into its confidence. They can admit their errors as readily as Lord
                        Roberts admitted, at the Mansion House, the he made in recommending Mr.
                        Brodrick to open three years’ recruiting. The primary consideration must be
                        the Regular Army, brought up to adequate strength by proper treatment, with
                        the great reserve of officers upon which we insisted last week, and the
                        importance of which Lord Roberts has since enforced. Then would come the
                        universal training of the people, and, as the Field-Marshal said, a
                        necessary part of any scheme would be the training of all boys aud youths,
                        up to the time of their reaching the military age, in drill and
                        rifle-shooting. The subsequent training would not be burdensome. It might
                        take the form of periods of embodiment in a reorganised Militia, after which
                        men would be drafted to the reserve of the Army, with liability to serve in
                        great national emergencies. Lest it never be forgotten that these reserve
                        troops would not be put,in the field at the first outbreak of war, They
                        would be embodied for training, and be despatched to the front as
                        reinforcements, just as the Japanese have despatched their reserve men to
                        Manchuria. There would be a great demand for officers, but the organisation
                        of the men would be easy. The system could be in-troduced gradually. It
                        oould begin with training in schools; it could be continued with boys’
                        brigades and cadet battalions ; it could be extended by embodiment in the
                        Auxiliary Forces ; and afterwards, if necessary, could be completed by
                        definite territorial organisation with permanent cadres. The opportunity now
                        arises for placing this great issue before the country. It is not
                        conscription that is required, but merely a system of individual training
                        throughout the nation, and we hope the Government will recognise and
                        proclaim the necessity.</p>

                    <p>question of indemnity.</p>
                    <p>REFERENCE TO ST. PETERSBURG PROBABLE.</p>
                    <p>Portsmouth (N.H.), August 17.</p>
                    <p>It is expected that Article IX. which refers to the question of indemnity
                        will come up today. It will probably be necessary to refer the matter to St
                        Petersburg.</p>
                    <p>Russia by accepting Articles VII. and VIII. surrenders every vestige of
                        ambition in Manchuria, and closes the door upon her scheme for possessing
                        Dalny, upon which she spent millions, as a port free from ice.</p>
                    <p>She retains only a non-military line connecting her European possessions with

                        one man was killed on the spot and two severely injured. Something like a
                        panic occurred among some of the merchants of the town, but order was
                        quickly restored by Khalil Bey, the energetic Albanian governor of the town,

                        at Cairo lately. For about a week the intense heat, which was experienced in
                        the beginning of August, has given way to a much pleasanter temperature, and
                        the nights are especially cool and refreshing, the difference between the
                        day and night readings of the thermometer being as much as 30 degrees
                        Fahrenheit.</p>
                    <p>Sad Death at Mex.—A European woman, of the name of Mrs. L. Demech, whilst
                        bathing at Mex yesterday afternoon, was suddenly seized with an attack of
                        syncope. Her daughters, who had accompanied her, and several other bathers
                        went to her assistance and succeeded in getting her ashore and into the
                        bathing cabin, but unfortunately she never recovered consciousness and died
                        in half an hour. The body of the deceased was taken to the Deaconness’s
                        Hospital for the holding of an autopsy. </p>

                    <p>An Ignorant Omdeh.—Anomdeh, ignorant alike of reading and of writing,
                        recently wished to fine a villager who had committed a contravention. He
                        therefore asked a fiki to fill up a form, which was to be sent to the
                        mamour. The fiki was almost as ignorant as the omdeh and copied the printed
                        report form without filling up one of the blanks left in it for the name,
                        date, contravention, and amount of fine, etc. The mamour was not a little
                        amused by the receipt of this product of the omdeh’s ignorance and the
                        fiki’s smattering of knowledge. ; </p>
                    <p>Alexandria's Boot-Blacks.—A month or so ago a protest appeared in our columns
                        against the granting of boot-blacking licences to other than native boys.
                        Attention chiefly drawn to the large number of Greeks, many of them big,
                        hulking specimens of their race, who adopted this calling as a method of
                        living, and the Greek Diplomatic Agent has since turned his attention to the
                        matter, A number of cases were investigated and the Cairo authorities
                        arrived at the conclusion that such an occupation was unfit for men who were
                        themselves in some cases “undesirables.” The necessary steps were taken and
                        the boot blacking trade is now confined entirely to native boys in Cairo.
                        Will not Alexandria follow Cairo's example? It is not a pleasant sight to
                        see a large number of strong and able-bodied men wasting their lives in a
                        boy's work of cleaning boots, and Greeks, Italians, Arme-menians, Levan tmes
                        and Natives are to be of Alexandria, in very large this calling. The remedy
                        we hope to see the authorities act upon our suggestion. </p>

                    <p>From further details that we have received it appears that the recent affray
                        between an Italian gentleman and certain employée of the Customs
                        Administration was caused by the brutal and offensive conduct of an effendi,
                        one Ali Sabit, who attempted to force his way into the bedroom of Mme
                        Baiocchi, an Italian lady, who had come to Port Said for a change of air,
                        and whose relations, with whom she stayed during the day, had found her a
                        furnished room in a pension in the Rue Eugenie. Some Englishmen staying in
                        the pension quickly intervened, and suppressed the effendi, and the husband
                        of the insulted lady hastened down from Cairo to demand an explanation of
                        his offensive and ungentlemanly conduct. The effendi answered his questions
                        with such insulting nonchalance that M. Baiocchi boxed his ears, whereupon a
                        number of porters and nondescripts fell on him, and beat and bound him. M.
                        Baiocchi complained to the Italian Consulate, which, very properly,
                        protested most vigorously, and was supported by the Italian Diplomatic
                        Agency, and the effendi has been reduced in rank. He is said to have been
                        transferred to Alexandria, while M. Baiocchi is reported to be bringing an
                        action against him, and against the Port Said Customs.</p>

                    <p>We are informed that the Council of Administration of the Cairo Bourse, in
                        conjunction with the Association des Courtiers en Valeurs have decided upon
                        the erection of a new exchange, failing to find for renting suitable and
                        centrally situated premises to accommodate the large and constantly
                        increasing number of members, which at present is about 250. The cost of the
                        new premises is estimated at £60,000 to £80,000, inclusive of the cost of
                        site and furnishing. The present bourse buildings in the sharia El Maghraby,
                        which belong to the family of the late Mr. Ed. Manuk, are held on a six
                        years’lease of which two years are expired, but the committee have the right

                    <p>Some of our readers will probably recollect how, about this period last year,
                        Cairo was roused out of its usual summer apathy by the news of the elopement

                        vernacular daily paper, and her marriage without the previous consent of the
                        father.</p>
                    <p>The incident caused quite a ferment in Cairene native circles at the time, on
                        account of the social standing of the parties concerned, and culminated in
                        the Mehkemeh Sharieh refusing to recognise the marriage, on the ground that
                        it was contracted without the knowledge of the bride’s father which,
                        according to Mohamedan law, was necessary. This judgment was appealed
                        against, but was upheld by the higher Court. Further interest was revived in
                        the case a few months back by the report that both the lady in question as
                        well as her mother had left the paternal roof and sought refuge in the house
                        of a Princess of the Khédivial family. Within the past few days a report was
                        circulated that a reconciliation had taken place between the Sheik Ali
                        Yussef, the editor of the vernacular sheet referred to, and Sheik El Sadaat,
                        the lady’s father, who, it was stated, had at last given his consent to the
                        marriage.</p>
                    <p>It seems, however, that such is not the case, as although the Sheik Ali
                        Yusref had obtained the assistance of friends to bring about a
                        reconciliation, the father remains inexorable and still refuses his
                        consent.</p>

                        Port Sudan on the 29th ult., from Khartoum, via Suez, by the Khédivial Mail
                        steamer Dakahlia, on inspection duty, and will shortly return to Cairo.

                        Bimbashi Newcombe, R.E, who is at present surveying the Pott Sudan line.</p>

                    <p>A Post office branch has already been opened at Port Sudan, and steps will
                        soon be taken by the Railway authorities to commence the Port Sudan line.
                        The Sudan Government Railways Administration has handed over all the
                        lighthouse material to the Works Department, Port Sudan, who will probably
                        invite tenders for its construction shortly.</p>

                    <p>It has been decided to build a special Government hospital which will admit
                        cases of both sexes. The plans have been approved, and the cost of its

                    <p> THE WEATHER.</p>
                    <p> The last few days here the weather has been almost unbearable. The
                        sandstorms have been so thick that the sun was hid altogether, and the hot
                        winds have blown as if from a fiery furnace. Yesterday the day was much
                        worse, and a European workman of the Suakin Railway recieved a sunstroke and
                        was taken into hospital. He died a few hours later.</p>

                    <p>Sir,—For the benefit of the public, I hope you will be kind enough to give
                        this letter of mine a place in your paper.</p>
                    <p>On my way from Europe to Constantinople I purchased from Cook's office at
                        Vienna a first-class ticket for the Austrian steamer that was to sail from
                        Constantinople for Beyrout on the 1st August, and, according to the
                        published tariff of the Austrian Lloyd Company, I had to pay 303 france
                        (£12.8s. 2d.) for my ticket At Constantinople I met a friend who wished to
                        accompany me to Beyrout, and so I had to get another first class ticket tor
                        him, for which I paid 235 francs at the Austrian Lloyds office at
                        Constantinople, and received ticket No. 547, and in exchange for Cook's
                        Vienna ticket (sea 8,002 No. 12,263} I was given ship's ticket No. 548. I
                        was very much astonished to find such a great difference between the price
                        of the “ first-class ticket charged at Cook’s office and that charged at the
                        Austrian Lloyd's office, and brought the matter at once to the notice of
                        Cook’s agency in Constantinople. I found than Cook’s agent was not
                        astonished at this inexplicable dealing of the Austrian Lloyd Company, and
                        he has made a formal complaint to the Company’s local office, and reported
                        the matter to his head office in London.</p>
                    <p>The S.S. Thalia was to sail on the 1st inst. from Constantinople and we
                        arrived on board an hour before she sailed. The poop deck which is supposed
                        to be reserved for the first class passengers was, soon after the departure
                        of the ship, invaded by the second class passengers, and later on was
                        intruded upon by the third class passengers as well, no notice being taken
                        by the officers of the ships. The grievance increased as the ship continued
                        to touch at' the intermediate ports and take more passengers, but it arrived
                        at a climax at Alexandretta, where the vessel shipped 500 sheep and four
                        boatloads of oxen (100 to 150). The sheep, being placed in a higher category
                        than the oxen, were accommodated on the deck under the "bridge, used till
                        then'by the second class passengers, and the oxen, being classed lower, were
                        given the place of third, class passengers.</p>
                    <p>To find room for the second and third class passengers there was no place on
                        hoard the ship, except the narrow deck space on the sides by the first-class
                        dining saloon, and the poop, and so they were freely admitted there.</p>
                    <p>Not to speak of the sickening smells caused on board by the presence of
                        several hundreds of four-legged second and third class passengers, the first
                        class two-legged passengers were squeezed out of the breathing space in the
                        poop, and had to pass the nights and days in the smothering atmosphere of
                        their cabins, for which, even in the twentieth century, electric fans are
                        considered superfluous by the owoers of the ship.</p>
                    <p>I hope the public will take note of this, and that any unfortunate traveller,
                        who may by circumstances be obliged to travel by the ships of the Austrian
                        Lloyd Company from Constantinople to the ports of the Syrian Coast, must be

                        Etant donné que les aunées précédontes plus de cent millions de francs,
                        représentant un bénéfice, restent dans le pays et augmentent son fonds de

                        sont, en Egypte, plutôt rares. Eu 1904, ou en a compté 157, soit une moyenne
                        de 13 par mois, pour uno popu lation qui dépasse 12 millions d’habitants. En
                        Europe, dans une ville de moyenne importance, ce chiffre est souvent pins

                    <p>Pour les Entrepreneurs</p>
                    <p>Une affaire intéressante va venir prochai nement devant le Tribunal mixte du
                        Caire. Il s’agit d’une question de principe qui tou che üe prés tous les
                        entrepreneurs. Le mi nistère des Travaux publics reçoit continuel lement des
                        oppositions aux paiements qu’n doit taire aux concessionnaires des travaux,
                        oppositions motivées par le fait que l’opposant doit toucher une somme,
                        souvent pas même spécifiée dudit concessionnaire. Far mesure de prudence, le
                        ministère dès lors ne paie plus ce qu’il doit à l’entrepreneur, qui souvent,
                        pour une dette assez douteuse de quelques livres se voit retarder le
                        paiement de plusieurs centaines de livres. Or un de ces entrepreneurs a
                        assigné le ministère des Travaux publics devant le tribunal mixte du Caire
                        demandant qu’il soit tenu responsable des conséquences du retard,
                        l’opposition simple d’an prétendu créancier ne pouvant pas avoir la force
                        d’une saisie. La chambre interna tionale de commerce s’est déjà occupée de
                        la question, et elle a adressé à ce propos on mémoire au gouvernement.</p>

                    <p>Vers la moitié du mois, nous avons eu du réveil et aussi bien dius les
                        farines dores que dans os tendres. Pour les dures ou se limite encore au
                        disponible, les prix actuels étant plus elevés que d'habitude. Nos
                        importateurs, craignant quelque brusque détente, préfèrent attendre encore,
                        avant do prendre des engagements sur l’éloigné. Quant aux tendres, il s’est
                        déjà lait des marches de quelque importance, mais la plupart de nos
                        fariniers s’abstiennent encore, nourrissant toujours l’espoir d’une
                        prochaine baisse.</p>
                    <p>A Marsoillo, le marché se maintient ferme ; mais, en réalité, il parait que
                        les farines dures seulement fassent la hausse à la suite de la demande
                        actuelle, tandis que les tendres ne seraient qu'entraînées dans leur

                        à uno hausse très sensible. Les exportations de Suez poor l’Europe du 1er au

                    <p>British Chamber op Commerce.—We would draw : the attention of manufacturers
                        and marchante to the work of the British Chamber of Commerce of Egypt which
                        was formed in 1896 with the sole object of assisting British trade in this
                        country. The services of the Chamber are always at the disposal of any
                        member desiring information on trade matters generally, including the
                        question of appointing suitable agents. As no fee is charged for such
                        advice, it is obviously in the interests of all British traders here to
                        become members, especially when it is remembered that the annual
                        subscription is merely the nominal one The latter payment also includes a

                    <p>ADVENTURE ON A CONSUL GENERAL’S JOURNEY.</p>
                    <p>Some interesting glimpses of the manners and customs of the natives are
                        afforded in the Report (issued by the Foreign Office last week)</p>
                    <p>By Mr. Alexander Hosie, Consul General at Chengtu on his journey to the
                        eastern frontier of Tibet. He passed along the great highway connecting
                        Chengtu, the capital of Souchnan, wi‘h Lhassa—the road on which pilgrims,
                        eager to look upon the face of the Dalai Dima travel ;</p>
                    <p>some, by continuous genuflections and prostra-</p>
                    <p>tions, taking years to reach their goal.</p>
                    <p> it is a road barred by numerous mountain passes, whose lofty passes inspire
                        terror io the breasts of the superstitions wayfarers, who at each successive
                        crossing give vent to their pent up feeling in muttering the well-known
                        prayer, ‘Om Mani Padmé Hum' and with jouyous shouts of ‘Hla solo, solo !'
                        lay each a stone as a thank-offering to the gods on the Obo, Hla Dzi, or
                        cairns which dot the sum-mits represent the offerings of many weary</p>
                    <p>travellers.</p>
                    <p>There was an enormous traffic on the road, especially as far as Shuang-lio.
                        Wheelbarrows laden with passengers, many of them asleep in spite of the
                        jolting, trundled along. Huge bags of rice and black pigs were being
                        similarly conveyed, the latter strapped in pairs on their backs, joining
                        their squalls to the squeaking of the wheels. Horses and oxen were also
                        engaged in the rice traffic, and there were porters with medicines, salt,
                        timber, and fowl of every age.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hosie one morning caught up a middle aged man with dishevelled locks,
                        accompanied by a poor child of five or six in a similar condition of filth
                        and disorder, “I addressed and asked him what he was doing and where he was
                        going. He replied that he was a native of Chihi who was visiting the Sacred
                        Mountains of China, and was bound for O-mei Shan. I pitied the child, and
                        said so ; but the man persisted in saying that the infant was fond of the
                        roving life. They were moving along very ei slowly, as the child could not
                        possibly walk at any pace. The man said he was not a priest, Buddhist, or
                        Taoist. I offered him some money to help him on his journey, but this, to my
                        surprise, he declined, not quite indignantly, but with needless reiteration,
                        saying that he accepted money from no one, but that he and the child managed
                        to subsist as best they could. It seemed to me that the man was either
                        insane or trying to wipe out by sanctity the memory of some great
                        crime.”</p>
                    <p>Our traveller had many troubles with the inns at which he stopped. In one his
                        bedroom contained the parts of two beautiful coffins, intended, in due
                        season, for the landlord and his wife.</p>
                    <p>Most Tibetan families with any pretensions of affluence keep a lama, or
                        priest, on the premises to perform by proxy their religious duties. “He
                        usually lives in a small room on the flat roof of the house, where, in
                        seclusion, he chants his sacred books and beats a drum, the servants of the
                        household attending to his wants in the way of refreshment, and carrying out
                        the other religious duties, such as the burning of incense on the housetop
                        in the early morning, and the changing of the holy water or butter in the
                        metal cups placed before the idols in the special room or shrine allotted
                        to</p>
                    <p>them.”</p>
                    <p>Presents were freely bestowed on Mr. Hosie during his journey, but he had to
                        pay for them. He stayed once in the house of a Tibetan chief “whose good
                        lady brought presents of tea, milk, and eggs. The eggs I accept ed and paid
                        for in more than double their value, but, as she did not appear satisfied, I
                        added as much again, with a resolve to accept no more presents. I should
                        have stated that the military official at Ho-k'ou sent me on the previous
                        evening a melon, three cucumbers, two cabbages, and a couple of turnips, for
                        which, of course, I had also to pay. The chief's wife was got up for the
                        occasion. She had a silver plate as big as a bread plate resting on the top
                        and another attached to the back of her head. She also wore long earrings of
                        silver, inlaid with coral.”</p>
                    <p>The power of the priest was apparent on every side. “The lamaseries are
                        gigantic trade concerns, and their practical monopoly account to a great
                        extent for their wealth ; but they have other sources of income. The
                        personal belongings of every Tibetan layman fall, at his death, to the
                        lamasery. A Tibetan in financial difficulties goes to the lamasery, which is
                        only too willing to lend at exorbitant interest. Failure to pay interest and
                        repay the loan, lands the debtor and his land in the hands of his creditor,
                        and whole families become what is called ‘Lama sen poh haing’— Lamasery
                        people—in other words, slaver.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hosie expresses admiration for the Tibetan. “But,” he goes on to say, “if
                        one admires the man, how much more the woman ? ln a land where each family
                        devotes one, or even two, of its sods to the priesthood, female infanticide
                        is unheard of, and woman is a very valuable asset She is the life, the main
                        spring of the Tibetan household. She milks the cattle before they are sent
                        out to graze in the early morning, and on their return in the evening. This
                        done, she slings the empty wooden water butt, some 2 1/2 feet long by 18
                        inches more in diameter, on her back, and runs off to the nearest stream for
                        the days water supply. She prepares the food, she weaves the cloth, and she
                        attends to the many other duties of the household, besides engaging. when
                        necessary, in the usual outdoor work of the farm. Where, too, there are no
                        male members in a family, or when they are otherwise employed, she
                        accompanies the transport animals as a driver, and sees that they are
                        properly cared for."</p>

                    <p>ENTHUSIASTIC SPBECHB8.</p>
                    <p>Appended is a report of the speeches deli vered at the Guildhall :</p>
                    <p>The Lord Mayor : Your Excellency, my lords, ladies, and gentlemen—I feel
                        confident that in submitting as the first toast at this historic gathering.
                        ‘The Health of his Gracious Majesty King Edward, with that of her Majesty
                        Queen Alexandra,” I suggest a sentiment which will meet with the warm
                        appreciation of our gallant visitors and the affectionate regard of his
                        Majesty’s devoted subjects. It will always be remembered that it was King
                        Edward’s visit to France, soon after his accession, which intensified those
                        feelings of mutual esteem and goodwill between the people of two countries.
                        (Cheers.) That his Majesty takes the keenest interest in the presence of the
                        magnificent French fleet at Portsmouth is evident to us all, and I am
                        certain that our distinguished guests will join us in drinking his Majesty’s
                        health, with that of his gracions Consort, with all that regard and
                        consideration which, we know, are entertained for them in every part of the
                        world. I give you with deep respect “The Health of his Gracious Majesty the
                        King and her Majesty Queen Alexandra.” (Cheers.)</p>
                    <p>The toast was heartily honored, and the National Anthem played. </p>
                    <p>The Lord Mayor next said : I now rise to invite your acceptance of a
                        toast,which will be received, as it deserves to be, with unlimited
                        enthusiasm by this distinguished company— “The Health of the President of
                        the French Republic.” (Loud cheers). It is just two years since we had the
                        honor of receiving M. Loubet in this ancient hall, and of tendering to him
                        the respectful welcome of the citizens of London on his auspicious visit to
                        the British capital. Since then, the President—equally with our own King—has
                        done everything in his power to increase the feelings of friendship which
                        have existed between the two nations. (Cheers). I ask you to drink his
                        health to day, not only as the first citizen of that great Repu-blic of
                        which all our guests are sous, but as one whose interesting and
                        distinguished personality and brilliant career have greatly impressed the
                        people of this oonntry, I propose “The Health of the President of the French
                        Republic.” (Cheers).</p>
                    <p>The toast having been drunk, and “La Mar-seiliaise” rendered.</p>
                    <p>The Lord Mayor said: I have now the honor to propose the toast of the day—'
                        The French Navy”—(loud cheers)—with the health of the admirals and officers
                        who are our most welcome guests on this interesting occasion. (Cheere.) In
                        the name of my fellow-citizens, I tender to our gallant and distinguished
                        visitors the warmest salutations of the City of London, and I assure them
                        that their visit to us will be a lasting memory iu our national and civio
                        history. (Cheers.) I convey to them the sincere thanks of the City for the
                        truly fraternal reception which they so hospitably accorded to the admirals,
                        officers, aud men of the British squadron on their recent pleasant sojourn
                        in French waters—(cheers)—and I trust that during their visit among us those
                        attentions will be so cordially reciprocated that they may be tempted to
                        come to England again at shorter intervals. (Renewed cheers) The French and
                        British Navies have in the past so often been united, both in peaceful
                        demonstrations and in active alliance against injury and wrong, that they
                        know by this time the importance and advantage of friendly and harmonious
                        cooperation. The presence of our gallant visitors here to-day, will, we feel
                        sure, tend to cement and intensify the happy relations which prevail between
                        the two nations—(hear, hear)—and which, ever continuing, will contribute to
                        their mutual prosperity in those glorious paths ot peace and progress in
                        which, by God’s blessing, they may be permitted to tread. I give you ‘’The
                        French Navy,” and the health of the French admirals and officers, and I will
                        ask Admiral Caillard to favor us by replying. (Load cheers.)</p>
                    <p>Admiral Caillard, who met with an ovation upon rising, said :</p>
                    <p>“ L’accueil si bienveillant que Sa Majesté le Roi a bien voulu faire à

                        Hôtel de Ville on the National Fête day, and all Portsmouth and his wife are
                        on the tiptoe of expectation. They want to see the Frenchmen. The mottoes,
                        mostly on banners strung across the streets or in shop windows, are not all
                        worthy of record. One is, however, and it runs as follows : “Touts nos
                        cigarettes sont fait par la main du meilleure tabac de Turc et havanè et
                        sont guarantee de convene a toute fur-meure de cigarettes.”</p>
                    <p>French everywhere, except at the Post Office. There a notice is posted on one
                        of the doors to the effect that this is the “entranoe for the Channel Fleet
                        and Cruiser Squadron's mails.” It has hardly been posted on the door when
                        two vaguemestres turn up. They look at the building and one of them remarks
                        : “This most be le postofees “Effectively, it must be,” replies bis comrade.
                        Then, of a sudden, their eye fetches the notice, and both of them ejaculate
                        : "Nous y sommes.” They are taken in charge by a crowd which surrounds them,
                        and offers them everything from a cigarette to an invitation to a prayer
                        meeting. They aooept innumerable cigarettes. They are the vanguard Later on
                        the Mathurins begin to pour into the’ town, “in tow” of friendly
                        bluejackets, who assure them that the “ongtente is all right, wee wee,” and
                        show them about. Very well do they get on together. In one shop, where
                        threepenny packages of cigarettes are being sold to the poor foreigner for a
                        shilling, Jack interferes forcibly and successfully, explaining to the
                        vendor of tobacco that they do not want to spend all their money in tobacco.
                        “They are’ ere to drink our ’ealths,” he says, and at an early hour of the
                        next day Jack and Mathurin are “cruising” together all over the street,
                        which is long, but not broad enough. They stumble over a peel of some kind
                        into tbe road, and then pick themselves ap. “Vive l’ongtente!” says Jack;
                        “Vive le Roi Edouard:” says his companion. The Frenchman kisses his cicerone
                        on both cheeks, and his friend slaps him on the back and ejaculates : “Good
                        old crapow !” The “ongtente” is almost spoilt by this allusion to a certain
                        “Johnny Crapaud,” but a deus ex machina comes to the rescue, and all is
                        well. “Me will go to glory,” says another Mathurin, and an intelligent
                        Marine interprets that he wants to go to the “Glowar,” and he is accordingly
                        oonveyed to the Gloire.</p>
                    <p>If the sergeant is the backbone of the British Army, the sous-officiers and
                        the warrant officers occupy the same position in the two Navies now
                        fraternising. They are a fine lot of men, They meet at the dinner table,
                        they visit the Vernon and Whale Island, and all the time they compare notes,
                        and intelligently at that At the dinner at the Central Hotel tbe speeches
                        are not “lip-talk,” for they come as unmistakably from French and English
                        hearts as they do from French and English lips. Mr. George Jeans, chief
                        gunner, drinks to the health of the “gallant President Loubet and of the
                        whole French nation.” He is glad to see “such a fine lot of oomrades of the
                        sea.” Mr. Mulligan, a rollicking Irishman of the purest Milesian type,
                        assures the guests that although they are men of war they are men of peace,
                        and that never will there by any clash of arms between them. Mr. J. Manners
                        gives expression to equally peaceful sentiments, and all of them are
                        rewarded with a triple banc, onr English “tiger.” The French form of
                        applause takes the shape of a dapping of hands in one, two, three, thrice
                        repeated. If they have understood ’tis because Mr. Charles Pallot, another
                        gunner, has translated the speeches for their benefit sentence by sentenoe.
                        An intermmezzo happens during the dinner. There is a skirl of the pipes, and
                        a fife and drum band more or lees harmoniously playing together “Bonnie
                        Laddie.” They are followed by a crowd of English and French sailors bound
                        for the Empire Palace of Varieties, where one of the best entertainments it
                        has been the fortune of the writer to witness is provided for them. It is up
                        to date, for the visitors am shown a counterfeit prient meut of themselves
                        entering the motiohall. They are very enthusiastic over the show, and vow
                        that it is better than in Paris, where they say that there are “too many
                        women who cannot sing, but no oomedians like the English.” The biograph
                        reproduces the French and British warships, and the French ships are loudly
                        commented on thus : “The Gloire, onr best orniser ! The Admiral-Anbe the
                        ship, such a bon capitaine ! Ah, here is onr Bouvi-nes, avec lee hommes qui
                        passent à la bande (dressing ship) 1” They leave the music-hall to go back
                        on board and then comes a shaking of hands, which would tire out the
                        occupant of the White House in Washington. Men, women, and children eeem to
                        be anxious to grasp a French hand. “You are such a polite nation,” kindly
                        says a French aoua-offioier. To the ladies, old and young, who press forward
                        they say by way of greeting : “Oh, yes. English meet, fore he’s a jolly good
                        fellow I They have been taught this by some wag, and conscientiously do they
                        repeat it Two French sons-officiers play a prominent part in tbe
                        festivities. One is M. re Roland, who sincerely believes that “Brest and
                        Portsmouth have created a strong and endurable entente oordiale, owing to
                        King Edward and his gracious Queen.” The other is M. Levecher, an old
                        sailor, a very old sailor, who, when on Whale Island, shows one and all how
                        guns were handled in the old days. He is a link with the past, but full of
                        life, and he sings a few comic songs, which “bring down the house,” which
                        would not understand them but for his gestures. Whale Island excites genuine
                        admiration. They have Toulon, but Toulon cannot be oompared with Whale
                        Island, çer tainement non. This is not a mere vain compli ment. It is
                        "Justice” to say this. ‘There is no harm in telling la vérité vrais." Mr.
                        George Wright, the oldest torpedo gunner in the British Navy, does the
                        honors of the Vernon, and he and the other veteran, M. Leveoher,</p>
                    <p>'exchanged notes,” and discovered that the sea is as small as the earth, and
                        that they met “out in China” once. Altogether French and English have met in
                        a manner which will have a lasting effect. It is an entente cordiale. O</p>

                    <p>PROSPECTING WORK AT ERIDIA.</p>
                    <p>Eridia is situated about fifty miles west of Keneh, a large native town on
                        the Nile, some fear hundred miles south of Cairo, and was chosen as a mining
                        site by Mr. C. J. Alford in his 1895 expedition.</p>
                    <p>A supply of water is obtained from an old well which was reopened by the
                        company last year ; Qiia supply’ could be supplemented if required from
                        several rock pools near by ; there is every reason to believe that this was
                        the well used by the ancient Egyptian miners.</p>
                    <p>Geology.—The vein lies in what maybe termed an island of “green” rocks in a
                        sea of “red” granite ; the “green” rooks consist of an igneous mass of gray
                        granite, intersected in all directions by dykes of greenstone. In places the
                        doleritic greenstones so largely predominate that the granite can hardly be
                        observed. In association with these veins or dykes there occur veins and
                        coatings of green epidotes, and where there is much of this mineral the
                        surrounding rock is much decomposed, and seems to show signs of sol-factaric
                        action. The red granite consists almost entirely of quartz and pink felspar,
                        while the grey granite is of the hornblende biotito variety. The greenstone
                        is believed to be olivine dolerite. The junotion of the pink and grey
                        granite is generally aline of softness, and consequently is often hidden by
                        being at the bottom of a wady, but occasionally a perfectly sharp junction
                        may he seen. In other places great metamorphism is observable, and it is
                        hard to say where one ends and the other begins.</p>
                    <p>In the grey granite there are also dykes of dark red quarts felsite ; these
                        are not nearly so common as the doleritio dykes, but they are generally of
                        great length and persistence. In the pink granite there are a large variety
                        of dykes, the commonest being the quarts felsite or porphyry, less commonly
                        the dolerite, and occasionally some very beautiful porphy-ritio rooks. These
                        dykes are nearly all harder than the surrounding rocks, and so stand up as
                        great ridges and walls. As regards tbe relative age of these rocks, a place
                        was observed near Eridia, where the evidence semrd especially dear : at the
                        jonction ot the pink and grey granite, a quartz vein running in the latter
                        was completely cut off by the former ; further along the junction is a
                        lensshaped mass of quarts felsite separating tbe red acd grey granite, and
                        having apparently oome up between them. The dark green stones seem to out
                        through everything, but occasion ally they are out by the quarts porphyry.
                        This, then, gives the order as follows, beginning with the newest (1) Dark
                        doleritic greenstone : (2, Quarts felrites and porphyries (3) Red granite.
                        (4) Dark hornblende biotits granite. It is only in the latter that the
                        quartz veins carry gold, those in red granite being invariably barren. The
                        main veins run for close on a mile nearly due north and south, and over the
                        entire length have been worked by the ancients, some of the upper slopes
                        being still open fer a depth 6f 30 ft. to 40 ft., but the lower ones are
                        filled in. with rubbish. The dip averages 80 degrees and the quartz has been
                        taken ont to a width of over 4 ft in some plaoes, the walls being left
                        perfectly clean and smooth. At the north end the vein lies between firm
                        walls of granite, hut at the southern end one wall is of intrusive
                        greenstone and the sides show considerable signs of motion and crushing. The
                        quartz varies from being fresh, unaltered and hard, to broken and decomposed
                        ; the richest quartz was found to be stained a dark red heather colour along
                        the cracks, due to an oxide of iron. At the extreme south end of the vein
                        this hematite forms a considerable layer on one side of the quartz, which is
                        much decomposed, the rook on each side being full of pyrites.</p>
                    <p>Method of Working.- practioally all the quartz has been removed from the vein
                        to a considerable depth, below the surface, so that although the rich chutes
                        could not be found by assaying, it was very evident, from the amount of
                        stuff thrown put, which were the rich places and which barren. Therefore two
                        shafts were sunk, one vertical in the rock, one along the vein through the
                        old workings, and crosscuts were started to out the vein at two points
                        between the shafts. The vertical shaft has so far proved the quicker and
                        cheaper, as the other shaft in the old workings has been considerably
                        delayed by the rotten nature of the ground, and had to be lined with masonry
                        for the first 60 ft. In the inclined shaft two sets of rails were put in and
                        self-tipping trucks need. The workmen are chiefly fellaheen, but a fair
                        number are Bedouins of the following tribes : from the north, Masse and
                        Soubahi ; from the south, Ababdeh and Bishareen. They are generally paid by
                        piecework, at the rate of one piastre for 6 in. drilled, the average earning
                        for a good driller being eight piastres—Is. 8d. per day. The rates of pay
                        per day are as fellows: Forge boy, P.T. 4 ; unskilled labourer P,T. 6 ;
                        skilled labourer P.T. 8 ; carpenter P.T. 12 ; overseer and blacksmith P.T

                    <p>The Native Miners - The natives are, as a rule, very willing and quick to
                        leave and soon become excellent miners. The Bedouins are particularly
                        fearless and may always be relied</p>

                    <p>upon at a pinch Occasionally, contracts were given at rates varying from 15s.
                        to 1 per foot, driven 6ft. by 4 ft in the granite with dynamite supplied
                        free, and measurements were taken once a week, but the former methods was
                        found more satisfactory,although involving extra work in measuring np every
                        day. The rate of advance in the cross-outs varied from 2 ft. per week in the
                        hardest dykes to 9 ft. per week in the granite. Three shifts of eight hours
                        each were employed in most places, and the holes were blasted once a day, as
                        a rule just about sunrise, this being the coolest time of the day, and the
                        ventilation consequently heat The temperature in a drive 20ft long at a
                        depth of 60 ft averaged 90 degrees,and as the temperature of the air above
                        ground was gene-rally over 100 degrees during the summer efficient
                        ventilation became difficult To anyone going underground the temperature
                        seemed far higher than above ground,owing to there being a slight percentage
                        of moisture in the air underground. In assaying, the following charge suits
                        well :—Ore 500 grs. red lead 250 gra., argol 60 grs., iodium carbonate 800
                        grs. The gold always ocours free and is often visible. Where there is much
                        galena and pyrites the value is generally low. A very good approximation to
                        the vaine of a sample could always be obtained by panning a 5 lb. sample of
                        the ore crushed to 20 sieve and judging from the length of the tail.</p>

                        pointed out the hardships entailed upon these people by this enforced
                        detention, and also mentioned that one of them had died.</p>
                    <p>Your Lordship was good enough to say, in reply, that a copy of my
                        communication had been sent to his Majesty's Minister at Brussels.</p>
                    <p>I have today received a further letter from Mr. Scrivener, dated June 25, to
                        the effect that the native witnesses aforesaid were still detained at Boma,
                        which, it may be pointed out, is hundreds of miles distant from their homes
                        round Bolobo. Mr. Scrivener says</p>
                    <p>“The Basengele witnesses are still at</p>
                    <p>Borna. Yet another death has occurred amongst them, and I fear, from reports,
                        that another has died since my correspondent last wrote me. Some of them are
                        eking out their rations by cutting firewood in the neighbouring jungle and
                        selling it. I wrote to the Director of Justice on May 10, imploring him to
                        use his best endeavours to release them and send them back to their
                        homes.</p>
                    <p>“For their relatives the suspense is most trying. All sorts of unfounded
                        rumours reach the latter, and whole villages are wailing for days. The other
                        day men came here at noon from a distant village, having walked all night,
                        to ask for confirmation of some rumour. I mention this to show the great
                        unrest this miserable business is caus-ing. The suspicion with which the
                        natives begin to look upon me for the part I took in sending down the
                        witnesses is very distressing.”</p>
                    <p>I venture respectfully to suggest that very earnest representations are
                        called for in connection with this matter, which is not the first of its
                        kind it has been my duty to place before your Lordship. It is one in which
                        the personal reputation of the members of the Commission of Inquiry is
                        morally involved, together with the good faith of the British missionaries,
                        in the eyes of the native population. It is merely necessary in this
                        connection to point out that the British missionaries gave every assistance
                        to the Commission, and, folly trusting in the power of the Commission to
                        secure just treatment to witnesses, encouraged natives to lay their
                        greivances undeservedly before it.</p>
                    <p>The impartiality displayed by the Commissionners in hearing the evidence laid
                        before them disposes of any suggestion that the treatment which has since
                        been meted out to native witnesses would have their approval were they on
                        the spot. But in, the events which have taken place since its departure,
                        proof is supplied of the powerlessness of the Commission to inculcate
                        elementary notions of the requirements of justice among those into whose
                        hands the fate of the native populations of the Congo has been committed. If
                        even native witnesser,needed for the prosecution of judicial inquiries into
                        peculiarly atrocious cases of crime, alleged against white men,and,
                        therefore, supposedly under the protection and guarantee of the law, can he
                        treated thus, there can he no cession for surprise that the system of forced
                        rubber production, and all the horrors which that system entails, should
                        still be—as is reported from reliable and true worthy sources—in full swing
                        in the Upper Congo.</p>
                    <p>If it were the deliberate intention of the executive authorities in the Congo
                        to discourage further evidence of atrocities being brought forward by the
                        natives, and to create in the mindes of the natives a feeling that they have
                        but increased their miseries by taking the advices of British missionaries
                        and testifying before the Commission of Inquiry, no policy could be more
                        fittingly calculated to bring about those results than the one which is
                        being followed at the present time. I have the honour to be, my Lord, Your
                        Lordship's obedient servant, August 6, E.D. Morn, Hon. Sec. </p>
