                    <head>Army Reform</head>
                    <p>It is the opinion of many thinking soldiers, who observed with discernment
                        the trend of public feeling after the war in South Africa, that a golden
                        opportunity was then lost by the Government, and that, if we had possessed a
                        leader alert at the time to observe and resolute to seize the chances that
                        were offered, the British Army would not now have been in a situation which
                        we have all to deplore. Instead of being the Army accura-tely described by
                        Lord Roberts as unfitted for the purposes of a great war, it would have been
                        a force engaged in embodying and training a new Army based upon the
                        universal training of the nation. What is it that gives the British Empire
                        its weight in the councils of Europe at the present time—upon what do the
                        groupings of foreign politicsnow chiefly turn? That weight is gained from,
                        and those groupings turn upon the strength and efficiency of a great Navy
                        built up and organised to a specific and known purpose, with the effort of a
                        consistent and unchanging policy. Wherein, on the other hand, lies the
                        weakness that endangers our position, and that menaces us with the gravest
                        danger that can ever threaten any 8tate? State weakness lies in the failure
                        to provide an Army adequate for the enormous demands which may be summed up,
                        as a standard of strength, in the defence of Afghanistan against a
                        first-class military Power—a defence, be it remembered, to which we are
                        pledged. Bismarck is credited with having made the cynical but sagacious
                        remark that “les faibles sont faits pour etre manges par les forts,; and
                        little as we may like the brutality of such statements, they are
                        demonstrably and palpably true. There can be no further excuse,
                        therefore,for ignoring the Empire’s need, which, as Lord Roberts said at the
                        Mansion Housed is the sufficiency and organised efficiency of the armed
                        forces to undertake a prolonged war in support of our national interests
                        against a great Power. This we may describe as the root problem now before
                        the Government. It cannot be solved in the imminent breach. It must be
                        solved now, once and for all.</p>
                    <p>Ministers should not cherish any feeble illusion on this matter. Their
                        proposals have so far touched only the outermost fringe of a great subject,
                        but their opportunity is not altogether lost We do not believe it to be the
                        settled mind of the British public to reject a doty assumed by every other
                        great people. Englishmen are awakening to the national need. Let the
                        Government, therefore, go to the country with the great demand. They will,
                        at least, have acquitted themselves of a supreme duty, and have brought
                        universal service into the domain of practical politics. They have a case
                        that is unassailable. They have endeavoured without success to make an Army
                        out of what we already possess, and, failing, they ask for more. They have
                        the teaching of all history, and all experience to prove that only the
                        strong are secure. It is not a vast standing Army that we require. Invasion
                        we do not contemplate, but, with a trained nation, all fear of descents on
                        our shores would disappear. If we had the Army of our need there oould be no
                        questioning of the attitude of France at the present hour. France and
                        England, equally strong at sea and on land, could defy aggression, and
                        impose peace upon the world. With an Army based upon universal servioe we
                        should possess that power of military expansion which would enable ns to
                        mobilise reserve after reserve, strengthening and reinforcing the regular
                        forces in any part of the world, until the will of the nation was
                        enforced.</p>
                    <p>Though Lord Roberts has given the weight of his high authority to the demand
                        for an army capable of indefinite expansion, as he told his hearers at the
                        mansion House,</p>
                    <p>neither the Royal Commission nor other endeavours have so far had any real
                        effect. We do not desire to see Army matters made an affair of party
                        politics, but it seems to us dangerous to wait for any slow movement of
                        public opinion, and we see no other way than for the Government to take the
                        country into its confidence. They can admit their errors as readily as Lord
                        Roberts admitted, at the Mansion House, the he made in recommending Mr.
                        Brodrick to open three years’ recruiting. The primary consideration must be
                        the Regular Army, brought up to adequate strength by proper treatment, with
                        the great reserve of officers upon which we insisted last week, and the
                        importance of which Lord Roberts has since enforced. Then would come the
                        universal training of the people, and, as the Field-Marshal said, a
                        necessary part of any scheme would be the training of all boys aud youths,
                        up to the time of their reaching the military age, in drill and
                        rifle-shooting. The subsequent training would not be burdensome. It might
                        take the form of periods of embodiment in a reorganised Militia, after which
                        men would be drafted to the reserve of the Army, with liability to serve in
                        great national emergencies. Lest it never be forgotten that these reserve
                        troops would not be put,in the field at the first outbreak of war, They
                        would be embodied for training, and be despatched to the front as
                        reinforcements, just as the Japanese have despatched their reserve men to
                        Manchuria. There would be a great demand for officers, but the organisation
                        of the men would be easy. The system could be in-troduced gradually. It
                        oould begin with training in schools; it could be continued with boys’
                        brigades and cadet battalions ; it could be extended by embodiment in the
                        Auxiliary Forces ; and afterwards, if necessary, could be completed by
                        definite territorial organisation with permanent cadres. The opportunity now
                        arises for placing this great issue before the country. It is not
                        conscription that is required, but merely a system of individual training
                        throughout the nation, and we hope the Government will recognise and
                        proclaim the necessity.</p>

                    <p>question of indemnity.</p>
                    <p>REFERENCE TO ST. PETERSBURG PROBABLE.</p>
                    <p>Portsmouth (N.H.), August 17.</p>
                    <p>It is expected that Article IX. which refers to the question of indemnity
                        will come up today. It will probably be necessary to refer the matter to St
                        Petersburg.</p>
                    <p>Russia by accepting Articles VII. and VIII. surrenders every vestige of
                        ambition in Manchuria, and closes the door upon her scheme for possessing
                        Dalny, upon which she spent millions, as a port free from ice.</p>
                    <p>She retains only a non-military line connecting her European possessions with
                        the maritime provinces ou the Pacific.</p>
                    <p>The Conference discussed the article relating to the indemnity all the
                        morning, but failed to arrive at any agreement It was therefore laid aside
                        and the question of the surrender of the interned warships was proceeded
                        with. (Æ.)</p>
                    <p>Portsmouth (N.H.), August 17, The Conference has agreed to Articles VII.</p>
                    <p>and Vlll. in reference to the Chinese railway, with the exception of one
                        point which requires special study. (Reuter)</p>
                    <p>Portsmouth (U.S.A.), August 17. Article VII. has been adopted, and also</p>

                    <p>Riot at Beyrout.—We hear that an affray recently occurred at Beyrout in which
                        one man was killed on the spot and two severely injured. Something like a
                        panic occurred among some of the merchants of the town, but order was
                        quickly restored by Khalil Bey, the energetic Albanian governor of the town,
                        and no further disturbances are anticipated.</p>

                        constructing new barracks etc. behind the Polygon. No decision is to be made

                    <p>Cairo Weather.—There has been a great and appreciable change in the weather
                        at Cairo lately. For about a week the intense heat, which was experienced in
                        the beginning of August, has given way to a much pleasanter temperature, and
                        the nights are especially cool and refreshing, the difference between the
                        day and night readings of the thermometer being as much as 30 degrees
                        Fahrenheit.</p>
                    <p>Sad Death at Mex.—A European woman, of the name of Mrs. L. Demech, whilst
                        bathing at Mex yesterday afternoon, was suddenly seized with an attack of
                        syncope. Her daughters, who had accompanied her, and several other bathers
                        went to her assistance and succeeded in getting her ashore and into the
                        bathing cabin, but unfortunately she never recovered consciousness and died
                        in half an hour. The body of the deceased was taken to the Deaconness’s
                        Hospital for the holding of an autopsy. </p>

                    <p>An Ignorant Omdeh.—Anomdeh, ignorant alike of reading and of writing,
                        recently wished to fine a villager who had committed a contravention. He
                        therefore asked a fiki to fill up a form, which was to be sent to the
                        mamour. The fiki was almost as ignorant as the omdeh and copied the printed
                        report form without filling up one of the blanks left in it for the name,
                        date, contravention, and amount of fine, etc. The mamour was not a little
                        amused by the receipt of this product of the omdeh’s ignorance and the
                        fiki’s smattering of knowledge. ; </p>
                    <p>Alexandria's Boot-Blacks.—A month or so ago a protest appeared in our columns
                        against the granting of boot-blacking licences to other than native boys.
                        Attention chiefly drawn to the large number of Greeks, many of them big,
                        hulking specimens of their race, who adopted this calling as a method of
                        living, and the Greek Diplomatic Agent has since turned his attention to the
                        matter, A number of cases were investigated and the Cairo authorities
                        arrived at the conclusion that such an occupation was unfit for men who were
                        themselves in some cases “undesirables.” The necessary steps were taken and
                        the boot blacking trade is now confined entirely to native boys in Cairo.
                        Will not Alexandria follow Cairo's example? It is not a pleasant sight to
                        see a large number of strong and able-bodied men wasting their lives in a
                        boy's work of cleaning boots, and Greeks, Italians, Arme-menians, Levan tmes
                        and Natives are to be of Alexandria, in very large this calling. The remedy
                        we hope to see the authorities act upon our suggestion. </p>

                    <p>AN OFFENSIVE Effendi. </p>
                    <p>From further details that we have received it appears that the recent affray
                        between an Italian gentleman and certain employée of the Customs
                        Administration was caused by the brutal and offensive conduct of an effendi,
                        one Ali Sabit, who attempted to force his way into the bedroom of Mme
                        Baiocchi, an Italian lady, who had come to Port Said for a change of air,
                        and whose relations, with whom she stayed during the day, had found her a
                        furnished room in a pension in the Rue Eugenie. Some Englishmen staying in
                        the pension quickly intervened, and suppressed the effendi, and the husband
                        of the insulted lady hastened down from Cairo to demand an explanation of
                        his offensive and ungentlemanly conduct. The effendi answered his questions
                        with such insulting nonchalance that M. Baiocchi boxed his ears, whereupon a
                        number of porters and nondescripts fell on him, and beat and bound him. M.
                        Baiocchi complained to the Italian Consulate, which, very properly,
                        protested most vigorously, and was supported by the Italian Diplomatic
                        Agency, and the effendi has been reduced in rank. He is said to have been
                        transferred to Alexandria, while M. Baiocchi is reported to be bringing an
                        action against him, and against the Port Said Customs.</p>
                    <p>CAIRO KHEDIVIAL BOURSE.</p>
                    <p>We are informed that the Council of Administration of the Cairo Bourse, in
                        conjunction with the Association des Courtiers en Valeurs have decided upon
                        the erection of a new exchange, failing to find for renting suitable and
                        centrally situated premises to accommodate the large and constantly
                        increasing number of members, which at present is about 250. The cost of the
                        new premises is estimated at £60,000 to £80,000, inclusive of the cost of
                        site and furnishing. The present bourse buildings in the sharia El Maghraby,
                        which belong to the family of the late Mr. Ed. Manuk, are held on a six
                        years’lease of which two years are expired, but the committee have the right
                        of vacating them during the unexpired period on giving one year’s notice, or
                        paying rent for that period. At we have mentioned in a previous article no
                        site has yet been acquired for the new bourse, and no decision is expected

                    <p>THE NILE FLOOD.</p>
                    <p>Following the publication of the report of Mr. Webb in this year’s probable
                        low Nile, the Ministry of Public Works requested the Ministry of the
                        Interior a few days ago to issue the necessary instructions to the Mondir of
                        Gizeh Province and the Moudirs of Upper Egypt, as well as to the Inspectors
                        of the latter Ministry, to give every facility to the officials of the
                        Irrigation Department in carrying out the requisite measares for the
                        protection of the crops, and also to take the same precautions as were taken
                        during the low floods of 1899 and 1902, in both of which years a “bad Nile"
                        was declared.</p>
                    <p>THE ROMANCE OF A NATIVE MARRIAGE.</p>
                    <p>Some of our readers will probably recollect how, about this period last year,
                        Cairo was roused out of its usual summer apathy by the news of the elopement
                        of the daughter of a native notable with the Editor of a well-known
                        vernacular daily paper, and her marriage without the previous consent of the
                        father.</p>
                    <p>The incident caused quite a ferment in Cairene native circles at the time, on
                        account of the social standing of the parties concerned, and culminated in
                        the Mehkemeh Sharieh refusing to recognise the marriage, on the ground that
                        it was contracted without the knowledge of the bride’s father which,
                        according to Mohamedan law, was necessary. This judgment was appealed
                        against, but was upheld by the higher Court. Further interest was revived in
                        the case a few months back by the report that both the lady in question as
                        well as her mother had left the paternal roof and sought refuge in the house
                        of a Princess of the Khédivial family. Within the past few days a report was
                        circulated that a reconciliation had taken place between the Sheik Ali
                        Yussef, the editor of the vernacular sheet referred to, and Sheik El Sadaat,

                    <p>El Kaimakam Kennedy Bey, R.E., Director of the Works Department, arrived at
                        Port Sudan on the 29th ult., from Khartoum, via Suez, by the Khédivial Mail
                        steamer Dakahlia, on inspection duty, and will shortly return to Cairo.

                    <p>Mr. Kerr, acting Moudir of Suakin, and Dr. Ibrahim Fehmi, acting S. M. 0.
                        Suakin Moudi-rieh, have been paying a visit of inspection to Port Sudan,
                        where they found everything satisfactory. They returned here on the 4th
                        inst.</p>
                    <p>Binbashi P. C. Lord, R.E, returned on the 8th inst, by the Khédivial mail
                        steamer Missir from England, and left the same day for Railhead to replace
                        Bimbashi Newcombe, R.E, who is at present surveying the Pott Sudan line.</p>
                    <p>POSTAL AND RAILWAY NEWS.</p>
                    <p>A Post office branch has already been opened at Port Sudan, and steps will
                        soon be taken by the Railway authorities to commence the Port Sudan line.
                        The Sudan Government Railways Administration has handed over all the
                        lighthouse material to the Works Department, Port Sudan, who will probably
                        invite tenders for its construction shortly.</p>
                    <p>A HOSPITAL TO BE BUILT.</p>
                    <p>It has been decided to build a special Government hospital which will admit
                        cases of both sexes. The plans have been approved, and the cost of its
                        construction is estimated at L.E. 7,000.</p>
                    <p>COAL FOR THE RAILWAYS.</p>

                    <p> THE WEATHER.</p>
                    <p> The last few days here the weather has been almost unbearable. The
                        sandstorms have been so thick that the sun was hid altogether, and the hot
                        winds have blown as if from a fiery furnace. Yesterday the day was much
                        worse, and a European workman of the Suakin Railway recieved a sunstroke and
                        was taken into hospital. He died a few hours later.</p>

                        great deal of damage to the engine room and the main deck amidships.
                        Assistance was im mediately sent out to her, and at the time of wiring the

                    <p>Sir,—For the benefit of the public, I hope you will be kind enough to give
                        this letter of mine a place in your paper.</p>
                    <p>On my way from Europe to Constantinople I purchased from Cook's office at
                        Vienna a first-class ticket for the Austrian steamer that was to sail from
                        Constantinople for Beyrout on the 1st August, and, according to the
                        published tariff of the Austrian Lloyd Company, I had to pay 303 france
                        (£12.8s. 2d.) for my ticket At Constantinople I met a friend who wished to
                        accompany me to Beyrout, and so I had to get another first class ticket tor
                        him, for which I paid 235 francs at the Austrian Lloyds office at
                        Constantinople, and received ticket No. 547, and in exchange for Cook's
                        Vienna ticket (sea 8,002 No. 12,263} I was given ship's ticket No. 548. I
                        was very much astonished to find such a great difference between the price
                        of the “ first-class ticket charged at Cook’s office and that charged at the
                        Austrian Lloyd's office, and brought the matter at once to the notice of
                        Cook’s agency in Constantinople. I found than Cook’s agent was not
                        astonished at this inexplicable dealing of the Austrian Lloyd Company, and
                        he has made a formal complaint to the Company’s local office, and reported
                        the matter to his head office in London.</p>
                    <p>The S.S. Thalia was to sail on the 1st inst. from Constantinople and we
                        arrived on board an hour before she sailed. The poop deck which is supposed
                        to be reserved for the first class passengers was, soon after the departure
                        of the ship, invaded by the second class passengers, and later on was
                        intruded upon by the third class passengers as well, no notice being taken
                        by the officers of the ships. The grievance increased as the ship continued
                        to touch at' the intermediate ports and take more passengers, but it arrived
                        at a climax at Alexandretta, where the vessel shipped 500 sheep and four
                        boatloads of oxen (100 to 150). The sheep, being placed in a higher category
                        than the oxen, were accommodated on the deck under the "bridge, used till
                        then'by the second class passengers, and the oxen, being classed lower, were
                        given the place of third, class passengers.</p>
                    <p>To find room for the second and third class passengers there was no place on
                        hoard the ship, except the narrow deck space on the sides by the first-class
                        dining saloon, and the poop, and so they were freely admitted there.</p>
                    <p>Not to speak of the sickening smells caused on board by the presence of
                        several hundreds of four-legged second and third class passengers, the first
                        class two-legged passengers were squeezed out of the breathing space in the
                        poop, and had to pass the nights and days in the smothering atmosphere of
                        their cabins, for which, even in the twentieth century, electric fans are
                        considered superfluous by the owoers of the ship.</p>
                    <p>I hope the public will take note of this, and that any unfortunate traveller,
                        who may by circumstances be obliged to travel by the ships of the Austrian
                        Lloyd Company from Constantinople to the ports of the Syrian Coast, must be
                        prepared to face the experiences of the writer —I am, 8ir, etc.</p>
