                    <head>The Railway Report.</head>
                    <p>We return to our review of the report of the Railway Commission and, as
                        promised in our last, we proceed to the consideration of the different
                        departments, their constitution, and their requirements. In the former, the
                        preponderance of and dependence upon the native element occupy so important
                        a place in every department that they claim passing attention, and the fact
                        is emphasised by the opinion expressed by the Commission that many Egyptians
                        are fit to be trained for higher posts thau they now occupy. There is no
                        disguising the tact that training, in the sense intended, has not hitherto
                        been forth-coming in Egypt generally. It never has been possible to
                        introduce the required quantity and quality of experience to educate the
                        people for many of the positions they even now hold in the Government
                        service, and in a case like the one under consideration, a course of
                        education has to be begun, which, under other circumstances, would by this
                        time have been completed and be working automatically. To this want of
                        training of the subordinate staff and consequent pressure of work upon
                        superiors we attribute, in some measure, the praise accorded by Lord Cromer
                        to the handful of officers who have to do the work of the country, and the
                        condemnation, by the Commission, of responsible railway officers for being
                        too little out and about their scattered charges. The cause is one and the
                        same, its removal is necessary in the inte-rests of ail concerned, and we
                        welcome the already visible signs of it in one department of the Railways. </p>
                    <p>In our former article we described the recommendations of the Commission, as
                        we understand them, and accepted, as a necessary conclusion, that if
                        circumstances permit of their being adopted, the necessary efficiency of the
                        Railways and the staff can, in due course, be easily and satisfactorily
                        secured, but in the other event, which deliberately forces itself upon us,
                        we seek for a modified and sufficiently suitable solution where possible. We
                        feel that we can dispose of the management by repeating that it must be the
                        work of one man, and he must be the right one for the position, with all the
                        freedom and power that can be given to him, with full appreciation of his
                        responsibilities, and no misconception as to what he can or cannot do :
                        strong and independent up to the point where he becomes subordinate to
                        higher authority, and not beyond it. Among successes and failures alike, in
                        corresponding but easier positions elsewhere, we know of soldiers, at least
                        one sailor, civil engineers, locomotive, traffic, and accounts railway men,
                        solicitors, and others. Evidently inherent qualities, rather than early
                        training, make the railway manager ; as is the case in so many important
                        administrative positions, opportunity often finds him out. Luck indeed may
                        play its part, but in this case the authorities cannot afford to incur a
                        risk. </p>
                    <p>We will now take up the departments of the Railways in the order given by the
                        Commission—presumably their order of importance in the eyes of railway men.
                        If we interpret correctly what is contained both in the report and its
                        appendices about the Traffic Department, we are forced to the conclusion
                        that it is wanting both in numbers- except in its subordinate staff—and in
                        experience. The subordinate staff is probably “excessive” because it is
                        '‘inefficient,” and this because of the absence of the necessary number of
                        trained superiors. It is safe to say that this sufficiency </p>
                    <cb n="6"/>
                    <p>has never existed, and the present position is due to this long standing
                        fact. The subject of proper traffic management-which includes both
                        “operating” and “commercial -is too important a one to be dropped when shown
                        to be thus wanting. The requirements of safety to the travelling public, the
                        conveniences of trade, and even the development of the country (apart) from
                        that of the Railways) are matters which require immediate attention. </p>
                    <p> As already stated by us, if all other circumstances can be disregarded in
                        securing the necessary standard of efficiency (which probably need not be ‘
                        first class European" any more thau the road itself) the proposals made care
                        certainly secure it, but we think there exists here an alternative worthy of
                        consideration. In the Accounts Department, which we have next to refer to,
                        the plan has been already adopted of temporarily employing an Adviser and
                        the desired reforms seem to be throughly in hand and in course of complete
                        execution. However great the difficulty might be securing the continuous
                        service of a superior traffic officer of proved ability, we are greatly
                        inclined to believe that there would be little or none in finding a Traffic
                        Adviser. Then are many men who, having relinquished active service either at
                        home or abroad, are now sufficiently free, and would, doubtless, be equally
                        ready and fit to accept a similar position to that of the existing Accounts
                        Adviser, and we firmly believe that the Traffic Department could be thus
                        dealt with as readily and completely as the Audit and Accounts, it might be
                        necessary to pay such a man a good salary, and he should, from time to time,
                        be allowed to employ or import whatever officers or subordinates he might
                        require for the special of general education of the staff. Some of these
                        assistants might even have to be brought to the staff for a time, and the
                        Adviser himself might have to return at intervals, but we feel sure that the
                        work could be more throughly, more safely, and with less disturbances, under
                        taken on these lines than upon any others.</p>
                    <p> The Accounts Department has received severe criticism, and in more complete
                        detail than any other. A worse state than existed, or a better method of
                        reform could not well have been described. The absence of any comment by the
                        Commission points to the fact that everything necessary is being provided
                        for, yet we have heard of no disturbance or great changes, and we are glad
                        to see au expression of appreciation of the services of the chief of the
                        Department even when such an unsatisfactory state affairs existed. In the
                        successful treatment of this matter we find sufficient reason suggest its
                        application to the traffic. The Way and Works Department has been condemned
                        in plain terms. We presume it deserves it for is said to possess more than a
                        sufficiency of superior staff. There may have been circumstances which have
                        led to the existing state of affairs, but these the same as in a department
                        which has been starved in the important of improvising staff, and the
                        principle of schooling'' becomes inapplicable. That are excellent men in the
                        Engineering Department is well known, that thoroughly efficient men with
                        railway experience are not to obtain is equally so. The Department evidently
                        has to he thoroughly reorganised, and the sooner the better m view ot the
                        importance expenditure to be entrusted to it. It cannot be a difficult task
                        to any one unconnected with the past. The Locomotive, Carriage and Wagon and
                        Stores Departments escape comment of any serious nature, and under the
                        circumstances they must take it as a compliment. It is quite possible they
                        have been favored by circumstances and that, enabled to possess themselves
                        of the necessary amount of technical experience the right sort, they have
                        been able to second proper organisation and working. But has been done
                        probably in the face of difficulties and to a sufficient extent to escape
                        from the shower of condemnation. Our concluding notice of this report will
                        deal with the recommendations for the expenditure to be increased and the
                        separation of the Port of Alexandria from its present connection with the
                        Railway Administration.</p>

                        of your compatriots in Khartoum, and I shall be glad to do what I can to
                        further any wishes your Holiness may have as to their religious welfare. I
                        trust you will have a pleasant visit to the Sudan. —Sirdar.” to which His
                        Holiness replied by wire : </p>
                    <p>“ His Excellency the Sirdar and Governor General, Kassala—We also sincerely
                        regret to be deprived of the pleasure of personally meeting your Excellency,
                        and to verbally express our admiration for the miraculous progress which is
                        being accomplished, in the cause of civilization in this country, under the
                        grace of God and your wise administration. It would be a breach of duty on
                        our part, were we not to express to your Excellency our entire gratitude for
                        the most kind reception shown us by your representatives at Khartoum, of
                        whom we will always cherish the wannest recollections. The whole Orthodox
                        colony of the Sudan is grateful lor your benevolent esteem as well as for
                        the accomplishment of all their desires, under the paternal care of your
                        Excellency and your Government. To their grate fulness we add our sincere
                        thanks for your Excellency’s benevolent expression that all our desires for
                        their spiritual welfare will have your Excellency’s support. We entreat the
                        Almighty to graciously protect your Excellency, and accord you a long and
                        prosperous life.—Patriarch Photius.” To this the Sirdar replied:- </p>
                    <p>“His Holiness, Patriarch Photius, Khartoum. Your Holiness’ greatly
                        appreciated telegram has given me much pleasure and satisfaction. I very
                        warmly reciprocate the good wishes expressed by your Holiness and the Greek
                        community to the Government and myself, and you may rest assured that the
                        spiritual welfare of the Greek residents in the Sudan will be a matter of
                        sincere solicitude on my behalf. I desire to wish your Holiness and party a
                        safe and comfortable journey to Egypt, and I trust your visit has been in
                        every respect pleasant and agreeable.— Sirdar.” </p>
                    <p>His Holiness has been exchanging visits with the principal Government
                        officials. He also visited the Gordon College, and declared himself much
                        impressed with the labours of the Research Laboratory under, Dr. Balfour,
                        and the solicitude of the authorities in the education of Mohamedan youth.
                        He is deeply impressed with the knowledge that the sacrifice of blood and
                        treasure in the Sudan has not been in vain. In recognition of the
                        earnestness and the valued work rendered by Father Gennadius, the parish
                        priest, and as a compliment to the Greek community, his Holiness has
                        promoted Father Gennadius to be an Archimandrite of the Church. </p>
                    <p>This evening, his Holiness will preside at a community dinner given by its
                        president, Mr. Griva, and to morrow will return to Egypt, visiting, on the
                        way, the Haifa and Assouan Orthodox communities. </p>
                    <p>The ex-Empress Eugenie and suite are expected to arrive here on the 27th
                        inst. and will stay at the Grand Hotel. </p>

                    <p>SIGNORA BELLINCIONI’S FAREWELL.</p>
                    <p>Many were the expressions of regret heard on every side last evening, from
                        the large audience assembled to bid Signora Bellincioni farewell, and to
                        take advantage of the one remaining opportunity of witnessing, once again,
                        her magnificent interpretation of the title rôle in Fedora, a character
                        admirably created by herself, and presented with that delicate perception,
                        and subtle realism, with which all her impersonations are associated. How
                        truly has this great vocalist and tragedienne been named The “Operatic
                        Bernhardt”! Her performance last evening was a veritable triumph, and was
                        greeted with repeated rounds of rapturous applause. </p>
                    <p>Signora Bellincioni leaves Alexandria to-day for Naples, where she will sing
                        at the “San Carlo” for a season, after which she takes up an engagement at
                        the Opera Comique in Paris. We join most heartily with her numerous friends
                        and admirers in wishing her “bon voyage,” and trust that the time may not be
                        far distant when it may be our privilege to welcome her return to
                        Alexandria, and share again in that rich feast of music and art, with which
                        her presence will undoubtedly provide us, </p>

                        administrative, the first under the control of A. Peake Bey, the second

                        at the Collegiate Church of St. George, Jerusalem, gave his first organ
                        recital on the 13th inst. Opening with Mendelssohn’s First Sonata (F minor),
                        Mr. Righton at once satisfied his audience that he was master of his
                        instrument; the pedal passages in the last movement being particularly well
                        played. Bach’s Prelude and Fugue in C minor were taken a little faster than
                        usual, the result being a slight sacrifice of rhythm. In Chopin’s Nocturne
                        in E flat major he was able to bring out the finer points of the instrument,
                        and his delicate handling of this favorite work was a great treat The other
                        items were an Andantino by Lemare, a Cavatina by Carl Bohm, and a Fanfara
                        and March by Lemmons. By special request the programme was repeated on the

                    <p>SERVICE DE LUXE. </p>
                    <p>For several seasons past our winter visitors have been crying out for a
                        regular service between Egypt and Europe, so that, once in Egypt, they could
                        make definite arrangements as to their time of return. Ever since Egypt has
                        been recognised as the winter resort of the world par excellence we have
                        been receiving letters from time to time pointing out that the steady
                        increase in the number of passengers, coming to winter in Egypt every year
                        demanded that something should be done to meet this great want, by supplying
                        a regular service. We congratulate the North German Lloyd’s on the success
                        which their regular weekly service between Marseilles, Naples, and
                        Alexandria has met with. They have selected for this purpose their two
                        first-class ships the “Schleswig” and the “Hohenzollern,” one of which
                        leaves Alexandria each Wednesday at 5 p.m., so that our visitors need no
                        longer wait for steamers arriving at Port-Said from the East at irregular
                        intervals, to take them home. The “Schleswig” and “Hohenzollern” are both
                        first-class ships in every respect. They have a tonnage of 7,000 tons
                        register and 12,000 displacement. We can speak from experience of the
                        cuisine and the service, both of which are of a high order, and everything
                        is done for the luxurious comfort and convenience of the passengers, so much
                        so that there ie nothing to compare between these boats and any of our
                        first-class hotels. The state-rooms are both large and airy and so arranged
                        as to meet every sort of requirement. On each steamer there are four suites
                        of state-rooms; each contains double beds, separate bath-room, lavatory,
                        etc. Our American visitors who have crossed the Atlantic and those who have
                        travelled by the ships of this line already know their good qualities, and
                        we feel sure that this effort of the N. G. L Company on behalf of our
                        visitors will be duly appreciated and will secure for them a large share of
                        patronage. Our European residents will also be glad to learn that the
                        company intend continuing the service of these steamers this year, so that
                        those going hence for their annual holiday will have an opportunity of
                        testing their good qualities. </p>

                    <head>KHÉDIVIAL AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY </head>
                    <p>(From our Correspondent). </p>
                    <p>Tantah, Tuesday. The first meeting of the Khedivial Agricultural Society was
                        held yesterday at Shebin el Kom under the presidency of the Moudir of
                        Menoufieh, who delivered an introductory speech on the main objects of the
                        constitution of the society, pointing out to his many hearers the benefits
                        already derived from it. </p>
                    <p>Mohamed Eff. Hosny, the secretary of the society, then rose and gave his
                        first lecture, dwelling upon the same subject as the Moudir. </p>
                    <p>A large number of notables subscribed to the society and the prospects for
                        the society’s work here seem very bright indeed. </p>
                    <p>CAIRO AGRICULTURAL SHOW. </p>
                    <p>The exhibits of the British Engineering Co. of Egypt, Ltd., at the Cairo
                        Agricultural Show, elicited great admiration and were very interesting. The
                        machinery exhibited consisted of the following :—One double ploughing set of
                        20 N.H.P. with implements, manufactured by Messrs. J. &amp; H. McLaren, of
                        Leeds. This set of ploughing tackle was much admired, especially on account
                        of the depletion of cattle in the country owing to the ravages of the bovine
                        plague. Amongst other ploughing implements shown at work on the 24th inst,
                        at Shoubra, on land belonging to Boghos Pasha Nubar, the McLaren ploughing
                        set gave very satisfactory results, especially the engines, which were
                        pronounced to be the finest ever brought into the country. </p>
                    <p>The British Engineering Co. of Egypt, Ltd., also exhibited one 25 B.H.P.
                        “Invincible" oil engine driving direct a 14 “Invincible” centrifugal pump,
                        manufactured by Messrs. Gwynnes, Ltd., of London. The most noticeable
                        features in this installation were the compactness of the plant, its
                        simplicity, economy, and efficiency. In addition to working a pump direct,
                        this engine was driving by belt an ice machine, manufactured by Messrs. Hall
                        of Dartford. This small machine is capable of producing 9 1/2 cwts. per 24
                        hours. The oil engine was fitted with a friction clutch, so that when the
                        pump was not required to be working, it was provided with a pulley so as to
                        work by belt a 42" single stone mill. </p>
                    <p>The stand of the company was lit by electric light The engine for this was a
                        4 B.H.P. vertical oil motor and a direct coupled dynamo of 3.4. K.W. The
                        company also showed a 2 1/2 B.H.P. oil engine driving direct in one side
                        1.75 K.W. dynamo direct coupled, and on the other side a 3" “Invincible”
                        centrifugal pump, the whole being on one bed-plate. All this machinery was
                        in motion, together with three types of the “Invinoible” centrifugal steam
                        pumping engines, etc. Messrs. Gwynnes Ltd., are the only makers in the world
                        of vertical oil engines and direct coupled centrifugal pumps. </p>

                    <p>The following is the text of the proposed Decree concerning measures for the
                        destruction of the cotton worm:— </p>
                    <p>Nous, Khédive d'Egypte, vu le rapport présenté par la Société Khédiviale
                        d'Agriculture ; sur la proposition de notre ministre de l’intérieur et lavis
                        conforme de notre conseil des ministres ; le Conseil législatif entendu,
                        décrétons : </p>
                    <p>I. Les feuilles de cotonniers sur lesquelles des œufs de ver de coton
                        auraient été déposés devront être immédiatement effeuillées et brûlées. </p>
                    <p>Lorsque les autorités administratives constatent que ces œufs ont été pondus
                        dans un terrain quelconque planté en cotonniers en nombre suffisant pour
                        constituer un danger public, l’effeuillage et le brûlage des feuilles
                        affectées auront lieu sous la surveillance de ces autorités, et, en cas de
                        besoin, par leurs soins. </p>
                    <p>II. Tout enfant de sexe masculin âgé de plus de 9 ans et de moins de 17 ans
                        révolus pourra, s’il est apte et habitué au travail, être requis par les
                        autorités administratives à l’effet de concourir aux opérations ci-dessus,
                        moyennant un salaire au taux courant dans la localité, qui sera fixé par le
                        mamour-markaz après avoir pris l’avis des membres du comité local de la
                        Société Khédiviale d’Agriculture s’il y en a. </p>
                    <p>III. Avant de procéder aux opérations ci-dessus, les autorités
                        administratives devront s’entretenir avec les propriétaires des terrains en
                        cause, leurs représentants sur les lieux ou les locataires, afin de
                        connaître si ceux-ci veulent s’en charger. S’ils acceptent de s’en rendre
                        responsables, les autorités administratives mettront a leur disposition, le
                        cas échéant, un nombre d’enfants suffisant pour le travail, contre le
                        paiement à ces autorités journellement et d’avance, des sommes nécessaires
                        pour pourvoir à leurs salaires. </p>
                    <p>IV. Si les propriétaires ou locataires ne sont pas en état d’entreprendre les
                        dites opérations ou s’ils refusent ou négligent de les faire, les autorités
                        administratives en dresseront procès-verbal et procéderont elles-mêmes au
                        travail. Dans ce cas, les frais de ces opérations (jusqu’à un maximum de
                        P.T. 20 par feddan) constitueront un droit additionnel gre-vant le terrain,
                        qui sera recouvert suivant les formes en vigueur pour le recouvrement de
                        l'impôt foncier. </p>
                    <p>V. Les autorités administratives pourront être représentées aux fins des
                        dispositions ci-dessus par les omdehs des villages, agissant sous la
                        surveillance des moudirs, gouverneurs et mamours et de tous autres agents
                        désignés à cet effet. Les omdehs seront assistés par les cheikhs-el-balad et
                        les gaffirs. </p>
                    <p>VI. Sera puni d’un emprisonnement ne dépassant pas un mois ou d’une amende
                        n’excédant pas L.E. 2 : </p>
                    <p>1) Celui qui cherche à soustraire un enfant à la réquisition prévue à l’art.
                        2 ; </p>
                    <p>2) Celui qui, chargé de l’effeuillage, du transport ou du brûlage des
                        feuilles, se rend coupable de tout acte de négligence tendant à ce que ces
                        feuilles ne soient pas brûlées. </p>
                    <p>VII. Sera puni d’un emprisonnement ne dépassant pas une semaine ou d’une
                        amende n’excédant par L.E. 1 : </p>
                    <p>1) Tout enfant qui refuse de répondre à la réquisition prévue à l’article 2
                        ou qui cherche à se soustraire ; </p>
                    <p>2) Tout enfant, chargé de l’effeuillage ou du transport des feuilles, qui se
                        rend coupable de tout acte de négligence tendant à ce que ces feuilles ne
                        soient pas brûlées. </p>
                    <p>Tout enfant qui, requis conformément à l’art. 2, refuse de travailler. </p>
                    <p>VIII. Les infractions prévues aux deux articles précédents seront jugées par
                        les tribunaux ordinaires et seront de la compétence des tribunaux des
                        markaz. </p>

                    <head>Guuny Bag Market</head>
                    <p>Schrager Bros., Market Report for the Week Ending February 16. </p>
                    <p>The continued rumours of damage by frost to crops up country, coupled with
                        the easier feeling that prevailed for Jute in the early part of the week,
                        further depressed the Gunny market, which opened quiet after the holidays
                        with prices weaker. </p>
                    <p>The reports that come in are decidedly conflicting, and for the time being
                        have checked speculative buying. Mills however have practically nothing to
                        sell up to June, and although they show rather more desire to work for
                        July/Decr. deliveries, they do not encourage buyers by giving any way in
                        price. </p>
                    <p>Export trade generally continues unsatisfactory and buyers’ ideas are
                        invariably below the current level of prices. There has been some movement
                        in 8 porter twilled goods and the conversion of a fair quantity of 2 1/2 lb.
                        bags into Australian Corn sacks for the Colonies. </p>
                    <p>The Straits have been taking Heavy C bags for Apl/June, but Burmah orders, as
                        also such as have come up from China, are confined to near at hand goods,
                        which for ail descriptions command very full prices. </p>
                    <p>Hessians are again easier and dull of sale. The withdrawal of orders from the
                        market make holders more anxious to dispose of the carry over goods. </p>
                    <p>The decline is not shared by mills to any appreciable extent unless for near
                        at hand. Their forward position remains practically unchanged. </p>

                    <p>(A.) TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT. building Departmental Organisation Subject to such
                        Chief Officer we think that there should be not more than four or five heads
                        of Departments. These Departments would naturally fail into the groups of :-
                        Traffic. </p>
                    <p>Traffic </p>
                    <p>Accounts </p>
                    <p>Way and Works. </p>
                    <p>Mechanical and Electric Engineering. </p>
                    <p>Stores and Purchase.</p>
                    <p> Officers meetings should be held at least monthly at which questions of
                        general interest should be discussed and minuted, and such minutes should be
                        open to the inspection of the Superior Council. </p>
                    <p>We have found that, although such meetings take place subject to the present
                        Board of Administration, there is a want of co-ordination between
                        departments and consequent unnecessary expenditure, and, in our opinion,
                        matters demanding expenditure should always be dealt with and agreed to at
                        such Officers’ meetings, so as to ensure the joint co-operation and
                        knowledge necessary for proper railway working. </p>
                    <p>As regards the detailed organisation of the Chief Departments, we cannot
                        offer suggestions except on those points which have been brought under
                        notice during our tour, as the departmental working can only be
                        satisfactorily dealt with by the head of the department who has daily
                        cognisance of it. </p>
                    <p>But we think that under the new organisation it will be possible to reduce
                        superfluous staff and to allot better salaries to the chief officers. </p>
                    <p>We think that more constant out-door work and inspection is necessary on the
                        part of chief officers, and that, as such out-door work is excessively
                        laborious on railways in Egypt owing to the climate and circumstances, it
                        deserves due remuneration. </p>
                    <p>TRAFFIC DEPARTMENT. </p>
                    <p>This department appears to be under the control of one officer who is
                        assisted by a Goods Manager. </p>
                    <p>There are only three district Traffic Superintendents. one for Lower Egypt,
                        one for Upper to Luxor inclusive) and one (who also takes Locomotive and
                        Engineering) for the Luxor-Assouan division. </p>
                    <p>(The Goods Depot at Gabbary and the Mex line, &amp;c., appear however to be
                        under a separate officer.) </p>
                    <p>There are no recognised District Goods Managers, except one at Alexandria, so
                        that such goods work is either done from headquarters or falls on the
                        movement officers; Cairo, Station and Yard, is said to be worked from
                        headquarters, and not to be under any district. </p>
                    <p>In our opinion Lower Egypt warrants at least two Traffic or Movement officers
                        (under one of which Cairo should be placed) and the very long district from
                        Luxor to Teh-el-Baroud should he shortened, thus enabling the Traffic and
                        Goods Manager at head quarters to free themselves from detailed operation,
                        and to devote their attention to larger matters of principle and to
                        travelling over the Railways. We believe that there is an excessive
                        subordinate staff, and that many Egyptians are fit to be trained up for
                        higher positions than they occupy. The total expense to the country need not
                        be greater, in our view, than at present. </p>
                    <p>RATES AND FARES. </p>
                    <p>We have given some attention to this matter, and in the Appendix certain
                        comparisons with other countries will be found. These can at best be but
                        approximate, since conditions vary in each country, but speaking generally
                        we do not think the goods rates are at all excessive. Nor do we think the
                        first and second class passenger tariffs are too high, but we are inclined
                        to believe that the third class tariffs might be experimentally reduced and
                        the number of passenger trains largely augmented with immediately profitable
                        results when rolling stock is available, since it is clear that the native
                        Egyptian labourer is only just beginning to travel by rail, and that if his
                        average wage is P.T. 4 a day, he cannot afford a rate of mills. 1.25 per
                        kilometre, the average journey in Egypt being 42 kilometres. We think
                        moreover that return tickets for all classes should be instituted when, and
                        as soon as each station is properly fenced, so as to enable a proper control
                        to be exercised against fraud ; and we think that, coupled with these
                        concessions, the plan of carrying animals by all trains should be gradually
                        restricted, their transport being confined, as in other countries, to one or
                        two trains a day. This would greatly lighten passenger trains. </p>
                    <p>The fencing of passenger stations and plat-forms is so important in the
                        interests of public safety and proper working that we think a small legal
                        fine should be imposed on trespassers at such stations. Cheap platform
                        tickets might be introduced for those desiring access to the interior of
                        stations or platforms, and the proceeds given to a Railway servants
                        provident fund. </p>
                    <p>We have elsewhere expressed our opinion that the present working of the
                        signals is not satisfactory and that to avoid the excessive number of
                        accidents, a considerable amount of fencing, as well as the provision of
                        agricultural roads, is needed. </p>
                    <p>ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT. </p>
                    <p>As regards .Engineering, we are of opinion that the engineers’ duties should
                        comprise the safety of the road and bridges, the whole of the signals,
                        —signalling at present is in a most unsatisfactory and even dangerous
                        condition— the plans of new stations, the estimates of new works, including
                        buildings, and generally those matters which are dealt with in other
                        countries under the head of Way and Works. Even with such work efficiently
                        performed, we think the present staff in this Department excessive
                        especially if the more economical form of outside contracts for work is
                        introduced. </p>

                    <p>We understand that the stewards have decided to omit in the programme of the
                        coming racing season all hurdle races. The reason for this is the lack of
                        entries in recent years for this class of racing, and also the fact that the
                        present club grounds do not admit of any adequate space being given up to
                        the schooling of horses over hurdles. </p>
                    <p>The following are the racing fixtures for the season: </p>

                    <p>KHEDIVIAL YACHT CLUB. </p>
                    <p>The annual general meeting of the club was held on Monday night at the
                        Khedivial Club, with H.H. Prince Aziz in the chair. The committee’s report
                        for 1904 was accepted, and the officers and committee were elected for the
                        ensuing year. Questions were gone into as to advisability of making tennis
                        and croquet courts on the ground as joining the club house. It was decided
                        not to establish the tennis court, and as to the croquet lawn, this would
                        depend on the cost of the same. </p>
                    <p>The committee's report will be published in our issue of Saturday next. </p>

                    <p>Dr. Llewellyn Jordan, Medical Examiner of the U.S. Treasury Department,
                        graduate of Columbia College, and who served three years at West Point, has
                        the following to say of Peruna:</p>
                    <p>"Allow me to express my gratitude to you for the benefit derived from your
                        wonderful remedy. One short month has brought forth a vast change and I now
                        consider myself a well man after months of suffering. Fellow sufferers,
                        Peruna will cure you."</p>
                    <p>A constantly increasing number of physicians prescribe Peruna in their
                        practice. It has proven its merits so thoroughly that even the doctors have
                        overcome their prejudice against so called patent medicines and recommend it
                        to their patients. </p>
                    <p>Peruna occupies a unique position in medical science. It is the only internal
                        systemic catarrh remedy known to the medical profession to-day. Catarrh, as
                        everyone will admit, is the cause of one-half the disease which afflicts
                        mankind. Catarrh and catarrhal diseases afflict one-half of the people of
                        United States.</p>
                    <p>Robert R. Roberts, M. D., Washington, D. C., writes: "Through my own
                        experience as well as that of many of my friends and acquaintances who have
                        been cured or relieved of catarrh by the use of Hartmans's Peruna, I can
                        confidently recommend it to those suffering from such disorders, and have no
                        heistation in prescribing it to my patients."--- Robert R. Roberts.</p>
                    <p>Dr. R. Robbins, Muskogee, I. T., writes: "Peruna is the best medicine I know
                        of for coughs and to strengthen a weak stomach and to give appetite. Besides
                        prescribing it for catarrh, I have ordered it for weak and debilitated
                        people, and have not had a patient but said it helped him. It is an
                        excellent medicine and it fits so many cases.</p>
                    <p>"I have a large practice, and have a chance to prescribe your Peruna. I hope
                        you may live long to do good to the sick and the suffering."</p>
                    <p>Dr. M. C. Gee, writes from 513 Jones St. San Francisco, Cal.:</p>
                    <p>"Peruna has performed so many wonderful cures in San Francisco that I am
                        convinced that it is a valuable remedy. I have frequently advised its use
                        for women, as I find it insures regular and painless menstruation, cures
                        leucorrhoea and ovarian troubles, and builds up the entire system. I also
                        consider it one of the finest catarrh remedies I know of."-M. C. Gee, M.
                        D.</p>
                    <p>Catarrh is a systemic disease curable only by systemic treatment. A remedy
                        that cures catarrh must aim directly at the depressed nerve centers. This is
                        what Peruna does.</p>
                    <p>Peruna immediately invigorates the nerve-centers which give vitality to the
                        mueous membranes. Then catarrh disappears. Then catarrh is permanently
                        cured.</p>
                    <p>If you do not derive prompt and satisfactory results from the use of Peruna
                        write at once to Dr. Hartman, giving a full statement of your case, and he
                        will be pleased to give you his valuable advice gratis.</p>

                    <p>(From our Correspondent). </p>
                    <p>London, February 20. Lieutenant Stewart B.B. Dyer, D S.O., 2nd Life Guards,
                        cousin of Sir Thomas S. Dyer, Bart., has been selected for service with the
                        Egyptian Army. Lieutenant Dyer was at tached for some time to the West
                        African Frontier Force and saw service in Northern Nigeria 1900 (mentioned
                        in despatches) and in the Bornu Expedition of 1902 and the operations in the
                        Bassana and Winkum areas in the course of which he was slightly wounded. He
                        was twice wounded in that brilliant campaign of 1903, the Kano-Sokoto
                        Expedition, and there meritoriously earned the D.S.O. and warm mention in
                        despatches. </p>
                    <p>Major Harry F. Pakenham, 1st Battalion King’s Royal Rifle Corps, was married
                        the 7th inst. to Miss May Markham, daughter of the late Colonel Markham,
                        Becca Hall, and spent the first few days of his honeymoon at Folke stone. On
                        the 10th inst. he went out for a walk and mysteriously disappeared.
                        Yesterday his dead body was found in the sea at Folkestone. At the inquest
                        yesterday the Coroner read an extract from a letter found in the overcoat of
                        the unfortunate officer, as follows : “Cannot stand this awful strain, must
                        end it.” The jury found that the deceased had committed suicide whilst
                        temporarily insane. </p>
                    <p>Major Pakenham, who was the son of General T. H. Pakenham, Longford Lodge,
                        near Belfast, was 40 years of age and had seen a lot of active service,
                        including the Hazara Expedition and Miranzi Expedition, 1891, and the late
                        Boer War. In the latter campaign he suffered from enteric fever and was
                        invalided home. Rejoining the 1st Battalion in Malta, he had a severe attack
                        of Mediterranean fever which resulted in a complete breakdown of his nervous
                        system and which in turn led to his untimely end. He was well-known in
                        Egypt, where he had both served and travelled. </p>
                    <p>Captain, G. M. R. A. Swiney has retired from the 20th Hussars, at Brighton
                        (lately at Cairo), to serve with the Worcester Imperial Yeomanry. Captain
                        Swiney spent a little over ten years in the regiment, and served with it in
                        the campaign in Orange River Colony, 1902 (medal with four clasps). The
                        vacancy caused by his retirement has been filled by the promotion to that
                        rank of Captain Herbert Street. Capt Street joined the 20th in December,
                        1893, so that he had the very long period of over eleven years to serve for
                        his third star. He was with the regiment during its service in the
                        Transvaal, Orange River Colony, and Cape Colony (medal with four clasps). </p>
                    <p>Major R. G. Chase, who has just retired from the 1st Battalion Royal
                        Berkshire Regiment, at Dublin, on retired pay, got his first commission in
                        it in October, 1881, shortly after the old 49th and 66th Regiments were
                        amalgamated. The following year he served with the first Battalion in the
                        campaign against Arabi (medal and Khedive’s star) and two years later went
                        through the operations in the Eastern Sudan with the Mounted Infantry
                        Company, including the affairs of Hasheen and Temai (clasps), and he saw
                        further service at Giniss with the Egyptian Frontier Field Force. Major G.
                        H. Arbuthnot, who has got the vacancy, is with the 2nd Battalion at
                        Alexandria. He has close on twenty years’ service in the regiment and holds
                        the medal and Khedive’s star for the frontier operations of 1885-86 and the
                        action of Giniss. </p>
                    <p>The Admiralty programme for the financial year of 1905-06 is a very modest
                        one. It will provide for the construction of one battleship of the improved
                        “King Edward VII.” type,and three very swift and powerfully-armed armoured
                        cruisers. The coming Estimates will be the first ever voluntarily reduced by
                        the Admiralty without pressure from the Treasury. In the present financial
                        year seven new battleships, seven armoured cruisers, and several smaller
                        ships were completed or will be.</p>
