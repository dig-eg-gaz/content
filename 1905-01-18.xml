                            the Baltic Fleet at Madagascar, it is unlikely there will be any further
                            outcome of this feeling, which it is believed was based on a

                            differ totally from the British, since they place no limit on the stay
                            of a belligerent in French ports, unless accompanied by a prize. It is
                            pointed out that the Japanese may enjoy similar advantages at

                    <p> Khartoum, January 9. * During the past two weeks, it seems, a great deal of
                        excitement has prevailed among the officials and employés of both the Sennar
                        and Ghezireh Moudiriehs, on learning that Ghezireh headquarters would be
                        transferred to Wad Medani, which is the most important and populous town of
                        the Sennar Moudirieh. This step, I believe, has been induced by the fact
                        that Ghezireh Moudirich is not large enough and has, moreover, been of late
                        reduced, two important markazes having been taken and added to the new
                        moudirieh, with its seat at Duem, and now called White Nile Province. </p>
                    <p> Sennar Moudirieh headquarters will be transferred to Singa, which town has
                        acquired great importance since the recent outrage which took place there. </p>
                    <p>Two new markazes, it is said, will be created on the Abyssinian boundary. The
                        date whers these changes will be carried into effect has not yet been fixed,
                        but it is presumed that they will take place before next October.</p>
                    <p> Sir Rudolph von Slatin Pasha went to Wad Medani last week and inspected the
                        different tribes of the Moudīrieh, afterwards returning here. </p>
                    <p>Ghezireh Moudírieh is to be called Blue Nile Province, to correspond with the
                        new moudirieh, White Nile Province.</p>

                        that he justifies the present high values of Egyptian securities.
                        Incidentally, when explaining that the return on Egyptian stocks and shares
                        is not attractive enough to draw capital from those who would otherwise

                    <p> LA GIOCONDA. Monday's performance was "frankly uninspiring : the orchestra
                        was as good as it always is and the chorus better than usual, | but the
                        performance of Ponchielli's melodrama, which requires the very best singing
                        and acting to be bearable, in spite of the good points in the second act and
                        the graceful melodic de signs of the "Dance of the Hours," was mediocre. And
                        mediocrity spells boredom ih </p>
                    <p> the case of "La Gioconda." Sig. Nani threw a | certain amount of vigour into
                        his singing : the </p>
                    <p> fine song-in our opinion the best in the | piece Pescator affonda l'esca'
                        was well given </p>
                    <p> and duly encored, and owing to the fact that he acted with power even the
                        dullest scenes in which he appeared were invested with some interest.
                        Artistically the rest were on a different level : Signa. Pinto could not
                        always control a vigorous voice and constantly overcharged it with emotion,
                        with lamentable re. sults. Sig. Bravi was fair, not in the least remarkable,
                        and in consequence &amp; failure, for to make "La Gioconda" interesting
                        throughout the singing and acting must be first-class. The rest were fair
                        and uninspired, and the performance fulfilled our worst fears, a moderate
                        performance of a moderate and melodramatic opera being worse by many degrees
                        than a real perversion of, say, "Lohengrin," assuming that the orchestra
                        plays both equally well. You can always look to the orchestra tor comfort in
                        the latter case, in the former it intensifies your glooma. </p>

                        <p> Sir, -The latter of the chairman of the above institution, which
                            appeared in your columns of the 16th inst., contains several interesting
                            particulars, but it does not furnish quite all the information désired.
                            I would, therefore, ask you, Sir, to grant me space to repeat my
                            unanswered question, and to add a few mote which arise out of his reply
                            : </p>
                        <p>(a). Was it one of the objects of the founders of this hospital to
                            provide accommodation for maternity cases generally, or especially for
                            the wives of soldiers belonging to the Army of Occupation ; and was the
                            fact so stated in the original appeal to the public for contributions ?
                            If such was not the case, when was it publicly intimated that the
                            hospital was to be used for that purpose ?</p>
                        <p> (6). What is the date of the arrangement between the Army of Occupation
                            and the hospital authorities, and when was the public first informed of
                            that arrangement ? </p>
                        <p> (c). For what term does that arrangement remain in force ? Does it
                            empower the hospital authorities to put an end to it before the date of
                            its expiry, and, if so, in what circumstances and upon giving what
                            length of notice ? </p>
                        <p> (d). Does the arrangement assign any limit to the number of maternity
                            cases that the hospital is bound to admit simultaneously? </p>
                        <p>(@). For what period, under the arrangement, are the hospital authorities
                            required to retain maternity cases, and what is the usual time during
                            which such cases remain in the hospital?</p>

   <p> TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE. </p>
                        <p> Sir,—Would it not be within the sphere of operations of the Wakfs
                            Administration to invest some of the funds at their disposal in building
                            dwellings for the labouring classes and other employés, on some of the
                            lands under their control outside the city ? No doubt the Tramway
                            Company would agree to establish a special service for workmen night and
                            morning to meet the requirements of the men, if sites were chosen which
                            their cars could serve. · Such a course would be a desirable one for
                            many reasons ; it would supply a very real want from a sanitary point ot
                            view, and should be profitable, useful, and very popular. </p>

                    <head> THE CHURCH OF ALEXANDRIA. </head>
                    <p> In no province of eastern Christendom is the Church's early history more
                        obscure than in that of Alexandria. Until the middle of the I third century,
                        we have to be content with the meagrest list of names and only occasionally
                        a fuller biographical notice (as in the case of Origen or of Dionysius). And
                        for these scants materials we are indebted solely to Eusebius. The
                        patriarchal chronicle of Severus of Ashmunain, whereof we have the first
                        instalment in "The History of the Patriarchs of the Coptic Church of
                        Alexandria." 1, St. Mark to Theonas (300) (Arabic text edited, translated,
                        and annotated by B. Evetts ; being tome I., fasc. 2, of the Patrologia
                        Orientalis, edited by R. Graffin and F. Nau. Paris. Didot), is, like all
                        similar compilations, dependent, more or less immediately, upon this common
                        source. How many degrees its author is removed from the Greek text has yet
                        to be ascertained. For alI though &amp; Coptic version--and that a very
                        inaccurate one-of the "Ecclesiastical History" has recently been brought to
                        light, we know, from Severus's own words, that he was unable to make use
                        even of this without the further medium of an Arabic translation. From one
                        of the three prefaces which introduce the chronicle, we learn how he
                        laboriously collected his | materials among the monastic libraries of Egypt,
                        and how friends aided him with translations of Coptic as well as of Greek
                        manuscripts. A comparison of the resultant Arabic with the Greek of Eusebius
                        shows, as was to be expected, that successive translations have often taken
                        us a long way from the meaning of the original text. However, it is not as a
                        translator of Eusebius that Severus is of importance : he had access to
                        documents of which not rarely he alone preserves a knowledge, as, for
                        instance, in his account of the patriarch Demetrius; and he drew besides
                        upon sources probably unknown outside Egypt, as in his notices of certain of
                        the Diocletian martyrs, and par </p>
                    <p> ticularly of Peter 1. But the latter bishop | does not come within the
                        limits of the present I fascicule. It is, indeed, on account of the </p>
                    <p> latter periods of his chronicle that Severus so well deserves complete
                        publication. From the Arab invasion till the middle of the ninth century the
                        work is rightly called by his name ; after his death, a hundred years |
                        later, the record is carried on by successive continuators down to the
                        thirteenth century. Throughout all that period we are dependent almost
                        exclusively upon it for information has to the state of the Alexandrine
                        Church, </p>

                    <p>Un cas d'infection*</p>
                    <p>Une nourrice italienne ayant été infectée d'une maladie grave par l'enfant
                        qui lui avait été confiée par un négociant européen de Zagazig, attaqua
                        celui-ci par devant le tribunal mixte' de Mansourah. Elle réclamait une
                        forte some de dommages-intérêts,</p>
                    <p>Après enquête et expertise ordonnée parlui, le tribunal de Mansourah condamna
                        le négociant à payer à la demanderesse 1° une somme de quatre cents livres à
                        titre de réparation du préjudice qu elle a souffert et souffrira
                        personnellement; 2 une autre somme de cent livres pour réparations des frais
                        et honoraires qu'elle a. dû et devra débourser pour le soin de sa santé et
                        la défense de ses droits, avec les intérêts à cinq pour cent du jour de la
                        demande en justice 6 décembre 1900; il condamna enfin le défendeur aux
                        dépens, y compris les frais de I'instance en référé vidée par l'ordonnance
                        etdes expertises auxquelles il avait été procédé IL y eut appel de ce
                        jugement, suivi d'un ar rêt interlocutoire le 13 Janvier 1904, ordonnant une
                        expertise médicale.</p>
                    <p>La Cour, par son arrêt de ce matin, déclare mai fondé l'appel du jugement.
                        Les experts nommés par la Cour confirment pleinement les constatations
                        résultant .des mesures d'instruction ordonnées par les premièrs juges et sur
                        lesquelles ils ont fondé leur décision. Quant à l'appel incident, la Cour,
                        tout en reconnaissant qu'il s'agitd'un fait dommageable imputable au
                        négociant et dont il est dû réparation, dit que ce fait ne peut cependant
                        être retenu comme lo résultat d'une intention réfléchie et perverse ; que la
                        réparation accordée par le tribunal paraît donc proportionnée au préjudice
                        souffert et par conséquent suffisante. </p>

                        dame Amina Hanem Toussoun, ne s'étant pas fait représenter, l'avocat de la
                        Cie., Me Vermond, a requis un arrêt par défaut, qui sera rendu à
                        huitaine.</p>
                    <p>La dame fera probablement opposition à cet arrêt</p>

                        c'est pour cette raison que M. Moriondo avait dû prendre sa place.</p>

                        diplomatique. Un de ses principaux titres de gloire est sans contredit la

                    <p>SIR W. GARSTIN'S INSPECTION. </p>
                    <p>Suakin, January 10.</p>
                    <p>Sir William Garstin, G.C.M.G., Adviser to the Ministry of Public Works,
                        accompanied by Miralai Macauley Bey, R.E., Director of Sudan Railways, and
                        Bimbashi Sowerby, R.E., Chief Engineer of Ways and Works, Suakin-Atbara
                        Railways, left for Railhead on the 4th inst. in a special train composed of
                        four saloon carriages on inspection duty, returning to Suakin at. noon on
                        the 7th inst. The same afternoon, Sir Wm. Gars tin,accompanied by Macau ley
                        Bey, inspected the piers and the works at Graham's Point. His Excellency
                        expressed his entire satisfaction with what he saw and with the great
                        progress made in such, a short space of time, and under many
                        difficulties.</p>
                    <p>On the 8th inst. Sir William Garstin, accompanied by Macauley Bey and Drury
                        Bey, Controller of Sudan Ports, left on H.H. Ports and Lighthouses steamer
                        "Aida,"which was followed by the Sudan Port steam tug "Hawk," for Sheikh
                        Barghout harbour. After the party had landed and inspected this new port,
                        Sir Wm. Garstin went on to Suez by the "Aida," and Macauley Bey and Drury
                        Bey returned. to Suakin by the "Hawk."</p>
                    <p>The British steamer "Sharistan" arrived there from England with a large
                        consignment of railway material and stores for the Sudan Government Railway
                        on the 4th inst.</p>
                    <p>H.M.S. "Sealark" (Commander Somerville) arrived here from Sheikh Barghout on
                        the 4th inst. and left again lor surveying purposes on the 7th inst.</p>
                    <p>One officer and 35 N.C.O. s and men belonging to the Works Department arrived
                        here on the 7th inst. from Khartoum via Berber, and are leaving for Sheikh
                        Barghout. They form the pioneer party and will start the public works there.
                        They will soon be followed by about 1,000 more men from the same department
                        coming via Suez. The total number of men to be sent to Sheikh Barghout in
                        connection with the public works there will amount to about 3,000.</p>
                    <p>The anniversary of the accession to the Throne of H. H. the Khedive was
                        observed as a general holiday, all Government offices and works being closed
                        for the occasion. At midday a salute of 21 guns was fired from the Customs'
                        Quay, and the town was anfete by day as well as by night.</p>
                    <p>The Khedivial mail steamer "Missir'' arrived here a few days ago from Suez
                        with a consignment of timber, etc., for the temporary wooden bridges te
                        erected for the Suakin-Atbara Railway. The returns to Suez to-day. </p>
                    <p>THE PICNIC GIRL. </p>
                    <p>WHAT SHE HAS TO PUT UP WITH.</p>
                    <p>The Picnic Girl goes out for pleasure; but she has much to put up with. She
                        must mix the salad, and keep the earwigs out of it, aud she mustn't scream
                        when a spider walks over her hand. Sometimes a burst of rain spoils her
                        pretty frock : but she must still look cheerful and try to pretend that she
                        likes it. And,these showers do more than spoil frocks, as a Liverpool lady
                        told her friend the other day. "I was a girl at a picnic, and got drenched
                        to the skin," she said. "And I have blamed that picnic ever since for the
                        way. I have suffered with rheumatism. "Only those who have ever suffered
                        from that dreadful malady can have any idea of the awful pain I had at times
                        to bear. For week after week I have been bed-ridden. Besides which I had
                        that miserable languor which is so horribly depressing. At night I have
                        often been in too great pain to sleep.</p>
                    <p>"There was hardly a part of my body which was not at one time or another
                        affected with the rheumatism," continued the speaker (Mrs. Moorcroft, of 88,
                        Leven-street, Kirkdale, Liverpool). "My appetite almost completely left me,
                        and when I did get the length of walking even a few yards I soon became
                        tired out, both with the pain and difficulty experienced in breathing. I
                        despaired, after I had suffered in the way I have described for many years,
                        of ever being like other people again. Nothing did me any good until I tried
                        Dr. Williams' pink pills, Three boxes effected an improvement, and as I
                        persevered with them a little time I soon felt quite well again, and have
                        been so now for a long time. My appetite has returned ; I am able to sleep ;
                        l have no pain, and I find pleasure in working."</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Moorcroft's case is like many others. She needed new blood to cure her
                        rheumatism, and Dr. Williams pink pills cured her by making new blood, just
                        as they have cured so many cases of anaemia, bile, consumption, decline,
                        fits, St. Vitus' dance, hysteria, and the many troubles which women silently
                        endure. It is important to insist on having genuine pills, with Dr. Williams
                        name, as some shopkeepers push useless substitutes.</p>
