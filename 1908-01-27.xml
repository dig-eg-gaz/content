                            arrivals The first dance give by any of the hotels in the town was held

                            to be forgiven their apathy in this respect, for we tremble to think of

                            that one is weary of the dust, a drenching shower has converted it into

                            the second one of the season, was held at the Helouan Casino on Thursday
                            evening, the hall of the Casino being well filled with dancers, many of
                            whom had jour- neyed out to Helouan from Cairo for the occasion. The
                            hall is as well suited to dancing as it is to the theatrical
                            performances to which it is usually devoted, indeed, the Casino and all
                            its works have been an assured and remark able success from the day of
                            inauguration, and are proving a boon to the inhabitants of Helouan, for
                            the programme of entertarnment ie varied and always good and the theatre
                            hall is one of the most comfortable in Cairo or its vicinity. Central by
                            situated within a minutes walk of the railway station, and within easy
                            access of the hotels it supplies a long felt want. Military band
                            performances are given in the gardens during the afternoons three times
                            a week, while orchestral, cinematograph, and theatrical performances are
                            also given regular- ly in the Casino itself. Frequent trains run to and
                            from the Bab el Louk station in Cairo, and Helouan is fast becoming what
                            San Stefano is to Alexandria, the resort of pleasure</p>

                    <p>Alexandria has for the past thirty six hours heen visited by one of the most
                        violent gales ever known since meteorological observations were begun here,
                        Saturday afternoon was as time as could be wished and the sky gave no Signs
                        of the terrible weather that was impend- ing. At 7pm. the rain began to fall
                        and in half an hours time a perfect deluge of rain came down Shortly
                        afterwards a thunderbolt fell in the neighborhood of Ibrahimieh and its
                        passage through the air was extraordinarily vivid On its way earthwards it
                        came down Like a brilliant streak of flame and its fiery course was visible
                        miles away. Immediately afterwards huge crashes of thunder resounded snd the
                        rain redoubled in vigour. Throughout the night the storm showed no sign of
                        lessening and indeed grew in strength 1 the wind yesterday reached a rate of
                        one hundred and twenty kilometers the hour. The records at the
                        Meteorological Station at Napoleon for the past: twenty years slows that the
                        wind has attained a speed of ninety to a hundred kilometers per hour, But
                        the force of the wind yesterday has never during that period been equalled,
                        Yesterday afternoon was extraordinarily boisterous and the hurricane grew in
                        violence. The rain and Wind came down in powerful angry gusts and all the
                        streets were utterly deserted. About midday yesterday a hail storm of
                        excessive severity burst over the town. The hail stones came down in such
                        quantities and were of so large a size that in a few minutes the streets
                        were covered in a mantle of white</p>

                    <p>The sea was very rough and many of the hips in the harbour got adrift) and
                        dragged their anchors</p>

                    <p>In the afternoon an Ottoman sailing vessel from Australia under the command
                        of Captain Macah Papalion with a cargo of wood consign ed to Rostow Bey to
                        the value of about £1,000 was driven into Eastern barbour. Drop ping her
                        anchor in a dangerous position about half past two she was only able to
                        withstand quarter of an hours bulleting Torn away From her anchorage she was
                        driven sheer on to The rocks and after a little more than two hours was a
                        broken up wreck. The crew manag ed to escape in a boat and after a hard
                        struggle with the elements were safely landed thanks to the assistance of a
                        crew who went out to them. Last night a small private tug broke away from
                        her moorings and is now a wreck, A coast guard rowing boat was dashed to
                        pieces against the petroleum quay, and several light- ers in harbour have
                        been sunk. The wreck of the Greek brig once again demonstrates the absolute

                        being dashed about before their eyes.</p>

                    <p>The storm has uprooted great numbers of trees it the neighborhood of
                        Alexandria, About fifty trees in the Rosetta Road between Rosetta Gate and
                        San Stefano have been torn from their roots. ‘Tis an ill wind that blows
                        nobody good and large numbers of gigantic and inartistic advertisements,
                        that have dis figured lather to the Ramleh Road, are now lying prone on the
                        ground.</p>

                    <p>The have wrought on the roofs of build ings has been considerable. A chimney
                        on the house of Mr Charles Alderson at Bulkeley was blown down and fell the
                        roof of the kit- chen, which was ripped off, and the contents of the kitchen
                        destroyed and two Arabs buried among the ruins.</p>

                    <p>The stable of a native notable near San Stefano was struck by lightning last
                        night and a valuable horse killed</p>

                    <p>A tramway car was blown right over on the Ramleh line near the Khediviah
                        Mother's Palace. Nobody was injured.</p>

                    <p>Three horses were killed between the Rond Point by the Alexandria Water
                        Company pumping station and the line to Cairo. The horses were killed by a
                        naked electric wire used as a feeder for the Alexandria Tramway Company's
                        system at the Rond Point. If the pecuniary damages, which this Company has
                        already had to pay for similar accidents at this point has not already shown
                        it the neces sity of replacing this naked wire by an ander ground cable, it
                        is strange that the Municipal ity should so far have neglected its duty in
                        not reminding the company of the fact.</p>

                    <p>Telegraphic communication with other parts of the country has been entirely
                        cut off by the land-lines, with the exception of a single line which can
                        only work at half its normal rate. Recourse has therefore to be had to the
                        cables of the ETC and to reach Suez it is necessary at present to circuit
                        the continent.</p>

                    <p>At half past nine this morning the black flag was hoisted at Kom el Nadoura

                        accompanied by an icy wind, in Cairo, and a steady down pour continued for
                        the whole of the forenoon. Little rain fell in the afternoon, but the cold
                        was as severe as ever, and towards nightfall a half gale sprang up, quickly
                        clearing the streets of pedestrians who were not compelled to remain abroad.
                        The cab stands were practic- ally empty, the drivers evidently preferring to
                        run the risk of losing possible fares, to the certainty of being half frozen
                        on their boxes. Despite the crowds of men and boys engaged upon the clearing
                        of mud from the principal streets, they were, as usual, almost impassible,
                        though it must be admitted that they were preferable to the pavements which
                        were carefully avoided by any but the most callous of the foot

                    <p>Since daybreak this morning a S. W. gale has been raging at Suez, and the
                        steamers in the roads experience difficulties in discharging their
                        cargoes.</p>
                    <p>Owing to the strong wind, the 8.8. “Bute- shire” grounded in the Canal near

                    <p>The Anstrian Lloyd SS. “Cleopatra,” (Captain Ivenich), which left Alexandria
                        at 4 o'clock on Saturday afternoon for Brindisi and Trieste, had to return
                        shortly afterwards owing to meeting with a mishap in the New Pass. The
                        “Cleopatra” and her captain have been on the regular express service of the
                        Austrian Lloyd between Alexandria and Trieste for years past and the Captain
                        bears a high reputation for navigation and caution As there were many ships
                        passing through the Old Pass, it was decided to take the New Pass. The pilot
                        left the steamer, as usual, before entering the Pass. The steamer when in
                        the Pass struck against a rock, which made a 1ole in her hold, number one.
                        The water rushed in with great force and filled the hold. The captain
                        decided therefore to turn back, al- hough there was no danger as the system
                        of watertight compartments acted excellently. The “Cleopatra” came back into
                        harbour at 5.30 pm and the work of discharging cargo rom No. 1 hold was at
                        once begun. The damaged cargo is as follows : two hundred bales of cotton,
                        sixteen cases of skins and seven hundred and forty two empty casks. The loss
                        s insignificant. The steamer will be taken o the dry dock at Gabbari, as
                        soon as the ‘weather improves. There were sixty-five pas- engers on board.
                        The mail was transferred to the train, which left Alexandria yesterday
                        afternoon with the Brindisi mail.</p>

                    <p>The steamer with Sir E. Gorst arrived at Sohag at 3.30 p.m. on Monday. Sir
                        Eldon first visited the Irrigation Department, and then all the other
                        Government offices escorted by a body of cavalry and the commander of the
                        police. Sir Eldon was much pleased with the excellent arrangements made by
                        the energetic Mudir. After that he visited Basta Bey’s school, which was
                        beautifully decorated with flags, flowers, and palms on the occasion of Sir
                        Eldon Gorst’s visit. For the hundred yards leading to the school the four
                        hundred and fifty pupils stood on either side cheering their illustrious
                        visitor as he approached the school gate</p>
                    <p>As soon as be alighted, the Mudir introduc- ed to him Mr. H. Basta,
                        A.M.I.C.E, and Mr. S. Basta, sons of the late founder, also the headmaster.
                        Sir Eldon then in spected the school rooms asking the head- master for much
                        information concerning it, which the latter was only too pleased to answer.
                        Then a pupil delivered a speech in English which pleased Sir Eldon so mach
                        that he graciously asked the pupil to let him have it. Finally a body of
                        scholars sang “God save the King” in an admirable manner, Sir Eldon holding
                        his hat in his hand all the time. On leav- ing Sir Eldon thanked the
                        founder's sons, who take great interest in the school and support it
                        financially, also the headmaster and teachers for their conscientious
                        labours in instructing their scholars. </p>

                    <head>FOR SUFFERERS FROM THE CRISIS.</head>
                    <p>In these troublous times when so many persons are suffering physically as
                        well as Financially from the crisis, it is interesting to now that a special
                        cure for persons whose nerves want calming, has been instituted in this
                        city. We are ashamed to avow that we have never beard of the “Blue Chamber”
                        here at the Paris “Figaro” vouches for it and the information has been
                        copied by many London newspapers. The following is what the “Figaro” says
                        :-</p>
                    <p>“Experiments have been made from to time to test the effect of colour on the
                        sick, especially on those suffering from nervous afflictions and mental
                        disorders. In an institution at Alex- andria, where the rooms have been
                        fitted up with coloured glass, it is found that in a blue chamber a restless
                        person has been calmed ; in red chamber a person suffering from melan-
                        holia, with a tendency to suicide, has become gay, and in a violet chamber a
                        maniac has become sane.”</p>
                    <p>The following is the text of a letter addressed to the Financial Adviser:
                        -</p>
                    <p>Sir,</p>
                    <p>With regard to the appeal which has been made to you by some of the financial
                        notabili ties of Cairo with a view to relieve the land and house owners from
                        the prejudicial effect of the crisis which has fallen on the country, I beg
                        to submit for your kind and earnest consi deration, the following remarks in
                        the interest of the mass of the people</p>
                    <p>In my opinion based on discussion with intelligent people of various classes
                        and especially with native land owners the Govern- ment ought not to
                        guarantee any loan except on the following conditions</p>
                    <p>1st. That the Credit Foncier Egyptien who is to be trusted with this work
                        should use half of the funds guaranteed by the Government and lent to him
                        for loans under one thousand pounds and over three hundred ; one quarter for
                        loans under two thousand pounds and over one thousand ; and the rest under
                        five thous- and and over two thousand</p>
                    <p>2nd. That the rate of interest charged by the credit Foncier should not be
                        over 6% in case the loan is obtained at 4% and in any case should not exceed
                        two per cent over the rate of interest charged for the money guaranteed by
                        the government whatever may be the amount of the loan</p>
                    <p>3rd. That every person should not obtain more than one loan from the
                        Government guaranteed fund and on the condition that he should not have
                        obtained in 1908 a loan from non guaranteed funds</p>
                    <p>4th. Should the Credit Foncier refuse to fellow these conditions the
                        Government could| take the matter in band by creating a special Department
                        for this purpose and profiting from the difference in the rate of interest
                        which not only will cover the expenditure but will also leave an important
                        surplus.</p>
                    <p>The Government has already helped the credit Foncier by lending them half a
                        million of pounds but I have beard from reliable sources that the greatest
                        part of this sum has been lent to rich people so that the relief instead of
                        falling to the lot of the relatively poor and middle classes has gone to
                        strengthen the position of the rich who with a little sacrifice could hold
                        their own and save their poorer and less favored fellow creatures from
                        certain ruin.</p>
                    <p>I am convinced that the able hands that direct the destinies of this country
                        will not permit the interests of the millions being sacri- ficed for those
                        of the millionaires.</p>
                    <p>I have the honor to remain, Sir, Your most obedient servant NEGHIB SHAKRA.

                    <head> BIMBASHI REUFEE</head>
                    <p>There went to its long eternal rest yesterday the soul of Bimbashi P. H.
                        Renfee. Its passing was of a supremely tragic character. In full pos-
                        session of all bis facilities, the “Major,” as he was termed amongst his
                        many intimates, was playing billiards in the well known saloon of
                        Shepbeard’s Hotel at half past six on Saturday evening, when he suddenly
                        complained of giddiness, and relinquished the game. He was immediately
                        attended to by Doctor Brabant, land taken to a room in the hotel, where he
                        exhibited most serious symptoms. Other doc tors were called, and, in
                        consultation with Doctor Brabant, the consensus of opinion was that the
                        patient was suffering from hemorrhage on the brain. The four doctors in
                        attendance did all that was possible, and the condition of the patient
                        becoming worse, it was decided to transport him to the Deaconesses’ Hospital
                        Here he never recovered from the state of coma into which he had fallen, and
                        passed away yesterday morning at five o'clock.</p>
                    <p> Bimbashi Reufee had experience of much active work in the field, and
                        possessed many medals with clasps for services rendered in Egypt and
                        elsewhere. He was one of the first to enter Cairo after the decisive en-
                        counter with Arabi Pasha's troops at Tel el- Kebir. For many years he was
                        associated with the Police Force in Alexandria and subsequently Cairo. His
                        assiduous and con scientious labours ultimately resulted in his being
                        appointed Governor of the Ghizeh Prison, whence he was transferred to the
                        great central prison of Menshieh, as director, — a posi tion he held at the
                        moment of his untimely death.</p>
                    <p>The funeral took place from the Deavonesses’ Hospital at four yesterday
                        afternoon, the service in the new cemetery being conducted by the Chaplain
                        to the Forces. There was present at the mournful ceremony a vast number of
                        sympathizers, and many beautiful wreaths were sent The cemetery was
                        thronged, land it is quite impossible to give the names of fall present, but
                        we noticed on the cards attached to the floral tributes the names of H.EB.

                                was notable by the reappearance of M. Delcassé, who admitted full
                                responsibility for the Murocean policy of France in view of the

                                attacking France with her powerful allies and friends. He urged the
                                necessity of defending the approaches to France's African Empire, on

                            party which was founded by a select number of our potables j and leaders
                            of thought, has served the purpose f that party in the most faithfull
                            and straight forward manner, always advpoating the cause of the people
                            against the ruling powers. It repeatedly explained in the most explicit
                            and conscieatious manner that the two powers now ruling Egypt, the
                            Khedive and the British xecupation, may have aims and interests at times
                            not identical with the interests of the people to which it devoted all
                            its energies at all times. This, of did not please everybody and the
                            usual intrigues began to work, ending in the last schism and the disa-
                            vowal or ‘Al Garida” by many Pashas and Beys who belped to found it a
                            year ago on the ground that the said newspaper had unneces sarily
                            criticised certain officials of the Palace and advocated acavse other
                            than of his Highiess the Khedive. Tha disenssion of Fs question bas been
                            long and painful and the victory rested with the party known as the
                            “Reform League.’ It is worthy of note, however, that all the notables
                            who have dis avowed “Al Garida” and its principle of serv ing the people
                            are among those who clamonu fora Constitution on republican or

                        <p> With reference to what was written in your last issue about the “Party
                            of the People, 1 am sorry to say that you must have been misled
                            concerning facts to such an extent that you find everything distorted
                            and in correct. Not a particle of truth lies in deserib- ing the
                            unimportant dissensions in the Party as “terrific internecine struggles”
                            nor in what you call “serious secession.” </p>
                        <p>Moreover Lord Cromer departed from Egypt about the middle of April last,
                            and the Party was only proclaimed late in September , so there is no
                            truth in your insinuation (in its worst seuse) that “as soon as Lord
                            Cromer departed this ‘Party of the people” entirely changed its
                            programme The Party has got only one programme which was announced on
                            the 21st of September last, and since then no modifications have been
                            therein introduced</p>
                        <p>Finally I see no alternative, as a gentleman, but to pass overall that
                            you say about the party's " disregard for political consistency and its
                            “acrimonious virulence towards Lord Cromer and the Occupation’ ete.ete,
                            as show ing utter ignorance of facts and of what is going on in the
                            broad daylight </p>

                    <p> The statement that, in as much as the Party of the People was only
                        constituted in the Autumn, therefore it could not have had any connection
                        with The Lord Cromer is absurd. The Nationalist Party was only organized
                        quite recently but it has existed for sone time past, and, as is well known
                        the Party of the People owes its inception to the late Sheiki Mobamed Abdou
                        and may be said to have commenced its actual existence with the first
                        number, of ‘‘Al Garidah.’ Why the various parties have only been actually
                        constituted since Lord Cromer's departure is said to be due to the crisis I
                        the Cairo correspondent of the “Times" re- marks: - </p>
                    <p>Somewhat late in the day the various Egyp tian parties have realized the
                        necessity of or- ganising themselves, and important meetings have recently
                        been held by the “Nationalist” faction under Mustapha Pasha Kamel and the
                        “Perty of Constitutional Reform” led by his rival, Sheikh Ali Youssef, at
                        which the statutes of the “Egyptian National party” and the Constitutional
                        Reform League” were read and adopted. This new departure is, I believe; to
                        be explained in part by the action of the “Party of the people,” in part by
                        the per sistence of an unfavourable financial situation Till recently many
                        of the leading Nationalists were dependent for the funds which they required
                        for journeys to Europe, political pro- paganda, Xc., on the generosity of a
                        limited number of wealthy Turks and Egyptians, some of them discontented
                        with the existing régime, others good easy men who bad a strong aversion to
                        seeing their names in print, unless accompanied by eulogies ot the most
                        trident pitch, or desired to maintain or acquire a repu tation for
                        generosity. The financial crisis has closed many purses, and it has become
                        neces sary to appeal for aid to the Egyptian public, a course which has met
                        with the warm ap proval of certain disinterested Nationalists who have good
                        reason to dislike a system which has rendered their political activity
                        dependent on the munificence of a few notables or of the</p>

                    <p>Palace. Whether their optimistic views con cerning the support which will be
                        given by the public to an appeal for wabsoriptions in aid of party funds is
                        likely to be justified or not is another question. The ntasses, in my
                        opinion, in the absence of any religions or economic stimulus, will long
                        remain profoundly indif ferent. </p>

                        parle liqui dateur, a eu lieu samedi aprés-midi dans les bureaux de
                        laSociété Alexandrie, 26 Rue Chérif Pacha. La majorité des actions déposées
                        étaient représentées par les avocats des inté ressés, et, comme laplupart
                        des titres se troavent dans qnelques mains seulement, c'est dire qu'il n'y
                        avait pas beaucoup de monde. C'était d’ail leurs prévu, puisqu’on n'avait
                        disposé que quelques chaises dans une salle peu luxueuse od en guise
                        d’éclairage pendait lainentablement un cordon électrique dont la lampe avait
                        été enlevée. La séance qui a eu lieu dans une obscurité preaque compléte o
                        été ouverte vers 5 heures et quart sealement avec un quorum || de 61.250

                    <p>En parlant do quorum, le liquidateur estimé qu'il était suffisant dans tous
                        les cas, puisque méme en faisant intervenir le droit des parts de fondateur,
                        Me Mercinier représentait a lui seul 4500 de ces parts surun total de 2000,
                        Sur ce, le liquidateur a déclaré l'assem blée valablement constituée.</p>
                    <p>M. Snelling aaussitot protesté contre la compé tence de l’assembi¢e 4 statuer
                        sur la deuxiéme question del’ordre du jour,attenda qu'uneaffaire y relative
                        ¢tait pendante au tribunal cons laire Britanniqae, Aprés une courte
                        discussion, on a passé 4 l’ordre du jour, qui était le suivant 1° Fixer les
                        émoluments du liquidateur, 2° En tendre le liquidateur relativement 4

                    <p>M. Nahman demande one rémunération de 80 &amp; 100 livres par mois. Me Padoa
                        Bey lui fait observer qu'il est impossible de rien fixer &amp; priori; il
                        faut d’abord que les actionnaires sachent quel travail ils doivent rémanérer
                        pour | en fixer le quantam. (i en est la liquidation ' Acela M. Nahman ne
                        dissimule pas que ya va tres mal. Les bons débiteurs méme ne paieat pas. Si
                        l'on n’encaisse rien, reprend aussit’t Padoa Bey, od prendrat-on l'argent
                        pour vous rémonérer ! Intervient alors M. Salinas disxant qu’a son avis,
                        c'est aux créanciers de trancher cette question.</p>
                    <p>Voici exactement le travail du liquidateur a ce joar: il a encaissé un
                        millier de livres Des débiteurs il a obtenu 350 &amp; 400 livres Pour
                        arriver ce brillant résultat ila do rem plir un copie de lettres et demi !
                        Les corres pondances et sommations sont innombrables il a ao sorplus engagé
                        ou sur le dos prés de deox donzaines de procés dont deux ont déja été
                        perdus, l'un aa tribunal consulaire Britan nique et l'autre au tribunal
                        mixte d'Alexandrie,</p>
                    <p>probablement, ajoute M, Nahman, parce que</p>
                    <p>)'ai tort. Devant |'indécision de |'assemblée M.Salinas dit ; “Puisqu’on vous
                        a nommé liquida</p>
                    <p>teur sans fixer vos ¢moluments, on a par le fait méme laissé le cas &amp;
                        votre discrétion”.Un autre actionnaire propose de fixer une somme globale
                        ponr la liquidation. Mais M. Nahman tient &amp; ne pas s’engager et il est
                        évidemment désireux que |'assemblée se prononce séance tenante sur cette
                        question qui est pour lui la plus impor tante. Pour les trois mois et demi
                        ¢coulés il réclame 250 livres.</p>
                    <p>Eafin, aprés consultation d'avocats et bien des tergiversations l’assemblée
                        s’arréte sur ve point 4 la nomination d’une commission chargée d’examiner le
                        travail et de se proaoncer sur le montant de la rémunération, Sont nomm's a
                        cet effet Me Mercinier, MM. Chasseaud et Myriasi</p>
                    <p>Le CuaNnoemeyt pu LigrtpTEcR</p>
                    <p>Sur cette deuxiéme question de l'ordre du jour, M. Nabman avoue qu'il ne
                        comprend pas | grand’ chose. I] demande sealement s'il peut livrer les
                        procés-verbaux et documents qe le demandeur veut communiquer au
                        Tribunal.</p>
                    <p>Me. Padoe Bey trouve sivgulier que sr cette affaire le liquidateur ne sache
                        rien et que \'actionnaire inteptant le procés ne dise rien. Pourtant, de
                        moins en‘ce qai concerne le silence de l'actionnaire, rien n'est plas
                        naturel pour deux raisons qu'a fortbien exposées M Snelling d'abord que
                        l'affaire ne peut ¢tre discutée tant qu'elle est sous l'examen du tribunal
                        consulaire et ensuite parce qu'il n'a pas d'e- claircissements 4 donner A
                        one Assemplée dont il nie la compétence cur ve sujet. Contraire ment 4
                        I'cpinion émise par le liquidateur, ce n'est pas une question de personne
                        mais de principe.</p>
                    <p>Quant &amp; la communication des proces verbaux, Me. Padoa Bey déclare au
                        liquidateur ahori que non seulement il peut les laiaser consulter par le

                    <p>Com coup de débiteurs ne peuvent payerq tie de ce qu'ils doivent, M Nahman
                        demande 4 |'assemblée des pouvoirs discrétionnaires pour transiger avec
                        eux.</p>
                    <p>Me. Cazer dit &amp; ce sujet qu’d |’assemblée préoédente il avait été proposé
                        3 liquidateurs, dont 2 experts Cenx-ci s'étant retirés, M Nahman voulait
                        s'adjoindre 2 créanciers, mais il n’en pas trouvé de disposés 4 remplir
                        cette mission. Dans tous les cas, ajoutet-il, comme il ne vestera pas un sou
                        aux actionnaires, ceux- ci n'ont pas &amp; se prononcer sur les pouvoirs 4
                        donner au liquidateur</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>Sut la proposition de Me. Padoa Bey, il a été décidé d’adjoindre au
                        liquidateur la Banque d'Athenes, M. Chasseaud et M. Snelling. Celui-ci a
                        répondu qu'il ne pouvait accepter une pareille proposition &amp; son égard,
                        puisqu il ne reconnait, comme 1! |'a declaré au début, aucune compétence
                        &amp; l'assemblée pour décider quoi que ce soit. Il a done refusé formelle-
                        ment, Cependant, sur l'observation de Me Padoa Bey qu'il s'agissait dune
                        acceptation sous réserve et aprés prononcé du jugement, ‘il s'est rallié au
                        vou de l'assemblée. Ce Comité sera chargé de transiger avee les débitears et
                        les créanciers</p>

                        <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                        <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers
                            the accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by
                            which they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange
                            them as accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that
                            none of them are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home
                            there are several things to be considered. To begin with there is the
                            difference in climate between Egypt and the various points at which you
                            may arrive in Europe.</p>
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                            January may be a little warmer than the Riviera and possibly not so warm
                            as Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly
                            warm than many other places in Europe. </p>
                        <p>Many people leave Egypt far too early in the year, for as a rule the
                            weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to go to on
                            leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                        <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent
                            at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list shewing the time occupied on
                            each of the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of
                            Europe.</p>
                        <p>They are as follows:-</p>

                        <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth,
                            Southhampton, London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short ones
                            are as follows:—</p>

                        <p>The steamers of the P.&amp;O., the Egyptian Mail S.S,. Co., North German
                            Lloyd, Orient, and Messageries Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor,
                            British India, Bibby and Henderson Lines are also excellent, and their
                            steamers are largely patronised by travellers to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to
                            Alexandria, without change (3 hours). That to Port Said can now be made
                            without change in 4 ½ hours.</p>
                        <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                            Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German
                            Levant line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                        <cb n="5"/>
                        <p>The quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O. Brindisi express
                            from Port Said, by the Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., from Alexandria to
                            Marseilles and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from
                            Alexandria.</p>
                        <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little
                            luggage is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several
                            good and responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed
                            charge to deliver packages to any address in Europe. The Egyptian Mail
                            S.S. Co., have also made arrangements whereby luggage can be collected
                            and sent to any address.</p>
                        <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by
                            the fast Mail<cb n="6"/> Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to Brindisi. One
                            of these leaves Port Said every week, as soon as possible after
                            receiving the Indian mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                        <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                            attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats"
                            having been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to
                            Brindisi. If you are going straight through to England you will find the
                            train waiting at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without
                            changing. It has complete arrangements for sleeping and eating on board,
                            and you should arrive in London on the fifth day from leaving Port
                            Said.</p>

                            place for the ascent of Etna, and here also is a fine Cathedral. The
                            Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over the island,
                            are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history,
                            having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413,
                            and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                            is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO,
                            with about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys
                            a delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city.
                                <hi rend="italic">The Palazzo Reale</hi> is of Saracenic origin and
                            close to it the church of <hi rend="italic">S. Giovannia degli
                                Eremiti</hi> with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum,
                            Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a visit.</p>

                        <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every
                            Wednesday during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3
                            days.</p>
                        <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino
                            Co.’s steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave
                            it without wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely
                            places on its bay—<hi rend="italic">Castellamare</hi> and <hi
                                rend="italic">Sorrento</hi>. The small steamer that takes you to
                            Sorrento [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                        <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can
                            will devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and
                            interesting portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are
                            too well-known to need comment here.</p>
                        <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five
                            hours brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent
                            admiring the <hi rend="italic">City of Flowers</hi> and its surrounding
                            country. In Florence itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing
                            interest, whilst the local promenades and excursions should not be
                            omitted. <hi rend="italic">The Cascine</hi> is the most attractive and
                            fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the <hi rend="italic">Viale
                                dei Colli</hi>, one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years
                            ago, goes winding up through the hills a distance of four miles. The
                            most delightful excursion outside Florence is that to <hi rend="italic"
                                >Vallombrosa</hi>, with its <hi rend="italic">Monastery</hi> 3,300
                            feet above the sea level. This is made first by ordinary train from
                            Florence to <hi rend="italic">St. Ellero</hi>, thence by cog-wheel
                            railway to <hi rend="italic">Saltino</hi>. The ascent through groves of
                            oaks takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to
                            view.</p>
                        <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a
                            fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night
                            should if possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile
                            at sunset.</p>
                        <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near
                            Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient
                            half-way house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable
                            and the air and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy,
                            with the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European
                            cities and a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and
                            deliciously cool breezes from the surrounding mountains and the
                            Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                        <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                            gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings,
                            are a constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn
                            in Genoa. Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches
                            containing exquisite marble columns and historical paintings, and the
                            incomparable Campo Santo filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                        <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                        <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                            Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful
                            windows illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and
                            the monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                        <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                            SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal

                        <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                            delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                            vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage
                            or bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every
                            turn. The approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any
                            other sea port. The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of
                            the sea. No hills behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of
                            Campaniles appear above the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering
                            town rises like a fairy mirage out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                        <p>Going northwards from <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi> you make the tour of
                            the beautiful Italian lakes.</p>
                        <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in
                            one-and-a-quarter hours by train by way of Monza.</p>
                        <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is
                            very beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                            enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come <hi rend="italic"
                                >Tremezzo</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Cadenabbia</hi>, and <hi

                                rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs
                            from <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Porlezza</hi>
                            on Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in

                            and is an excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso,
                            situated above the town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting
                            paintings, “Entombment," by Ciseri, and ‘Tho Flight into Egypt,” by
                            Bramantion.</p>

                        celui-ci n'opère bien que lorsqu'il est pris avec de bons aliments et des
                        boissons fortifiantes, telles que vin, café, thé. Chacun choisit, pour se

                        occupations. La fatigue de la purgation étant annulée par l'effet de la
                        bonne alimentation, on se décide aisément à recommencer autant de fois que
