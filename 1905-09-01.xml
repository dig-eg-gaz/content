              FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 1905.
              THE SULTAN'S ACCESSION.
              To-day Egypt is celebrating the anniversary
              of the aooession of its de jure suierain, Saltan
              Abdnl Hamid Khan of Turkey, and whatever
              the sympathies of many of onr readers they
              oannot fail to be impressed by the enthusiasm
              whioh a large seotion of the Moslem popu-
              lation displays when honoring the aooes-
              sion day of the Commander of the Faithful.
              Then an many reasons for this attitude,
              whioh at first sight seems inexplicable on the
              pert of a peopla whioh is lees directly under
              Turkish influence than any other tributary
              provinoe of the Ottoman Hmpira,sxoept perhaps
              Bulgaria, and over whioh reigns an Albanian
              snooees over Turkish arms gained in Syria ami
              Asia Minor. Some of these reasons we
              not attempt to discuss ; others can be openly
              treated in these columns, and deserve to be
              noted by those who allow their iudignalioo
              at the misdeeds of certain of the Saltan’s
              servants to blind them to the progress whioh
              the Ottoman Empire has made under his
              rule and to his genuine popularity with a
              large proportion—not only of his Moslem
              subjects, but of the Sunni Moslems of the
              world First and foremost of these oauses
              is the spread of what we may call the
              Pan-Islamio idea, whioh emphasises the
              spiritual headship of the Sultan over the
              Snnni Moslems, lo Mesopotamia and Syria,
              in Kurdistan, in Central Asia and Tripoli,
              this dootrine, whioh had become almost a
              formula, has reoently been revived and is
              fast becoming a belief. It has had a certain
              influenoe among a seotion of the Moslems
              of Algeria, India and Egypt, though there can
              he no harm in recording onr opinion that
              the bestowal of honors and rewards on its
              chief promoters in these ooantries has oaused
              so loud and vigorous an outbnnt of gratitude
              that it is a little diffioult to hear the opinions of
              theplain man. It has met with fierce opposition
              alone in Arabia, where an influential minority
              longs for the return of the days of Haronn-El-
              Rashid, andwhere the majority of the population
              is composed either of Zaidis and Wahabis, who
              eaoh claim to be the sole possessors of the
              true doctrine, or of nomads, whose seonlar
              avocations of stock-raising and brigandage
              leave them little time for meditation on the
              beauties of dogma. But elsewhere this dootrine,
              in its revived form, hinting at something more
              than a spiritual unity of the Moslems, has.
              made progress, and alt students of eaatenv^
              politios must take note of its tendencies and
              development. Another cause of the warmth
              shown in celebrating the Sultan’s aooession, is
              the undoubted eoonomio progress made by
              Turkey sinoe 1876. We do not here propose
              to enquire how muoh of this progress is
              really attributable to European capital and
              European aoienoe, somewhat grudgingly per-
              mitted to take apart in the exploitation
              of the Turkish dominions, or to what
              extent pnblio works, whioh are professedly
              inspired by eoonomio and oommeroial ideals,
              are really politioal and strategical in their
              intention. Bat progress has been made and
              to the “man in the street” the faot is suffioient
              Finally we oome to the reoent escape of the
              Sultan (rom a singularly oruel and stupid
              attempt at assassination whioh destroyed a
              number of innooent lives, and had it proved
              snocessful, would have caused a terrible explo-
              sion of rage and hatred among hundreds of
              thousands of Moslems. The foot that the
              Sultan bore himself) after the wtplnfioT«, with
              the dignity and self possession that befit a
              Khalif and a ruler of the house of Othman, is
              of more importance in the eyes of his subjects,
              than the sealvenations of his subordinates,
              and in the eyes of Egyptians, then the arrest
              of the lnokless journalists, sheikhs, or busmen
              men seeking a holiday in Syria and Palestine.
              All said and done the world judges externals
              first.
              We can therefore understand the enthusiasm
              whioh is being displayed oii this oooasion by
              many of the Moslems of Egypt. With this
              enthusiasm we have no quarrel, and onr opinion
              of the methods ot repression adopted against
              Christians in Armenia and Maoedonia, against
              Druses in the Hauran, and Zaidis in the
              Yemen does not blind ns to the faot that the
              Moslem world looks upon the wholesale
              slaughter or forced conversion of peoples who
              have rebellednot against the Sultan, but against
              thefrantiomullahandthe rapacious taxgatherer,
              not against theMoslem bat against the paid spy
              and the venal judge, with comparative indiffe-
              rence—not to say callousness. The indictment
              may seem too harsh, but we think that it will be
              admitted by all who are in touch with eastern
              affairs that, with the exoeption of the enlight-
              ened Mobamedans of Egypt and fndia, the
              followers of the prophet oan with difijonlty be
              persuaded that even rebellions schismatics and
              infidels do not deserve torture and oatraga.
              Whatever the crimes of European armies in
              the past, the Russo-Turkish war, the British
              ooonpation of Egypt, and the Anglo-Egypti^n
              reoonquest of the Sudan were aooompanied by
              the minimum of violenoe and brutality towards
              non-oombatants.But it is hopeless to e^peotthe
              unenlightened to hold these views and, in the
              meantime,it is satisfactory tonote that in parts
              of the Turkish Empire,—ve may instanoe Damas-

              to lira together without broils or riots, and by
              their energy and toleration have achieved
              results that would have been thought impos-
              sible ten years ago. The oontentment and
              prosperity of the Turkish E<npiro are almost as
              important to its neighbours as its integrity,
              and we are ready to acknowledge both that

              is in his hands, his diplomatio subtlety has
              enabled him to evade	that he oould

                        <p>Renewed Alliance. Takahashi Interviewed.</p>
                        <p>London, August 31. Reuter's Agency is informed that a new AngloJapanese
                            arrangement was signed by Lord Lansdowne and Baron Hayashi on the 12th
                            inst. It affords mutual guarantees for the protection of Anglo-Japanese
                            interests, even if only threatened by a single hostile power and assures
                            the maintanence of the status quo in the Far East.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Takahashi in an interview with Reuter's Agency said that Japan has no
                            less than thirty-five millions sterling untouched at London, Berlin, and
                            New York. There will threfore be no necessity to issue a new loan, as
                            the available resources of Japan are ample for clearing up the war. If
                            Japan contemplated the issue of a new loan it would be to convert
                            previous loans bearing a higher rate of interest, but he has not heard
                            that the governent has any such intention. He believes that a lasting
                            peace in the Far East will be assured, not only as a consequence of the
                            war but also on account of the new relations between Great Britain and
                            Japan (Reuter).</p>

                            children, and is managed by a British staff, and, although applications
                            for th eadmittance of native children are not infrequently made, they
                            are invariably refused on that ground. There are at present thirty-five

                            on the opening of the new term. The ordinary course includes instruction

                            divinity, singing, drawing, French, and Latin, and to these may be added

                        <p>The increase of the passenger traffic on the state
                            railways is certainly phenomenal when one considers the comparative
                            smallness of the country and the conversative habits of its inhabitants,
                            in many districts locomotion by camel or donkey being still preferred to
                            steam. Yet during the period from the 1st January to the 10th August of
                            this year the augmentation in the number of persons travelling was
                            approximately one and a half millions compared with the same period of
                            1904, the increase in the receipts under this head being L.E. 83,880.
                            The goods traffic also increased enormously, and the increase would have
                            been greater had the administration the requisite rolling stock to cope
                            with it. Notwithstanding this drawback the Government railways carried
                            in the period mentioned 521,432 tons mrore merchandise than last year,
                            with an increase of nearly L.E. 88,000 in the receipts from this branch

                    <head>A NATIONAL CONGRESS</head>
                    <p>Amazing Document</p>
                    <p>We have received a species of manifesto printed in Cairo and drawn up, we
                        should say by some very young men. It is described as a circular of the
                        public advocates, we are assured, has decided to establish a school for
                        young Egyptians anxious to see their country progress. It aims at a campaign
                        against dishonesty and self indulgence and especially against the vices that
                        injure social and family life. The Congress also aims at the formation of a
                        club in Cairo where discussions can be held, with the object of discovering
                        the moral needs of the country, and the methods whereby Egyptians may be
                        educated and enlightened.</p>
                    <p>It aims at persuading the natives of the country to keep the wealth of the
                        country in their hadns, and so to conduct themselves that foreigners will
                        cease to look down on them. In this wasy Egyptians will one day govern
                        themselves. The Congress proposes to bring its views before the Government
                        in the near future. Its suggestions can be summed up as follows.</p>
                    <p>1. Restrictions should be imposed on European immigrants to Egypt with a view
                        to restricting crime and only admitting persons whose antecedents are
                        respectable and possess a certain sum of money.</p>
                    <p>2. Companies should be strictly prohibited from encroaching on the privlieges
                        granted them by the Government.</p>
                    <p>3.The Regulation of all bourse speculations.</p>
                    <p>4. Restrictions should be imposed on exports and imports, so as to check the
                        excessive export of necessaries--such as cereals--and the consequent rise of
                        their price.</p>
                    <p>5. The established of local commissions throughout Egypt to regulate the
                        price of vegetables, bread and meat.</p>
                    <p>6. A thorough inspection of liquor shops. </p>
                    <p>7. Rents should not be permitted to rise above a certain level.</p>
                    <p>8. The 2% rate levied by the Municipality of Alexadria for the construction
                        of the new sea wall to be abolished, the sea wall being now completed.</p>
                    <p>9. The reduction of the salt tax.</p>
                    <p>10. The reduction of the rates levied by the water company.</p>
                    <p>The authors of this document have refrained from signing their names in full,
                        and we have gathered nothing from a study of some rather cryptic initials.
                        As for their suggestions, some appear to us to be unnecessary, the attention
                        of the Government being occupied with the discovery of the means to combat
                        the evils of which the signatories complain, while others are so throoughly
                        mediaeval that we cannot help being amused at the naïveté of the writers,
                        who obviously imaging that the revival of the trade restrictions of the
                        fifteenth century will prove a panacea for any economic ailments from which
                        Egypt suffers.</p>

                    <p>The comments of the native Press on the Accession day of the Sultan bear a
                        decided resemblance to those of Turkish newspapers, published on previous
                        occasions of this kind at Constantinople, and often quoted as examples of
                        what we may cal the 'honorific' style of composition. In reading them we
                        move in august regions peopled by courtly superlatives, resonant titles and
                        cardinal virtues, in a fairy-land of splendour and dignity where debts and
                        difficulties are ignored and where the Commander of the Faithful and the
                        great dignitaries of his Empire receive the endless homage of a contented
                        people. This species of composition cannot perhaps be naturalised in Egypt
                        with complete success. We reproduce the following extract from our
                        contemporary.</p>
                    <p>"AL LEWA."</p>
                    <p>"Twenty-nine years have passed since H.I.M. Sultan Abdul Hamid II. ascended
                        the throne of his illustrious ancestors. Since that date he has revived
                        hopes that seemed to have died, and has preserved the honor of his kingdom,
                        and maintained it in an exalted and honorable position, after finding it a
                        prey to disorder and threatened by ruin. He has smitten down with an iron
                        hand the pernicious rebels who plotted its ruin and has scatterd them
                        abroad. He has watched over the development of science and industry, and has
                        opened schools, institutes, and colleges in every part of his empire, while
                        doing all in his power to preserve the old Moslem teaching from modern and
                        contaminating influences He has continually striven to protect and
                        strengthen the faith and has moreover build numerous warships, constructed
                        railways, and organised a great and victorious army. If the Moslem world
                        celebrates this fete, the Turkish nation celebrates with it the day of its
                        political revival . The committee has therefore organised all measures that
                        will make this celebration fare superior to those of the past in honor of
                        the preservation of our beloved Sultan from te scoundrels who recently
                        attacked him.</p>

                        Fouilles Archeologiques," has recently held an exhibition at the
                        Petit-Palais de Champs Elysees, in which were shown the results of M.A.
                        Gayet's latest campaign of excavations at Antinoe.</p>
                    <p>As is well known this explorer has been working at the site of the Emperor
                        Hadrian's celebrated city at various times since 1896, but no season's
                        explorations have been so fruitful as the last. Hitherto M. Gayet had
                        devoted his attention to the vast necropolis to the north-east of the town,
                        but this cemetery did not possess tombs of the richer or patrician families,
                        though those of various pagan and Christian people were found there of what
                        may be termed well-to-do people.</p>
                    <p>The great men, however, of the capital of the Roman Thebaid were
                        undiscovered, and so this last winter M. Gayet searched in the rocky valleys
                        on the edge of the "Arabian Plateau" toward the Red Sea, and was rewarded by
                        finding a superior style of sepulchres, though most of them had been
                        pillaged, probably in late Persion time under Chosroes, about A.D. 600. The
                        description of the tomb given by the Gayet in the "Catalogue Sommaire" of
                        the Exhibition need not detain us here excepting the account of one, the
                        burial arrangement of which was so unique that it is interesting to read the
                        explorer's description in full. "L'un d'eux, ou je retrouvais le corps d'un
                        gladiateur, offrait cette particularite caracteristique que, sur tout le
                        fond, une epaisse couche de ciment recouvrait les dalles. Une silhouette
                        humaine y avait ete modelee en creux, donnant de profil les lignes
                        d'ensemble du squelette, auquel s'accrochaient les masses figurant le
                        vetement. Les cotes, les os des bras, des jambes, etaient dessines aveo
                        soin; a l'entour, les lignes du rappel de manteau etaient en proportion
                        suffisante. Autre detail non moins important: alors que dans toutes les
                        tombes le mort repose couche sur le dos, le corps du gladiateur etait etendu
                        sur le cote, s'emboitant dans ce moulage, bien qu'il fut un tiers environ
                        plus grand que nature. C'est le seul exemple jusqu'ici de pareil fait
                        observe."</p>
                    <p>The Gayet notes the valuable fact that in Christian burials the mummy holds
                        in his right hand upon the breast the "crown of election" just as in early
                        and late Egyptian tombs the deceased grasped the magic sceptre, Nek, which
                        symbolised the future life in the theology of the ancient priests. Also the
                        presence of portraits in all the tombs of wealthy people is connected
                        evidently with the portraits, from the "Double" or "Ka" spirit in the old
                        Egyptian sepulchres, which in the later were mostly statues and not relief
                        representation of the defunct. The same idea that if the mummy were
                        destroyed, the replica or effigy would take its place appears to have
                        lingered on into Christian times. The custom of gilding the face, fully
                        dwelt upon in the "Egyptian Gazette" in an essay entitled "The Golden
                        Horns," was still practised quite lately at Antinoe, reminding us of the
                        Pharaonic religious literature, promising the deceased should have a "visage
                        shining as the light," or "that the eyes shall see the light." To ensure the
                        fulfilment of this later formula, the mummies in some cases have little
                        rolls of bitumen covered with gold leaf, inserted in the orbital sockets. </p>
                    <p>Among the tombs discovered, the most interesting occupants were a charioteer
                        and a gladiator, doubtless celebrated champions in the circus fetes at
                        Antinoe and a lady "Khelmis" the famous singer of Osiris Antinous, certainly
                        a priestly hierophant in the temple wherein the unfortunate favorite of
                        Hadrian was worshipped under the ceremonial cult of the ancient Egyptian
                        ritual. Other frames appear also to have been those of actors in the Antinoe
                        Olympic games, or of officiants in the "Mysteries" instituded in honor of
                        the lovely youth Antinous. (To be continued.)</p>

                    <p>VITALITY STATISTICS</p>
                    <p>From the latest returns of the statistical office in Cairo we find that the
                        births registered there during the week ending Saturday 19th August, were
                        410, including 3 of European parentage; and the week following 441, which
                        included 6 of the latter category. For the two weeks under review the deaths
                        were 492, of which 9 were of Europeans nationality, and 489, of these 19
                        being Europeans. </p>
                    <p>During the same weekly periods the total number of births at Alexandria were
                        271, of which 12 were of European parentage; and 255, including 6 of the
                        latter category. The deaths totalled 233 for the first week, of which 17
                        were Europeans; and 256, in the second week, including 19 of the latter.</p>
                    <p>It should be remarked that the figures given relating to the births of
                        European children are these sent in by the district inspectors, as the new
                        law compelling the registration of all children belonging to Europeans does
                        not come into operation until it has been approved of by the International
                        Mixed Tribunals, and therefore the returns are apt to be misleading. Such,
                        however, is not the case as regards the mortality statistics.</p>

                    <head>THE CONGO FREE STATE. OFFICIAL COMMUNICATIONS.</head>
                    <p>Mr. E.D. Morel, hon. secretary of the Congo Reform Association, has issued
                        for publication the further correspondence that has passed between his
                        organisation and Lord Lansdowne, the Secretary for Foreign Affairs. Lord
                        Lansdowne's communication, which is dated the 17th inst., is a reply to one
                        from Mr. Morel on the 8th inst., respecting the native witnesses, and it is
                        in the following terms:</p>
                    <p>"I am to inform you that reports of the privations from which these natives
                        are suffering have been received through the ating British Consul at Boma,
                        and his Majesty's Minister at Brussels has been instructed to call the
                        attention of the Congo Government to the matter.</p>
                    <p>"I am to state that the latter recently pointed out to Monsieur de Cuvelier,
                        in the course of converstation, the hardship involved by sending
                        considerable numbers of native witnesses, required in connections with the
                        trial of white men, to Boma from the Upper Congo, and inquired whether such
                        trials could not take place in the Upper Congo. Monsieur de Cuvelier replied
                        that the practice of holding trials, when white men, to Boma from the Upper
                        Congo, and inquired whether such trials could not take place in the Upper
                        Congo. Monsieur de Cuvelier replied that the practice of holding trials,
                        when white men were involved, in the Upper Congo or rather remote districts,
                        had, since 1895, in consequence of the Stokes case, been abandoned, and that
                        it would require serious consideration whether it would be possible to
                        resume the practice of holding trials, of as important a character as those
                        now under discussion anywhere but at the principal seat of justice.</p>
                    <p>"I am to add that his Majesty's Acting Consul at Boma has been instructed to
                        give the native witnesses such assistance as he properly can in their
                        efforts to obtain work during their detention at Boma."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Morel, as a rejoinder, submitted the following to Lord Lansdowne: </p>
                    <p>"In the report to the Sovereign of the State ('Rapport au Roi-Souverain'),
                        dated Brussels, 21st May, 1897 ('Bulletin Offical No. 5 bis, numero
                        supplementaire'), it is stated:</p>
                    <p>In all the districts of the interior the creation of territorial tribunals
                        has been decided, empowered to apply penal law to all residents in the
                        State, native, or other, the courts-martial thus becoming competent only to
                        deal with military cases.</p>
                    <p>"It is true that in the same offical report the value of the new organisation
                        was greatly lessened by the proviso that in cases of 'murder and homicide,'
                        and of 'attempts upon the life or liberty of the natives' (the charges
                        brought against Europeans employed in the Upper Congo, for the prompt local
                        investigation of which the machinery referred to in the previous passages of
                        the report was ostensibly created, being precisely of this character) the
                        Europeans accused should be brought before the Tribunal in the Lower Congo,
                        the object being, as stated in the report, 'to guarantee more efficaciously
                        the repression of particularly grave acts.' But the procedure adopted in
                        various cases would appear to differ not a little. Thus on November 14th,
                        1901, M. Lejeune, an agent of the A.B.I.R. Society, was sentenced by the
                        Territorial Tribunal at Coquilhatville--, which, according to Monsieur de
                        Cuvelier, would appear to be non-existent--to six months' imprisonment, and
                        1,000 frs. fine. The original charges in this case would seem to have been
                        those of making war upon the natives without authorisation, in the course of
                        which the bodies of the slain were alleged to have had their hands removed;
                        and handing out firearms to soldiers contrary to law. M. Lejeune, I
                        understand, was acquitted of the first-named charges by th elocal tribunal,
                        and acquitted of the later on appeal. "Whatever arguments may be adduced by
                        Monsieur de Cuvelier in explanation of the present system of administering
                        justice in the Congo, the resultant effect is, on the one hand, to
                        facilitate the escape of Europeans involved in alleged cases of atrocity; on
                        the other, to bring unmerited sufferings upon native witnesses, and to clos
                        the mouths of native witnesses who would be only too anxious to come forward
                        to testify to the wrongs of which they and their relatives have been, and
                        continue to be, the victims, were local courts authorised to deal with their
                        grievances and were they guaranteed from subsequent persecution.</p>
                    <p>"The present system, in its practical outcome, consitutes, indeed, a negation
                        of justice, and amits of no defence."</p>
                    <p>"In conclusion, I would beg leave to point out respectfully to your lordship
                        that, while the 'careful regulations' indicated by Monsieur de Cuvelier are
                        being elaborated, and while the report of the Commission of Inquiry remains
                        still unpublished, the slaughter and torture of natives in the Upper Congo
                        continue with monotonous persistency.</p>

                        was formed in 1896 with the sole object of assisting British trade in ths
                        country. The services of the Chamber are always at the disposal of any
                        member desiring information on trade matters generally, including the
                        question of appointing suitable agents. As no fee is charged for such
                        advice, it is obviously in the interests of all British traders here to
                        become members, especially when it is remembered that the annual
                        subscription is merely the nominal one of £1. The latter payment also
                        includes a copy of the monthly Journal issued by the Chamber. Home enquirers

            and assures the maintenance of the status q

            Mr. Takahashi in an interview with Rente

            thirty-five millions sterling untouched

            therefore be no necessity to issue a new loa

            3a printed in Cairo and drawn np, we shonld
            a‘ say by some very young men. It is described
            as a circular of the public advocates of a
            National Congress. This congress, we are
            >e assured, has decided to establish a school for
            w young Egyptians anxions to see their country
            progress. It aims at a campaign against dis-
            honesty and self indulgence and especially
            against the vioes that injure social and
            ie family life. The Congress also aims atthe forma-,
            b, tion of a club in Cairo where disoussions can
            ie be held, with the objeot of discovering the
            ie moral needs of the country, and the methods
            whereby Egyptians may be educated and
            enlightened.
            It aims at persnading the natives of the
            68 country to keep the wealth of the country ip
            10 their hands, and so .to condnet themselves that
            m foreigners will cease to look down on them.
            !(* In this way Egyptians will one day govern
            themselves. The Congress proposes to bring
            it* views before the Government in the near
            futnre. Its suggestions can be Bammed np as
            ;h follows.

            ly European immigrants to Egypt with a view
            it to restricting crime and only admitting persons
            )Q whose antecedents are respeotable and possess
            a certain sum of money.

            from encroaching on the privileges granted
            Q. them by the Government,
            in 3.—The Regulation of all bourse specula-

            01	4.—Restrictions should be imposed on ex-
            I	ports and imports, so as to check the excessive

            NATIVE PRESS COMMENTS.
            The comments of the native Press on the
            Accession day of the Sultan bear a decided
            resemblance to those of Turkish newspapers,
            published on previous occasions of this kind
            at Constantinople, and often quoted as exam-
            ples of what we may call the ‘honorific’ style
            of composition. In reading them we move in
            august regions peopled by courtly superlatives,
            resonant titles and cardinal virtues, in a fairy-
            land of splendour and dignity where debts
            and difficulties are ignored and where the
            Commander of the Faithful and the great
            dignitaries of his ^Empire receive the endless
            homage of a contented people. This species of
            composition cannot perhaps be naturalised in
            Egypt with complete success. We reproduce
            the following extract from our contemporary.
            “Ax Lewa.”
            "Twenty-nine years have passed since H.I.M.
            Sultan Abdnl Hamid II. ascended the throne
            of his illustrious ancestois. Since that date be
            has revived hopes that seemed to have died,
            and has preserved the honor of his kingdom,
            and maintained it in an exalted and honorable
            position, after finding it a prey to disorder
            and threatened by rain. He has smitten down
            with an iron hand the pernicions rebels who
            plotted its rain and has scattered them abroad,
            lie has watched over the development of
            -oienoe and industry, and has opened schools,
            institutes, and colleges in every part of
            his empire, while doing all in his power
            to preserve the old Moslem teaching
            from modern and oontaminatiDg influences
            He has continually striven to protect and
            strengthen the faith and has moreover built
            numerous warships, constructed railways, and
            organised a great and victorious army. If the
            Moslem world oelebrates this ffite, the Turkish
            nation celebrates with it the day of its political
            revival. The committee has therefore organised
            ,11 measures that will make this celebration
            far superior to those of the past in honor of
            tho preservation of our beloved Sultan from
            the scoundrels who reoently attaoked him.

            BY JOSEPH OFFORD.
            The new association founded in Haris
            somewhat npon the model of the British,
            Egyptian, and Palestine Exploration Fonda,
            the “Socidt^ Fran^aise de Fouilles Arohdologi-
            ques,” has recently held an exhibition at the
            Petit-Palais de Champs Elysdes, in whioh were
            shown the results of M. A. Gayet’s latest
            campaign of excavations at Antinoe.
            As is well known this explorer has been
            working at the site of the Emperor Hadrian’s
            celebrated oity at various times since 1896,
            bat no season’s explorations have been so fruit-
            ful as the last. Hitherto M. Gayet had
            devoted his attention to the vast necropolis
            to the north-east of the town, bnt this oeme-
            tery did not possess tombs of the rioher or
            patrician families, though those of various
            pagan and Christian people were touqd there
            of what. may be termed well-to-do people.
            The great men, however, of the capital of the
            Roman Thebaid were undiscovered, and so this
            last winter M. Gayet searched in the rocky
            valleys on the edge of the “Arabian Plateau”
            toward the Red Sea, and was rewarded by find-
            ing a superior style of sepulchres, though most
            of them had been pillaged, probably in late
            Persian times under Chosroes, about A.D. 600.
            The description of the tomb given by the
            Gayet in the “Catalogue Sommaire” of the
            Exhibition neednot detain uahereexoeptingthe
            aooonnt of one, the banal arrangement of which
            was so nniqne that it is interesting to read the
            explorer’s description in fulL "L’nn d’eux, oh je
            retrouvais le corps d’un gladiateur.offrait oette
            particularity caractdristique que, sur tout le
            fond, nne dpaisse couche de ciment reoouvnit
            les dalles. Une silhouette humaiue y avait dtd
            modelde eu creux, donnant de profit les ligues
            d’ensemble du squelette, auquel s’aoorochaient
            les masses figurant le vgtement. Les cdtes, les
            os des bras, des jam bee, dtaient dessirds aveo
            soin ; k l’entonr, les lignes dn rappel de man-
            teau ytaient en proportion snffisante. Autre
            detail non moins important: alors que dans
            toutes les tombes le mort repose conchy sur le
            dos, le corps dn gladiatenr ytait y tend a sur le
            c6W, s’emboitant dans ce monlage, bien qn’il
            fftt un tiers environ pins grand que nature.
            C’est le seul exemple jnsqn’iei de pareil fait
            observy.”
            The Gayet notes the valuable fact that in
            Christian burials the mummy holds in his
            right hand upon the breast the “crown of
            election” just as in early and late Egyptian
            tomb3 the deceased grasped the magic sceptre,
            Nek, whioh symbolised the future life in the
            theology of the anoient priests. Also the
            presence of portraits in all the tombs ot
            wealthy people is connected evidently with
            the portraits, from the "Double” or “Ka” spirit
            in the old Egyptian sepulchres, whioh in
            the latter were mostly statues and not relief
            representation of the defnnot The same idea
            that if the mummy were destroyed, the replica
            or effigy would take its place appears to have
            lingered on into Christian times. The custom of
            gilding the face, fully dwelt upon in the
            “Egyptian Gazette” in an essay entitled “The
            Golden Horns,’’was still practised qhite late'y
            at Antinoe, reminding ns of the Pharaonic reli-
            gious literature, promising the deceased should
            have a “visage shining as the light,or “that
            the eyes shall see the light.” To ensure the
            fulfilment of this latter formula, the mummies
            in some cases have little rolls of bitumen
            covered with gold leaf, inserted in the orbital
            sockets.
            Among the tombs discovered, the most inter-
            esting occupants were a charioteer andagladia-
            tor,doubtless celebrated champiousin theoircus
            fetes at Antinoe and a lady “Khelmis” the
            famous singer of Osiris Antinons, certainly a
            priestly hierophant in the temple wherein the
            unfortunate favorite of Hadrian was worshipped
            under the oeremonial cult of the ancient
            Egyptian rituaL Other frames appear also to
            have been those of aotors in the Antinoe
            Olympic games, or of offioiants in the "Mys-
            teries” instituted in honor of the lovely youth
            Antinons.

            From the latest returns of the statistical sect
            office in Cairo we find that the births regis-
            tered there during the week ending Saturday com
            19th August, were 410, inoludiDg 3 of Euro- tiop,
            pean parentage; and the week following 441,	"
            which included 6 of the latter category. For out
            the two weeks under review the deaths were ^l0
            492, of which 9 were of European nationa-
            lity, and 489, of these 19 being Europeans,
            During the same weekly periods the total mB1
            number of births at Alexandra were 271, of t0re
            which 12 were of European parentage; and 255,
            including 6 of the latter category. The deaths
            totalled 233 for the first week, of which 17 —
            wore Europeans; and 256, in the second
            week, including 19 of the latter.
            It should be remarked that the figures
            given relating to the births of European ohil- 0 al

            Mr. E. D. Morel, r hon. secretary of the
            Congo Reform ' Association, has iaened for
            publication the farther correspondence that
            has passed between his organisation and Lord
            L&nsdowne, the Secretary fir Foreign Affairs.
            Lord Lansdowne’s communication, whioh is
            dated the 17th inst., is a reply to One from Mr.
            Morel on the 8th inst., respecting the native
            witnesses, and it is in the following terms:
            "I am to inform you that reports of the
            privations from whioh these natives are suffer-
            ing have been received through the acting
            British Consul at Boma, and his Majesty’s
            Minister at Brussels has been fristfneted to (ill
            the attention of the Congo Government to the
            matter.
            “I am to state that the latter recently point- ]
            ed ont to Monsieur de Cavelier, in the oonne ani
            of conversation, the hardship involved by send- an
            ing considerable, numbers of native witnesses,
            required in connection with the trial of white
            men, to Boma from the Upper Congo, and
            inquired whether such trials oonld not jei
            place in the Upper Congo. Monsieur de Cave- ?l
            lier replied that the practice cf holding tijala,
            when white man were involve^, in the Upper
            Congo or rather remote distriots, had, since g‘
            1895, in conseqnenoe of the Stokes case, been 7T
            abaadoned. and that it would require serious g
            consideration whether it would he possible to 01
            resume the practice of holding trade, of as
            important a character as those now under
            disoussion anywhere bnt atthe principal seat of ws
            justice.	in
            “I am to add th&t his Majesty’s Acting
            Consul at Boma has been instructed to give
            the D&tive witnesses such assistance as he
            properly oan in their efforts to obtain work
            during their detention at Boma.”	P3*
            Mr. Morel, as a rejoinder, submitted the
            following to Lord Lansdowne :
            “In the report to the Sovereign of the Qj
            State (‘Rapport an Roi-Souverain’), dated ^
            Brussels, 21st May, 1897 (‘Bulletin Official
            No. 5 bis, numero aupplementaire’), it ia ^
            stated:
            In all the districts of the interior the
            creation of territorial tribunals has been ,
            decided, empowered to apply penal law to ac
            ail residents in the State, native, or other, _
            the courts-martial thus becoming com-
            petent only to deal with military eases.
            “It is true that in the same official report
            the value of the new organisation was greatly p.
            lessened by the proviso that in cases of ‘murder
            and homioide,’ and of ‘attempts npon the life
            or liberty of the natives’ (the charges brought
            against Europeans employed in the Upper
            Congo, for the prompt local investigation of ^
            whioh the machinery referred to in the pro- t0.
            vious paseages of the report was ostensibly
            created, being precisely of this character) the
            Europeans accused should be brought before
            the Tribunal in'the Lower Congo, the objeot by
            being, as stated in the report, ‘to guarantee 00
            more efficaciously the repression of particular-
            ly grave aots.’ Bat the procedure adopted in
            v*rions oases would appear to differ not a
            little. Thus on November i4th, 1901, M.
            Lejeune, an agent of the A.B.I.R. Society,
            was sentenced by the Territorial Tribunal at
            Coquilhatville—,whioh, aooording to Monsieur
            de Cuvelier, would appear to be non-existent gt
            —to six months’ imprisonment, and 1,000 fri>. „
            fine. The original charges in this ease would U
            seem to have been those of making war npon
            the natives without authorisation, in the tb
            oourse of whioh the bodies of the slain were
            alleged to have had their hands removed ;
            and handing out firearms to soldiers oontrary •
            to law. M. Lejeune, I understand, was so- 1U
            quitted of the first-named oharges by the looal
            tribunal, apd acquitted of the latter on appeal.
            “Whatever arguments may be adduced by
            Monsieur de Cuvelier in explanation of the
            present system of administering justice in the
            Congo, the resultant effect is, on the one hpud,
            to facilitate the escape of Europeans involved „
            in alleged oases of atrocity ; on the other, p
            to bring unmerited sufferings upon native wit- 6
            nesses, and to close the months of native
            witnesses who would be only too anxious to
            come forward to testify to the wrongs of whioh n
            they and their relatives have been, apd con- w
            tinue to be, the victims, were local courts 1
            authorised to deal with their grievances and
            were they guaranteed from subsequent per- p,
            secntioD.	t;	Vf
            “The present system, in its praotical out- “
            come, constitutes, indeed, a negation of jus-
            tics, and admits of no defence.	r	*1
            “In conclusion, I would bsg leave to point
            out reapeotfully to your lordship that, while Mi
            the ‘oareful regulations’ indicated by Monsieur
            de Cuvelier are being e’aborafed, and while 0-
            the report of the Commission of Inquiry re-

              QUESTIONS D’ACTUALITE
              Le Krach Cronier
              Lea Sucreries et Rafliuerie d'Egypte, aprAs
              avoir AtA un moment trAs bas,ont oldturA A Paris
              A fr. 53.
              Une reunion de quelques banqnes de notre
              place a ea lieu mercredi soir : dies ont dAcidf!
              de ne pas engager de nonvelles affaires (achat
              de change, avances sur marchandisea etc.) avec
              la SociAtA, tant qne des nonvellea precises et
              certaines garanties ne leur seront pas fonrnies.
              Plnsieurs dApSches privees sont parvenues b.
              certains Atablissements de notre ville. Elies se
              contredisent pour la plnpart. La plus pessi-
              mists est sans contredit la suivante, re^ue par
              nne banque frangaise, “Capital englouti, obli-
              gations compromises” la cause: “la SociAtA
              des Sucreries ayant garanti 25 millions d’ac
              captations de la Raffinerie Say.” %
              Les 25 millions de perte ont sans doute dejA
              AtA escomptes par nos bourses de valeurs. Mais,
              avant d’inscrire une telle somme an passif des
              Sucreries Agyptiennes, faut-il encore que la
              Raffinerie Say refuse le payement integral de
              cette somme.
              Pour 1’execution d’une saisie Aventuelle sur
              l’actif de la SociAtA des sucreries 1 'exequatur
              est tout au moins nAeessaire. L’intervention
              des crAanciers Agyptiens A tant certaine, il s’en-
              suivra un procAs fort intAressant dont l’issue
              ne sera pas, souhaitons-le, de nature A dAses-
              pArer les actionnaires.
              A.S.
              La chasse aux filets
              Toute la cote d’Alexandrie jusqu’A la pointe
              d’Aboukir est tendue de filets pour la prise
              des cailles. Ces intAressants volatiles qui vien-
              nent ioi pour la saison d’hiver ne se trouvent
              done nullement protAgAs par le dAcret khAdi-
              vial interdisant la pose de filets A moins d’un
              kilomAtre de distance du rivage sur les terrains
              du gouvemement. C’est qu’en efietlacote pres-
              que entiere appartient A des partiouliers et
              ceux-ci ne se font pas faute d’installer des en-
              gine sur leurs propriAtAs. lies parcelles appar-
              tenant A l’Etat sont clairsemAes et couvertes de
              chasseurs dont les coups de feu rApAtAs re-
              jettent les malheureuses bAtes dans les filets
              voisins.
              Pour que le dAcret khAdivial ait quelque
              efficacitA il faudrait dresser les cailles, leur en-
              seigner les passages fibres, les accoutumer au
              feu et leur enseigner A passer A une certaine
              hauteur et toujours isolAes.
              Le proteoteur de ces oiseaux qui s’est donnA
              tant de mouvement pour obtenir la publication

              La dAfense de chasser et de vendre les bec-
              figues devait nous prAserver d’une foule de
              maux, en particulier de l’invasion des insectes
              et des chenilles. Et voilA qu’un an aprAs la
              mise en vigueur de 1’arrfitA ministAriel, nous
              sommes menacAs de l’invasion de toutes sortes
              d’insectes, de sauterelles et de chenilles:
              jamais le ver du ooton n’avait mis en plus grand
              pAril la prinoipale culture du pays, A tel point,
              que, sans les mesures promptes et vigoureuses
              prises par le Gouvemement, nous allions as-
              sister A une rAAdition des flAaux d’Egypte dont
              il est parlA dans la Bible.

              THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 1905
              DOWN THE CHAGRES.
              Matachin is the half way station on the line
              of the Panama railroad. Here the trains pass
              0.) their daily trip across the Isthmus. Here
              also the Rio Chagres, after descending from
              the higher and more remote ranges, sweeps
              sharply round and makes its way down the
              broad valley, to the ocean near Colon. No
              river within the equatorial area bears a more
              sinister reputation. It has given the name to
              one of the most pernicious forms of tropical
              fevers; while its sinuous course, crossing and
              recrossing the axis of the Panama Canal, its
              sudden floodings and destructive force, make
              it the most formidable difficulty which the
              engineers and contractors of the undertaking
              have to overcome. So impossible of control is
              it that it is proposed to intercept it, and, as
              it were, hang it up out of the way on the
              mountain side. It is navigable by native
              coyuka from Colon to Matachin, but only
              those well versed in its temper and vagaries
              use it to any extent.
              A study of the canal plan showed that the
              best method of seeing the works on the
              Atlantic slope of the Cordillera was to go by
              river. When I made the suggestion to the
              dark-skinned Colombian in the village store
              he stared, and said he had never known white
              men attempt the trip. What was the use when
              the railroad was there ? The Senor would but
              take the fever and end the journey at Hjlonkey
              Hill. But as the Senor persisted he summoned
              two river man, one a yellow-faced native, the
              other a negro, and after much palaver a bargain
              -»as struck. It was then ten o’clock on a hot
              ning.
              ,'he canoe lay in a bend of the river below
              the village. The spot appeared to be the
              common lavadero, and presented a scene
              of primeval simplicity. A score of women,
              scant!y clad, were sitting in the water,
              pounding and rubbing clothes, their naked
              children sprawling on the banks behind. In
              the stream a number of natives were bathing.
              Occasionally the bolder spirits among these
              swam forward to chaff the women, who laugh-
              ingly pelted them with pobbles.
              Tho canoe, which was cut out of a wild tama-
              rind tree, was large and narrow, and light and
              unsteady enough to make the baggage welcome
              ballast. The men themselves were lightly
              equipped. They merely wore bine pants tucked
              up to the knees, and old terai hats, and they
              brought with thsm two paddles, a long pole,
              and a conch shell. The negro limped from a
              sore in his foot, and explained that his toe had
              been attacked the previous night by a vampire
              bat, which paid him frequent visits, though he
              was never conscious of the bloodsucking
              nrnnAflfl nntil he awoke.
              musio, and out of it stole a large canoe,
              heavily laden with bananas, ar.d carrying a
              number of Indian men and women. They were
              apparently on their way to Colon with the
              produce, and were warding off evil spirits by
              ohanting a native melody. They answered our
              warning call with a weird “Co-o ee.”
              About five miles fiom Colon the canal and
              the river finally parted, and the latter ran to
              its outlet through the dismal, death-like
              swamps and lagoons that breed the Chagres
              fever. The channel was here and there choked
              with reeds and silted up with sand and mnd,
              though there was no movement of any kind
              perceptible. The stagnant, foetid water was
              luminous with phosphorescence, and the air
              was rank with miasma. If choked and
              sickened me ; I could not breathe it, but lay
              with a handkerchief stuffed into my mouth and |
              nostrils, yet feeling as if the odour were;
              penetrating the whole body. The moon had j
              risen, casting a melancholy glamour over tho j
              scone, and by its light could be seen amazing j
              evidences of extravaganoe and waste in miles
              of engineering material lying decomposing in
              the rotting slime.
              The lights of Colon gleamed at last, and at
              eleven o’clook we emerged from the canal and
              crossed the salt bay, rippling under a fresh
              sea wind, and landed among the masonry of a ,
              broken breakwater at the canal headquarters, j
              The men shouldered my baggage, and we i
              moved off towards the town, when I heard a !
              low whistle, and a number of shadowy figures
              advanced from different points. They wore
              native soldiers, and we were placed under
              arrest. Of what avail was it to protest? Were
              we not revolutionaries? Was I not the leader
              of a band of Liberals coming to seize and saok
              the town!
              HISTORIC DISCOVERIES IN
              MASHONALAND.
              Dr. Carl Peters, the well-known explorer, has ,
              just returned to London after an extended j
              tour in South Africa, principally in Rhodesia,!
              where he has made some interesting historic
              i discoveries tending to confirm his theory that
              ! Mashonaland is the ancient Land of Ophir. ‘T
              J went first to Nort-East Mashonaland,” said Dr
              i Peters to a Press representative,“to investigate
              ■	some mining properties, and also to look for
              ! more evidence of my Ophir theory. I have
              1 managed to place the Ophir of the Bible in
              ! these countries between the Zambesi and the
              j Limpopo, and as a result of my interest-
              ing archaeological explorations there I found
              J several inscriptions of an ancient Arab cha-
              ■	racter, which I have brought to Europe to be
              | deciphered, and which I think will be able
              j finally to solve the question of ancient civilisa-
              i tion in these countries. So far, one inscription
              has been deciphered by au eminent German
              ! Orientalist, Dr. Giasar, as meaning “Sophar,”
              which is the name of the capital in South
              Arabia, and at the same time is the root of
              the name “Sofala,” a port in East Africa.
              The inscription, which was on a stone, is
              about 1,700 years old. Two other stones
              which I have brought home have been classi-
              ■	fied as Babylonian boundary-stones. The re-
              j maining stones have been sent to Hanover
              to have the inscriptions deciphered. When
              I was in Johannesburg I was asked by the
              British Association to give a lecture there
              on my discoveries, but as I was obliged by
              business to come home, I shall give a lec-
              ture on the subject as soon as the inscrip-
              tions on all the stones have been thoroughly
              investigate'! That is only one side of my
              expedition, however. 1 have been olosely
              examining Rhodesia on its mining and
              agricultural prospects. While I find that
              the mining prospeots are muoh better than
              many people have thought— for ir stance,
              there care traces of tin all over North-East
              Mashonaland, and at the same time large
              copper deposits—! do not thiuk much of the
              agricultural prospects, for the reason that the
              soil is everywhere very thin. Generally spe -k-
              ing, after 8'x to eight inches you get to bed
              rock. Of oourse, there are exceptions.”
              ROMAN EEM AINSIN SCOTIAND p
              l
              Since Febrnary 14 of this year a staff of
              workmen, under the direction of Mr. James
              Curie, F.S.A., Scot., has been engaged making
              excavations near Newstead, Melrose, in a
              Roman a'ation which, so far as known, is the
              largest in Scotland, it being believed from the P
              trenches cut that the station extends to at ■
              least 14 acres. The camp at Caatlecary extends
              to two and a half acres, that atBirrens, Dum-
              friesshire, to about four acres, and that at
              Camelon is under six acres, while the largest
              of the Northumberland camps iB not over five
              and a half acres. The work of exoavating,
              which is being carried out at the instanoe of
              the Sooiety of Antiquaries of Scotland, is still
              being proceeded with, and, so far, of the total mi
              ! area not more than three and a half acres have j)(
              i been touched. The camp is mainly situated ^
              j in what is called the Red Abbeystead field,
              | but important works have been come upon
              : in the Wellmeadow and the Guttorflat fields. tj,
              A party from the Berwickshire Naturalists’ gQ
              Club were on the ground some time ago, and ^
              Mr. Curie gave an interesting description of ^
              the work that had been accomplished since w
              operations began in February, and he detailed ^
              the various discoveries made. They were ^
              j standing, he said, in a Roman station whioh
              ! was absolutely forgotten in every way, the g
              | name of it was not known, nor was any maTk y.
              of it to be feen above ground. About 1743 the w
              Rev. Adam Milne wrote a description of the jj
              parish of Melrose. Writing of Old Melrose, he
              said :—“About a mile to the west there was p,
              an abbacy standing in a field oalled the Red tr
              Abbeystead. It was not known whether this
              name was derived from the colour of the stones ^
              wherewith it was built, or whether it was a jn
              house belonging to the knights of the Red
              Templars, but it was certain that when the <jj
              field was ditched or ploughed the foundations ai
              of several houses were found, a great deal ^
              of lead, and some curious seals.” Then came c(
              , General Roy, who in 1769-71 inspected the g,
              i roads in North Britain. He said the only signs j £
              • of a Roman station were some entrenchments !

              A lecture was given recently at Pieter- hi
              naritzburg, on ‘ Sleeping Sickness” by Colonel ^
              David Bruce, C.B..F.R.S., Royal Army Medi U
              jal Corps.	w
              Colonel Bruce introduced the subject by si
              showing that it was by no means impoBsib'e P<
              that this disease, sleeping sickness, might pass tl
              southward from Lake Victoria and Central si
              Africa and reaoh the Zambesi, or even invade &
              some parts of the TransvaaL The disease h
              was endemio on the West Coast of Africa, E
              especially in the basin of the Congo, and here A
              it had been known as long as we had any fi
              history of that country. Slaves taken from ci
              the West Coast had died of the disease in ei
              the West Indies and other countries, but tl
              without spreading the disease to their imme- k
              diate neighbours.	$
              Sleeping sickness first broke out in the n
              province called Busoga. It was probably in- ii
              traduced when Emin Pasha’s Sudanese and o
              their wives and followers, numbering some tl
              ten thousand, were brought into and settled s
              in Busoga. These natives were brought from si
              the Congo territory, a country in which the ii
              disease had been endemic for a long time, tl
              and, therefore, it was hardly to be expected c
              that this large number of natives would not “
              contain a certain number suffering from the ii
              first stages of the disease. As this country, d
              Busoga, was well adapted for the spread of v
              sleeping sickness, in a few years—viz, in 1901 s
              —the disease had attained such dimensions
              that in a short time it reduced the most >
              populous and fertile province of Uganda to a
              d ran la ted desert,	'	f
              oping sickness was a curious disease, and '

              -»	*ing his ordinary work for
              mds noticing that there was
              er ; but gradually a slight
              tieut’s demeanour became
              evident; be was less inclined to exert himself,
              fib lay about more during the day ; and at last
              fife intimates saw that he had the first symp
              toms of this absolutely fatal malady.His symp-
              toms gradually deepened, and after a year or
              so—it might be longer—he was unable to
              walk, unable to speak, and even unable to feed
              himself, and he gradually sank into a comatose
              condition and died. Sleeping sickness was
              caused by the entrance into the blood of a
              minute protozoal parasite called Trypanosoma
              ggmbienso. The micro-organism was first named
              and described by Dr. Dutton, who recently lost
              healthy animals by means of a biting fly, the
              G lossina morsitans. It was, therefore, thought
              that in all probability sleeping siokness would
              be foind also to be conveyed by a biting fly.
              jarge collections of all the biting flies of
              Jganda were made, and the astonishing result
              was arrived at that the distribution of sleeping
              sickness and of a biting fly, the Glotsina pal
              pedis, corresponded absolutely with one ano-
              ther. Experiments were then made, whioh
              showed that this biting fly, Glossina patpalis,
              could cany the disease from the sick to the
              lealtby for a period of at least 48 hours.
              Sxperiments made with other speoiea of bitin g
              flies, made under exaotly the same conditions,
              failed to give any result. Lastly, tsetse flies
              caught in the sleeping sickue s areas and p'ac-
              ed straightway on healthy monkeys conveyed
              the disease in every case. This disease, which
              killed every one it attaoked, had already oaus-
              ed the death of some hundreds of thousands of
              natives in Central Afrioa. It was slowly spread-
              ing wherever there was a Glossina palpalis to
              convey it. It ww now spreading north along
              the Nile from Lake Albert. It was slowly
              spreading round Lake Albert, had reached the
              south of Lake Viotoria, and there was no say-
              ing to what extent it would further devastate
              this country. There was a danger of its being
              conveyed across British East Afrioa into the
              “fly belts” of the east coast; even danger of
              its being conveyed to India, where a similar
              disease, oalled surra, existed among horses, and
              where there might exist a biting fly capable of
              spreading it
              process until he awoke.
              With a long blast from the conoh we swung
              into the current, and made a descent as ex
              citing as it was swift. The negro used hi
              paddle and the Colombian the pole to guidi
              the canoe among the rooks aud derelict logi

              In the qu eter stretches both men paddled
              It was a oiuudiess and windless day, and th
              air was aglare with heat. The vegetatioi
              hung limp and motionless, the birds wer
              mute, lizards and iguanas drowsed upon th
              banks, even the alligators could hardly fim
              energy to drop into the water as we approach
              ed. We passed them at every turn. One
              , i when I seized a dead bough embedded i
              Ithe mud to ward off the canoe I saw th
              gnarled snout of one within a couple of fee
              of my hand. Now and then we came acros
              an Indian fishing, or, more rarely, one struf
              gling in his coyoka upstre.m.
              | We came frequently in touch with th
              I canal. Here it was banked up and shut o
              j from the river ; there the two joined an
              ! became one. Magnificent dredges were chaine
              I to the banks, and wagons, cranes, and othc
              1 materia! lay rusting in the jungle. What
              saw ot the excavations showed that muo
              good work had been done, and that mos
              of it is still in as good condition as whe
              the navvies ceased digging. A wiry scru
              has overrun the banks and aoted as a bindc
              for the soil. The real menace to the wot
              is, of course, the .flooding of tho river, fc
              when it “comes down” it carries all befor
              it. We passed under one lofty bridge eve
              which the water had swept during a freshe
              The white sandstone piers of this bridge, b
              the way, were red with blood ; it was th
              ^ scene of a laaguinary fight between the Gi

              J of a Roman station were some entrenchmentu 1 g
              j near the village of Eildon. After this the disco-! _
              1 very of two Roman altars was made, the first ^
              being found in 1783. The second altar, which '
              was found in 1830, was dedicated by the oen- (j
              turion of the 20th Legion to the god Silvanns.
              In 1846 came the cutting of the railway, which ^
              threw more light on the subject than any ^
              discovery hitherto made. In the cutting to
              | the south of the Red Abbeystead field
              there were found pits filled with black a
              peaty mat»er,in whioh were portions of Samian (]
              , ware, deer bones, &o. The most interesting
              !! disoovery ot all, however, was the skeleton of i
              a soldier standing erect in one of the pits, with
              hiu spear beside him and part of the wooden
              : shaft still existing. No doubt, what was then
              1 cut through was the cemetery of the place.
              After this the place, so far as antiquaries were
              concerned, was deserted until the spring of
              ! 1904, when, during draining operations in the '■
              Red Abbeystead field, there were discovered
              ,1 foundations of buildings, a line of curiously J
              , jointed water pipes, some Samian ware, &c. It (
              was thought the buildings were worth .in\1
              . j vestigating, and the matter being brought be-1 f
              . fore the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, j 1
              j | they decided to take it up. Operations were j
              , 1 begun on February 14 of this year. All the-(
              j) buildings which had been come upon were ' (
              ,! large. In the Gutterflat field (two fields away)!}
              . ■ there had been traced what appeared to be a !
              .' large annexe ot the camp, containing about j ‘
              j: four acres. There had also been found a big
              j building with an apse, which was no doubt the .
              r bath of the place. They had not had time to j
              1 go further there. In the Wellmeadow (the ]
              t field adjoining Red Abbeystead) they had (
              j found a rampart 45ft. wide lying partly in stone
              paving. Inside this they came upon a stone
              t platform 15ft wide, and on the north it (
              3 was bounded by a deep-built drain. On (
              j the outside of the rampart lay a ditch .
              3 21ft. wide and ljft. deep and two subsidiary
              . ditches and ramparts. The buildings in the ■
              i Red Abbeystead field formed six blocks, and (
              five were barrack like buildings over 200ft. in
              length. They were separated from each other
              by roads about 29ft wide, having footpaths on
              one side. The sixth building was of better and
              i heavier masonry, showing one good buttress
              and well-defined oross wall. At one end there
              had been noted a number of crosB walls with ’
              what might be broken-down flues. Behind it
              was a long builcfing in heavy buttresses, whioh '
              might have been one of those great storehouses
              , that were common in Roman oamps. With
              regard to the articles found, there had been '
              0 discovered so far a quantity of ordinary rough
              pottery, Samian ware, and large pieces with i
              3 the potters’ marks similar to those found in
              Antonine’s Wall. Several brooches had been !
              come upon, a circnlar one of pale blue enamel
              l' with six round spots of red enamel on it, being '
              tho most interesting of these. Suoh brooohes
              t were very rare in Sootland, Mr. Curie stated,
              Camelon being the only plaoe where they got
              t good specimens of them. With regard to coins,
              they had found a fair number in denari of I
              r Nsro, Domitian, Vitellius, Hadrian (2), An-
              toninus Pius, and Crispina j and in brass,
              j coins of Faustina the Elder and Trajan. 'They
              q hal also come across one fragment of inscrip-
              tion on stone and a number of iron implements.
              Under the ramp trt to which he had already
              referred they found a ditch of an older oamp,
              and in the bottom of the ditoh they had got a
              typical Romau stylus of bronze.

              0 pursuing the study of this disease. The trypan-
              0 osome was an active, wormlike oreatnre,which
              0 lived among tho red blood oorpnscles, where it

              0 siokness were examined with sufficient care
              0 this parasite would be found in every ease. It
              ? was also found in fairly large numbers in the
              10 lymphatjc glands of the body, and as the dis-
              0 ease advanced it could always be found in the

              Sleeping sickness in Uganda had a very
              )g peculiar distribution, and the country oan be
              divided into sleeping siokness areas and non-
              0 sleeping sickness areas. An examination of the
              . natives living in the sleeping sickness areas
              ? showed that some 30 per cent, of them were
              in the early stages of the disease, and their
              f blood contained thess trypanosomes. On the
              other hand, although a large number of natives
              P were examined in the non-sleeping sickness
              ^ areas, in not a single case could a trypanosome
              be foand ; further, when blood or cerebro-
              0	spinal fluid was injooted under the skin of a
              j healthy monkey the animal took the disease anf
              died after several months with typical symp-

              When the Royal Society Commission which
              had been sent to Uganda in th9 spring of 1903
              ^ hod discovered these facts, they came to the
              q conclusion that this trypanosoma was the true
              ’ oause of the disease. The next point they took
              y up was to try to discover the reason of the
              ’ oarions distribution of the disease in Uganda.
              Sleeping sickness was only found in a narrow
              y area lying along the shore of the lake. It was
              found on both bands of the Nile as far as Lake
              Albert; it also occurred round the shore of
              Lake Albert and passed north along the Nile
              almost as far as Wadelai. The disease whs very
              ~ common among the inhabitants ot the nume-
              rous small islands whioh dotted the northern
              part of Lake Viotoria. It was evident, then,
              that the disease had some predileotion for the
              vicinity of open water, and the oommission set
              about to try to find ont the cause of this. In
              1	3outh Afrioa there was a disease among oattle
              m and other domestio animals, also caused by a
              trypanosome—the Trypanosoma brueei. This

              great curve from Bobio to Colon, a distance
              about fifteen miles. There are few more beai
              ful avenues of water in the tropics. The ol
