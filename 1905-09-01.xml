                    <head>THE SULTAN'S ACCESSION.</head>
                    <p>To-day Egypt is celebrating the anniversary of the aooession of its de jure
                        suierain, Saltan Abdnl Hamid Khan of Turkey, and whatever the sympathies of
                        many of our readers they oannot fail to be impressed by the enthusiasm which
                        a large seotion of the Moslem popu- lation displays when honoring the aooes-
                        sion day of the Commander of the Faithful. Then an many reasons for this
                        attitude, which at first sight seems inexplicable on the pert of a peopla
                        which is lees directly under Turkish influence than any other tributary
                        provinoe of the Ottoman Hmpira,sxoept perhaps Bulgaria, and over which

                        of these reasons we not attempt to discuss ; others can be openly treated in
                        these columns, and deserve to be noted by those who allow their iudignalioo
                        at the misdeeds of certain of the Saltan's servants to blind them to the
                        progress which the Ottoman Empire has made under his rule and to his genuine
                        popularity with a large proportion—not only of his Moslem subjects, but of
                        the Sunni Moslems of the world First and foremost of these oauses is the
                        spread of what we may call the Pan-Islamio idea, which emphasises the
                        spiritual headship of the Sultan over the Snnni Moslems, lo Mesopotamia and
                        Syria, in Kurdistan, in Central Asia and Tripoli, this dootrine, which had
                        become almost a formula, has reoently been revived and is fast becoming a
                        belief. It has had a certain influenoe among a seotion of the Moslems of
                        Algeria, India and Egypt, though there can he no harm in recording our
                        opinion that the bestowal of honors and rewards on its chief promoters in
                        these ooantries has oaused so loud and vigorous an outbnnt of gratitude that
                        it is a little diffioult to hear the opinions of theplain man. It has met
                        with fierce opposition alone in Arabia, where an influential minority longs
                        for the return of the days of Haronn-El- Rashid, andwhere the majority of
                        the population is composed either of Zaidis and Wahabis, who eaoh claim to
                        be the sole possessors of the true doctrine, or of nomads, whose seonlar
                        avocations of stock-raising and brigandage leave them little time for
                        meditation on the beauties of dogma. But elsewhere this dootrine, in its
                        revived form, hinting at something more than a spiritual unity of the
                        Moslems, has. made progress, and alt students of eaatenv^ politios must take
                        note of its tendencies and development. Another cause of the warmth shown in
                        celebrating the Sultan's aooession, is the undoubted eoonomio progress made
                        by Turkey since 1876. We do not here propose to enquire how muoh of this
                        progress is really attributable to European capital and European aoienoe,
                        somewhat grudgingly per- mitted to take apart in the exploitation of the
                        Turkish dominions, or to what extent public works, which are professedly
                        inspired by eoonomio and oommeroial ideals, are really politioal and
                        strategical in their intention. Bat progress has been made and to the "man
                        in the street" the faot is suffioient Finally we oome to the reoent escape
                        of the Sultan (rom a singularly oruel and stupid attempt at assassination
                        which destroyed a number of innooent lives, and had it proved snocessful,
                        would have caused a terrible explo- sion of rage and hatred among hundreds
                        of thousands of Moslems. The foot that the Sultan bore himself) after the
                        wtplnfioT«, with the dignity and self possession that befit a Khalif and a
                        ruler of the house of Othman, is of more importance in the eyes of his
                        subjects, than the sealvenations of his subordinates, and in the eyes of
                        Egyptians, then the arrest of the lnokless journalists, sheikhs, or busmen
                        men seeking a holiday in Syria and Palestine. All said and done the world
                        judges externals first.</p>
                    <p>We can therefore understand the enthusiasm which is being displayed oii this
                        oooasion by many of the Moslems of Egypt. With this enthusiasm we have no
                        quarrel, and our opinion of the methods ot repression adopted against
                        Christians in Armenia and Maoedonia, against Druses in the Hauran, and
                        Zaidis in the Yemen does not blind ns to the faot that the Moslem world
                        looks upon the wholesale slaughter or forced conversion of peoples who have
                        rebellednot against the Sultan, but against thefrantiomullahandthe rapacious
                        taxgatherer, not against theMoslem bat against the paid spy and the venal
                        judge, with comparative indiffe- rence—not to say callousness. The
                        indictment may seem too harsh, but we think that it will be admitted by all
                        who are in touch with eastern affairs that, with the exception of the
                        enlight- ened Mobamedans of Egypt and fndia, the followers of the prophet
                        oan with difijonlty be persuaded that even rebellions schismatics and
                        infidels do not deserve torture and oatraga. Whatever the crimes of European
                        armies in the past, the Russo-Turkish war, the British ooonpation of Egypt,
                        and the Anglo-Egypti^n reoonquest of the Sudan were aooompanied by the
                        minimum of violenoe and brutality towards non-oombatants.But it is hopeless
                        to e^peotthe unenlightened to hold these views and, in the meantime,it is
                        satisfactory tonote that in parts of the Turkish Empire,—ve may instanoe
                        Damas- cus and Beyrout -.energetic and honest Walis have made it possible
                        forChristians and Moslems to lira together without broils or riots, and by
                        their energy and toleration have achieved results that would have been
                        thought impos- sible ten years ago. The oontentment and prosperity of the
                        Turkish Empiro are almost as important to its neighbours as its integrity,
                        and we are ready to acknowledge both that progress has been made on these
                        respects under the reign of Abd el Hamid I£han end that no monaroh has
                        worked harder for what heoonoeived to be the welfare ofhiasubjeots than the
                        present Sultan. The whole machinery religions and politioal, of the vast
                        organisation is in his hands, his diplomatio subtlety has enabled him to
                        evade that he oould not repel, and his inflexible determination to preserve
                        intaot the dominion of his house has communicated itself to his armies in
                        reoent wars, and may yet lead Ahmed Paisi Pasha to viotory over the armies

                        <div type="cable">    <dateline>London, August 31.</dateline><p> Reuter's Agency is informed that a new AngloJapanese
                            arrangement was signed by Lord Lansdowne and Baron Hayashi on the 12th
                            inst. It affords mutual guarantees for the protection of Anglo-Japanese
                            interests, even if only threatened by a single hostile power and assures
                            the maintanence of the status quo in the Far East.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Takahashi in an interview with Reuter's Agency said that Japan has no
                            less than thirty-five millions sterling untouched at London, Berlin, and
                            New York. There will threfore be no necessity to issue a new loan, as
                            the available resources of Japan are ample for clearing up the war. If
                            Japan contemplated the issue of a new loan it would be to convert
                            previous loans bearing a higher rate of interest, but he has not heard
                            that the governent has any such intention. He believes that a lasting
                            peace in the Far East will be assured, not only as a consequence of the
                            war but also on account of the new relations between Great Britain and
                            Japan (Reuter).</p>

                            will recommence its classes on October 2. This school, which was opened
                            in 1903, is confined entirely to British children, and is managed by a
                            British staff, and, although applications for th eadmittance of native
                            children are not infrequently made, they are invariably refused on that

                        <p>The increase of the passenger traffic on the state railways is certainly
                            phenomenal when one considers the comparative smallness of the country
                            and the conversative habits of its inhabitants, in many districts
                            locomotion by camel or donkey being still preferred to steam. Yet during
                            the period from the 1st January to the 10th August of this year the
                            augmentation in the number of persons travelling was approximately one
                            and a half millions compared with the same period of 1904, the increase
                            in the receipts under this head being L.E. 83,880. The goods traffic
                            also increased enormously, and the increase would have been greater had
                            the administration the requisite rolling stock to cope with it.
                            Notwithstanding this drawback the Government railways carried in the
                            period mentioned 521,432 tons mrore merchandise than last year, with an
                            increase of nearly L.E. 88,000 in the receipts from this branch of the

                    <head>A NATIONAL CONGRESS</head>
                    <p>Amazing Document</p>
                    <p>We have received a species of manifesto printed in Cairo and drawn up, we
                        should say by some very young men. It is described as a circular of the
                        public advocates, we are assured, has decided to establish a school for
                        young Egyptians anxious to see their country progress. It aims at a campaign
                        against dishonesty and self indulgence and especially against the vices that
                        injure social and family life. The Congress also aims at the formation of a
                        club in Cairo where discussions can be held, with the object of discovering
                        the moral needs of the country, and the methods whereby Egyptians may be
                        educated and enlightened.</p>
                    <p>It aims at persuading the natives of the country to keep the wealth of the
                        country in their hadns, and so to conduct themselves that foreigners will
                        cease to look down on them. In this wasy Egyptians will one day govern
                        themselves. The Congress proposes to bring its views before the Government
                        in the near future. Its suggestions can be summed up as follows.</p>
                    <p>1. Restrictions should be imposed on European immigrants to Egypt with a view
                        to restricting crime and only admitting persons whose antecedents are
                        respectable and possess a certain sum of money.</p>
                    <p>2. Companies should be strictly prohibited from encroaching on the privlieges
                        granted them by the Government.</p>
                    <p>3.The Regulation of all bourse speculations.</p>
                    <p>4. Restrictions should be imposed on exports and imports, so as to check the
                        excessive export of necessaries--such as cereals--and the consequent rise of
                        their price.</p>
                    <p>5. The established of local commissions throughout Egypt to regulate the
                        price of vegetables, bread and meat.</p>
                    <p>6. A thorough inspection of liquor shops. </p>
                    <p>7. Rents should not be permitted to rise above a certain level.</p>
                    <p>8. The 2% rate levied by the Municipality of Alexadria for the construction
                        of the new sea wall to be abolished, the sea wall being now completed.</p>
                    <p>9. The reduction of the salt tax.</p>
                    <p>10. The reduction of the rates levied by the water company.</p>
                    <p>The authors of this document have refrained from signing their names in full,
                        and we have gathered nothing from a study of some rather cryptic initials.
                        As for their suggestions, some appear to us to be unnecessary, the attention
                        of the Government being occupied with the discovery of the means to combat
                        the evils of which the signatories complain, while others are so throoughly
                        mediaeval that we cannot help being amused at the naïveté of the writers,
                        who obviously imaging that the revival of the trade restrictions of the
                        fifteenth century will prove a panacea for any economic ailments from which
                        Egypt suffers.</p>

                    <p>The comments of the native Press on the Accession day of the Sultan bear a
                        decided resemblance to those of Turkish newspapers, published on previous
                        occasions of this kind at Constantinople, and often quoted as examples of
                        what we may cal the 'honorific' style of composition. In reading them we
                        move in august regions peopled by courtly superlatives, resonant titles and
                        cardinal virtues, in a fairy-land of splendour and dignity where debts and
                        difficulties are ignored and where the Commander of the Faithful and the
                        great dignitaries of his Empire receive the endless homage of a contented
                        people. This species of composition cannot perhaps be naturalised in Egypt
                        with complete success. We reproduce the following extract from our
                        contemporary.</p>

                        the throne of his illustrious ancestors. Since that date he has revived
                        hopes that seemed to have died, and has preserved the honor of his kingdom,
                        and maintained it in an exalted and honorable position, after finding it a
                        prey to disorder and threatened by ruin. He has smitten down with an iron
                        hand the pernicious rebels who plotted its ruin and has scatterd them
                        abroad. He has watched over the development of science and industry, and has
                        opened schools, institutes, and colleges in every part of his empire, while
                        doing all in his power to preserve the old Moslem teaching from modern and
                        contaminating influences He has continually striven to protect and
                        strengthen the faith and has moreover build numerous warships, constructed
                        railways, and organised a great and victorious army. If the Moslem world
                        celebrates this fete, the Turkish nation celebrates with it the day of its
                        political revival . The committee has therefore organised all measures that
                        will make this celebration fare superior to those of the past in honor of
                        the preservation of our beloved Sultan from te scoundrels who recently

                        undiscovered, and so this last winter M. Gayet searched in the rocky valleys
                        on the edge of the "Arabian Plateau" toward the Red Sea, and was rewarded by
                        finding a superior style of sepulchres, though most of them had been
                        pillaged, probably in late Persion time under Chosroes, about A.D. 600. The
                        description of the tomb given by the Gayet in the "Catalogue Sommaire" of
                        the Exhibition need not detain us here excepting the account of one, the
                        burial arrangement of which was so unique that it is interesting to read the
                        explorer's description in full. "L'un d'eux, ou je retrouvais le corps d'un
                        gladiateur, offrait cette particularite caracteristique que, sur tout le
                        fond, une epaisse couche de ciment recouvrait les dalles. Une silhouette
                        humaine y avait ete modelee en creux, donnant de profil les lignes
                        d'ensemble du squelette, auquel s'accrochaient les masses figurant le
                        vetement. Les cotes, les os des bras, des jambes, etaient dessines aveo
                        soin; a l'entour, les lignes du rappel de manteau etaient en proportion
                        suffisante. Autre detail non moins important: alors que dans toutes les
                        tombes le mort repose couche sur le dos, le corps du gladiateur etait etendu
                        sur le cote, s'emboitant dans ce moulage, bien qu'il fut un tiers environ
                        plus grand que nature. C'est le seul exemple jusqu'ici de pareil fait
                        observe."</p>
                    <p>The Gayet notes the valuable fact that in Christian burials the mummy holds
                        in his right hand upon the breast the "crown of election" just as in early
                        and late Egyptian tombs the deceased grasped the magic sceptre, Nek, which
                        symbolised the future life in the theology of the ancient priests. Also the
                        presence of portraits in all the tombs of wealthy people is connected
                        evidently with the portraits, from the "Double" or "Ka" spirit in the old
                        Egyptian sepulchres, which in the later were mostly statues and not relief
                        representation of the defunct. The same idea that if the mummy were
                        destroyed, the replica or effigy would take its place appears to have
                        lingered on into Christian times. The custom of gilding the face, fully
                        dwelt upon in the "Egyptian Gazette" in an essay entitled "The Golden
                        Horns," was still practised quite lately at Antinoe, reminding us of the
                        Pharaonic religious literature, promising the deceased should have a "visage
                        shining as the light," or "that the eyes shall see the light." To ensure the
                        fulfilment of this later formula, the mummies in some cases have little
                        rolls of bitumen covered with gold leaf, inserted in the orbital sockets. </p>
                    <p>Among the tombs discovered, the most interesting occupants were a charioteer
                        and a gladiator, doubtless celebrated champions in the circus fetes at
                        Antinoe and a lady "Khelmis" the famous singer of Osiris Antinous, certainly
                        a priestly hierophant in the temple wherein the unfortunate favorite of
                        Hadrian was worshipped under the ceremonial cult of the ancient Egyptian
                        ritual. Other frames appear also to have been those of actors in the Antinoe
                        Olympic games, or of officiants in the "Mysteries" instituded in honor of
                        the lovely youth Antinous. (To be continued.)</p>

                    <p>From the latest returns of the statistical office in Cairo we find that the
                        births registered there during the week ending Saturday 19th August, were
                        410, including 3 of European parentage; and the week following 441, which
                        included 6 of the latter category. For the two weeks under review the deaths
                        were 492, of which 9 were of Europeans nationality, and 489, of these 19
                        being Europeans. </p>
                    <p>During the same weekly periods the total number of births at Alexandria were
                        271, of which 12 were of European parentage; and 255, including 6 of the
                        latter category. The deaths totalled 233 for the first week, of which 17
                        were Europeans; and 256, in the second week, including 19 of the latter.</p>
                    <p>It should be remarked that the figures given relating to the births of
                        European children are these sent in by the district inspectors, as the new
                        law compelling the registration of all children belonging to Europeans does
                        not come into operation until it has been approved of by the International
                        Mixed Tribunals, and therefore the returns are apt to be misleading. Such,
                        however, is not the case as regards the mortality statistics.</p>

                    <head>THE CONGO FREE STATE. OFFICIAL COMMUNICATIONS.</head>
                    <p>Mr. E.D. Morel, hon. secretary of the Congo Reform Association, has issued
                        for publication the further correspondence that has passed between his
                        organisation and Lord Lansdowne, the Secretary for Foreign Affairs. Lord
                        Lansdowne's communication, which is dated the 17th inst., is a reply to one
                        from Mr. Morel on the 8th inst., respecting the native witnesses, and it is
                        in the following terms:</p>
                    <p>"I am to inform you that reports of the privations from which these natives
                        are suffering have been received through the ating British Consul at Boma,
                        and his Majesty's Minister at Brussels has been instructed to call the
                        attention of the Congo Government to the matter.</p>
                    <p>"I am to state that the latter recently pointed out to Monsieur de Cuvelier,
                        in the course of converstation, the hardship involved by sending
                        considerable numbers of native witnesses, required in connections with the
                        trial of white men, to Boma from the Upper Congo, and inquired whether such
                        trials could not take place in the Upper Congo. Monsieur de Cuvelier replied
                        that the practice of holding trials, when white men, to Boma from the Upper
                        Congo, and inquired whether such trials could not take place in the Upper
                        Congo. Monsieur de Cuvelier replied that the practice of holding trials,
                        when white men were involved, in the Upper Congo or rather remote districts,
                        had, since 1895, in consequence of the Stokes case, been abandoned, and that
                        it would require serious consideration whether it would be possible to
                        resume the practice of holding trials, of as important a character as those
                        now under discussion anywhere but at the principal seat of justice.</p>
                    <p>"I am to add that his Majesty's Acting Consul at Boma has been instructed to
                        give the native witnesses such assistance as he properly can in their
                        efforts to obtain work during their detention at Boma."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Morel, as a rejoinder, submitted the following to Lord Lansdowne: </p>
                    <p>"In the report to the Sovereign of the State ('Rapport au Roi-Souverain'),
                        dated Brussels, 21st May, 1897 ('Bulletin Offical No. 5 bis, numero
                        supplementaire'), it is stated:</p>
                    <p>In all the districts of the interior the creation of territorial tribunals
                        has been decided, empowered to apply penal law to all residents in the
                        State, native, or other, the courts-martial thus becoming competent only to
                        deal with military cases.</p>
                    <p>"It is true that in the same offical report the value of the new organisation
                        was greatly lessened by the proviso that in cases of 'murder and homicide,'
                        and of 'attempts upon the life or liberty of the natives' (the charges
                        brought against Europeans employed in the Upper Congo, for the prompt local
                        investigation of which the machinery referred to in the previous passages of
                        the report was ostensibly created, being precisely of this character) the
                        Europeans accused should be brought before the Tribunal in the Lower Congo,
                        the object being, as stated in the report, 'to guarantee more efficaciously
                        the repression of particularly grave acts.' But the procedure adopted in
                        various cases would appear to differ not a little. Thus on November 14th,
                        1901, M. Lejeune, an agent of the A.B.I.R. Society, was sentenced by the
                        Territorial Tribunal at Coquilhatville--, which, according to Monsieur de
                        Cuvelier, would appear to be non-existent--to six months' imprisonment, and
                        1,000 frs. fine. The original charges in this case would seem to have been
                        those of making war upon the natives without authorisation, in the course of
                        which the bodies of the slain were alleged to have had their hands removed;
                        and handing out firearms to soldiers contrary to law. M. Lejeune, I
                        understand, was acquitted of the first-named charges by th elocal tribunal,
                        and acquitted of the later on appeal. "Whatever arguments may be adduced by
                        Monsieur de Cuvelier in explanation of the present system of administering
                        justice in the Congo, the resultant effect is, on the one hand, to
                        facilitate the escape of Europeans involved in alleged cases of atrocity; on
                        the other, to bring unmerited sufferings upon native witnesses, and to clos
                        the mouths of native witnesses who would be only too anxious to come forward
                        to testify to the wrongs of which they and their relatives have been, and
                        continue to be, the victims, were local courts authorised to deal with their
                        grievances and were they guaranteed from subsequent persecution.</p>
                    <p>"The present system, in its practical outcome, consitutes, indeed, a negation
                        of justice, and amits of no defence."</p>
                    <p>"In conclusion, I would beg leave to point out respectfully to your lordship
                        that, while the 'careful regulations' indicated by Monsieur de Cuvelier are
                        being elaborated, and while the report of the Commission of Inquiry remains
                        still unpublished, the slaughter and torture of natives in the Upper Congo
                        continue with monotonous persistency.</p>

                        <p>Une reunion de quelques banqnes de notre place a ea lieu mercredi soir :
                            dies ont dAcidf! de ne pas engager de nonvelles affaires (achat de
                            change, avances sur marchandisea etc.) avec la SociAtA, tant qne des
                            nonvellea precises et certaines garanties ne leur seront pas fonrnies. </p>
                        <p>Plnsieurs dApSches privees sont parvenues b. certains Atablissements de
                            notre ville. Elies se contredisent pour la plnpart. La plus pessi- mists
                            est sans contredit la suivante, re^ue par une banque frangaise, "Capital
                            englouti, obli- gations compromises" la cause: "la SociAtA des Sucreries
                            ayant garanti 25 millions d'ac captations de la Raffinerie Say." % </p>
                        <p>Les 25 millions de perte ont sans doute dejA AtA escomptes par nos
                            bourses de valeurs. Mais, avant d'inscrire une telle somme an passif des
                            Sucreries Agyptiennes, faut-il encore que la Raffinerie Say refuse le
                            payement integral de cette somme.</p>

                    <head>DOWN THE CHAGRES.</head>
                    <p>Matachin is the half way station on the line of the Panama railroad. Here
                        the trains pass 0.) their daily trip across the Isthmus. Here also the Rio
                        Chagres, after descending from the higher and more remote ranges, sweeps
                        sharply round and makes its way down the broad valley, to the ocean near
                        Colon. No river within the equatorial area bears a more sinister reputation.
                        It has given the name to one of the most pernicious forms of tropical
                        fevers; while its sinuous course, crossing and recrossing the axis of the
                        Panama Canal, its sudden floodings and destructive force, make it the most
                        formidable difficulty which the engineers and contractors of the undertaking
                        have to overcome. So impossible of control is it that it is proposed to
                        intercept it, and, as it were, hang it up out of the way on the mountain
                        side. It is navigable by native coyuka from Colon to Matachin, but only
                        those well versed in its temper and vagaries use it to any extent.</p>
                    <p>A study of the canal plan showed that the best method of seeing the works on
                        the Atlantic slope of the Cordillera was to go by river. When I made the
                        suggestion to the dark-skinned Colombian in the village store he stared, and
                        said he had never known white men attempt the trip. What was the use when
                        the railroad was there ? The Senor would but take the fever and end the
                        journey at Hjlonkey Hill. But as the Senor persisted he summoned two river
                        man, one a yellow-faced native, the other a negro, and after much palaver a
                        bargain -»as struck. It was then ten o'clock on a hot ning.</p>
                    <p>The canoe lay in a bend of the river below the village. The spot appeared to
                        be the common lavadero, and presented a scene of primeval simplicity. A
                        score of women, scant!y clad, were sitting in the water, pounding and
                        rubbing clothes, their naked children sprawling on the banks behind. In the
                        stream a number of natives were bathing. Occasionally the bolder spirits
                        among these swam forward to chaff the women, who laugh- ingly pelted them
                        with pobbles.</p>
                    <p>Tho canoe, which was cut out of a wild tama- rind tree, was large and
                        narrow, and light and unsteady enough to make the baggage welcome ballast.
                        The men themselves were lightly equipped. They merely wore bine pants tucked
                        up to the knees, and old terai hats, and they brought with thsm two paddles,
                        a long pole, and a conch shell. The negro limped from a sore in his foot,
                        and explained that his toe had been attacked the previous night by a vampire
                        bat, which paid him frequent visits, though he was never conscious of the
                        bloodsucking nrnnAflfl until he awoke.</p>
                    <p>With a long blast from the conoh we swung into the current, and made a
                        descent as ex citing as it was swift. The negro used hi paddle and the
                        Colombian the pole to guidi the canoe among the rooks aud derelict logi and
                        branches and over the treacherous rapids In the qu eter stretches both men
                        paddled It was a oiuudiess and windless day, and th air was aglare with
                        heat. The vegetatioi hung limp and motionless, the birds wer mute, lizards
                        and iguanas drowsed upon th banks, even the alligators could hardly fim
                        energy to drop into the water as we approach ed. We passed them at every
                        turn. One , i when I seized a dead bough embedded i Ithe mud to ward off the
                        canoe I saw th gnarled snout of one within a couple of fee of my hand. Now
                        and then we came acros an Indian fishing, or, more rarely, one struf gling
                        in his coyoka upstream.</p>
                    <p>We came frequently in touch with th canal. Here it was banked up and shut o
                        from the river ; there the two joined an became one. Magnificent dredges
                        were chaine to the banks, and wagons, cranes, and othc materia! lay rusting
                        in the jungle. What saw of the excavations showed that muo good work had
                        been done, and that mos of it is still in as good condition as whe the
                        navvies ceased digging. A wiry scru has overrun the banks and aoted as a
                        bindc for the soil. The real menace to the wot is, of course, the .flooding
                        of tho river, fc when it "comes down" it carries all befor it. We passed
                        under one lofty bridge eve which the water had swept during a freshe The
                        white sandstone piers of this bridge, b the way, were red with blood ; it
                        was th ^ scene of a laaguinary fight between the Gi vernment troops and the
                        Liberals during th receut revolution. </p>
                    <p>Late in the afternoon we entered the a pleted portion of the canal, which
                        runs ic great curve from Bobio to Colon, a distance about fifteen miles.
                        There are few more beai ful avenues of water in the tropics. The ol glow of
                        the cooler light lay upon the la The surface of the canal was like glass t
                        curiously green in the half-lights ; the bai were covered with bright
                        blossoms, and ale the top ran colonnades of bananas, plants and trumpet
                        trees, with a rich undergrowth wild cane. The life of the forest hid reviv
                        humming-birds, paroquets, peadoves, tones and many other birds of strange
                        form a plumage came within vision ; gaudy bntterf and dragon flies flitted
                        aoross our path deer came down the secret paths to drink th8 river men bade
                        me fi'sten to the dist screaming of monkeys, which probably tokened tho
                        presenoe of a tiger, oat, or b1 Mile after mile, the canoe sped along
                        darkening vista. When night fell, our guide was the dim reflection of the
                        star lit down the centre. In the silence one oo hear with startling
                        clearness the mysteri noises that thrill a tropical night, the orackl of
                        dead wood, the rush of wings above, quiet "plop" of living things into the
                        wa the far-off tones of foraging oarnivora.</p>
                    <p>The canal broadened, and into it came fr torrents from several affluents.
                        From one {he dark openings issued the sound of wild <cb n="2"/>musio, and
                        out of it stole a large canoe, heavily laden with bananas, ar.d carrying a
                        number of Indian men and women. They were apparently on their way to Colon
                        with the produce, and were warding off evil spirits by ohanting a native
                        melody. They answered our warning call with a weird "Co-o ee." About five
                        miles fiom Colon the canal and the river finally parted, and the latter ran
                        to its outlet through the dismal, death-like swamps and lagoons that breed
                        the Chagres fever. The channel was here and there choked with reeds and
                        silted up with sand and mnd, though there was no movement of any kind
                        perceptible. The stagnant, foetid water was luminous with phosphorescence,
                        and the air was rank with miasma. If choked and sickened me ; I could not
                        breathe it, but lay with a handkerchief stuffed into my mouth and |
                        nostrils, yet feeling as if the odour were; penetrating the whole body. The
                        moon had j risen, casting a melancholy glamour over tho j scone, and by its
                        light could be seen amazing j evidences of extravaganoe and waste in miles
                        of engineering material lying decomposing in the rotting slime.</p>
                    <p>The lights of Colon gleamed at last, and at eleven o'clook we emerged from
                        the canal and crossed the salt bay, rippling under a fresh sea wind, and
                        landed among the masonry of a , broken breakwater at the canal headquarters,
                        j The men shouldered my baggage, and we i moved off towards the town, when I
                        heard a ! low whistle, and a number of shadowy figures advanced from
                        different points. They wore native soldiers, and we were placed under
                        arrest. Of what avail was it to protest? Were we not revolutionaries? Was I
                        not the leader of a band of Liberals coming to seize and saok the town!</p>

                    <head>HISTORIC DISCOVERIES IN MASHONALAND.</head>
                    <p>Dr. Carl Peters, the well-known explorer, has just returned to London after
                        an extended tour in South Africa, principally in Rhodesia, where he has made
                        some interesting historic discoveries tending to confirm his theory that
                        Mashonaland is the ancient Land of Ophir. 'T went first to Nort-East
                        Mashonaland," said Dr Peters to a Press representative,"to investigate some
                        mining properties, and also to look for more evidence of my Ophir theory. I
                        have managed to place the Ophir of the Bible in these countries between the
                        Zambesi and the Limpopo, and as a result of my interest- ing archaeological
                        explorations there I found several inscriptions of an ancient Arab cha-
                        racter, which I have brought to Europe to be deciphered, and which I think
                        will be able finally to solve the question of ancient civilisa- tion in
                        these countries. So far, one inscription has been deciphered by au eminent
                        German Orientalist, Dr. Giasar, as meaning "Sophar," which is the name of
                        the capital in South Arabia, and at the same time is the root of the name
                        "Sofala," a port in East Africa. The inscription, which was on a stone, is
                        about 1,700 years old. Two other stones which I have brought home have been
                        classified as Babylonian boundary-stones. The re- j maining stones have been
                        sent to Hanover to have the inscriptions deciphered. When I was in
                        Johannesburg I was asked by the British Association to give a lecture there
                        on my discoveries, but as I was obliged by business to come home, I shall
                        give a lec- ture on the subject as soon as the inscrip- tions on all the
                        stones have been thoroughly investigate'! That is only one side of my
                        expedition, however. 1 have been olosely examining Rhodesia on its mining
                        and agricultural prospects. While I find that the mining prospeots are muoh
                        better than many people have thought— for ir stance, there care traces of
                        tin all over North-East Mashonaland, and at the same time large copper
                        deposits—! do not thiuk much of the agricultural prospects, for the reason
                        that the soil is everywhere very thin. Generally spe -k- ing, after 8'x to
                        eight inches you get to bed rock. Of oourse, there are exceptions."</p>

                    <head>ROMAN REMAINS IN SCOTLAND.</head>
                    <p>Since Febrnary 14 of this year a staff of workmen, under the direction of Mr.
                        James Curie, F.S.A., Scot., has been engaged making excavations near
                        Newstead, Melrose, in a Roman a'ation which, so far as known, is the largest
                        in Scotland, it being believed from the P trenches cut that the station
                        extends to at least 14 acres. The camp at Caatlecary extends to two and a
                        half acres, that atBirrens, Dum- friesshire, to about four acres, and that
                        at Camelon is under six acres, while the largest of the Northumberland camps
                        iB not over five and a half acres. The work of exoavating, which is being
                        carried out at the instanoe of the Sooiety of Antiquaries of Scotland, is
                        still being proceeded with, and, so far, of the total mi area not more than
                        three and a half acres have been touched. The camp is mainly situated in
                        what is called the Red Abbeystead field, but important works have been come
                        upon in the Wellmeadow and the Guttorflat fields. tj, A party from the
                        Berwickshire Naturalists' gQ Club were on the ground some time ago, and Mr.
                        Curie gave an interesting description of the work that had been accomplished
                        since operations began in February, and he detailed the various discoveries
                        made. They were standing, he said, in a Roman station which was absolutely
                        forgotten in every way, the g name of it was not known, nor was any maTk y.
                        of it to be feen above ground. About 1743 the w Rev. Adam Milne wrote a
                        description of the jj parish of Melrose. Writing of Old Melrose, he said
                        :—"About a mile to the west there was p, an abbacy standing in a field
                        called the Red tr Abbeystead. It was not known whether this name was derived
                        from the colour of the stones ^ wherewith it was built, or whether it was a
                        jn house belonging to the knights of the Red Templars, but it was certain
                        that when the field was ditched or ploughed the foundations ai of several
                        houses were found, a great deal of lead, and some curious seals." Then came
                        General Roy, who in 1769-71 inspected the roads in North Britain. He said
                        the only signs of a Roman station were some entrenchmentu 1 g near the
                        village of Eildon. After this the disco-! _ very of two Roman altars was
                        made, the first being found in 1783. The second altar, which was found in
                        1830, was dedicated by the oen- turion of the 20th Legion to the god
                        Silvanns. In 1846 came the cutting of the railway, which threw more light on
                        the subject than any discovery hitherto made. In the cutting to | the south
                        of the Red Abbeystead field there were found pits filled with black a peaty
                        mat»er,in which were portions of Samian ware, deer bones, &amp;o. The most
                        interesting disoovery ot all, however, was the skeleton of a soldier
                        standing erect in one of the pits, with hiu spear beside him and part of the
                        wooden shaft still existing. No doubt, what was then cut through was the
                        cemetery of the place. After this the place, so far as antiquaries were
                        concerned, was deserted until the spring of 1904, when, during draining
                        operations in the Red Abbeystead field, there were discovered foundations of
                        buildings, a line of curiously jointed water pipes, some Samian ware,
                        &amp;c. It was thought the buildings were worth .in vestigating, and the
                        matter being brought be- fore the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, they
                        decided to take it up. Operations were begun on February 14 of this year.
                        All the buildings which had been come upon were ' large. In the Gutterflat
                        field (two fields away)! there had been traced what appeared to be a large
                        annexe of the camp, containing about four acres. There had also been found a
                        big building with an apse, which was no doubt the bath of the place. They
                        had not had time to go further there. In the Wellmeadow (the field adjoining
                        Red Abbeystead) they had found a rampart 45ft. wide lying partly in stone
                        paving. Inside this they came upon a stone platform 15ft wide, and on the
                        north it was bounded by a deep-built drain. On the outside of the rampart
                        lay a ditch . 21ft. wide and ljft. deep and two subsidiary ditches and
                        ramparts. The buildings in the i Red Abbeystead field formed six blocks, and
                        five were barrack like buildings over 200ft. in length. They were separated
                        from each other by roads about 29ft wide, having footpaths on one side. The
                        sixth building was of better and i heavier masonry, showing one good
                        buttress and well-defined oross wall. At one end there had been noted a
                        number of crosB walls with what might be broken-down flues. Behind it was a
                        long builcfing in heavy buttresses, which might have been one of those great
                        storehouses that were common in Roman oamps. With regard to the articles
                        found, there had been discovered so far a quantity of ordinary rough
                        pottery, Samian ware, and large pieces with the potters' marks similar to
                        those found in Antonine's Wall. Several brooches had been come upon, a
                        circnlar one of pale blue enamel with six round spots of red enamel on it,
                        being tho most interesting of these. Suoh brooohes were very rare in
                        Sootland, Mr. Curie stated Camelon being the only plaoe where they got good
                        specimens of them. With regard to coins, they had found a fair number in
                        denari of I Nsro, Domitian, Vitellius, Hadrian (2), An- toninus Pius, and
                        Crispina j and in brass, coins of Faustina the Elder and Trajan. 'They hal
                        also come across one fragment of inscrip- tion on stone and a number of iron
                        implements. Under the ramp trt to which he had already referred they found a
                        ditch of an older oamp, and in the bottom of the ditoh they had got a
                        typical Romau stylus of bronze.</p>

                    <head>SLEEPING SICKNESS.</head>
                    <p>A lecture was given recently at Pietermaritzburg, on 'Sleeping Sickness' by
                        Colonel David Bruce, C.B., F.R.S., Royal Army Medical Corps.</p>
                    <p>Colonel Bruce introduced the subject by showing that it was by no means
                        impoBsib'e that this disease, sleeping sickness, might pass southward from
                        Lake Victoria and Central Africa and reaoh the Zambesi, or even invade some
                        parts of the TransvaaL The disease was endemio on the West Coast of Africa,
                        especially in the basin of the Congo, and here it had been known as long as
                        we had any history of that country. Slaves taken from the West Coast had
                        died of the disease in the West Indies and other countries, but without
                        spreading the disease to their imme- diate neighbours. </p>
                    <p>Sleeping sickness first broke out in the province called Busoga. It was
                        probably in- traduced when Emin Pasha's Sudanese and their wives and
                        followers, numbering some ten thousand, were brought into and settled in
                        Busoga. These natives were brought from the Congo territory, a country in
                        which the disease had been endemic for a long time, and, therefore, it was
                        hardly to be expected that this large number of natives would not contain a
                        certain number suffering from the first stages of the disease. As this
                        country, Busoga, was well adapted for the spread of sleeping sickness, in a
                        few years—viz, in 1901 —the disease had attained such dimensions that in a
                        short time it reduced the most populous and fertile province of Uganda to a
                        depopulated desert, </p>

                        evident; be was less inclined to exert himself, fib lay about more during
                        the day ; and at last fife intimates saw that he had the first symp toms of
                        this absolutely fatal malady.His symp- toms gradually deepened, and after a
                        year or so—it might be longer—he was unable to walk, unable to speak, and
                        even unable to feed himself, and he gradually sank into a comatose condition
                        and died. Sleeping sickness was caused by the entrance into the blood of a
                        minute protozoal parasite called Trypanosoma ggmbienso. The micro-organism
                        was first named and described by Dr. Dutton, who recently lost his life on
                        the West Coast of Africa while pursuing the study of this disease. The
                        trypan- osome was an active, wormlike oreatnre,which lived among tho red
                        blood oorpnscles, where it could le seen wrig^l ng about with great acti-
                        vity, if the blood were examined under the microscope with a magnification
                        of 200 or 300 lt diameters. If the blood of cases of sleeping siokness were
                        examined with sufficient care this parasite would be found in every ease. It
                        was also found in fairly large numbers in the lymphatjc glands of the body,
                        and as the dis- ease advanced it could always be found in the oerebro-spinal
                        fluid which bathed the brain am spinal cord.</p>
                    <p>Sleeping sickness in Uganda had a very peculiar distribution, and the
                        country oan be divided into sleeping siokness areas and non- sleeping
                        sickness areas. An examination of the natives living in the sleeping
                        sickness areas showed that some 30 per cent, of them were in the early
                        stages of the disease, and their blood contained thess trypanosomes. On the
                        other hand, although a large number of natives were examined in the
                        non-sleeping sickness areas, in not a single case could a trypanosome be
                        foand ; further, when blood or cerebro- spinal fluid was injooted under the
                        skin of a healthy monkey the animal took the disease anf died after several
                        months with typical symp- toms of sleeping sickness, and its brain showee
                        the characteristic alteration in its substance which was found in sleeping
                        sickness in man. When the Royal Society Commission which had been sent to
                        Uganda in th9 spring of 1903 hod discovered these facts, they came to the
                        conclusion that this trypanosoma was the true oause of the disease. The next
                        point they took up was to try to discover the reason of the oarions
                        distribution of the disease in Uganda. Sleeping sickness was only found in a
                        narrow y area lying along the shore of the lake. It was found on both bands
                        of the Nile as far as Lake Albert; it also occurred round the shore of Lake
                        Albert and passed north along the Nile almost as far as Wadelai. The disease
                        whs very common among the inhabitants of the nume- rous small islands which
                        dotted the northern part of Lake Viotoria. It was evident, then, that the
                        disease had some predileotion for the vicinity of open water, and the
                        oommission set about to try to find ont the cause of this. In South Afrioa
                        there was a disease among oattle and other domestio animals, also caused by
                        a trypanosome—the Trypanosoma brueei. This trypanosome was oonveyed from the
                        sick to <cb n="5"/>healthy animals by means of a biting fly, the G lossina
                        morsitans. It was, therefore, thought that in all probability sleeping
                        siokness would be foind also to be conveyed by a biting fly. jarge
                        collections of all the biting flies of Jganda were made, and the astonishing
                        result was arrived at that the distribution of sleeping sickness and of a
                        biting fly, the Glotsina pal pedis, corresponded absolutely with one ano-
                        ther. Experiments were then made, which showed that this biting fly,
                        Glossina patpalis, could cany the disease from the sick to the lealtby for a
                        period of at least 48 hours. Sxperiments made with other speoiea of bitin g
                        flies, made under exaotly the same conditions, failed to give any result.
                        Lastly, tsetse flies caught in the sleeping sickue s areas and p'ac- ed
                        straightway on healthy monkeys conveyed the disease in every case. This
                        disease, which killed every one it attaoked, had already oaus- ed the death
                        of some hundreds of thousands of natives in Central Afrioa. It was slowly
                        spread- ing wherever there was a Glossina palpalis to convey it. It ww now
                        spreading north along the Nile from Lake Albert. It was slowly spreading
                        round Lake Albert, had reached the south of Lake Viotoria, and there was no
                        say- ing to what extent it would further devastate this country. There was a
                        danger of its being conveyed across British East Afrioa into the "fly belts"
                        of the east coast; even danger of its being conveyed to India, where a
                        similar disease, called surra, existed among horses, and where there might
                        exist a biting fly capable of spreading it.</p>
