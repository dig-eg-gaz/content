                    <p>An English daily Newspaper, established 1880.</p>

                    <p>WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 4. 1905.</p>
                    <p>AFTER PORT ARTHUR.</p>
                    <p>The fall of Port Arthur has necessarily brought up the question of mediation
                        or in- ervention, and a telegram from London this morning states that
                        various inspired sug- estions in the direction of peace are emanating from
                        Washington, representing Mr. Roosevelt as anxious to mediate but unable to
                        move until approached by both the belligerents. Nothing whatever
                        confirmatory has been receiv ed, and the peaee rumors are not credited. The
                        scepticism prevailing in London is doubt- less well founded for we are still
                        unable to believe that peace is near at hand. The fall of</p>
                    <p>Port Arthur does not necessarily imply that the Japanese will triumph in the
                        war, for the capitulation of the Gibraltar of the Far East is probably only
                        the end of the first act, and not by any means the drop scene, of the great
                        drama. We believe that Ruarsa will fight to the bitter end, subject always
                        to the condition that there is no general internal revolt. Such an
                        occurrence is possible if the peasantry have ceased to fear a beaten
                        Government, or are convinced that the war will drain them of too much of
                        their strength, and if the soldiery are unwilling to put insurrection down ;
                        but it seems to us most improbable. Very few Rus- sians realise what the
                        loss of sea-power means, and fewer still are fully convinced that it has
                        been lost. There has been no invasion, no cap- ture of any ancient Russian
                        city, nothing to enable an unusually ignorant population to see the war.
                        They feel the draft made on them by the summons to the Reserves, and they
                        are disturbed by rumours that Holy Russia is not crushing her enemies with
                        her usual com- pleteness ; but there has been no disaster sufficiently
                        visible to destroy the mingled fear and reepect felt for the authority of
                        the Tsar, or to induce the people to run the terrible risks involved in any
                        insurrection not supported by the soldiery. So long as there is obedience
                        the governing group in St. Petersburg can go on with the war if it will; and
                        its material resources, except at sea, are not yet worn out, or even
                        seriously affected. Even if the Russians have lost in the campaign two
                        hundred thousand men through the hardships of transport, the out- bursts of
                        sickness, and the deaths in actual fighting, these losses will soon be
                        replaced by the conscription, more especially as most of the dead belonged
                        to the Asiatic side of the vast Empire. The losses of officers, which have
                        been frightful, are being made up. Better artillery, better powder, better
                        muni- tions altogether, are all procurable for money; and the idea that the
                        wealth of Russia has been-exhausted in less than a year of war is positively
                        inept. The Treasury must provide for the interest on the Debt, and for all
                        that is purchased abroad; but it has reserves of gold to meet those
                        necessities, and everything procur- able at home can be paid for in paper,
                        to be redeemed on the conclusion of the war. There are plenty of resources
                        for a secoond campaign, and the great Russians are, as we believe,
                        determined to fight one. They have at least three sets of motives, any one
                        of which would induce them to adopt that course. They are as proud of Russia
                        as we are of Great Britain, and would feel ultimate defeat by an Asiatic
                        Power as an inexpiable shame. They are firmly convinced that their defeat
                        has been due to unpreparedness, mismanagement, and corruption, and believe
                        that with a few months for reorganisation they can collect a mighty army,
                        resume the offensive, and in the next campaign drive the Japanese into the
                        sea. And the governing classes feel, rather than see, that a shameful peace,
                        especially if it included an indemnity, would be fatal to the autocracy;
                        that is, would, in their judgment, be the precursor of anarchy, and probably
                        of dismemberment.</p>

                        are generally quieter, though there are occasional disturbances. Work is
                        still suspended. The agitation is increasing at Tiflis and Batum. In the
                        former town, there have been sanguinary conflicts in the streets between the
                        police and cossacks and the revolutionary mobs. The strike is spreading on
                        the Trans-caucasion railway. A troop train proceeding to Batum was derailed,
                        the line being cut. (R.)</p>

                    <p>The nile cold storage company is experimenting in a new direction. A steam
                        trawler hired by the company for six months, with option of purchase at the
                        expiry of the period should the results obtained justify the course, has
                        commenced operations off port said, and has met with decided success in her
                        first two ventures. Good takes of merlan, soles, skate, loup-de-mer, and
                        John dory are reported with a fair number of red mullet of better quality
                        and far larger size than those usually seen in Egyptian restaurants and
                        hotels. The latter, taken as a rule within a few miles of the coast, are
                        almost all immature fish weighing as a rule from 1.5 to 2 ounes, but the
                        trawler has already taken a few half pounders, with a large proportion of
                        six ounce fish. It is of, course, too early yet to anticipate large takes of
                        excellent soles and transcendant red mullet finding their way to cairo and
                        alexandria, to the delight of dinners out. Nothing, or next to nothing is
                        known of the feeding grounds and general habits and distribution of the
                        numerous specis of fish that occur in Egyptian waters, except within a belt
                        not exceeding a dozen miles in distance from the coast. The fisherman of our
                        coast line from alexandria to port said rarely venture further, but a steam
                        trawler can work in the waters for thirty miles without any risk of finding
                        her return impeded by adverse winds. Among the recent catches of the
                        companys trawler- which by the way is an up to date boat manned by a british
                        crew and commanded by capt Micholson on fleetwood, who is known as the
                        pioneer of steam trawling in england- are a number of large trukish sponges
                        of large size and fine quality. A sponge fishery has been for some time
                        established at marsa Matrouh, but the frequent roughness of the sea outside
                        the small and obstructed harbour has frequently proved a great hindrance to
                        diving. The discovery of sponges of a good quality within 30 miles of port
                        said is valuable in itself, and there is every reason to suppose that the
                        development of the egyptian fisheries will be of great economic importance
                        to the country. The coast fishermen, with inadequate appliances frequently
                        succeed in making good takes of fish, and the steam trawler and her two
                        sisters shortly arriving should be far more fortunate. </p>

                    <head>CORPORATION OF WESTERN EGYPT</head>
                    <p>The directors of the corporation of western egypt, limited, who have been
                        staying at the savoy hotel for the last fortnight, have now left cairo for
                        england via naples. The party included Messrs. the Hou. Alexander O. Murray,
                        master of eubank, J.P., D.L., M.P., chairman of the corporation, Charles
                        E.H. Hobhouse, J.P., M.P., the Hon. W. Twilough O'brien, William Heaton
                        Armstrong, and W. Chas Scales. The object of their visit was to discuss the
                        companys policy wit the local board and railway and mining engineers, and to
                        thoroughly investigate the companys interests on the spot. We understand
                        that Mr. Waller, of the well known firm of Messrs. Kincard, waller, maville,
                        and dawson, the corporations consulting engineers, has now completed his
                        report on the section of the railway which the corporation are building to
                        connect the Oasis of Kharga with the egyptian governmetn ranway at farshut,
                        a distance of 118 miles. It was feared taht the first ten miles of this
                        section would be very expensive, but Mr. Waller now reports that by taking
                        the line among a certain Wadt the plateau can be reached without any extra
                        expense. It is evident that the directors are actively attending to the
                        business in hand, and we understand that they have expressed themselves as
                        being much impressed with the corporations various interests. Taking into
                        consideration the high standing and ability of the directorate, the
                        importance of many of the names on the list of shareholders, and the
                        enormous porenrialites of the corporations concessions, which will be opened
                        up by the new railway, it is evident that the corporation has before it a
                        brilliant future. Application has been made to the london stock exchange
                        committee to appoint a special setting day in corporation of western egypt,

                    <head>EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE RUSSIAN FLEET</head>
                    <p>A correspondent writes: The leading ar- ticle in the "Egyptian Gazette" on
                        the position of the Egyptian Government in its policy towards the Russian
                        fleet was admirably oogent in its logic. But viewed in its purely legal
                        aspect, this question should be looked at As one which concerns Egypt alone
                        and without reference to Great Britain. A copy of the Suez Canal Convention
                        lies before me. It was signed at Constantinople on the 29th October, 1888,
                        and ratifications were deposited at Constanti- nople on the 22nd December of
                        that year. The Convention was made between Great Britain, Germany,
                        Austria-Hungary, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia, and Turkey.
                        "Egypt's political status is," as the Judicial Adviser correctly observes,
                        “that of a part of the Ottoman Dominions." She has therefore no individual
                        power to make treaties save such as the firmans of the Sultan of Turkey ex-
                        pressly authorise. Those firmans did not invest her with power to enter into
                        the Suez Canal Convention, which was consequently made on her behalf by her
                        Turkish suzerain. It follows then that if the Convention was binding on
                        Turkey it was binding on Egypt. If it was binding on Egypt in 1888—the date
                        of its signature—it was equally binding upon her in 1898, at the time of the
                        passage of the Spanish Fleet, and in 1904, at the time of the passage of the
                        Russian Fleet through the Canal. The Egyptian Government held—so the
                        Judicial Adviser informs us— that the Convention was not binding upon Egypt
                        in 1898. Assuming that view to be correct, and nothing having been done by
                        Turkey to render the Convention binding in the interval between that date
                        and 1904, it was not binding upon Egypt in 1904.- The fact that the British
                        Government did not consider the Convention binding upon them in 1898 by
                        reason of a reservation made in 1888 with reference to retaining full
                        liberty of action regarding the British Occupation of Egypt, could in no
                        respect affect Egypt's con- tractual obligations in 1898 any more than Great
                        Britain’s announcement of her adherence to the Convention as recorded in the
                        Anglo- French Agreement of April, 1904—to which, by the way, Turkey was not
                        a party—can affect Egypt’s obligations at the present time. It will be seen
                        that, starting from the same premises as the Judicial Adviser, I arrive at a
                        different conclusion. The difficulty of the Judicial Adviser was from the
                        first obvious, and, I venture to think, insurmountable, namely, the
                        divergence between the technical and the actual position—the status de jur
                        and that de facto—of Egypt He may well be pardoned for having tailed to
                        reconcile the irreconcilable.</p>

                    <head>THE NATIVE BAR</head>
                    <p>The Native Bar has recently gained a victory over the Ministry of Justice
                        and, although it is only a trifling matter, the successful issue has given
                        great satisfaction, as the native barristers are by no means content with
                        the persistent efforts of the Ministry to rule over them “par conseil de
                        discipline." Recently a circular was issued to the barristers' clerks
                        requiring them to furnish to the Court of Appeal a certificate of good
                        conduct and a photograph. This arbitrary interference natur- ally called
                        forth a number of protests, and a meeting of the clerks was held, when it
                        was agreed that they should strike if the circular was put into force. The
                        vote of this meeting was unanimous and the decision was com- municated to
                        Judge Bond, Vice-President of the Native Court of Appeal, by the members of
                        the Bar, who stated that their clerks one and all refused to submit to any
                        such con- ditions whatsoever. The result was that the obnoxious circular was
                        withdrawn.</p>

                    <head>ALEXANDRIA MUNICIPALITY</head>
                    <p><persName>Councillor Alderson</persName> has addressed the following letter
                        to the administrator of the municipality: Dear sir,—Please put in your next
                        minutes following proposition : I propose that all matters to be discussed
                        by the Delegation should be sent to all members of the Commis- sion, and
                        that those of the members who feel interested in the subject, shall be
                        informed of the date and hour of the meeting and allowed to attend. As it
                        is at present, those who are not on the Delegation are not really "au
                        courant" with what is going on with the municipality. Also, that we should
                        have a printing press and proces-verbaux should be sent to every member, at
                        least within 48 hours, not as now. I received on the 4th of Feb. the
                        proces-verbal of the Delegation of the 17th Jan. Again, the proces-verbal of
                        the Commission of the 30th Nov. 1 received on the 10th of January- yours
                        sincerely, <persName>Geo. B. Alderson</persName> A propos of the above, Mr.
                        G. B. Alderson writes:—Only at the meeting of the 11th Jan- uary, some
                        members of the Delegation spent two hours complaining that the secretary had
                        not correctly reported their own discussion. It was then I proposed the
                        phonograph. It being then late, we all wanted to go, and passed the
                        remaining four questions on the ordre du jour in about 10 minutes </p>
