                    <head>The Nile</head>
                    <p>Sir William H. Preece’s paper, read before the Society of Arts on the 1st
                        inst, in which he discusses the measures that ought to be taken to increase
                        the flow and improve the navigation of the Nile between Assouan and Cairo,
                        merits the careful attention of our Irrigation Department. This branch of
                        the Egyptian Administration has hitherto been looked upon as the most
                        efficient that the country possesses. What has it to say to the following
                        impeachment extracted from Sir William Preece’s lecture? “I have seen no
                        evidence whatever of any engineering operations in hand either to maintain
                        the depth or to train the currents so as to keep the channels in their
                        proper course.I havenot seen a dredger at work, but my line of inspection
                        has been confined to Upper Egypt. On the other hand, the des­truction of the
                        banks by the shadoufs is only too apparent. There are no charts of the
                        river, nor is there any systematic survey in hand. I doubt if any other
                        river in the world is so badly treated.” Further on the lecturer proceeds to
                        point out that “thirty thousand tons of valuable mud are lost in the sea
                        every year, and the rise of the bed of the river in the Delta is a very
                        serious question.” It would be interesting to learn what the Department has
                        to say to Sir William Preece’s strictures, and how far it is considered that
                        the improvements he ad­vocates can be profitably undertaken. Surely so
                        serious an indictment as the wanton neglect of Egypt’s single waterway and
                        sole source of fertilisation, or, to adopt Sir William’s words, “the main
                        artery of life and commerce of the country,” calls insistently tor some
                        reply ; and the public mind, greatly disturbed by criticisms coming from so
                        highly qualified an expert, will not be tranquillised without some official
                        reassurance that matters are not so black as they are painted.</p>

                    <p>GRAND DUKE'S MURDER</p>
                    <p>THE TSAR'S GRIEF</p>
                    <p>STRIKES EXTENDING</p>
                    <p>ST. PETERSBURG, February 18. The Tsar deplores in a manifesto the death, by
                        the wicked hand of assassins, of his Uncle and friend “whose whole life was
                        devoted to the service of ourselves and the Fatherland.” An extraordinary
                        sitting of the Council of the Empire took place to-day in order to con-sider
                        the situation resulting from the assas-sination of the Grand Duke Sergius.
                        The leading Russian papers, while de-nouncing the assassination of the Grand
                        Duke Sergius, declare that the need for reforms is largely responsible, as
                        it promotes the revolu¬tionary propaganda. The town is being flooded with
                        revolutionary literature (Reuter) </p>
                    <p>ST. PETERSBURG, February 18. The Council of the Empire held an extra-ordinary
                        sittirg on the occasion of the death of the Grand Duke Sergius. A manifesto
                        of the Tsar expresses his grief at the assassination of the Grand Duke,
                        whose every action had been devoted to the service of his country. Every
                        Russian would share in the mourning, and would pray for the deceased.
                        (Havas.) </p>
                    <p>ST. PETERSBURG, February 19. The alarm caused here by the murder of the Grand
                        Duke Sergius has been intensified by the scattering broadcast of violent
                        revolutionary proclamations. Fresh strike troubles are announced from
                        different parts of Russia. (Reuter.) </p>
                    <p>LONDON, February 19. The King has ordered Court mourning during a week for
                        the Grand Duke Sergius. (Reuter.) </p>
                    <p>ST. PETERSBURG, February 18. The strike here is again rapidly extending.
                        30,000 men have rejoined the strikers, whose temper is now more threatening
                        than during the previous period. The troops have been re-drafted into the
                        vicinity of the works. The police are renewing their domiciliary visits and
                        arresting the leaders. (Reuter.) </p>
                    <p>ST. PETERSBURG, February 18. The employees of the South Western

                        have struck. The traffic on the last line is completely sus¬pended, and the
                        others partially so. (Reuter) </p>

                        cutters on the 13th inst, was surrounded on the 14th by an overwhelming

                        memorandum of the 22nd November. It says that the protecting Powers will not
                        tolerate annexation without the consent of the inhabitants, but the wording
                        generally appears to defer the realisation of the Greek hopes indefinitely.

                        quite phenomenal. On Saturday last, at 8 a.m., we touched the nearest point
                        registered to zero since 1888. Atthat hour the thermometer was only 3
                        degrees Centigrade above zero. The minimum during the 24 hours at Asslout
                        was 1 and Helouan and Ghizen 4 on that dale. Bad weather has been
                        experienced in the mediterranean. The Florio-Rubatino S.S. "Singapore,"
                        which was due at Alexandria yesterday at 2 p.m, only arrived this morning at
                        6 o' clock.</p>
                    <p>The ALEXANDRIA MURDER.-- The two men</p>
                    <p>who, as we announced on Saturday, have been arrested on the charge of
                        murdering the woman whose corpse was found in the Mahmoudiyah Canal some
                        weeks ago, have been handed over to the Parquet and the enquiry is still
                        proceeding. The trunk was found in a box in the canal and the head, arms,
                        and legs were discovered close by. The police, when the discovery was made,
                        were aware thatan old woman, about 60 years of age, who used to sell eggs in
                        the Souk el-Cantar, had been missing for some days past. Itwas known that
                        she wore artificial teeth, and when the head of the victim was discovered,
                        the verification of this peculiarity established the identity. Some persons
                        had seen two men wheeling a box by the canal, and the description of the box
                        called(CANT READ) with that which contained the trunk. The murdered woman
                        lived in the Souk el-Berslu(CANT READ), and one of their neighbours
                        recognised the murderers from the description. They both live in the same
                        house as did the victim, and when arrested accused each other of the crime.
                        They are very pour and had been out of work for some time. The woman was
                        evidently murdered for her valuables, as it was known that she had some
                        jewelry and trinkets in her room.</p>

                    <head>THE ROYAL VISIT</head>
                    <p>
                        <note><p>SERIOUS ACCIDENT AVERTED. </p><p>T.R.H. the Duke and Duchess of
                                Connaught, with the Princesses and H.H. the Khedive, honored the
                                Cairo Horse Show with their presence on Saturday afternoon.</p>
                            Yesterday morning, their Royal Highnesses attended divine service at All
                            Saints’ Church, and in the afternoon they drove out to Ghezireh. On
                            their return across the Nile bridge, what might have been a nasty
                            accident was narrowly averted. The horse of one of the soldiers of the
                            escort was frightened by the noise made by the large motor belonging to
                            Ghezireh Palace, which was drawn up with a number of other vehicles to
                            allow their Royal Highnesses to pass the bridge, and plunged and fell
                            with its rider. A policeman, named Papayanni, rushed up and by great
                            prompti­tude succeeded in getting horse and rider up again just in front
                            of the Royal carriage.<p>This morning the Duke of Conuaught in­spected
                                the troops at Kasrel-Nil at 9.40 o’clock in the barrack
                                square.</p><p>On Wednesday next the Duke and Du­chess will lunch at
                                the Citadel alter the inspection of the troops stationed
                                there.</p><p>On Thursday their Royal Highnesses will proceed to
                                Bedmchein before lunch in the steamboat “Misr” and will remain till
                                the evening at Sakkarah.</p><p>On or about the 27th inst. their
                                Royal Highnesses, who will probably be accompanied by Sir Wm.
                                Garstin, G.C.M.G., will visit the Cairo Barrage.</p><p>The date of
                                their arrival in Alexandria is still uncertain, but it is probable
                                that they will come down in the afternoon of the 27th and leave on
                                March 2 by H. M. S. “Essex” for Cyprus.</p><p>Owing to Court
                                mourning for the late Grand Duke Sergius, their Royal Highnesses
                                will be unable to attend any social functions.</p><p>MECCA
                                PILGRIMAGE.</p><p>A telegram from Mecca states that the Egyptian
                                pilgrimage has arrived at Mecca, the health of the pilgrims being
                                perfect.</p><p>The Board of Health at Constantinople has declared
                                the pilgrimage as free from epidemic.</p><p>FITZNER
                                QUATUOR.</p><p>The second Fitzner Quatuor concert took place at the
                                Khedivial on Friday before a small but appreciative audience. The
                                charity perform­ance next door at the Zizinia Theatre doubtless
                                would account to a certain extent for the absence of some who would
                                otherwise have been present. But the concert-going public of our
                                city require to be spooned with tickets and only buy when pressed to
                                do so. Anyhow, amateur performances are better attended than those
                                of the best European artists. The programme was a very beautiful and
                                highly interesting one and opened with a Quatuor in D Major by a
                                Russian composer, Giazounow. The Andante Allegro led off with a
                                fugue motif followed by a melody which was taken up by each
                                instrument in turn and again replaced by the fugue motif. The
                                Allegretto was noticeable for its pizzicato passages and cadenzas in
                                thirds perfectly played and apparently the performance of one
                                instrument. The Adagio was incomparably the finest movement of the
                                quartet. It seemed an imitation of the weird music of the AEolian
                                harp, and one distinctly heard the storm fined angrily dashing
                                against the strings and the gentle sighing answers of zephyrs
                                wearied out by the unequal contest. The Allegro was a bright finale
                                of feathered songsters twittering gaily after the cessation of the
                                storm. Dvorak’s Lento, entitled ‘Dumky,’ a Czech word, which was
                                untranslatable even to Austrians present, appeared to resemble a
                                Scotch or an Irish lament in its plaintive wailing melody, so much
                                so that we feel sure a Dumky is the expression musically of forlorn
                                love or a desolate hearth. It elicited a hearty encore which brought
                                hack the performers, who played an Andante movement from one of
                                Grief’s quartets, which was played in a masterly way and brought to
                                a finish with an astonishing chord passage of harmonics. Cherubini’s
                                Scherzo, which followed, was a sportive lively number, and then came
                                the “piece de resistance,” Beethoven’s Quartet in E Minor (op. 59 No
                                2). How can we dare describe the breadth and beauty of this music al
                                giant’s compositions? We cannot do better than refer music-lovers to
                                Sir George’s Grove’s Essay on Beethoven’s instrumental music.
                                Although the hour was late, nearing midnight, the audience was still
                                enthusiastic, and another encore was granted, when a second movement
                                from Grieg’s Quartet was given, a picturesque martial number in
                                which the dash of arms and the sorrowful tunes of mothers and wives
                                wailing for their lost ones followed one another in quick crashing
                                chords and softened subdued passages of impassioned grief. The
                                finish and ensemble of the Fitzuer Quatuor was admirable, so we have
                                confined ourselves to a mere description of the beautiful music they
                                played. It was altogether a feast for music-lovers.</p></note>
