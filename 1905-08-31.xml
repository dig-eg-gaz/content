                        <p>We have no excuse and no apology to offer for having coonpied so many
                            oolumns of onr special doable number of to-day with reports of the total
                            solar eclipse which darkened the Nile valley yesterday afternoon, and
                            with a variety of references to eclipses and their oon- oomitant
                            phenomena, whioh we have been a> some pains to oolleot. We are assured
                            that our readers will require no such apology. Those who are in Egypt
                            will have an interesting sou- venir of a remarkable event, and those of
                            our subscribers, who have avoided an exceptionally hot year by going
                            home to England or the con- tinent, and have thus missed the solar
                            eolipse —and the solar heat—oan console themselves with the possession
                            of full descriptions of the event, as seen from various looalities whioh
                            onr correspondents have forwarded us. Egypt will not see snoh a sight
                            again for a generation at least, and the next total eolipse to visit the
                            British Isles in 1927 wiH be con- fined to the Bast Coast of Inland and
                            ths Northern Counties of England. Ths last total soUpstofthe sob visible
                            in Hgypt took plaoe on May 17, 1882, when the "Egyptian Gazette" was in
                            its infancy and bnt little notice was taken of the phenomenon either by
                            this journal or by its local contemporaries. For this there was good
                            reason: Egypt was in the throes of a military revolution of which none
                            oonld see the end, Arabi and hiB oolonels were all powerful and within
                            less than a month ot the darken- ing of the snn, Alexandria vu in
                            mourning for the victims of the terrible riot whioh bronght about the
                            bombardment,- the war and the British Ooonpation. Many of those, who
                            took more than a passing interest in the eolipse of 1882 mast have fonnd
                            it hard to resist the impression that this was an evil omen, a portent
                            of war and ruin to the land over whioh it pasted. Yesterday all was at
                            peace in the lands from which the eolipse was visi- ble, above all in
                            Egypt, where no wars or rumours of wars disturbed a population that ias
                            forgotten the "events" in its anxiety that eaoh year’s ootton crop
                            should exoel the last, and, thanks to the presence of the European
                            schoolmaster and, we may add, to the wide inorease of enlightenment
                            among Moslem and Copt alike, the passing of the moon's shadow over the
                            glowing disc was recorded without 1 ear and with something more than
                            mere ohildish wonder and perplexity. Nor were Europeans indifferent to
                            the fascination of watching the dark shadow eat its way into the bright
                            oirole of the sud. Laymen and scientific amateurs gazed at the sky, the
                            most vigorous speculator forgot Nile—but we must avoid puffs even in onr
                            purplest passages— while he made alarming facial contortions at the
                            heavens through a disc of smoked glass, and np the Nile at red hot
                            Assouan scientists of three nations took valuable records of the
                            remarkable phenomena whioh aooompany every total eclipse. The
                            Commissions, whatever their sufferings from the climate, had no
                            atmospherio difficulties to oontend with, and they oonld sympathise with
                            the sufferings of astronomers under other skies oondemned to see a large
                            and inky olood bank hide the snn at the very moment of totality, or
                            onrse the fickle olimate of the north when rain andmiat cover the sky
                            all through that day of all others whioh should be dear and bright The
                            conditions under whioh yesterday's eolipse took plaoe were supremely
                            favorable to observers in Egypt, and we shall not be sur- prised to
                            learn that the observations taken by the numerous and distinguished
                            scientists at Assouan, have given highly snooessfnl results, and have
                            contributed largely to onr knowledge of solar astronomy and physios. The
                            study of the oorona, the measurement of its brightness at varying
                            distances from the son’s oentre, the determination of the quantity of
                            light that beoomes radially polarised, the photo- graphing of the field
                            of view all round the eclipsed snn in the hope of finding a new planet
                            even nearer than Meronryto the oentre of the solar system, and the
                            attempt to prove whether, when the son’s light is screened, a portion of
                            its magnetio rays are also ont off,—these are the ohief problems whioh
                            scientists in Spain, Algeria, and Egypt set themselves to solve
                            yesterday. We shall have to wait for the results of their observa- tions
                            to be studied and oompared in the great observatories of Europe and
                            America before we know all the additions made to astronomical and
                            physical soienoe, bnt we feel confident that none of the commissions
                            sent to solve these problems in Algeria and Spain will have the
                            mortifying experience that once befell oer- tain German observers who
                            ruefully oonfessed to Prince Bismarok that they had aohieved nothing.
                            “Why 1 ’ asked the Chanoeller "The ” began the ohief of the party, to be
                            ont short with an unfseling 1 Then you had better pay your own
                            expenses.” But when an eolipse does visit Egypt and especially Upper
                            Egypt there is every reason to count npon its being a speotaonlar and
                            aoientifio suc- cess. We have, in the Oriental phrase, been honoured by
                            the presence of some of the leaders of aatronomioal research, we have
                            had the pleasant and flattering experience of seeing The sun darkened by
                            the shadows of the world of whioh we form a part, we have had the satis-
                            faction of "assisting" at an event that will be- recorded long after we
                            have been forgotten, and that in our opinion, justifies the "Egyptian
                            Gazette’^ in devoting as muoh space to the topio of the day as if its
                            motto were—"Eclipse Piest—Ths Rest Nowhere.".</p>

                    <p>(By Telegraph)</p>
                    <p>Assouan, Wednesday.</p>

                    <p>This afternoon’s eclipse was a thorongh success, if I may be allowed to nse
                        the expression, and whatever the scientific results obtained, there can be
                        no doubt that the conditions were as favorable to observation as they well
                        could be. The wind was very light, and not a single cloud was visible during
                        the whole afternoon, though there a certain haziness about. Haze was of
                        course almost inevitable at this season of the rising Nile flood, but I have
                        not been informed that it appreciably interfered with observations. Numerous
                        observers were in the field. Besides the scientific parties and commissions,
                        not a few energetic amateurs had braved the heat and discomfort of a long
                        railway journey to go south to Assouan. Mr. Smyrnoff, the Russian Diplomatic
                        Agent in Egypt, Count Arrivabene Gonzaga, the Acting Diplomatic Agent for
                        Italy, Graft Antonio von Stadnicki, Secretary of Legation to the
                        Austro-Hungarian Diplomatic Agency, and M. Roman Ertbuer, secretary to the
                        Belgian Consulate General, left Cairo on Monday evening and arrived at the
                        Savoy Hotel last night, while Mr. Mitchell Innes, who gives a dinner to all
                        the astronomical missions to-night, Mr. A. L. Webb, C.M.G., and Mr.
                        Courtenay Clifton were also among the spectators. The Egyptian Government
                        mission was divided. Mr. Wade watched the eclipse from a height west of
                        Assouan, while Mr. Freeman’s station was near Edfou, and Mr. Macpherson and
                        Youssef Etfendi Fordi were at Dauhid south of the first cataract.</p>

                    <p>The members of the various scientific missions were early on the ground.
                        Special policemen and barriers of rope kept the meet carious at a distance
                        from the astronomers and their instruments, and long before the eclipse
                        began all was in the most perfeot readiness for the great event.</p>

                    <p>At 3.26 p.m. came the moment of first contract and thereafter the black line
                        of the moon’s shadow gradually gained on the glowing brightness of the sun.
                        The progress of the eclipse was followed with intense interest and it must
                        have seemed years to the more impatient observers before the phase of
                        totality was reached at 4.36 p.m. For two minutes and twenty four seconds
                        the sun was completely hidden. Several stars were plainly visible and the
                        planet Mars was remarkably conspicuous. Animal life was absolutely still in
                        the gloom, but for one flock of birds that passed overhead.</p>

                    <p>The corona afforded a most interesting study. The streamers were most
                        prominent in the sun spot zones, the western streamers being shorter and
                        more divergent, the longest, being quite two diameters of the sun in length.
                        Short streamers of light were also visible proceeding from the north and
                        south polar extremities of the sun. The prominences noticed were
                        particularly large, especially those which issued from the western side of
                        the obscured sun. </p>

                    <p>Then the bright edge of the sun began to emerge and the important part of
                        the eclipse was over. Nothing is known as yet of the results obtained by the
                        scientists who were at work in recording magnetic observation, and as the
                        photographic results await development it is impossible to give anything
                        like a complete description of what has actually been recorded by the
                        instruments. Further details will follow; in the meantime the eclipse may be
                        pronounced a success from every point of view. </p>

                    <head>AT ALEXANDRIA.</head>
                    <p>In Alexandria, as in every other town and village of Egypt, a keen interest
                        was taken in the eclipse, which was the topic of the day in some circles,
                        and in others was a close second either to the Peace or the effects of M.
                        Cronier’s suicide. Interest, indeed, is hardly a strong enough term for the
                        emotions that was stirred in the breasts of many Alexandrians by the
                        realisation of the fact that at one minute to three in the afternoon a
                        partial eclipso of the sun would commence, without fail, — for such events
                        are never postponed—and that led even bootblacks and marmitons to arm
                        themselves with pieces of smoked glass. As the time of the commencement of
                        the eclipse drew near, the streets, in some of the quarters, were full of
                        individuals braving a sunstroke or the wheels of the passing arabeahs in
                        wild anxiety lest the moment of contact should pass unobserved. Many
                        photographic records were taken, and the majority of those which we have
                        seen have been highly successful, portraying the crescent-like appearance of
                        the eclipsed sun with great accuracy. </p>
                    <p>Those who knew. nothing of science, and merely regarded the sun as a
                        provider of light and heat, and to whom the statement that the earth moves
                        round the sun is as improbable as its contrary is unimportant, anticipated
                        the event with a certain uneasiness. They had an idea that something was
                        going to happen to “Eshshems,” they had been told that its disc would be
                        almost entirely hidden from their view, and that day would become night, and
                        believing all, they brooded uneasily over what would happen, and wondered
                        what it would all look like. </p>
                    <p>How disappointed they must have been Unable to appreciate that the sun,
                        while completely hidden at Assouan, would be only partially obscured at
                        Alexandria and other stations even closer to the zone of totality, they had
                        hoped or feared that a great and solemn darkness would pass over the earth,
                        attended by rare and curious portents. </p>
                    <p>Bnt all they saw was a black something that came into contact with the rim
                        of the sun’s disc and ate its way into the fiery circle, disposing like a
                        glutton of more and more till, in the words of a spectator, “the sun looked
                        like a huge cheese from which a great piece had been bitten.” Such was the
                        eclipse to many of the smoked-glass enthusiasts. </p>
                    <p>The morning opened hazily enough, but the sky cleared as the day grew older,
                        and the conditions at the actual moment of the eclipse were as favorable as
                        any observer could desire. We chose the <placeName> Ras el Tin
                            lighthouse</placeName> as our point of observation, obtained admittance,
                        thanks to the kind offices of Admiral Sir R.M. Blomfield, and began our
                        climb. The extreme effort of climbing 261 steps to the summit, was right
                        well repaid, and had there been no eclipse we should never have regretted
                        it, for the view from the platform just below the light is the best in
                        Alexandria. The coast from San Stefano to Fort Agami the grey town, the
                        harbour with its shipping and quays and the Mariout Lake, white with salt
                        incrustations west of the causeway, a dull greenish grey to the east, were
                        all stretched below us, wonderfully clear and distinct despite the haze that
                        drew in from seaward, and in the harbour below the white sails of the racing
                        boats passed like swans. </p>
                    <p>At the first moment of contact nothing—but a violent and painful glare—was
                        visible to the naked eye, nor could the smoked glass show us anything, but
                        being provided with a fairly strong telescope with smoked lenses, we were
                        able to follow the progress of the moon’s shadow from start to finish. The
                        first sign of the eclipse that we could discern was a peculiar jaggedness in
                        the sun's circumference. </p>
                    <p>This was noticeable shortly after 3 p.m.— the first contact taking place at
                        2 h. 59 min. 41 sec. The shadow moved forward very slowly but by 3.30 p.m. a
                        certain diminution in the sun’s light and heat was apparent, and the glasses
                        showed that the circular edge of the moon had made considerable progress. </p>
                    <p>The effect of the diminution of the sun’s light was first obvious shortly
                        after 3.30 p.m, when the colours of the sea and shore, which had previously
                        been warm and glowing, began to wane and, if the expression may be used, to
                        fade. It was not that the actual colour of objects really changed, but that
                        its intensity diminished. </p>
                    <p>This feature increased with the progress of tbe eclipse, but it was not
                        possible to distinguish any change of colour till shortly before 4 p.m.,
                        when the obscuration was nearing its maximum. The sea was then a dead slaty
                        green in the harbour, a remarkably beautiful violet near the horizon, a dark
                        blue green in the middle distance. The Mariout Lake had completely lost its
                        colour, and objects on the shore seemed to be suffused with a slight shade
                        of yellow. At the time of maximum obscuration, the sun had shrunk to a
                        crescent which appeared to be a little larger than the new moon. No stars
                        were visible, at least from our vantage point. The day was now decidedly
                        dull, but not in the least dark; distant objects, though their colour had in
                        some degree faded or altered, being just as distinguishable as at midday. In
                        the town, owing to the abundance of shade from houses and the narrowness of
                        many of the streets the effect was certainly more marked, but we imagine
                        that many of the observers must have felt a certain disappointment at being
                        able to dispense with articial light; indeed the strongest impression left
                        on us was that of the immense power of the solar light even when reduced to
                        12% of its original volume. </p>
                    <p>The recovery from the obscuration does not meric special description. The
                        light returned very rapidly, and within half an hour from the moment of
                        maximum obscuration everything had regained its normal appearance. One
                        result of the eclipse which we noticed, was more durable, the later
                        afternoon though as damp as it always is in the autumn months, being much
                        cooler than usual. </p>

                <div type="item">
                    <head>AT CAIRO</head>
                    <p>(From Our Own Correspondent)</p>
                    <p>Cairo, Wednesday</p>
                    <p>The early morning yesterday was as dull and cloudy in Cairo as it usually is
                        at this period, but at about eight o’clock the atmosphere become quite clear
                        and continued so for the rest of the day, which was fortunate for those
                        anxious to have a good view of the phenomenon which, with one or two others
                        subjects, has been the chief topic of conversation for the past week or two,
                        not only amongst Europeans but also the educated portion of the native
                        population </p>
                    <p>Among the lowest classes of the latter the most extraordinary notions seemed
                        to prevail as to the cause of the wonder that was about to happen and its
                        conseqnenoes. Some of the more vigorous observers of religion uttered
                        prayers all the while. In the purely native quarters, troops of children
                        with a few adults as well perambulated the streets, beating tomtoms and
                        invoking divine protection. </p>
                    <p>In Cairo the eclipse was only partial but about nine-tenths of the sun’s
                        disc was covered and this took place at thirteen minutes past four when the
                        light became much dimmer, somewhat resembling a very bright moon- light
                        evening or the shortened twilight of this time of the year. It commenced at
                        four minutes past three and the eclipse ended at a quarter past five
                        o’olook. These were the times famished by the Survey Department which,
                        however, differed slightly from those given by the eminent astronomer, M.
                        Buscaloni, and published by us last Friday. Most of the Europeans witnessed
                        the phenomena from the house tops with smoked glasses, without which it was
                        not possible, even when the eclipse was at its fullest to look at the sun
                        with the naked eye with any comfort. </p>
                    <p>A Mahomedan writer of about a century back recounts that a total eclipse of
                        the sun in his time excited veritable terror amongst the population of
                        Cairo, many people being so alarmed as to hide themselves in barricaded
                        rooms. He likewise relates that animals and birds seemed as susceptible as
                        human beings, and doubtless had fear at the disappearance of the sun. </p>
                    <p>If this year’s had been also a total eclipse many strange sights would have
                        been witnessed in the metropolis amongst the illiterate native population.
                        According to another writer plants and flowers were influenced by the
                        phenomen a and the leaves of those plants that close at night did the same
                        during an eclipse that ocurred in his day. Whether such be a fact or not it
                        is for the astronomers of to-day to enlighten us. </p>

                    <head>AT PORT SAID.</head>
                    <p>(From Our Own Corespondent.)</p>
                    <p>Port Said, Wednesday</p>
                    <p>Very considerable interest has been taken in Port Said in the great event of
                        to-day, and the question of the eclipse has been the chief topio of
                        conversation with almost everyone. Telescopes of all sorts and sizes were
                        hastily prepared with little pieces of smoked orcolonred glass, and on all
                        hands, almost since the day broke, one could observe people gazing at the
                        snn, as though they could not depend upon scientists to have fixed the time
                        accurately. Even the Arab bootblack seems to have heard that somethiog.out
                        of the common was abont to happen, and with a certain amount of doubt and
                        apprehension looked upwards wondering, and expecting he knew not what. </p>

                    <p>The day broke in anything bnt a reassnring manner. Banks of cloud and mist
                        had gathered over the Bky, making the morning like an October one in
                        England. This mist and damp in the air is hot surprising in a way and indi-
                        rectly is nndontedly caused by the eolips e itself. The cause of tides, as
                        is well known, is due to the joint attraction of the sun and moon, and when
                        the two bodies aot in oonjunotion, as they do in a direct line daring an
                        eclipse, the effeot is a much higher tide than nsnal. Anyone here, who has
                        watohed the un behaviour lately, will have notioed how much higher the water
                        has stood in the early evening, and this has caused a quite unwonted
                        humidity and resultant mist for the last two mornings. </p>

                    <p>I explain this point as I have heard several people during the last few
                        days, propound deep theories on the weather changes which accompany
                        eclipses. It was not the direct influence of the eclipse on the weather
                        which caused the misty day, but the peculiar situation of lower Egypt,
                        having so much semi-marshy land which covers and uncovers with the slightest
                        tidal variation. </p>

                    <p>Long before the critical hour of first contact approached (the time at which
                        the moon’s disc touched the extreme edge of that of the sun) numbers of
                        people could be seen watching for the sun’s appearanoe through their
                        specially prepared shades and glasses. The hour, as published iu the
                        “Gazette," of 3.13 p.m. passed and few were aware of it, for without a good
                        telescope fitted with suitable shades, and without the observer knowing
                        exactly where to look, it is more than likely he would have seen nothing of
                        the herald of this wonderful phenomena. I was perhaps a little more
                        fortunate than many, having at my disposal a very good “Ross pancritic”
                        glass properly fitted up, aided by which I easily saw and noted the first
                        contact, which ocourred at 3h. 12m. 40sec. p.m. </p>

                    <p>Nothing particular was to be noted during the first few minutes, except the
                        gradual encroachment of the dark serrated-edged mass of the moon on the
                        bright solar disc, but towards four o’clook, daylight had very sensibly
                        diminished and terrestrial objects had begun to take on themselves the
                        weird, lurid, half eleotric type of light which is so peculiarly
                        characteristic of these eclipses. This strange colour which everything
                        rapidly took as time moved onwards appeared to resemble nothing so much as
                        the hue which objects have during the lightning flashes of a heavy
                        thunderstorm, the daylight becoming less and less as moments sped on towards
                        the hour of maximum eclipse. By 4.16 p.m.over 75 per cent of the sun’s light
                        had been cut off. </p>

                    <p>The calculated hour for Port Said of 4.26 p.m., at which the maximum eclipse
                        was to take place, seemed to pass without any special notice being taken of
                        it by the layman, as, for some moments before, owing to the effects of
                        irradiation, by virtue of which all bright objects to the naked eye appear
                        much larger than they really are, the blank disc of the moon seemed to the
                        naided eye to have almost ceased to move. </p>

                    <p>The sun at 4.26 p.m, greatly resembled a very bright new moon, having in its
                        arms an opaque disc suoh as is frequently seen at the period of perigee,
                        when, oembined with suitable weather conditions, the new moon appears to
                        hold the old one in its arms. </p>

                    <p>In Port Said to-day there was no sign of the corona which waa eagerly looked
                        for by many, and many people seemed disappointed that the day continned so
                        light, but it was hardly surprising, when one considers that only 27 minutes
                        of arc were out off. Near the south- western edge, however, a faint extended
                        phosphorescence could be seen, as I have stated. A planet for which I was on
                        the look out, was to be seen to the south, and I fancied I could piok up
                        another, Venus, close to the western horizon. but was not sure. </p>

                    <p>Regulus, a star of the first magnitude, situated only a few degrees west of
                        the two bodies, I could not piok up, nor did I see any of the numerous
                        smaller ones which in totality should have been clearly visible,— and so
                        passed the best of what we saw here of the eclipse. </p>

                    <p>By 4.45 p.m. most people appeared to have got tired of watching, especially
                        as every minute increased the size of the sun’s visible crescent, and the
                        consequent brightness of daylight, and all seemed to think that nothing more
                        was to be seen. </p>

                    <p>The moment of last contact when the moon finally left the eastern edge of
                        the sun, occured at the predicted time, 5.22 p.m. Then came the sunset,
                        which, I have noticed, on the day of solar eclipses generally has a beauty
                        all its own. The damp air here is peculiarly suited for these beautiful
                        effects and as the glowing orb sunk in the west into a somewhat hazy
                        horizon, the sky took on the same gloomy reds, yellows and dark blues
                        extending to the eastern horizon. </p>

                    <p>(By Telegraph).</p>
                    <p>Suez, Wednesday</p>
                    <p>The conditions under which the eclipse of the sun was viewed from this
                        station were exceedingly favorable. The sky was perfectly clear and not a
                        cloud was to be seen, and though there was a slight haze it did not
                        interfere in any way with the observations taken here. </p>
                    <p>It is safe to say that the eclipse was viewed by everybody in Suez, smoked
                        glasses were everywhere in evidence, and an altogether remarkable interest
                        was taken in the phenomenon. </p>

                    <p>The shadow of the moon was first observed in contact with the sun at eight
                        minutes past three by Cairo time or eight minutes past one by Greenwich
                        time, and it disappeared at thirteen minutes past five by Cairo time. The
                        direction waa S. S. E. 81° west. </p>

                    <p>At no time did darkness reech any great degree, but as the sun became
                        gradually more and more hidden the temperature grew appreciably cooler, and
                        a curious effect, of which I have never seen the parallel, was observable.
                        The light became much less intense and resembled neither night nor day,
                        objects assumed a peculiar outline, and the colour, or colors, I should say,
                        of the sea were indescribable. </p>

                    <p>The horizon was particularly noticeable. As the solar disc gradually
                        disappeared from view, a haziness appeared, and the outline, which during
                        most of the day had been well-defined, was first of all blurred, and it then
                        became difficult to distinguish, and at the same time assumed a greyish-blue
                        tint. </p>

                    <p>There was, however, at the place where the rays from the unobscured portion
                        of the sun lit upon the sea, a bright light, in strange contrast to its
                        surroundings, and of an almost silver hue, which gave an excellent effect. </p>

                    <p>In the town itself, I am told, an almost better effect was obtained than in
                        the open space from which I observed the eclipse, for here there was a
                        greater degree of darkness, which from a popular point of view, is the
                        greatest feature, of such a phenomenon, be it total, or be it partial, and
                        no little oonsternation was apparent amongst some of the more youthful
                        observers, who were unable to understand such a strange occurrence in broad
                        daylight. </p>

                    <p>The astronomists who witnessed the eclipse from here were all amateurs, so
                        that one cannot hope for an authentic aooount of the phenomena presented,
                        but the eclipse did not reach a sufficient degree of totality to render them
                        worthy of a special reoord. It has, however, been an event of great interest
                        to amateur astronomers and physicists, and many of these, who were unable to
                        go to that zone where their enthusiasm would have met with more valuable
                        results, will have interesting records of the great event of 1905 as seen at
                        Suez. </p>

                        for the space of sixty-eight seconds. The eclipse ended at forty five
                        minutes past five. Numerous observers watched the phenomenon from here and
                        special magnetic observations were taken from the roof of the great temple
                        here. The results showed that no special magnetic disturbances took place
                        during the eclipse. </p>

                        130 miles in diameter, first struck the earth at sunrise somewhere near
                        Winnipeg in Canada, and just skirting the southern shores of Hudson Bay its
                        centre reached the Atlantic on the coast of Labrador, near Domino Harbour.

                        Tripoli and the Gulf of Sidra traversed a portion of the Libyan Desert,
                        passing across Egypt, Assouan being near the centre line; and crossing the

                    <head>SHADOW BANDS.</head>
                    <p>There is an interesting and hitherto Unexplained phenomenon which is often
                        seen during a solar eclipse for a few seconds just before and just after
                        totality, and that is the appearance of what are called "shadow bands"
                        passing as waves of shadow with greater or less rapidity across the ground
                        or on the fronts of walls facing the sun. Although there is, perhaps, no
                        great scientific value to be anticipated from their investigation, their
                        very mysteriousness is a sufficient reason for their careful observation,
                        and at every station at which observers are stationed they have been noted,
                        and the following particulars recorded; the direction in which the bands
                        lie, the direction in which they move, the velocity with which they travel,
                        the width of the bands, and of the spaces between them. The object of this
                        investigation an attempt to ascertain if they be due to the effect of our
                        atmosphere, or to anything connected with the sun itself. That they are not
                        optical illusions is proved by the fact that they are nearly always seen by
                        several observers and have been photographed. It is possible they may be a
                        phenomenon of diffraction and interference occurring at a time when what is
                        still left of the photosphere is becoming a mere point of light in the sky,
                        but in either case their motion is, at present, impossible to explain. We
                        are not aware of the appearanoe of any of these bands during tbe eclipse of
                        yesterday, but it is quite possible that later news from our special
                        correspondent at Assouan may bear reference to them. </p>

                    <head>THE ECLIPSE OF THE SUN.</head>
                    <p>“The total eclipse of the sun, which took place this morning and was also
                        visible in Europe, began at Greenwich at 6 h. 10 m. this morning ; the
                        beginning of the total phase was «t 6 h. 46 m. and the end of this phase was
                        at 7 h. 23 m. The magnitude of the eclipse (at Greenwich) was 0.245. From
                        the first to the last contact with the shadow 5 h. 28 m. G' elapsed, the
                        first contact taking place at 5 h. 1 m. 2' and the last at 10 h. 29 m. 8'
                        morn. This day may, therefore, be said to have begun only at about half past
                        ten this morning, which will certainly have causecbsome excitement in many
                        of the vUlpfges of the interior. In many plaices the ignorant will have
                        thought that the eclipse was a presage ol‘ the beginning of the end. But
                        they will have speedily recognized that the darkness which accompanies the
                        maximum of such a pheno- menon was not even total. The only difference
                        observable was the fact that objects took a greenish or copper tint,
                        producing a strange effect, and which surprises every one who has not
                        witnessed this effect on some previous occasion.</p>
                    <p>Arago writes as fbllQwsj^specting the tota eclipse of thtf 8th
                        Julj*1842,\riiich he observer from Perpignan, and which surprised many of
                        inhabitants of that town :— ♦“The hour for the commencement of the eclipse
                        approached. Nearly twenty thousand persons examined, through smoked glass,
                        the radiant sun on its azure field. Till then, a legitimate curiosity had
                        inspired the spec- tators ; but, when the sun, reduced to &amp; narrow
                        strip, only threw a feeble light on the horizon, an unquiet feeling appeared
                        to agitate every person ; all appeared to wish to communicate their
                        impressions to those standing aroync them.</p>
                    <p>“Then there was a rumbling noise similar to that of a distant sea after a
                        storm. This noise grew louder and louder as the solar strip became gradually
                        less; the strip disappeared ; finally darkness suddenly succeeded to the
                        light, and a profound siienee marked this .phase or the eclipse, just as
                        clearly as had been done by the pendulum of our astronomical clock. “The
                        phenomenon, in all its magnificence, triumphed over the petulancy of youth,
                        over the light-headedness whioh is affected by a certain class of men as a
                        sign of superiority, over the noisy idifference customary among soldiers. A
                        profound silence reigned every- where, even the birds had ceased to sing.
                        “After a solemn pause of about two minutes transports of joy, loud shouts
                        saluted, with the same accord, the same spontaneity, the reappearance of the
                        sun’s rays.”</p>
                    <p>We may add to this account of the illustrious savant that the animals also
                        show their surprise by well understood movements, and even the vegetable
                        creation is subject to the influence of this phenomenon.</p>
                    <p>Eclipses of the sun occur whenever the moon passes before the sun, and
                        eclipses of the moon whenever that luminary enters the shadow which the
                        eather throws behind it. F^)ip«AH of the sun occur at new moon and' eclipses
                        of the moon are. only seen when it is > at its full. Only seven eclipses can
                        take place in any one year and never less than two; in the latter case they
                        are always eclipses qfi the sun. In every period of twenty eight jmji»and,
                        ten;days, there, are,, as a,mean, twenty eight central eclipses, that are
                        suscep- tible of becoming annular or total according to oiroumstances; but
                        as the terrestrial zone along which the phenomenon can be observed, either
                        in one phase or the other, is very narrow, total or partial eclipses are
                        extremely rare occurrences. At -Greenwich only one total eclipse was
                        observable during the eighteenth oentury, and this will be the last one
                        visible i there till next century.”</p>

                    <head>SUN SPOTS AND THE CORONA.</head>
                    <p>It is an interesting fact, and one fraught with great possibilities, that
                        between the eclipse of'1900 and that of 1905, both of which making so
                        similar a|J .track over the European Continent^ Jhere is, in one import- ant
                        respect, a great difference. While the 1900 eclipse, which was so well
                        observed in Spain and Algeria, was at a period of sunspot mini- mum, this
                        eclipse comes when sunspots are near their maximum. And as there is very
                        little doubt that there is a close connection between the nature and form of
                        the corona and the prevalence of sunspots, it may be hoped . that among the
                        many observations have been made on the corona and from stations s6 far
                        distant from one another as Labrador and Egypt, connected by a chain of
                        observing stations between, new light may-be thrown of the nature of
                        sunspots and on their connection with the great coronal envelope of the,
                        sun. That there is an undoubted connection be- tween sunspots and this earth
                        is now well established, and their influence upon,earth currents and
                        magnetio storms, by which telei- graphy is so often retarded, has parted
                        front the region of coincidence to take its place in that of cause and
                        effect; and when it is consid- ered how vast retire area of the solar atmos-
                        phere which is occupied by a large spot, some of them being 150,000 miles
                        across, and that they indicate gigantic activity in the envelop, ing
                        atmosphere of the sun the wonder fe rather that their influence upon the
                        earth is not greater than.it appears to be. There are among astronomers and
                        physicists very diverse opil tutm es to the ireton and origin of these great
                        fidUs ef activity W the sun,'and it may be Imped that the observations made
                        yesterday prey threw considerable light upon the question.</p>

Halley wrote a paper on the total solar
eclipse whioh occurred in LondoiMp^th^pear
1715, and mentions, in i 11 astratieira.efj.tlie
rarity of such phenomena, that no previous
eclipse of the same nature had been visible in
the rfnptrepolis,, since ifee gye*r. 1140. \ The
ffma^rtarfpsasawreradtf in that Mk4aJTOirq~
nicle” and short mention is made of it by'
William of Malmesbury. The “Saxon Chroni-
cle” states that “in the Lent the sun and the
day. dafken®d about the noontide of the day,
i-wheifimen warm eating, and they- did ^ight
their -"candles toeat by. That waadheHhif-
teenth day before the Calends of April Men
were very much struck with wonder.” William
of Malmesbury in mentioning the subject
in papers which he wrote says “that while
persons werf^re si^igiSl th^mejlsSfe J
darkness became so grtot' thatTThey “ftefed
the ancient chaos was about to return ; and
upon going out immediately they perceived
several stars about the sun.”
History mentions total eclipses of the sun
as having occurred in the years 1107, 1241,
1415, 1433, 1485, 1506, 1530, 1544, 1560,
1567, 1590, 1605, 1652, and fi1699. ’ The
eclipses of 1433, and 1598, and 1652 Were
viable in the British Isles, the first of-these
occurring in Scotland. According to Maolanrin
there is a manuscript account of the T433
eclipse preserved in the library of the Edin-
burgh university. The moon’s shadow on the
occasion of theeclipse of >1578 appears to have
passed'over the border, counties of England
and Scotland^ - and the day of its occurrence
which was a Saturday, was long known as
“Black Saturday.” The eclipse of 1652 was
visible in the North of,.: Ireland,] and in
Scotland.
In 1706 there occurred a total eclipse gf.
the sun which was visible in the southern
countries of Europe. At Montpelier, i where i t
was observed by Plantade and Capfes, the
total obscuration laster four minutes and ten
seconds. During this time the dark body of
moon appeared to be surrounded by a corona
of polar light The planets Venus, Mercury,
and Saturn, and several of the fixed stare were
visible to the naked eye. On the summits of
some ofithe mountains of Switzerland, where
the view was not impeded by the gross vapours
whioh accumulate in / the lower regions of the
atmosphere, the stare appeared as thiokly,
strewed as in the time of full moon.
On the 3rd May 1715 there ooourred a total

the same year. The total1 obscuration lasted
three nflnutes and twenty two seconds. The
planets Jupiter, Mercury, and Venus, as well,
as the fixed stare Gapella and Aldebaran, were
visible to the naked eye.
On May 22, 1724, a total eclipse of the
sun occurred at Paris. The total obscuration
lasted only a little more than two minntes.
Venus and Mercury and a few of the fixed
stars were visible to the naked eye.
The next total solar eclipse recorded in
history was visible in the 'northern countries
of Europe. It occurred on May 2, 1733. The
total obscuration lasted a little more than three
minntes. The planet Jupiter, the stars of
Ursa Major, Oapella, and-several others were
visible to thenaked eye. Besides the corona,
several reddish patches of light were seen
around the, dark body of the moon.

On the 24th June, 1778, a total eclipse1
of the sun was observed at s-i» by the Spanish
Admiral Don Antonio Ulloa, while proceeding
from the Azores to Oape St. Vincent The
obscuration last about four minutes and the
corona around the moon‘ appeared in great
splendour.
A total eclipse of the seen was -visible in
North America, at Kinderhook in the State of.
New York, on June 16, 1806, and. was observ-

Another total eclipse visible in America
occurred On the 30th of November 1834. It
'was observed at Milledgeville, Georgia, by the
French astronomer Nicollet, and the obscura-
tion on this occasion lasted one minute and
fifteen seconds. At Beaufort, South Carolina,
two planets and four stare of the first magni-
tude were visible to the naked eye.
A total solar eclipse was visible in the South
of Europe on July 7, -1842, and was- obeerved
at Perpignan hy the late .M. Arago and other
Frenoh astronomers, j The i sum was totally
obscured for two minutes andi twenty four

the totality lasted somewhat longer, -the time
recorded atLipeak being three minutes and
five seoonds. Several red protuberances were
also observed round the dark body of the
moon.
On the 8th Aogost 1850 there occurred a
-total eclipse of the son,, whioh was visible in
the islands of the Pacifio Ocean. It was
observed at Honolulu by Kutosyolri, who has

SOLAR ECLIPSES OF ANCIENT DAY$.
- i '	, 1
The- ancient literature of Greece and Rotde
contains several incidental allusions to tlite
occurrence of total eclipses of the sun. The
most celebrated of these is- the eclipse men-
tioned by -Herodotus as -having taken place
during a battle between the Modes and fife
Lydians. The story , relates ■ how- that the twp
hostile armies, were so terrified by-, the spec-
tacle of the eclipse;: , that they suddenly de-
sisted from fighting,, and eoeelnded a treated
of amity and peace. He further states that
the eclipse had been foretold to the doniaiM
by Thales , the Milesian. The .precise date ot
this eclipse has given rise to modkdtecusBion
fe, modern times. In , 1811 - the late-Francis
Baily cemmunioated a., paper to the^Royal
Society, in itwhich, by, ,availing himself-df

Hansen. The Donolusion .at .whiehJierMQvbi
is that the eclipse referred toby Herodotus
must have occurred on the 17th. (Scptefefeer|
585 B.C. „He . shows that this date.neootd*

is that the, eclipse referred toby Herodotus
must have occurred on tire 7 to , September;
585 B.C. .,He shows that this date, neoonis
satisfactorily with the eclipse recorded diwi
fee. time of Ag*4hoole8, and also with ad
eclipse briefly alluded to by., Xepophon, yfed
records it. as having ooourred at Larissa, id
Asia, during tire retreat of the ton thousand
j reeks along the .Tigris over fee high, table*
lands of Armenia to Trebitond (Trapezus) on
the Black Sea (400 B.C.).
Plutarch also makea jefewnoe to a total
eclipse of. the sun whioh , - ooouraed fe his
time. The aooount of^this is given in- his
“Dissertation-on the LunarRpots” and though
the allusion is brief, it is nevertheless fair
teresting. He says that it ooouned about
midday, that the darkness was so great M
to oause the day to rasetoble night, and feat
stars were visible all over the firmamtat.
Kepler; who investigated the probable time
of the ooourrence of this eclipse, is of opinion
that it is identical with one which took plies
n the year USA. D,

raftxtragdinary interest was aroused in Slain
byrfhe efiipse, and special preparations were

OTpeditions, both private and official erected
provisional observatories fe the eclipse zone and
the Spanish army was represented, several
to study the eclipse from the higher and more
rarefied strata of the atmosphere. The import-
ance of these observations, taken at heights
far above the clouds, must be very great and

reoords special instructions were issued to the
people and to the local authorities to secure
and guard these balloons on their fall.
King Alfonso XIII and the Royal family
went to Soria to observe the eclipse, and Mad-
rid society followed their example, the summer
visitors toMoncayo, and other well known
health resorts fe northern Spain,showing great
eagerness to be present at the chief points of
observation on toe great day. N umerous foreign

                    <p>Paris, August 30. The papers do scant justice to Japan's magnanimity. The
                        majority of the newspapers proclaim the Tsar's wisdom in refusing the
                        concessions. (Reuter)</p>

                    <p>London, August 30. The papers are unanimous in declaring that Japan's
                        extraordinary magnanimity is a lesson to the world, and in eulogising
                        President Roosevelt's efforts, to which peace is larely due. (Reuter)</p>

                    <p>Vienna, August 30. The Austrian and German press welcome the conclusion of
                        peace. The "Norddeutsche Zeitung," in a highly inspired article, says that
                        the resolution to yield may well have been no easy task for Japanese
                        statesmen but does honor to their wisdom. The Japanese concession is all the
                        more valuable as it is an act of voluntary self restraint and not the
                        outcome of any external pressure. (Reuter).</p>

                    <p>St. Petersburg, August 30. The journals deplore the conclusion of peace when
                        the army had become stronger than ever. The "Bourse Gazette" rejoices that
                        good sense has triumphed at Tokio. The "Novoye Vremya" says that peace is
                        disastrous for Russia. The "Sviet" states that all the Japanese concessions
                        pale before the loss of helf of the Saghalien Island. The "Ruski Listok"
                        welcomes peace as enabling Russia to reorganise her internal administration

              to give her the talaq’ or notice of divorce,
              proved that the unlucky woman had good
              reason for her demand, by beatiDg her savagely
              over the head and legs. The wife will require
              ton days’ medioal treatment. The proper treat-

              obvious.
              Hint to British Manufacturers. — The
              British Vice-Consul at Adana says in a recent
              report that the importation of British thresh-
              ing machines into Cilicia seems likely to
              increase in the future. Altogether some 15
              reapiog and threshing machines were imported
              from ihe United _ §ing4om during the year
              19G4. The sale of sttoh article’, which is now
              oaly in its infancy, appears likely to beoome
              important.
              British Chamber of Commerce.—We would
              draw the attention of manufacturers and mer-
              chants to the work of the British Chamber of
              Commerce of Egypt, which was formed in
              1896 with the sole object of .assisting British
              trade in this country. The services of the
              Chamber are always at the disposal of any
              member desiring information on trade matters
              generally, including the question of appoint-
              ing suitable agents. As no fee is oharged for
              such advice, it is obviously in the interests of
              all British traders here to beoome members,
              especially when it is remembered that the
              annual subscription is merely the nominal one
              of £1. The latter.payment alio includes a copy
              of the monthly Journal issued by the Chamber.

              showed an inor, am of about £5,000,000 on the
              previous year, 1903* The estimate for 1905 is
              put at about £80^0^060. It is interesting to

                        apparence qu’il soit de nature k entralner la faillite de la Sooiete. Le
                        President ne pou- vait, si mime il l’eftt voulu, miner d’un oonp nne societe
                        pareille. Les detoumements de fonds sont teparables. Quant k avoir engage
                        ontre mesure la societe, il ne faut pas oublier que leu^Sucreries et
                        Raffinerie ont leur siege an Cairo et que les differences de jeu, pour etre
                        opposables k une societe egyptienne, doivent fitre sanotionnees par la
                        justice du pays. Or, danB le cas qui nouB oooupe, l’exoeption de jeu trouve
                        pleinement son application. Il y a deplus des administrateurs qui oht outre-
                        passe '«urs pouvoirs et qui ne sauraient en aucune fa^on engager la Sooiete
                        des sucreries d’Egypte. Il est oonsolant pour les aotionnaires de voir qu’il
                        y a dans le oonseil d’administra- tion des gens presentaut de la surfaoe et
                        conacients de leur propre responsabilite, nous vonlons dire M. Barois,
                        administrates des ohemins de fer egyptiens, MM. Arbib et Ther- nynck; ainsi
                        que M. Dorizon, le Direoteur de la Societe Generate, un des plus puissants
                        ita- blissements de banque de France. Pour calmer les esprits, il est
                        necessaire que les administrateurs du Caire s’expliquent et publient un
                        bilan k oe jour le plus tdt pos- sible. C’est lk un devoir auquel ils ne
                        sauraient se derober, oar les aotionnaires peuvent, en vertu du droit
                        oommun, provoquer de telles declarations par voie de Justice. On doit faire
                        le jour le plus oomplet et dire aux aotionnaires oe qu’il en est de la
                        Sooiete et de son aotif. Un oommunique officiel seul pourra moderer la
                        surexoitation k laquelle sont en proie les Bour- ses de Paris et
                        d’Egypte.</p>

                    <p>There is nothing to do in the Canary Is- lauds, and one has no energy to do
                        it with. The climate is lovely, no donbt, for the snn bhines, and the daily
                        range of temperature even in February is no more than 65 to 70 degrees, bnt
                        only necessity can make a man energetic. What supplied me with the ne-
                        cessary strength of mind and body to tackle the Peak was the simple fact
                        that I had told frieLds of mine in England that I meant to do it Otherwise I
                        should have sat in a chair to look at it, or have ascended it by telescope
                        in the same way that Mark Twain did Mont Elanc. But having said I was going
                        to do it hampered me. On the evening of my arrival at Orotava I asked for
                        guides, and heard that those usually supplied by my hotel were away. I sent
                        tor one Frederico, not upon the list, and he came headlong from the Villa,
                        and brought his brother Dionisio. I was especially striot in ordering a
                        sound mule, one whioh was “sano” and had no sore upon it Frederico and
                        Dionisio swore by their gods and all the saints that they possessed the
                        soundest and most wonderful mule in all the islands, an animal which knew
                        the way to the Peak by himself and would carry me there as if I sat in an
                        armchair. For one rides to Alta Vista, where the hut stands at the height of
                        10,700 feet. As to being carried to that height as if in a chair or a
                        hammock I had my doubts, for I knew mules, and my notions on that r^Bead
                        were not far out. Moreno, for that was my mule’s name, indeed proved sound.
                        I took his saddle off to see, for in these matters no inhabitant of the
                        island is to be trusted, and he possessed all his skin, whioh is a rare
                        thing in the Canaries. So we started at seven in the morning, Dionisio and I
                        and a man called Teleforo, for Fredeiico had other work. I had made my
                        arrangements as to payment, and on telling them .that if I was satisfied I
                        should add another dollar or five pesetas to the agreed sum, they swore I
                        was a very noble Caballero, and one of the moBt generous people they had
                        ever had the luck to meet. This oheered me up, and we rode to the Villa
                        Orotava in great spirits, there picking up a pack mule, named after the
                        great Spanish painter, Murillo, which carried the forage and the men’s food
                        and my food and blankets. The Villa is a half-desert- ed, quiet town rather
                        more than a thousand feet above Orotava Puerto ; it has the same air of
                        exclusiveness that any half-ruined old aristo- crat might possess. Its quiet
                        is the quiet of poverty. And yet it is very beautifnl. An hour after leaving
                        the town we passed out of the area of cultivation and left the little hill
                        farms, ooming to thin forest and a flowering shrub called oodeso. Aftet the
                        little forests and the codeso we came to cinders. For, after all, the Canary
                        Islands are only seven cinders heaps, the product of .fire. A handful of
                        soil is always half cinders. The path grew steep and the mules slid and
                        floundered, and the Villa faded below us, and the port shone in sunshine on
                        the verge of the sea. And the sea horizon spread further and further and yet
                        appeared to rise till it seemed that we were in a deep cup. The illusion iB
                        difficult to rid one’s self of. And then at last we lost the sea for a time
                        and came to a scene of fiery deflation ; burnt rocks, oinder heaps, a split
                        or canyon, or barranco, called the Barranco de la Reina. Here the retama
                        begins, for on the upward lands of pumice and cinder, nothing can grow but
                        this. It is a strong and vigorous hard- wood shrub that grows in patches,
                        and it is sometimes ten feet high. The foliage is like mare’s tail; it is
                        tough and acrid, and the mules seemed to love it We were olose to the
                        Pertillo or gate to the Canyadas, by whioh one means the ancient and vast
                        crater in whioh the Peak as we know it now riees. For the old crater must
                        have been ore mighty lake of fire ten miles across, not perhaps all a flame
                        of lava at once but like Eilauea in the Sand- . which Island, an ebbing and
                        flowing sea of fire. The walls of this crater are partially swept away, but
                        even now they stand hundreds of feet high for long miles, and are huge but-
                        tresses scarped and scraped by the heat of centuries. Ard in places water
                        has washed them away. For sometimes the volcano has vomited floods. Ia other
                        parts towards the north-west these barriers are beaten as low as they are at
                        the Portillo. But towards Vilaflor they stand red, gigantic, and fire-eaten
                        relios of a dreadful past. How does the retama grow so green on cinders and
                        pumice 1 For these strange Canya- das are a great plain of pumice, beaten
                        and pounded into little fragments and to powder. The whole plain is brown
                        and white, the powdered ropilli move with the wind, move of themselves it
                        seems. For the dead branches of still rooted retama seem to flow down hill
                        on a faint slope from their parent roots. The air was fine and still as we
                        rode over the plain It reminded me of the air of the highest plateaus of
                        Texas. It was keen, intoxioating, bright. I forgot that I had no energy in
                        Orotava. The air of the C mya-^as seemed life itself And far across the
                        brown plain, which look- ed less barren than it was, for the oolonr recalled
                        the burnt and brown grasses of Australia, the Peak rose, the Peak of
                        Teneriffe. El Pico de Teide, the ancient home of the Guancbe gods. It was
                        even yet five thousand feet above us, but it showed itself as a bold homp, a
                        gigantic fnmarole shaped like a rounded breast with another oinder heap upon
                        its snmmit like a nipple. It was very old, very Strange, very grim, unlike
                        any other monntain that I bad seen. It possessed none of the terrors of the
                        icy peaks of the Alps, and yet •new gleamed upon it still. But it had a
                        character all its iwn. If was my first vcloanio fountain, 'fl To the■ left
                        as we went south-west Monte Bianco ro'e in another low hump, a mountain of
                        white pumioe. Here and there juts of volcanic rock protruded from the earth
                        of ash, like decayed tusks. Each tusk had once been a fire jet. Now we
                        passed bits of pumice, where a pumice mine had been, and Moreno plough- ed
                        through it almost as deeply as if it had been snow. Far above us on the
                        slopes leading to the Peak itself were huge separate blocks of lava, which
                        had rolled from a great lava dike as ice breaks from an ioofall. They shone
                        afar off, gleaming in the sun, polished, clean fractured like obsidian. And
                        the great walls or dikes of lava seemed ytt to roll down from the crater.
                        They showed black, tremendous and barren. It is only in the lower (run try
                        that the poisonous euphorbia grows on lava. Now we were even leaving the
                        hardy retama behind us as we climbed upward to the old oamping grounds where
                        people used to sleep before the high hut of Alta Vista was built. The first
                        camp was called Estancia de los Alemanos, and above it was the second one.
                        Estoncia de los Ingleses at nearly ten thousand feet. And now the worn rough
                        path over lava and oinder and loose rapilli zigzagged up the steep side of
                        the great cone. For hours I had seen no vegetation, no sign of life, not
                        even a vulture flew overhead, not so much as a strayed moth ; the world was
                        a glare of sand cinders, fine rapilli, white pumice, black lava. On either
                        hand as we criss-orossed up the steep slope a mighty dike of lava, broken,
                        oraokled like a spoilt glazed pot iu the fire, shone in the sun which now
                        began to leave us in shadow. In another hour we came to a little flat space,
                        and were at Alta Vista, the hut. It was four o’clook, and I looked down upon
                        a dead world of fire, and yet up to the horizon. For the sea-line climbed
                        high, we were in a well. The distances in spite of the clear air seemed
                        immense. The vast opposing wall of the Canyapas was red bastionod, and grim,
                        and as the sun began to get lower it grow pink and wonderful. The brown
                        stretches of the Canyadas themselves were a floor of yellowish fire. And
                        still the effect was not so desolate as it might have been, for here and
                        there a greenish mineral looked almost like grass, and the brown was the
                        exact brown of bnmt herb age. But with the one exception of that faiht rare
                        tinge of green, the whole chord of oolonr was at first in the oohres. While
                        the men unloaded the paok mule T sat on the doorstep of the hut and stared
                        east- ward. Grand Canary wa9 not visible. It lay under clouds, even as a
                        huge departing steamer might have been hidden under fresh smoke in a
                        following wind. I felt well. The fattgne of riding was on me but I felt no
                        touch of mountain sickness. I sighed a little now and again, but oould
                        smoke. So far the rise from the sea level to 10,700ft. had not affeoted my
                        heart. My mind too, went easily. I was pleased to be at Alto Vista, above
                        the world, in anoient peace and quiet. The wind was still. I looked down
                        upon a red moonscape, as it seemed to me. And as one sees the shadows of the
                        peaks in the moon, so now the shadows of the peak and the lesser fumaroles
                        orept across the floor of the Canya- das. Near me was a patch of snow, over
                        it was l>laok forbidding lava down below red faded to grey and darkened. The
                        shadow of the great oone orept aoross the floor. But above me the real moon
                        was gibbons and faint. The calm air froze. The shadow of the Peak became a
                        vast pyramid, outline! on the red-brown floor. It orept to the ancient
                        crater oliff, ciimbed it and went seaward. In half an hour the point of the
                        shadow was nearly to the horizon. The darkest umbral point of the shadow was
                        near the top. It look- ed like a floating cloud ; triangular, vagne ; a
                        shadow on the air. Overhead the sky was yellow and yellow-blue. The horizon
                        was rosy, and the oroter walls rosier still. The cliffs to- wards Vilaflor
                        shone wonderfally. And then the shadow of the Peak shot beyond the hori-
                        zon. The Canyadas were covered with a thin rey haze. They looked as if they
                        had been a sea. There was a line of whitened pumice and grey sand beneath
                        the crater walls, look- ing like an anoient beach. As the sun set the effect
                        was very beautiful. The shadow of the oone was visible in the very air.. The
                        Grand Canary clouds were grey, purple, and fine faint gold. I had my supper
                        alone in the paper-strewn fiat. Dionisio and Teleforo prepared their simple
                        meal of gofio and potatoes, and were lelighted to share my better food. But
                        delioaoy forbade them coming to my room. 1 lighted six indles, and had the
                        stove red with dried retama. Even so the cold was intense. Though 1 was
                        warmly olad I took my rug and, with n knife, cut a hole in the middle of it.
                        and converting it into a poncho, put my head through the hole. After food I
                        came ont on the plateau, and found the moon brighter, Under its rays the
                        snow patohes looked in- finitely cold and the black lava blaoker still. The
                        air was qniefi the frost intense. Thrice that night I rose to light the fire
                        again. And my two men slept in their room with a fire on the floor. The
                        smoke came through the cracks of the wall, and nearly choked me. I slept,
                        and froze, and woke, and cnrsed all monntain-olimbing, and remembered that
                        in Orotava I should have been sleeping with open windows. I woke finally at
                        dawn, vnd got my breakfast in a rage. Onoe more (as always) I determined to
                        climb no more monn- ains. And then Dionisio said he was ready if 1 was. We
                        started on the last fifteen hundred feet just as the son rose, and the bard
                        colours >f the morning illumined the oold world. The wind was bitter. I
                        never felt snoh oold. tad we passed much snow. The rough path was blocked
                        with it, and Dionisio evidently had all a Southerner’s dislike of it. I
                        found my ice-axe useful a dozen times. Certainly I need- ed it even si a
                        stick, for my breath grew mise- rably short. Every fifty feet I had to rest,
                        And at last we oame to the Rambleta, another plateau, onoe a orater from
                        whioh the final ash oone now springs. It was at a slope of a IP tie over SO
                        deg., and the ashes were soft. I was glad to see a patch of snow even if I
                        had to cut stops B it sooner than go upon the snow Dionisio went half a mile
                        round, while I cut my way up it Blowly. At the steep top of the snow I was
                        nttoriy exhanatc!, aod sat down for ten minutes. The top was yet infinitely
                        far away. I felt weak, frozen, my heart was feeble. It was obvious that the
                        easy Peak was not so easy to a man out of condition, to an invalid. But I
                        threw off my poncho, left it on the ashes, and climbed again. We oame to the
                        first blow-hole, and at the sight of the smoke I cheered up. When I came to
                        El Nariz as it is called, I knelt down and warmed my hands. But still the
                        top w is hundreds of feet above us. The ast pull was ihe worst of all, for
                        now the wind from the south-west, the Counter Equatorial current, blew
                        fiercely. When I topped the edge o( the high crater I was glad to fall flat
                        behind a rock and lie there to get my breath. And I smelt sulphur and
                        sulphurous aoid, and chok- ing fumes of it came at me in gusts, whioh
                        finally drove me right to the windward side, which was the last and final
                        snmmit of the peak. There are days when one sees the whole world, so to
                        speak, from the rocks above the sulphur pit. A man may count Teneriffe’s
                        satellites, Grand Canary, Fuertaventura, Lan- zarote to the east; Palma,
                        Gomera, and Hierro to the v e-t. There islands swim in luoid sea and air;
                        are painted in fine atmosphere on the climbing wall of the high sea
                        horizon.But such good fortune was not mine. The eastern islands were under
                        clouds an ! haze. And to the west there was a mighty sea of cloud under
                        whioh Palma and her neighbours lay like rocks be- neath snow. Yet suddenly
                        the oloud-blanket swayed and sank lower to the west; the heights of Palma
                        broke through ; and then Gomera showed darkly, and, beyond it, to the south-
                        west, Hierro.Then the olouds olosed again, and there was nothing visible but
                        the slopes of my own peak and the Canyadas, for even lower Tenerffi itse’f
                        was under olouds six thousand feet above the sea level. The whole world as I
                        saw it was Volcano. The looso-lipped, gaping orater of Chahorro was beneath
                        me to the west. It is dead, they say, yet it looked but asleep. Further
                        aoross the Canyadas and beyond them rose other volcanos, great fumaroles
                        visibly aotive, smok- ing heavily, like a steamer firing up with Newavt'o
                        coal. Two smoked furiously ; one puffed i t leisure over against Garaohioo,
                        onoe a great port bat destroyed by lava in 1706. As for me, I felt as if I
                        was being destroyed by frost, and crawled down into the orater, when I had
                        recovered my breath, to get warm at sulphur vents ; the oreater was white
                        and yellow, cracked and beamed. Out of cracks visible vapour oame, but here
                        and there an invisible gas nearly choked me. But the whole pit or fiery
                        saucer was warm and comfortable; I left it with reluctanoe, for still the
                        wind carried ioe in it, and bit and nipped me. I climbed once again tothe
                        highestrock and took in the volcanic world of ash, prized off the actual top
                        of tiie peak with the pick of my ice- axe and put it in my pocket, and then
                        turned to go back. We ran and slid to the Rambleta, one might almost have
                        glissaded on the steep ash. Bat as I descended I grew more tired ; the oold
                        got hold of me again. By the time I reached the hut,I was done for, and lay
                        on a mattress, glad to get a medicinal drink of brandy touched up with some
                        drops of nux vomica. My heart almost refused to beat, and I came to the
                        conclusion as I lay unable to move for over an hour that climbing even easy
                        mountains over 12,000 feet was not a proper amusement for an invalid. I
                        thought so even when I reached Orotava again that afternoon, after seven
                        hours on a mule, having descended from the Peak by way of La Fortaleza, lood
                        el Alto and the steep desoent over Realejo. But I am glad I went all the
                        same, for there are many mountains and only one Pioo de Teide.</p>

                    <p>“ Hurray ! Hnrray 7” They all oame running ont of the village school,
                        shouting, whooping the boys snatch- ing off and throwing np each other’s
                        caps. "Hprra-a-ay!” In more exuberance of joy, olose by the churchyard
                        steps, "girt” Jaok Bawdon shoved little Tommy Steer np against Priscilla
                        Baker, a’mott fit to knook her down “/ n’ you’d best to look out then to
                        what yon be about, John Bawdon. Girt bittle-head !" cried Priscilla with
                        sndden anger and a fine accession of dignity. Bat there was no time to
                        quarrel on that sunny summer afternoon. For .the whortleberries—"warte” they
                        called them, and even “harts”—were taming purple- ripe upon the moot, and
                        the holidays had begun. Those summer holidays, that began upon no fixed
                        date, bnt were a movable festival, changing according to the season, so that
                        the children might gather the wild harvest of the moorland. There were
                        little more than a score, though they made noise enough for a hundred as
                        they ran down the village street "Hoor-a-ay 1 " 1 have an affection for that
                        Exmoor village street It is so far-away, so quaint and old- world. j It rnns
                        along the hill-side, with little by- ways up the incline, so that the houses
                        Btand one behind and above the other. Bnt the sqnat embattled tower of the
                        old grey church rears higher than them all Before each cot- tage is a
                        slanting garden. Ranks of peas and tall soarlet runners, laden now with
                        flowers, as well as beans ready for use, ran parallel with the path of flat
                        stones from the front door to the hatoh. There are tall hoDy-hooks, groups
                        of blue monks’-hood, and here and there a fnohsia bash, bearing tiny red
                        flowers less than an inoh in length. All sorts of creepers olam- ber over
                        the white-washed front, and geraniams blind the downstair windows. There is
                        a clothesline, too, from which household olonts and wonderful unmentionable
                        garments flatter gaily in the wind. A faggot pile and a dark brown stack of
                        turves stand olose by. The smoke that rises curling ont of the ohimney is
                        bine and has no smuts. Down the valley, merrily humming aronnd rooks and
                        boulders, leaps the Bilver Barle ; and above the woods and enclosed fields
                        that skirt its oourse, both before and behind the village, lies the broad
                        moor where the whortle- berries grow. It is quite a little industry this
                        pioking of "wurts,” though it lasts only about three weeks. No other fruit
                        possesses so unexpected a flavour. None gives so fine a blend with the
                        scald-cream, which is one of the most admir- able institutions of the
                        neighbourhood. So there is invariably a great demand. And when the crop is
                        small, why the prioe goes so much the higher. We must all go “a-wnrting.” If
                        not for trade, as a sort of a picnic. I let it be known that a guide was
                        required to point ont the most fruitful places. Three applicants for the
                        post came running upon each other’s heels—“girt” Jack Bawdon, little Tommy
                        Steer, and Priscilla Baker, who arrived breathless, bnt three yards in
                        front. Priscilla, in my eyes, is not a beauty. She is fair and florid, with
                        hair like tow, and a broad open face that beams ingenuous innocence I
                        admired Prisoilla for this nnmixed candour. After all why not engage all

                        ee zay to a shil'on a piece 1” "Very well that will” “Or one an’ a penny,”
                        interrupted Prisoilla with convinotion. We agreed upon that The odd penny
                        seem- ed to give dignity to the transaction. It raised a mere oommon wage to
                        a professional honorarium. So now we had only to deoide where to go. “Girt”
                        Jack Bawdon shouted ont, “Why, Winsford Common, to bo sure," But a bit of a
                        frown puckered Prisoilla’s brow, and her thick red lips pnt on a pout “I
                        should say Withypool Moor,” cried she. To WithypooJ Moor we went. We began
                        with a mile of lane. Bnt a glorious lane between walled barks with
                        sheltering beech hedgerows high above. On either hand were bright green
                        ferns and taU purple fox- gloves, to which great bnmble-bees paid visita,
                        buzzing from flower to flower all up the taper ing stem, and silent only
                        when they orept within to drink, Wild strawberries, with deep orimson fruit,
                        sprang from the orevioes, and hang ripeniDg over the mossy stones. Wild
                        raspberries, too, on Lilliputian oanes, drawing an ancestry, it may be, from
                        bird carried seed of a more onltnred stock, flourished in profu- sion. “Ah (
                        They do beat the garden ones holler,” cried Priscilla, “That they do.” And
                        she held ont half on her brown palm. Otat it the shad/ lane, by a narrow
                        pathway np the slope, where bracken grows waist-high after the old heather
                        has been bnmt off, we olimbed to the ridge of the open, breezy moor.. Masses
                        of pnrple heather and the paler-oolonr- ed ling were in foil flower; and
                        growing amongst them, and intermingled everywhere, was the little dark green
                        myrtle-shaped leaf that halfoonoeals a berry almost the sire of a black
                        currant, and ooverad with a thicker bloom than the wild sloe. Honeybees wive
                        hamming on all side*, and butterflies went flitting by in tht inn. Upon the
                        lyrQwn hill- side of next ridge was passing the dark shadow of an Angast
                        thundercloud. We picked and picked, stopping only when some incident was
                        thought worthy of my attention. Priscilla’s eyes were the quickest. She
                        first took note of the buzzard circling with outspread rounded wings on his
                        way aoross the moor. She saw the raven too, which •'girt” Jaok Bawdon said
                        was nothing bnt a crow. Bnt little Tommy Steer was the hero of the day. He
                        oame upon an adder half asleep aoross a tuft of dry grass, and not having a
                        stick, stamped on it with his hob-nailed boot. “Lank, nasty girt thing !”
                        cried Prisoilla, as we gathered ronnd to look at the black diamonds down his
                        back. At noon we unanimously agreed to invest- igate the keep. We sat oat of
                        the son beside a stack of brown turves set np to dry. Most of onr fingers
                        were pnrple with the juioe of the whortleberies. So were three pairs of
                        lips. In the landscape we conld see the whitewashed village whence we oame.
                        “What are yon all going to be when yon grow up 1” “I shan’t bide here,” said
                        “girt” Jaok Bawdon. “Ne’et I,” cried Prisoilla. “Why what is but woods an’
                        moors and a river a-runnen all the wiok alike V ■ “I ihall go in the Lnnnon
                        p’lioe when I be a man,” declared little Tommy Steer. At one end of the
                        village, nnnotioed as yon pass the street, are two oottages. The doors are
                        broken, the windows are gone, there are , holes in the roo£ and weeds
                        growing on the thatch. The population has been dwindling for J years After
                        all we only picked a quart apiece. Bnt | as Prisoilla said, “Yon never can’t
                        tell. Maybe ' we ought to ’a-went to Winsford a’ter alL” I Wherever she may
                        go that girl ia destined to get on in life. She went to Winsford for herselt
                        the next day and picked a peck.</p>

GOALS.
A BROKEN-DOWN 3YSTEM.
This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors
give many names, but which few of them really
understand. It is simply weakness—a fayeak-down,
asit were, of the vital forces that sustainthe system.
No matter what may be its causes (for they are al-
most numberless), its symptomsaremuch the same:
the more prominent being sleeplessness, tease of
prostration nr weariness, depression:of spirits and
want of energy for all the ord'nary affairs of life.
Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such
cases is increased vitality—vigour—
VITAL STRENGTH & ENERGY

proves that as night succeed.-* the day this may ba
more certainly secured by a course of the cele-
brated life-reriving tonic

than by Any other known combination. So sorely
as it is taken in accordance with the printed

valueless. This wonderful medicament it purely
yegetahle and innocuous, is agreeable to the tasta
—suitable for all constitutions and conditions, in

disease or derangement, whose main features are
those of debility, that will not be speedily and
permanently benefited by this never-ailing recu-
perative essence, which is destined to cast into
oblivion everything that had preceded it for this
