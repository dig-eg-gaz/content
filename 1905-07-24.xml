                        coming out of the mosque that the bomb exploded. There were 40 killed, Turks
                        or soldiers, but no foreigners. The Sultan returned to the Palace with
                        absolute composure. The author of the outrage is said to have been killed.

                    <p>("Al Ahram”) We were horrified to hear by cable that his Majesty the
                        Sultan—whom God preserve- had been attacked during his return from the
                        ceremony of the Selamlik. But by his Majesty’s well-known good fortune he
                        escaped uninjured and we congratulate him on his escape from the dangerous
                        toils of a conspiracy. We hear that the Sultan displayed the usual composure
                        and courage which are the attributes of Turkish Sultans on occasions of
                        terror and dismay. With every good and honest Osmanli we con- gratulate his
                        Majesty on his escape and con- demn the miscreants who are responsible for
                        this nefarions attempt.</p>
                    <p>(“Al Moayad") We find it difficult to believe the shocking information of the
                        attack on our beloved Sultan,as the courtyard of the mosque is always full
                        of guards, officers of the army, aides-de- camp, and soldiers, and all the
                        necessary precautionary measures to deter evil-doers from entering are
                        usually taken and all suspected persona who bear the marks of guilt are
                        prompt- ly arrested and tried. How can the guilty wretch in the face of such
                        precautionary measures have dared to bring a dynamite bomb to the Selamlik
                        and hurl it at the Ruler as he left the mosque He most have been a desperate
                        character ready to sacrifice his own life. We are not surprised to hear that
                        many arrests have been made,as the incident is most dangerous to the
                        world....... The Turkish Government is the most cautions in guarding against
                        the occurrence of such incidents. May God save the Commander of the Faithful
                        from all harm and enable him to repress the foes of his Government</p>
                    <p>("Al Lewa") Our readers will have read the telegrams that announced the
                        preservation of our beloved Sultan by the will of Heaven from an abomina-
                        ble attempt on his life. We were glad to be able to despatch the following
                        telegram to H.E. Tah- sin Pasha, Chief Secretary ofthe Mabain:— “We,the
                        staff of’Al Lews,and all theMoslems of Egypt beg you to deign to inform our
                        beloved Khalif of our joy at his escape. We pray Heaven to give him long
                        life and to crush and exact punishment from the enemies of Islam." “Al Lews”
                        inserts the text of numerous telegrams from Egyptian notables professing
                        their joy at the escape of the Sultan and offering their congratulations on
                        his preserva- tion from harm.</p>

                    <p>The "Pall Mall Gazette” says The dinner of the Anglo-Egyptian Army, which
                        coincided in date with that given by the Army and Navy Club to the Duke of
                        Connaught, was, like it, a very remarkable gathering. Admiral Lucas, V.C,
                        ably presided at the last-named, Sir Reginald Wingate over the former, and
                        was supported by Sir Evelyn Wood, Sir John Maxwell, and a number of
                        distinguished offi- cers who made their career in Egypt Lord Kitchener
                        being, of course, unavoidably absent Time was when service in Egypt was the
                        only outlet for the adventurous, and numbers came to the front there whose
                        names have become household words. None has risen so fast or so high as Sir
                        Reginald Wingate, to whom we owe no small portion of the ultimate establish
                        ment of British power in the Sudan. Since he became Governor General Wingate
                        has worked little less than a miracle in the Sudan. He has abolished
                        "backsheesh," and that is no small achievement He had made up his mind that
                        the practice which had taken such a hold in Lower Egypt was a disgrace and a
                        discredit to the country, and he set himself at once to forbid it in the
                        Sudan. Orders were issued to the police to arrest summarily all and singular
                        who made the conventional appeal, and nothing strikes travellers to Khartoum
                        more nowadays than that the hateful word backsheesh is never heard.</p>

                            ; poor quel- ques-uns le chiffre primitif s’est maintenu; nous avons du

                        <p>Nous avons tout lieu d’etre satisfaits de nos deux cours de violon. Le

                    <head>COTTON GAMBLING IN EGYPT. QUESTIONS IN PARLIAMENT.</head>
                    <p>The following printed questions and answers in regard to cotton prices were
                        issued in Saturday week’s Parliamentary papers :— Mr. Field asked the First
                        Lord of the Treasury whether, in view of the opinion ex- pressed by Lord
                        Cromer, as stated b his official report for 1904 on gambling in futures and
                        options on the bourses of Egypt, in con- junction with the resolution passed
                        at the International Cotton Congress at Manchester on the 9th inst, he would
                        consider the advis- ability of the Government instructing His Majesty’s
                        representatives in Egypt, who are at present sitting as members of the
                        International Judicial Congress on the question of gambling in futures in
                        that country, to advocate repres- sive international legislative measures
                        for the joint benefit of Egypt and of manufacturers, operatives, and users ;
                        and whether he would give instructions that the official proceedings of the
                        International Cotton Congress recently held b Manchester, and also those of
                        the International Agricultural Con great lately held in Rome, should be
                        published b Blue-book form, in the same way as Lord Cromer’s report on Egypt
                        was published.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Balfour replied: The hon. gentleman has, I think, misapprehended the view
                        ex- pressed by Lord Cromer in his official report for 1904, as the following
                        passage will show "On the other band, most authorities hold the opinion, in
                        which I venture to express my entire concurrence, that it is practically im-
                        possible, by legislation, to put a stop to specu- lation without at the same
                        time causing great hindrance to trade in general If anything is done, it
                        will probably be in the direction of preparing a 'reglement de bonne’....."
                        In view hereof and of the fact that the resolution of the International
                        Cotton Congress merely suggested certain technical alterations of trade
                        practice, I do not think it would be expedient to act on the suggestion of
                        the hon. gentle- man. I have no right to give any instructions as to the
                        publication of the proceedings of the International Cotton Congress, which
                        is an un- official body, and as to the publication of the proceedings of the
                        recent International Agri- cultural Congress, perhaps the hon. gentleman
                        will consult the President of the Board of Agriculture.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Field asked the First Lord of the Treasury whether he is aware that,
                        owing to the actions of the bears in Liverpool and in America, forcing down
                        the price of cotton after the Sully collapse in 1904 from 9d. per pound to
                        the low price of 4d., the Southern Planters Cotton Association have entered
                        into a com- pact with the exchange gamblers of the latter country to reduce
                        the acreage of cotton for 1905-6 by about 25 per cent, and that specu-
                        lative advances have recently been operated in options and futures on the
                        Liverpool and the United States cotton exchanges, to the detri- ment of the
                        Lancashire cotton industry, and likewise to the world’s cotton trade
                        generally ; whether he would, in view of such artificial conditions, appoint
                        a special commission to inquire into and report upon transactions in-
                        juriously affecting international trade ; and whether he would confer with
                        President Roose- velt with the object of adopting some inter- national
                        cooperative endeavour in order to prevent a repetition of these
                        international gambling operations in the shape of paper sales of fictitious
                        products through option and future contracts.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Balfour replied : I am informed that no inch compact is known to the
                        Board of Trade, and its existence seems rather improbable. The price of
                        cotton has recently advanced in consequence, as I am told, of the
                        unexpectedly low official estimate of the coming crop. It is not proposed to
                        take the steps suggested by the hon. gentleman.</p>

                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette. Dear Sir,— The public very justly
                            thinks it hard lines that the only road on which everyone must take the
                            air, either in arabiehs and motors or on bikes, quadrupeds, etc., should
                            be subject to agricultural stenches of the worst description. If the
                            members of the Municipality had noses they could not drive out to Ramleh
                            without being perpetually sickened, especially when the wind is from the
                            Canal Is it absolutely necessary for the welfare of the proprietors, who
                            are probably related to members of the Municipality, that these heaps of
                            offensive material should be left for months on top of the land and not
                            be buried below the surface If we are to consider ourselves a civilised
                            community let us preserve the one road allowed us for our afternoon
                            drive, devoid of such Oriental barbarities.—Faithfully yours, A Woman
