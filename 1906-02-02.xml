                    <head>DISESTABLISHMENT IN FRANCE.</head>
                    <p>This morning's news from Paris shows that the making of inventories of State
                        property let to the French Church is ensuing trouble, and the disturbance at
                        St. Clothilde yesterday is only an echo of what is going on in the
                        provinces. At Nancy and one or two other places in eastern France priests
                        have read aloud protests against the violation of the churches, and have
                        refused to open the reliquaries. Their refusal has been respected, and
                        valuations have been taken at the word of the priest or a trustworthy
                        layman. Is one or two Breton villages there have been <cb n="6"/> slight
                        disturbances, and at Sables d'Olonne and at Boslogne the inspectors making
                        the inventories have been maltreated. Nevertheless, there is nothing as yet
                        to show that open opposition or disorder will become general.</p>
                    <p>There are several different schemes for raising the 1,460,000 hitherto paid
                        by the State. The Marquis Costa de Beauregard, the well-known Academician,
                        and one of the leading Roman Catholic laymen in Paris, has recently made a
                        suggestion, which has been quickly approved, and may possibly be adopted by
                        the Archiopiscopates. He bases his project on the latest estimate that there
                        are ten million Roman Catholics able and willing to pay for their religion.
                        He would have each of these pay one centime a day-yearly, quarterly, or
                        monthly-making no difference between rich and poor. One centime a day given
                        by ten millions would realise the necessary 1,460,000 a year. The larger
                        gifts, which, as the Marquis says, are like rainstorms, and do not last,
                        would pay for organisation, and would help the weaker dioceses. Until a
                        scheme has been adopted by the Roman Catholics will probably maintain their
                        churches by funds raised by the religious associations of each parish. In
                        Paris arrangements have been already made to do so. </p>
                    <p>According to an article in the "Matin" very few parish churches will suffer
                        through being deprived of the State suheidy. The "curee" alone had their
                        salaries paid by the State, their subordinate "vicaires" being supported by
                        the archbishoprie. By a levy on the parish associations, the archbishoprie
                        will assure a minimum salary of 120 to each "vicaire," and the parishes wil
                        support their own "cure." The way in which the different parishes raise
                        funds varies. St. Pierre de Chaillot, a very fashionable church, is paid to
                        have an average of one funeral de premiere class daily during three months
                        of the year, and thus makes about 2,400. Notre Dame de Loretta, whose
                        congregation is mostly well to do, is said to make half this sum, and the
                        income of its "cure" will only be diminished by 480, if at all. Other
                        churches in poorer parts of Paris are organising subscriptions, and one
                        church, appropriatey named Notre Dame du Travail, despairing of raising much
                        by subscriptsion, means to live on the profits of a chocolate factory
                        carried on by the Abbe Soulange, its founder.</p>
                    <p>The churches in the poorer country districts are in the worst case, and many
                        will have to depend on gifts from the lord of the manor. This dependence,
                        making the "cure" become chaplain of the castle, as the Marquis Costa de
                        Beauregard puts it, is thought by him to be undignified. He would prefer to
                        see priests supported by the people, and this is one of his principal
                        arguments in behalf of his scheme. Meanwhile the manna of large gifts does
                        not cease to fall. The Barones de Rothschild gave 14,400 only the other day.

                    <head>RHODESIAN COTTON GROWING.</head>
                    <p>Up to the present it has been open to question whether cotton grown in
                        Rhodesia would suit the manufacturing requirements of Lancashire. There was
                        never any doubt about the suitability of the soil and climate for certain
                        sorts; Nature long ago demonstrated that possibility by producing wild
                        cotton, without any help from man. Happily, the other and more important
                        issue is now decided. A considerable consignment of the Rhodesian product
                        recently landed at Liverpool has fetched almost fancy prices, local experts
                        having unanimously expressed most favourable opinions about the quality of
                        the fibre. The sole point in doubt, therefore, is whether the infant
                        industry seems likely to yield such profits as would stimulate its
                        expansion. That mainly depends on the cost of transport to Europe from the
                        cultivable area. There is, report says, a sufficiency of native labour on
                        the spot to insure cheap production, while British capital would not be
                        lacking when once the commercial profitableness of the venture was placed
                        beyond controversy. The railways rates to the coast and the port dues are
                        still very high, as are shipping frieghts and handling charges. But it is
                        hardly believable that self-interest will not influence these several
                        parties collectively to do all they can to promote the extension of
                        cultivation by cheapening the cost of transport. </p>

                    <dateline>Port Sudan, January 26.</dateline>
                    <p>There is an air of spaciousness about Port</p>
                    <p>Sudan that promises well for its future. The</p>
                    <p>main streets marked out by lines of posts are</p>
                    <p>wide—never under 50 feet and often more, the -</p>
                    <p>houses an in large open compounds, and the</p>
                    <p>careful sanitary precautions taken by the</p>
                    <p>authorities make the new port a model among </p>
                    <p>Eastern cities. Of course it is all unfinished</p>
                    <p>that goes without saying, for a twelvemonth</p>
                    <p>ago Sheikh Barghout boasted nothing but a</p>
                    <p>tomb and a few grass tukuls; but stone houses </p>
                    <p>will soon replace the wooden buildings and</p>
                    <p>such an excellent harbour is bound to make a</p>
                    <p>great city in time. In ten years’ time Port</p>
                    <p>Sudan will rival if it does not surpass the</p>
                    <p>greatest of the Red Sea coast towns of to-day,</p>
                    <p>and unlike Jeddah, Hodeidah, and Yambo it</p>
                    <p>already possesses the first essential of success,</p>
                    <p>a just and progressive Government.</p>
                    <p>To leave the future for the present and the</p>
                    <p>immediate past, the Legislative Council and</p>
                    <p>the correspondent have had a great day. We</p>
                    <p>could not leave ship till after 10 a.m., when</p>
                    <p>the whole party went on board the Diana,</p>
                    <p>where the guns, the wireless telegraphic</p>
                    <p>installation, and the explosion of a mine of</p>
                    <p>40 lbs. of gun cotton plowed everybody except</p>
                    <p>the fish, a number of which were picked up by</p>
                    <p>the crew who had laid the mine. Then the</p>
                    <p>party crossed to the southern side of the harbour and mounted a steam tram
                        which ran</p>
                    <p>round the N. of the town and swerving to the</p>
                    <p>South finally brought the party to the pulsometer plant which supplies the
                        town with</p>
                    <p>good water from a distance of over 3 1/2 miles.</p>
                    <p>The water is drawn from a well sunk in the</p>
                    <p>side of a broad wadi that runs down from the</p>
                    <p>hills S. W. of the port. At this point the</p>
                    <p>plateau of coral limestone on which the town</p>
                    <p>is built ends and an open sandy plain covered</p>
                    <p>with thorny tussochs stretches for some</p>
                    <p>distance and finally gives way to stony</p>
                    <p>country, rising very gradually to the foot</p>
                    <p>of the mountains. The prevailing colours are</p>
                    <p>greenish grey with yellow sand patches in the</p>
                    <p>foreground, the hills were misty, or rather,</p>
                    <p>less clearly outlined than is usually the case in</p>
                    <p>the desert, while the red-brown of the wooden</p>
                    <p>houses in the town relieved what would other-</p>
                    <p>wise have been a cold if interesting landscape.</p>
                    <p>The people were, of course, the most interesting objects ; the majority were
                        Hadendowa, red-brown people as a rule slightly</p>
                    <p>built but muscular and wiry, with none of</p>
                    <p>the heaviness that characterises the Egyptian,</p>
                    <p>with small, often regular features, straight-</p>
                    <p>nosed and nearer, so it seemed to me, to</p>
                    <p>the Abyssinian than to the Arab. As the tram</p>
                    <p>passed the straw tukls near the pulsometer</p>
                    <p>plant, where many of them had gathered to</p>
                    <p>watch the visitors, the women uttered thin-</p>
                    <p>quavering screams, shriller in tone but otherwise</p>
                    <p>resembling the Arab "zaghareet”.</p>
                    <p>The party returned to boat for lunch and</p>
                    <p>at about 2 p.m. the thudding of dozens of</p>
                    <p>darabukehs and the appearance of crowds of</p>
                    <p>natives stalking with long strides across the</p>
                    <p>open showed, if the flags and triumphal arches</p>
                    <p>were not sufficient, that the day was one of</p>
                    <p>festivity. <persName>Miralai Kennedy Bey</persName> and Bimbashi</p>
                    <p>Kelly had invited the whole of the Dakahlieh’s party to the R. E. Mess on
                        learning</p>
                    <p>that Lord Cromer’s arrival would be delayed</p>
                    <p>till 6 p.m., and at 4 p m. all were there</p>
                    <p>waiting the coming of the Sirdar ; shortly</p>
                    <p>after 4.30 p.m. the <persName>Sirdar and Lady Wingate</persName>;</p>
                    <p>with <persName>Slatin Pacha</persName>, arrived, and if ever a</p>
                    <p>gathering deserved to be called representative</p>
                    <p>it was this, for practically all the Headquarters</p>
                    <p>Staff and heads of the various Departments</p>
                    <p>of the Administration ware there, with all the</p>
                    <p>chief officials of the Red Sea province.</p>
                    <p>After the greetings between the Sirdar and</p>
                    <p>the Legislative Council and an excellent tea,</p>
                    <p>during which the Sudanese band played, a</p>
                    <p>camel race was announced and all the guests</p>
                    <p>lined the wall of the mess compound, while</p>
                    <p>the troopers of the Camel Police—mostly Hadendowa irregulars—kept back the
                        crowd. A</p>
                    <p>word as to these police—whoever designed</p>
                    <p>their uniforms had real artistic taste. A white</p>
                    <p>loose tunic and short loose Turkish trousers</p>
                    <p>reaching the knee, a scarlet sash and red</p>
                    <p>turban, red shoes, and leather gaiters made a</p>
                    <p>picturesque costume, and the black double</p>
                    <p>crosshilt of a dagger projecting from their</p>
                    <p>sashes gave a touch of wildness to the outfit</p>
                    <p>of these excellent irregulars.</p>
                    <p>The camels spel by amid dust and shouting,</p>
                    <p>a small boy rode the winner and came home</p>
                    <p>by a bare head. The prizes (in money) were</p>
                    <p>given by <persName>Lady Wingate</persName>. The half-naked Hadendowa boy came
                        up first, received the prize,</p>
                    <p>stared very hard at <persName>Lady Wingate</persName> and the</p>
                    <p>Europeans, and walked away, whereon the police seized him and bade him
                        salaam. With a</p>
                    <p>cheerful smile he applied two fingers to his</p>
                    <p>forehead and in a few minutes more he was</p>
                    <p>mounted again and tearing at fall speed over</p>
                    <p>a rough slope in answer to a challenge from</p>
                    <p>the second—a herculean savage from whom</p>
                    <p>he appeared to be leading till he vanished</p>
                    <p>from our sight.</p>
                    <p>Then the Sudanese band played the cake</p>
                    <p>walk, and a swarm of natives, Hadendowa,</p>
                    <p>Nubians, Dinkas, and Shillouks from the Nile</p>
                    <p>Turs from Darfur, and Arabs with every variety of mixed race poured into the
                        compound,</p>
                    <p>men and women. The drums thudded, the</p>
                    <p>elder women began to sing the men answering in a bass refrain, Arab in
                        character but</p>
                    <p>far more melodious than the Arab airs of</p>
                    <p>Egypt, and the dance began. I ought rather</p>
                    <p>say the dances: there was the ‘dilunka’ of the Nile Valley, a wild war dance
                        of the <cb n="3"/> Hadendowa, and half-a-dozen tribal dances.</p>
                    <p>All about the compound the groups shuffled</p>
                    <p>and hopped, or beat the ground like the Red</p>
                    <p>Indians of the schoolboy’s imagination and</p>
                    <p>threatened one another with fearful snarls and</p>
                    <p>strange grimaces. Here a line of men faced a</p>
                    <p>line of women and woman after woman broke</p>
                    <p>rank shuffled with a jigging step up to the</p>
                    <p>men, and came back hopping and shuffling with</p>
                    <p>a sturdy partner side by side with odd jerking</p>
                    <p>movements and raisings of the shoulders. Here</p>
                    <p>Hadendowa girls, their hair dressed in hundreds of greased plaits, came up
                        sidling, moving their beads forward and back like courting</p>
                    <p>pigeons, balancing and swaying, and as they</p>
                    <p>reached the Europeans threw back their heads</p>
                    <p>for the coin to be placed on their foreheads,</p>
                    <p>and still dancing dropped it into their</p>
                    <p>hands or a fold of their ‘tob.’ The official Sudan</p>
                    <p>was generous and one young lady arrayed in</p>
                    <p>a “tob”—a toga is perhaps the best European</p>
                    <p>equivalent—of yellow tussore striped with red</p>
                    <p>and wearing a head band of shells and red and</p>
                    <p>white coral beads, bore away a clear two dollars worth of silver to her
                        mother, who embraced her with more than maternal fervour.</p>
                    <p>All the time the drums beat time and the men</p>
                    <p>and women danced and sang together.</p>
                    <p>The dance over the party went to the ship.</p>
                    <p>The telegraph office had worked for the next</p>
                    <p>6 hours and closed at 8 p.m., which cheered the</p>
                    <p>Press, who were able to dispense with wiring</p>
                    <p>the news that Lord Cromer was still delayed.</p>
                    <p>It was only next day that we learnt that</p>
                    <p>“hot boxes,” or, in naval language, overheated</p>
                    <p>bearings, which at one time threatened to</p>
                    <p>stop his journey entirely, had delayed his</p>
                    <p>train from Wady Haifa to Atbara, and further,</p>
                    <p>had necessitated the shedding of a carriage</p>
                    <p>and had all but compelled the dropping of</p>
                    <p>the kitchen waggon, one of the wheels of which</p>
                    <p>became red hot, and had prevented the arrival</p>
                    <p>of his train till 11.30 p.m. The inspection was</p>
                    <p>put off till Saturday after the inauguration,</p>
                    <p>and neither Owen Bey nor Drury Bey, who</p>
                    <p>were bound by boat to Suakin, took part</p>
                    <p>therein and the proceedings had to be out as</p>
                    <p>short as possible.</p>
                    <p>The Diana was illuminated, and splendidly</p>
                    <p>illuminated too, rows if electric lights near</p>
                    <p>the water line, on the bow, masts and bulwarke,</p>
                    <p>and the Mukhbir and the Dakahlieh followed</p>
                    <p>saut. At 10.30 p.m. load explosions alarmed</p>
                    <p>the Legislative Council. The Dakahlieh’s fireworks were let loose and for the
                        next half-</p>
                    <p>hour rockets and serpents flew into the air</p>
                    <p>and the sea at various angles.</p>
                    <p>The Press quill drove or, to be more accurate, plied their pencils till
                        heaven knows</p>
                    <p>when, and even Mr. Blank had no time</p>
                    <p>to lecture his confrères on English literature</p>
                    <p>or on the Napoleon of the newspaper world.</p>
                    <p>At 4 a.m. all arose and, arrayed in their best,</p>
                    <p>went ashore for the function.</p>
                    <p>Then came this ceremony according to programme. It was long and a little
                        tiring. Every</p>
                    <p>one was there and in every costume : the</p>
                    <p>frocks of the European ladies present, among</p>
                    <p>them <persName>Lady Wingate</persName>. <persName>Mrs. de Halpert</persName>,
                        Mrs.</p>
                    <p>Kennedy, and <persName>Mrs. Windham</persName>, the red robes of</p>
                    <p>honour of the Sheikhs, some of whom had dyed</p>
                    <p>their beards a bright orange, the block and gold</p>
                    <p>loce of the Legislative Councillors the uniforms</p>
                    <p>of Sudanese and Egyptians, of British sailors</p>
                    <p>and soldiers. Two points deserved notice. One</p>
                    <p>was Chawarbi Pacha’s eloquent speech of which</p>
                    <p>I send a translation, the second Slatin Pacha’s</p>
                    <p>speech, each sentence of which was translated</p>
                    <p>into the Hadendowa by Karmakam Moh. Bey</p>
                    <p>Ahmed, Commandant of the Suakin Police,</p>
                    <p>At the close of the speeches came cheers</p>
                    <p>from the Hadendowa and the shrill cries</p>
                    <p>of the women, and then Lord Cromer,</p>
                    <p>after distributing the decorations, returned to his train for breakfast
                        before a</p>
                    <p>hurried inspection of the port. Chawarbi</p>
                    <p>Pacha took advantage of the brief delay</p>
                    <p>between the departure of the Dakahlieh</p>
                    <p>and the end of the ceremony to pay a</p>
                    <p>brief visit to the tomb of the Sheikh</p>
                    <p>who gave his name to the port of Sheikh</p>
                    <p>Barghoud and will, it is said, rebuild the tomb,</p>
                    <p>adding a dome to what is now a ruin and a</p>
                    <p>landmark.</p>
                    <p>At 10 25 a.m. the Dakahlieh started for</p>
                    <p>Suakin. Hamdulillah! we were spared the</p>
                    <p>necessity of getting our traps on land for</p>
                    <p>training to Suakin.</p>
                    <p>Among those present was Col. MoCracken,</p>
                    <p>commanding the 2nd Royal Barks Regiment.</p>
                    <p>In 1885 he accompanied the lost train that</p>
                    <p>retreated to Suakin, tearing up the rail as it</p>
                    <p>retired. 21 years afterwards he had travelled</p>
                    <p>from Khartoum to Suakin,—a notable instance</p>
                    <p>of Time's revenges</p>

                    <dateline>Khartoum, Thursday. 7 15 p.m.</dateline>
                    <p>To-day the members of the Legislative Council and the Press correspondents
                        visited Mr.</p>
                    <p>Capato’s land north of Khartoum in the</p>
                    <p>steamer Abbas Pacha, also the experimental</p>
                    <p>farm, where we saw good Mit Afifi and Jannovioh cotton. Afterwards a move was
                        made</p>
                    <p>to the Egyptian officers club, where we were</p>
                    <p>most hospitably entertained. We leave to-</p>
                    <p>morrow after paying a farewell visit and expressing our thanks to the Sirdar,
                        with</p>
                    <p>whom the members of the Legislative Council will lunch. To-night (Thursday)
                        they dine</p>
                    <p>with Slatin Pacha.</p>
                    <p>I must confess to having been greatly impressed with the work which is being
                        done</p>
                    <p>in Gordon College, where efficient subordinates have already been trained and
                        sent</p>
                    <p>out for the Government service, chiefly in the</p>
                    <p>survey department. Critics seem to me incapable of realising that a beginning
                        must</p>
                    <p>be made, unless sole reliance is to be planed</p>
                    <p>upon Egyptian employés, who stand the climate worse, cost more than twice as
                        much,</p>
                    <p>and do not possess any higher mental qualities that the Sudanese. This policy
                        will ultimately save thousand of pounds to the Sudan</p>
                    <p>in salaries. There is no fear, from what I</p>
                    <p>have seen, that the Sudanese will be turned</p>
                    <p>into persons of the Bengali Baboo type. The policy of adapting education to
                        the needs of the country is being studiously followed. </p>

                    <p>The season has tamed out to be a much</p>
                    <p>better one than was anticipated a month ago.</p>
                    <p>The holds an all fall and in most of the</p>
                    <p>pensions all the rooms have been engaged.</p>
                    <p>About 160 tourists are expected to arrive in a</p>
                    <p>few days from Assouan. The exaggerated</p>
                    <p>reports of the Alexandrian riot published in</p>
                    <p>the Riviera papers at the time, although they</p>
                    <p>prevented some people from coming to Egypt</p>
                    <p>as early as usual, have not permanently kept</p>
                    <p>tourists from leaving for the Egyptian resorts.</p>
                    <p>The scarcity of houses is still felt in Helouan, some families having
                        recently been compelled to seek accommodation in Cairo. Next</p>
                    <p>year, probably, houses will not be so scarce,</p>
                    <p>as there is building going on in several ports</p>
                    <p>of the town.</p>
                    <p>The Weather.</p>
                    <p>The weather during the greater part of</p>
                    <p>January has been very fine, and touristes have</p>
                    <p>been able to visit Sakharah, Wady Hof and</p>
                    <p>other places. Daring the past week, however,</p>
                    <p>the weather has been more unsettled. On</p>
                    <p>Sunday, there was an unusually heavy rainfall,</p>
                    <p>and the large number of people who had</p>
                    <p>arranged a trip to Sakharah had to travel</p>
                    <p>through a blinding sandstorm.</p>
                    <p>Among the latest arrivals in Helouan are</p>
                    <p><persName>Mr. J. Balm</persName>, the Belgian Consul at Lourenço</p>
                    <p>Marques, and family, who stay at the Villa</p>
                    <p>Savoy.</p>
                    <p>A Fowl Story.</p>
                    <p>There has bean a great scarcity of fowls in</p>
                    <p>Helouan during the last week or two. This is</p>
                    <p>no doubt due to the fact that hundreds of</p>
                    <p>birds are being swept away every week by</p>
                    <p>disease. One gentleman told me recently that</p>
                    <p>fowls are subjected to great cruelty in the district, and to prove his
                        assertion he related a</p>
                    <p>somewhat remarkable story. A few days previously he had bought a turkey,
                        which was to</p>
                    <p>be delivered on the following day. When the</p>
                    <p>turkey was delivered, the purchaser noticed</p>
                    <p>that though it was very heavy it appeared to</p>
                    <p>be much leaner than the one he had bought. A</p>
                    <p>slight examination disclosed the foot that the</p>
                    <p>poor bird had by some means been made the</p>
                    <p>receptacle of a large quantity of water, which</p>
                    <p>accounted for the extraordinary weight. Needless to say that the inflated
                        turkey was not the</p>
                    <p>one bought on the previous day.</p>
                    <p>Amusing.</p>
                    <p>Helonan people are, evidently, eerily pleased</p>
                    <p>in the way of amusements. A week or two</p>
                    <p>ago, an entertainer spotting the title of “Count”</p>
                    <p>and describing himself on the bills as "A</p>

                    <head>BIG COTTON FIRE.</head>
                    <head>ENORMOUS DAMAGE.</head>
                    <head>MINET EL BASSAL SHOONAH GUTTED.</head>
                    <p>Last night, one of those huge cotton conflagrations, which break out now and
                        again in the Minet el-Bessel quarter of Alexandria, took</p>
                    <p>place in the cotton press of the Société de</p>
                    <p>Pressage et des Dépôts, known by the name of</p>
                    <p>"Press ex-Choremi.”</p>
                    <p>The fire was observed about 10 o’clock and</p>
                    <p>in a very short space of time the flames were</p>
                    <p>bursting forth from the Press, illuminating the</p>
                    <p>entire quarter and throwing a lurid glare on</p>
                    <p>the sky, which must have been visible for</p>
                    <p>many miles around. </p>
                    <p>There were about 6,500 bales of cotton</p>
                    <p>in the building at the time, and it is presumed that the fire broke out in
                        one of the</p>
                    <p>bales. Sometimes a bale arrives from the interior with a little cotton
                        smouldering inside.</p>
                    <p>This goes on smouldering and spreading until</p>
                    <p>the bale bursts. Each has been the origin of</p>
                    <p>several similar conflagrations, and it may</p>
                    <p>well have been the case in the present instance.</p>
                    <p>As soon as the fire was perceived the alarm was given and among those
                        notified was Mr. Charruy, the general manager of </p>
                    <p>the company, who at once hurried down to </p>
                    <p>the spot. Among the directors of the company who also came were Mr.
                        Ambreise</p>
                    <p>Zervudachi, <persName>Mr. dé Techudi</persName>, and <persName>Mr.
                            Critchley</persName>, and in a very short space of time an enormous
                        crowd had gathered to watch the </p>
                    <p>conflagration, which soon began to assume</p>
                    <p>gigantic proportions. The spectacle was magnificent and awe-inspiring and the
                        absence </p>
                    <p>of the moon enhanced the terrific splendour </p>
                    <p>of the scene. The flames spurted from the </p>
                    <p>doomed building with extraordinary vehemence</p>
                    <p>and huge tongues of fire leaped towards the </p>
                    <p>sky, lightening up all the surrounding neighbourhood with a weirdly brilliant
                        effect. The Press soon resembled a burning, fiery furnace from whence
                        volumes of fire issued without intermission and with a ceaseless roar. </p>
                    <p>The Fire Brigade.</p>
                    <p>The Fire Brigade was very tardy in putting </p>
                    <p>in its appearance. It is alleged that the Brigade</p>
                    <p>was not notified of the outbreak at all, and </p>
                    <p>that the first intimation they received was the </p>
                    <p>reflection on the sky. It may be that in the</p>
                    <p>confusion that ensued at the Press, this essential notification was omitted,
                        but it it curious, </p>
                    <p>if this was the case, that an intimation was </p>
                    <p>sent at once to the manager of the company,</p>
                    <p>while, it is alleged, none was sent to the Fire Brigade.</p>
                    <p>When the Brigade did turn up the projection of water by the hoses was
                        lamentably</p>
                    <p>weak. We also noticed that the hoses had a </p>
                    <p>number of holes from which the water spurted </p>
                    <p>and appeared generally to be in need of repair. Surely the Alexandria
                        Municipality should see that sufficient funds are provided for this</p>
                    <p>most essential part of a Fire Brigade’s paraphernalia. If it be that the
                        grant to the</p>
                    <p>Alexandria Fire Brigade for hoses is insufficient, steps should at once be
                        taken to remedy</p>
                    <p>this disgraceful state of things, for the inefficiency</p>
                    <p>of the hose last night was apparent to</p>
                    <p>all observers. This should be remedied at once</p>
                    <p>and we are disagreeably surprised to find that</p>
                    <p>each a state of things existed. It is to be hoped</p>
                    <p>that the responsibility will be brought home</p>
                    <p>to some one. The Fire Brigade is a Municipal Department </p>
                    <p>and if the Municipality does not see that such</p>
                    <p>an important and elementary part of its</p>
                    <p>equipment as is the hose, is not in</p>
                    <p>an efficient condition, the Ministry of the Interior </p>
                    <p>ought to have the matter enquired into,</p>
                    <p>for the most valuable spot in Egypt is</p>
                    <p>the Minet el Bassal quarter of Alexandria and</p>
                    <p>conflagrations in the cotton presses and shoonahs are more calamitous and
                        costly than anywhere else in the country.</p>
                    <p>The Damage.</p>
                    <p>It is impossible to as yet estimate the damage</p>
                    <p>done, for at the present moment the fire is still</p>
                    <p>smouldering. Possibly, but it is a very rough</p>
                    <p>guess, about fifty per cent, of the contents of</p>
                    <p>the shoonah were destroyed. Of the four great</p>
                    <p>hydraulic presses two fell victims to the flames.</p>
                    <p>The fire was not so extensive as that which</p>
                    <p>occurred in a shoonah belonging to the same</p>
                    <p>company on the 9th December, 1901.</p>
                    <p>The fire was completely mastered at 5</p>
                    <p>o’olock this morning. It must be admitted that</p>
                    <p>the Fire Brigade did good work. To have</p>
                    <p>completely extinguished a huge roaring furnace within six hours of their
                        arrival, and prevented it from spreading to the adjoining buildings and
                        Stagni’s timber yards (fears for the safety of which were at one time
                        entertained) was certainly something of an achievement, though a certain
                        lack of organisation and combination was observable. The Brigade received
                        considerable aid in their heavy task from the Customs’ Guards firemen, who,
                        we believe, were first on the scene, and worked hard under the supervision
                        of Bimbashi Randall and Sagheolagassi Paling. The staff of the company did
                        their duty to the utmost, and Mr. Neill, the engineer, and Mr. Vannini, the
                        head storekeeper, were especially unremitting in their efforts. </p>

                            drove out the prefect of police and the Republican Guard. The bells rang
                            the tocsin : the guards finally broke in the doors with the butts of
                            their rifles and after a free fight expelled the demonstrators. 80
                            persons were injured and 150 arrests have been made. (Reuter)</p>

                    <p>The statements made by the Princess Nazli Hanem in her interview with a
                        Syrian journalist, as reproduced in our issue of Wednesday’s date, leads “Al
                        Lewa” to ask :- "Does it redound to the credit of the Khédivial family to
                        see one of its members openly abusing the family and dwelling on its
                        shortcomings? The answer to this question is better left to the Princes
                        themselves.” "Al Zaher” remarks that it does not contest the Princess's
                        eulogy of Lord Cromer, but that the statement made by her Highness to the
                        effect that there are no Egyptians sufficiently reliable to be capable of
                        self-government is regrettable, and such words will never be forgotten. We
                        have received the following communication on the subject:- Sir,—I am
                        flattered to find that my article in the “Zaher” relative to the Princess
                        Nazli’s adumbrations upon the backwardness of the Egyptians should have
                        received the high distinction of reproduction in your valued columns.
                        Perhaps however yon will permit me to indicate that your translator, though
                        an admirable interpreter of my words, missed the underlying meaning. We all
                        know the good Princess and her love of making known, her opinions even when
                        they are beside the mark and based upon superficial or even erroneous
                        information. My appeal to her Highness was intended to be ironical as indeed
                        were my descriptions of the pain and suffering occasioned to our people by
                        her frivolous reproaches. It would be far better for her to castigate her
                        own “babes in bibs” than to rash to print where she may meet with
                        retaliation.—I am, etc.,</p>

                    <head>THE TRAGEDY OF AN EGYPTIAN PRINCESS.</head>
                    <p>In his work of exploration in Egypt, <persName>Nicholas Gemond</persName>,
                        the famous archæologist, unearthed the sarcophagus of an ancient queen. He
                        shipped it to his home in Paris and there opened it with the most exquisite
                        delicacy in order that the mummy it contained might not be disturbed. He
                        found the body in a perfect state of preservation, enwrapped in mummy cloths
                        and shrouded in cloth of gold. He removed the body from the sarcophagus and
                        set it up in his study. He called his servant and told her the mummy must
                        not ever be touched, much less dusted, as it was very precious and
                        exceedingly fragile. The dead queen stood in an alcove of the Egyptologist’s
                        study, the object of an almost hieratic reverenge on his part. He longed to
                        remove the gold and resin that clothed her and gaze upon her face and form,
                        but knowledge that one touch of his hand would destroy forever the fragile
                        flesh within caused him to curb his curiosity and to worship with his eyes
                        alone. Once a month Gemond took a feather duster and, reverently and in
                        trepidation, whisked from his treasure the dust that had settled upon it. No
                        other hand but his was ever laid upon her who in life had reigned over Egypt
                        and who in death reined with no less authority over this quiet study in
                        Paris. He was her high priest and she was his goddess. But Gemond was alone
                        in his worship. His servant, a pious, practical Frenchwoman, saw with grave
                        disapproval this corpse, that ought to be underground, standing in her
                        master’s study ; the fact that it had lain buried thousands of years
                        rendered the sacrilege no less impious in her sight. But it was the dust
                        which gathered upon the mummy that most shocked her tidy soul, and her busy
                        fingers fairly itched to take off those golden robes and give them a shaking
                        and beating at an open window. Fear of her master alone restrained her, but
                        she would sniff with contempt at Gemond’s efforts to keep the mummy clean
                        with a feather duster. After the queen had reigned over the Parisian study
                        for several months, her high priest went out one day and forgot to look the
                        door of the room that was his shrine. The faithful Gabrielle seized the
                        opportunity to tidy up a bit. She dusted the books, she shook the rugs, she
                        placed her master’s papers in neat piles, she washed the windows and waxed
                        the floor and polished the mirror and did all the other little things that
                        only a woman's sense of neatness impels. At last she stood before the sacred
                        mummy and looked with ever-increasing rebellion at the veil of dust that
                        enshrouded it. Everything else in the room shone, and this alone stood
                        dusty. It was too much for her woman’s soul. What woman could have stood
                        such a sight? What woman would not have done as did Gabrielle-even with the
                        commands of her master to the contrary? What do men know about neatness,
                        anyway? She took the cloth of gold from the shoulders of the queen,
                        despoiled her of the royal death-robes and shook them out of the window.
                        Then she brushed them carefully and laid them aside. Having began her work,
                        she determined to finish it, and make a good job of it. So she began to
                        remove the brown mummy cloths in which Her Egyptian Majesty had slept for
                        all these thousands of years, determining to give them a good cleaning. But
                        what was her horror when she discovered that they fell to pieces in her
                        hands! Gabrielle stood as if transfixed. The soft brown linen dropped, bit
                        by bit, flaking away and crumbling as it fell. She seized the golden robes
                        and hurriedly draped them upon the silent form, hoping thereby to hide the
                        ravages her hands had wrought. But as she worked too roughly in her
                        hurry—she felt the whole mass crumble under her hands, and the cloth of gold
                        fell in a shapeless heap over a pile of brown dust. At this moment Nicolas
                        Gemond entered the room. Gabrielle jumped from her task and stood facing
                        him, her eyes wide with fright. The savant looked at the spot whereon had
                        stood his ancient queen, and beheld it empty. He seized the golden
                        draperies, and found beneath them nothing but a handful of dust. Then he
                        turned in speechless wrath and put a bullet through Gabrielle’s heart. The
                        faithful servant fell dead at his feet. Nicolas Gemond, the famous
                        Egyptologist, sits to-day in a cell in a Paris prison, a convicted murderer,
                        awaiting sentence of death.</p>

                        practically accounted for, as to day, the whole of the exports, taking
                        between them 13,232 000 eggs valued L. E. 10,736. The shipments rose to over
                        39 millions in 1899, and steadily increased afterwards until last year, when
                        the trade received a serious check owing to an outbreak of cholera amongst
                        the fowls. The loss of poultry from this cause was enormous, with the result
                        that although the reduction in numbers was to a large extent counterbalanced
                        by incubating operations at the end of the season—to which we shall again
                        refer—there are certainly grounds for fearing that the returns 1905/6 will
                        fall behind those of 1903/4. The spread of the plague was greatly assisted
                        by the natives themselves, who, as might be expected, failed to grasp the
                        importance of taking swift and drastic measures for stamping out the
                        disease. Such an elementary precaution as the proper disinfecting of crates,
                        etc., seems to have been largely disregarded, whole consignments of live
                        birds often arriving dead in Cairo after a journey from one of the villages
                        in Upper Egypt. At the present moment, so far as can be gathered, the plague
                        has practically died out, though it is yet too early to speak definitely on
                        the subject. The main source of the egg supply for export purposes is Upper
                        Egypt, one of the principal districts being from Baliana to the Fayoum. The
                        eggs are bought from the natives by local men who travel from village to
                        village very much after the plan of the same fraternity in England. The
                        goods are then sent by rail to Alexandria, where the "gatherers” agent sells
                        them to one of the export merchants. Any crate arriving with its contents at
                        all damp-and it should be remembered that the winter rains here are by no
                        means light—must immediately be sold locally, otherwise the contents will be
                        useless alter a couple of days or so. The next stage is "candling", which
                        consists in passing the eggs in front of a strong electric light in a dark
                        room, in order to discover all unsound, slightly broken or immature ones. At
                        the commencement of the season, each egg is treated separately, though later
                        on, when consignments are arriving every day, such a precaution is not
                        necessary to the same degree. After being sorted, the eggs are carefully
                        packed tier upon tier in timber boxes, each box containing 1440 eggs all
                        protected by wood wool. The crates are then shipped, abroad, the freight on
                        each being generally about 2s/l0d to either Hull, London, Liverpool, or
                        Glasgow. Turning to the financial side of the question, we may say that the
                        buying and celling rates have been gradually rising during the past few
                        years. For the season 1902/3 the price paid by the merchant to the middleman
                        per 1000 eggs delivered at Gabbary (Alexandria) railway station, began about
                        P.T. 140 (£1: 8: 8), rose to P.T. 165 (£1: 13 : 10) and finished off at,
                        say, PT. 130 (£1: 6: 7). During the season 1903/4 the same quotations were
                        P.T. 160 (£1: 12: 9), P.T. 180 (£1: 16: 10) and P.T. 145 (£1: 9: 8). For
                        1904/5 the figures increased to P.T. 170 (£1: 14: 10), P.T. 190 (1: 18: 11)
                        and P.T. 137 (£1: 8: 1); whilst the season which commenced last month opened
                        with P.T. 195 (£1: 19 : 11) and has already touched P.T. 200, (£2 : 1 : -),
                        the demand being very strong owing to the absence of the usual Russian
                        supply. As the eggs arrive in England at a time when the home production is
                        exceedingly smell, it is not surprising to find that fairly good prices are
                        obtained. An average rate for 120 eggs (known in the trade as a "gross”) c.
                        i. f. any of the ports mentioned previously is from 4/6 to-5/3, though this
                        year, in consequence of the demand and the high prices ruling in Egypt, the
                        rate has risen to 6/- ant even 6/9. The shipper, of course, pays for all
                        breakages, and he also takes the risk of any part of a consignment arriving
                        in an unsound condition. Eggs, larger than the ordinary ones, coming from
                        the Fayoum district, generally fetch an</p>

                    <p>additional 8/- to 10/- per case of 1,440, the merchant here paying an extra
                        5/- for the same quantity. At the present moment an effort is being made by
                        the export merchants to alter the terms of sale to f. o. b. Alexandria, at
                        any rate as regards new customers. An article such as the one under
                        discussion gives many facilities to buyers—other than those who are strictly
                        straight forward—to refuse delivery, or to claim heavy rebates, when the
                        market runs against them, and in such a case the merchant in Egypt is
                        practically in the hands of the consignee. Complaints are heard regarding
                        the treatment the eggs receive on the railways here whilst in transit from
                        the interior. The question of handling goods of this description is always a
                        troublesome one, but a trade involving over 100,000,000 eggs is certainly
                        entitled to some consideration in this respect. In goods stand the journey
                        to England extremely well, and it is much to be regretted that the
                        percentage of breakages at this end is so heavy. As regards the method of
                        raising large quantities of chickens, the native does not use this European
                        or American pattern of incubator. In various villages throughout the country
                        there are to be found specially built rooms, which are heated to a proper
                        temperature by means of fires. When the incubating process commences, two
                        men enter the room, which is then carefully closed up. The men remain in the
                        chamber from 24 to 30 days turning and examining the eggs once or twice
                        every twenty-four hours. A small space in the roof, covered with glass,
                        gives the required amount of light and food is passed in through another
                        small opening. Needless to say, the occupation is not a healthy one, though
                        the system appears to act very well as regards the production of birds.</p>

                    <p>Constantinople.</p>
                    <p>There is a point, all too often overlooked, which is greatly to the credit of
                        the Ottoman Government, and that is the care it excerises in protecting
                        various Christian interests and privileges against the aggression of another
                        party or creed. In Jerusalem, it is the Turkish troops who protect, let us
                        say, a Greek Orthodox procession against Gregorian Armenians, or any other
                        combination of creeds out of the multitude of conflicting Christian sects.
                        Even within the precincts of the Holy Sepulchre the Christians cannot be
                        trusted to keep order, and Turkish sentries stand on guard to see fair play
                        and no favour. Just such an issue of privilege is now raised by the envoys
                        of the Emperor Menelik, who have come here, it is alleged with £30,000 to
                        assist them in their mission. All that they ask for is a key, just a simple
                        key, to the portion of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre which is reserved
                        for the Copts. The Copts energetically oppose this innovation, stating that
                        the Abyssinians never had any right to a key, and have no just cause for
                        complaint, as the Abyssinian Christians are allowed free access to the
                        church on all days after four in the afternoon. The Porte would like to
                        oblige the Emperor Menelik, to whom, not too long ago, the Sultan sent a
                        special mission with decorations and presents, but, on the other hand, there
                        is the fear of serious disturbances resulting from a fanatical movement on
                        the part of the Copts. The British Government may easily be drawn into the
                        discussion, and would feel itself in mach the same uncertain position, for
                        as the Copts are all Egyptians they would certainly ask our support, while
                        we also seek the Emperor Menelik’s favour, notably as to his cooperation
                        with us in Upper Sudan. There is every probability that the Porte will be
                        firm enough to settle the question equitably, without any diplomatic
                        interference.</p>

                        features which have justly made of it one of the most popular books of
                        reference extant. Besides the almanac proper, with which everyone is
                        acquainted, the book contains a concise account of the Indian Empire,
                        followed by articles concerning the British Colonies (with statistical
                        tables showing their progress) and the principal foreign countries. These
                        geographical and historical summaries are supplemented by “A Political

                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                        <p>Sir, — I have read this work, so ably and impartially reviewed in your
                            columns; and in my opinion, though much space was devoted to criticism
                            not altogether favourable, such extensive comments were fully warranted
                            by the amount of speculation to which the work and its authorship have
                            given rise. The volume, venture to submit, though of a highly polemical
                            nature, was judiciously temperate in tone and eloquent in exposition.
                            The author has evidently studied world-politics to great advantage and
                            discusses the relative interests of the different countries concerned
                            with Egypt as if he were a familiar of the chancelleries of Europe. I
                            note, however, two omissions, in respect of which I would beg the
                            hospitality of your columns to enable me to call attention. The first
                            question that everyone asks himself when he considers this subject is,
                            "are the Egyptians ripe for independence?” It is a question which I will
                            not venture myself to answer as I can claim no authority for so doing
                            But the answer, and an authoritative one, has been given, and that
                            moreover in the affirmative, by the British Government so long ago as
                            1887 On the 22nd May of that year a treaty was signed by Mukhtar Pacha,
                            acting on behalf of the Turkish Government, and by Sir Henry Drummond
                            Wollff, acting on behalf of the British Government, the main provisions
                            of which were as follows :— "(1) The British troops were to be withdrawl
                            at the end of three years, or as soon after a possible coinciding with
                            the disappearance of internal end external danger to the polities and
                            territorial integrity of Egypt; (2) two years thereafter, British
                            supervision over the Egyptian Army was to cease; and (3) on the exchange
                            of ratifications between Great Britain and Turkey the Powers were to be
                            invited to give their adhesion to the terms of the convention, and to
                            recognise and guarantee the inviolability of Egyptian territory. Both
                            the Sultan by reason of his suzerainty, and Great Britain on account of
                            her responsible position, agree to mutually recognise their
                            corresponding rights to re-occupy Egypt, should circumstances arise that
                            imperilled the main objects of the convention ; but, so soon as such
                            dangers were past, they undertook to withdraw their armies. Moreover,
                            among other safeguards for the tranquillity and safety of Egypt, a
                            protocol was attached, providing for the institution of local and
                            uniform jurisdiction and legislature to which foreign residents would be
                            amenable. True, the treaty was never ratified by reason of the Sultan’s
                            refusal to do so, but the sign finance of the declaration made by
                            England in that treaty cannot be overrated.The irresistible inference to
                            be drawn from that declaration is that Egypt was approaching the moment
                            who she would be capable of governing herself. What is there that has
                            happened since this period to change so solemn and deliberate a
                            assertion? Have the Egyptians retrograded? If so, the blame mast rest
                            entirely wit the tutelary Power for having neglected their education.
                            But the reverse is conclusively the case if there be one word of truth
                            in the reports chronicling their continuous progress. Political memories
                            are proverbially unreliable and to this argument many will be inclined
                            to reply that the policy, which dictated to British withdrawal from
                            Egypt, was the same as was responsible for one disgraceful abandonment
                            of Gordon and the Sudan, or of discreditable surrender after Majuba
                            Hill, the policy which prompted the cry of "Perish India," which
                            advocated the sale of the Britiish shares in the Suez Canal, and which
                            may be compendiously characterised as "the policy of scuttle ” But a
                            comparison of dates will immediately make dear the fallacy of such a
                            constitution, for in 1887. the date when this treat was concluded,

                            office. It is extraordinary that the author of this work should have
                            failed to discuss the portentous significance of the above-mentioned
                            treaty, merely contenting himself with relegating it to a foot-note. The
                            other point which seems to have entirely escaped his notice is a
                            momentous statement made by Lord Cromer in his last report, which would
                            more than anything have assisted and reinforced his argument, namely, to
                            use his Lordship's own words, "Although it may take a long time to
                            arrive at Egyptian autonomy in the full sense of the term, at the same
                            time that autonomy is the ultimate goal towards which reform should be
                            gradually directed. Here we see, though starting from very different and
                            perhaps contrary standpoints, our author and the great Anglo-Egyptian
                            diplomatist are practically at one, the only apparent difference being
                            one not of substance but of time. One more observation perhaps I may be
                            permitted to make inclosing this somewhat lengthy letter, and that is by
                            way of reproach to the educated Egyptians, imbued with patriotic feeling
                            and absorbed in their country destiny, that pioneer work of this
                            description should have been left to foreign initiative.—I am, etc.,</p>

                    <p>The Egyptians had a very remarkable ordinance to prevent persona from
                        borrowing imprudently. An Egyptian was not permitted to borrow without
                        giving to his creditors in pledge the body of his father. It was deemed both
                        an impiety end an infamy not to redeem so sacred a pledge- A person who died
                        without discharging that duty was deprived of the customary honours paid to
                        the deed.</p>

                            startling changes. It is certain at least that he will not be tied down

                            that was to eject the School of Military Engineering from Chatham, so
                            long its head-quarters. It would, have been a costly move to tear up the
                            old institutions ; the fine mess, magnificent hand, and many heirlooms,
                            its many mementoes and portraits of distinguished sappers,

                            instructional facilities, in schools, lecture-rooms, ateliers, that have
                            gathered round the centre of scientific soldiering with which Chatham
                            had come to be synonymous. The place was essentially the Alma Mater of
                            the Royal Engineers, to which young officers came when first
                            commissioned, and laid the foundation of that varied knowledge that was
                            their indispensable stock-in-trade. It was the Mecca to which all tamed,
                            enshrining the best traditions of "the corps," as its members fondly
                            styled it, with a prestige that would have been slowly acquired on
                            Salisbury Plain. There were some arguments however, in favour of the
                            move, despite it inconvenience and the sentimental arguments, to
                            it—Chatham, like the great headquarters of Royal Artillery at Woolwich,
                            has its limitations of space for military operations, so much more
                            generously afforded in the southern command. The proposed exchange was
                            not, indeed, made hastily or capriciously, and might have been upheld on
                            plausible grounds. Few, however, will regret its postponement, or that
                            the contemplated expenditure is to be saved for application to more
                            essential Army needs. Mr. Haldane will have trouble enough with his
                            estimates when they are brought in, and although he promises boldly to
                            show no undue cheeseparing where efficiency is at stake, it is safe to
                            predict that he is already largely committed to unavoidable
                            expenditure.</p>

                    <p>The margin of profit in the spinning of fine counts as spun in Bolton from
                        Egyptian cotton is wider than for a long time back. The gain per pound is
                        greater than a month ago. To, buy cotton last week in Alexandria and sell
                        say, 60s T. in Manchester meant a profit of fully 1 1/2 d. per pound, some
                        experts making it close upon 2d. Producers are making a considerable amount
                        of money. Engagements are extensive. Spinners are literally pulled out of
                        the place for deliveries towards contracts placed by users some months ago.
                        It need hardly be said that the Finn Spinners’ Combine is participating in
                        the good times. Mr. William Tattersall, of Manchester, says the outlook for
                        very fine numbers is most encouraging.</p>
