                        <head>SAGHALIEN.</head>
                        <p>The long-expected attack on Saghalien has come to pass, and a formidable
                            Japanese Armada has appeared off Korsakovsk, silenced the Russian
                            batteries, and protected the landing of a brigade. The shore defences,
                            hastily improvised and unsupported by permanent fortifioations, were
                            unable to resist the invaders. General Liapunoff has made off at his
                            best speed and the Russian garrison, hampered with the care of thousands
                            of convicts, is not likely to make a very effective resistance to an
                            enemy inspired by the memory of previous successes and fiercely anxious
                            to win back for the Island Empire the territory she lost in the days of
                            her weakness. </p>
                        <p>The Peace Commissioners will meet at Washington in a few weeks’ time, and
                            the statement so often made by “Russian officials who are in touch with
                            the Foreign Office, etc.,” that Russia will fight to the bitter end
                            rather than surrender a foot of real Russian soil— Port Arthur, of
                            course, was leased and Manchuria “occupied”—will he thoroughly tested.
                            Possession is nine points of the law and the Japanese plenipotentiaries,
                            secure in their knowledge that the island is their prize, are not likely
                            to abandon it a second time without exacting a most substantial quid pro
                            quo. The Russians, on the other hand, have to face the fact that the
                            conquest of Saghalien will greatly aid the Japanese attack on
                            Vladivostok and even on General Linievitoh. With Korsakovsk and Aniwa
                            Bay in Japanese hands, vessels laden with provisions and contraband of
                            war destined <cb n="6"/>for the “Eye of the East” are not likely to risk
                            the dangerous passage of the Straits of La Perouse, and the long island
                            will famish an admirable base for a Japanese attack on Nico-laievsk and
                            the mouth of the Amur. With Nioolaievsk in Japanese hands an advance to
                            Khabarovka and the catting of Vladivostok’s northern communications
                            would be a matter of ease, and once established at Khabarovka there is
                            no reason to suppose that the Japanese might not organise a harassing
                            river warfare on the Hank of the Russian line of communications. The
                            Amur and the Sungari are navigable by the light gunboats and smaller
                            torpedo craft of which the Japanese possess large numbers, and the mere
                            threat of a flank and rear attack would force General Linievitch to
                            reconsider his confident remarks of a few weeks past. The approaching
                            capture of the island also has its bearing on the question of indemnity.
                            Russia may wish to buy back the island whose riches she has hardly begun
                            to exploit and the occupation of the maritime province, so artfully
                            obtained by Muravieff after the third Chinese war, may make her
                            statesmen doubt the wisdom of a policy which, if persisted in, may lead
                            to the economic suffocation of the whole of western Siberia. </p>

                            which he spent in riotous living. The remonstrances of the justly
                            indignant sheikh appear to have inspired the boy with the idea of
                            killing his father and sisters, and enjoying the family wealth at his
                            ease. He accordingly mixed powdered datura leaf with their food and when
                            asked to eat with them, refused. Within an hour of the meal, the sheikh
                            and his three daughters showed symptoms of datura poisoning. The
                            principal medical officer of the moudirieh was called in, and
                            recognising the symptoms, asked the son why he would not eat with his

                            poison found in his pockets. The sheikh and his daughters, who are still

                    the Acting Sirdar expresses his appreciation of the services rendered by this
                    officer for the last ten years. During this period he has taken part with the
                    Egyptian Army in the following campaigns and actions:— Expedition to
                        <placeName>Dongola</placeName>, 1896, actions of

                    the Nile Expedition of 1899. As Commandant of the Artillery and Director of
                    Ordnance, which appointments he held for the last six and four years
                    respectively, and when in command of the Sudd Expedition, which in 1900 opened
                    up the <placeName>White Nile</placeName>to navigation, the excellence and
                    thoroughness of his work was most conspicuous. The Sirdar also expresses his
                    great regret at El Miralai Peake Bey’s retirement from the Egyptian Army, and in
                    the name of the army wishes him every success in his future career.</p>

                <p>The Acting Sirdar has issued a Special Army Order announcing to the army with the
                    deepest regret the death of<persName>El Kaimakam H. L. H. Fell Bey</persName>,
                    Senior Inspector of the<placeName>Bahr El Ghazal Province</placeName>, which
                    occurred at <placeName>Tembura</placeName>, in the<placeName>Bahr El
                        Ghazal</placeName>, on the 19th June. Fell Bey joined the Egyptian Army on
                    the 26th February, 1899, and took part in the following campaigns with that
                        Force:—<placeName>Nile</placeName>Expedition 1899;
                        <placeName>Sudan</placeName>, 1900-02. — Re-occupation of the

                    the army of this valuable officer, whose services in the Bahr El Ghazal had been
                    of conspicuous merit.</p>

                    <dateline><placeName>Port Said</placeName>, Sunday.</dateline>
                    <p>Yesterday afternoon, the Messageries S.S. “Polynesien” arrived from
                            <placeName>Aden</placeName>, at which port she had taken on board 250 of
                        the survivors the Wreck of the “Chadoc,” which was lost! on ÷ on 26th June.
                        The S.S. “Iraouaddy,” of the same company, has just arrived from the canal,
                        haying on board the remaining 360, all of whom were picked up by the Russian
                        Volunteer cruiser “Rion” (ex “Smolensk”) on the 1st inst, and landed at
                        Aden, at which port the “Rion” was obliged to coal, she having burned all
                        her woodwork and fittings to enable her to
                        reach<placeName>Aden</placeName>.</p>
                    <p>In an interview which I had with two of the passengers of the “Chadoc,” I
                        learned that the vessel went ashore at 4 a.m. close under Guardafui on the
                        26th ulto. and that most of the ship’s boats were broken
                            <placeName>up</placeName>.</p>
                    <p>The Somalis, many of whom spoke French, having served in the “Haussas,” took
                        the whole number, including 80 children, off the vessel, only one being lost
                        in the rescue operations. The passengers in many cases were able to save
                        their personal effects, and the steward’s department to disembark a quantity
                        of provisions. The natives built them rude huts of twigs and gorse and
                        treated them all with considerable kindness, which belies the general idea
                        entertained that the men of that coast are utter savages.</p>
                    <p>After four days spent in the village, they were able to attract the attention
                        of the “Rion” by means of a signal staff erected on a sand-hill to the north
                        of the Cape and were all embarked (save one, who was lost two days before)
                        on the Russian vessel, arriving at Aden all well on the morning of the 4th
                        July.</p>
                    <p>By the “Polynesien” there also arrived 190 Russian refugees, who were
                        transferred to the S.S. “Tchihatchoff,” which vessel sailed last night
                        direct for<placeName>Odessa</placeName>.</p>

                    <p>Some two months ago, I noted the destruction of the “Bains Minerve” and the
                        refusal of the authorities to allow a syndicate to build a similar place on
                        account of the reputation which it had gained. Since then, land has been let
                        in large quantities for the erection of bath houses on the beach, and now,
                        instead of the gambling and so on being carried on in one large building,
                        there are at least 20 or 30 in which the wildest of orgies take place
                        nightly. Not content with that, the whole line of beach is now filthy in the
                        extreme and a grave menace to health—and the police do not see that which is
                        plain to every resident.</p>

                    <head>WATER POLO. R. A. M. C. v. ALEX. SWIMMING CLUB.</head>
                    <p>This fixture was brought off on Saturday afternoon at Rs-el-Tin in lovely
                        weather and before a good turn-out of spectators, both on shore and in boats
                        surrounding the enclosure. The R. A. M. C. started the game with the sun in
                        their eyes and after some near passing Ames got through the defence and
                        opened the score by a high-placed goal, the ball just clearing the
                        cross-bar, in favor of his team. Halftime arrived with a score of one goal
                        to the R A M. C.</p>
                    <p>On resuming, the club team carried the ball down field and for a time the
                        game was confined to the homesters’ goal. Some neat and exciting passing now
                        took place and Ecclestone, clearing, put a well-placed goal in, thus
                        bringing the club’s team score to one. Fast play was now witnessed, the R.
                        A. M.C. . trying hard for the conqueror, but time was celled, the score
                        remaining one all.</p>
                    <p>The following were the teams R.A.M.C.: Steele, Cruise, White, Bright, Ames,
                        Benn, Adams being in goal. Alexandria Swimming Club: Wood, Hewgill, Mace,
                        Darton, Ecclestone, and Webb in goal. Referee: Q. M. S. Sauders</p>
                    <p>Members are hereby notified that from Saturday next, the weekly meetings will
                        be held at the basin entered by Custom House Gate No. 28, adjacent to

                    <head>MOROCCO’S ROYAL NAVY. A TRAGEDY OF MISMANAGEMENT.</head>
                    <p>Morocco, which to-day might almost be called the central objective of
                        European diplomacy, once dominated European waters. In the eighteenth
                        century Morocco was the scourge of the Mediterranean, and actually her
                        corsairs looted English and Irish coast towns. In the early nineteenth
                        century, even, our merchants paid annual tribute to Morocco, to save their
                        fleets from capture and destruction. During that same nineteenth century the
                        Moors lost even the rudimentary art required to build a row-boat. Towards
                        the close of the century Morocco purchased a navy, and within the present
                        young century I inspected that navy before it was sold, lest worse things
                        befel and it should sink at its moorings. </p>
                    <p>The naval history of Morocco has been almost as chequered and romantic as the
                        story of the Moorish dominion upon dry land, from the stage of nomadic
                        barbarism to the ruling of Southern Europe and the apex of civilisation, and
                        from the enslaving of thousands of Christians, as recently as the eighteenth
                        cen tury, down to the bankrupt, tottering desiccation of the Empire’s state
                        to-day. But my business of the moment is with the Moorish navy of yesterday,
                        of Morocco’s last stage of decadence. </p>
                    <p>Some ten years ago, while yet the late Moulai el Hassan sat under the Green
                        Parasol, and the present Sultan dwelt within the shadowy precincts of the
                        Shareefian hareem, an enterprising member of Italian mission in Morocco
                        secured an order for a small armoured cruiser to be built in the Fratelli
                        Orlando dockyard at Leghorn at a cost somewhat under £100,000. In due course
                        the bill was presented, the cruiser, El Bashir, being ready for sea, and
                        manned by Italians. Then began the complications which attend movements of
                        all kinds in Al Moghreb. The other Powers, with a smile and a bow for Italy,
                        turned and rent the Sultan for his partiality, and demanded orders for
                        similar vessels. The Sultan, as by tradition taught, procrastinated. Italy
                        presented another bill. The jealous Powers clamoured like bagmen. </p>
                    <p>“Plague take the ship, and the whole accursed tribe of Nazarenes !” said the
                        Sultan. “I’ll do without it, and take no ships from any of you. Now perhaps
                        you will leave me alone.” Naturally Italy demurred, and finally a compromise
                        was effected. Some years had passed, and Moulai El Hassan had been called to
                        the Shareefian pavilion which doubtless awaited him in Paradise ; Moors who
                        had been entered for training in the Italian navy were forgotten and left
                        there ; many things had changed, but, at long last, El Bashir was duly
                        delivered in Tangier Bay, and it was solemnly agreed that no Power
                        “interested in” Morocco should permit any of its subjects to man the dainty
                        craft once she had been taken over by her new owners. </p>
                    <p>The Moorish gentlemen of Italian naval training came ashore in all the glory
                        of gold braid and uniform. They dispersed in holiday vein to their homes in
                        the interior, shedding their civilization with the various portions of their
                        uniforms that pleased the country-folk, and taking, as ducks to water, to
                        the old, primitive life of camel-drivers and half-naked tillers of the
                        earth. The cruiser, a graceful, yacht-like little vessel, of, perhaps, 1,100
                        tons, had been securely moored by her vendors. A Moorish crew was duly
                        appointed, and the vessel given over to its tender mercies by the Moorish
                        paymaster, who had never trod a deck in his life, but had paid a thumping
                        sum for this post. (There were several commanders, but in Morocco the real
                        master is always the man who holds the purse.) </p>
                    <p>El Bashir accumulated barnacles, and a fine foot-long fringe of weed. One day
                        it was decided that she should be anchored on the other side of the bay. She
                        had to be towed from one anchorage to another ! That rather riled Al
                        Moghreb, proud of its new toy, and an English engineer was engaged to set El
                        Bashir’s "steam devil business” in order. Your marine engineer is not given
                        to maudlin ways, but this member of the fraternity is said to have wept when
                        he ended his inspection of engines which, a few months before, had left
                        Italy in perfect order. Curses rather than tears were presently his portion. </p>
                    <p>Work that he ordered Mohamed to set about was shruggingly delegated to
                        Cassim, who lit a cigarette and bade Absalaam, who recommended Hamadi to the
                        task, and invited him to smoke, whilst Achmet, the head rascal of my
                        unfortunate compatriot’s gang, entertained them all with the story of his
                        ancle’s wife's sister’s marriage with a kaid from Al-Ksar. In this pleasing
                        manner the days passed, whilst the beautiful Bashir lay rotting at her
                        moorings, and tears and perspiration oozed from out the Christian engineer.
                        At length he came ashore, a saddened and exhausted man, and resigned his
                        post, for which piece of honesty all credit is due to him. </p>
                    <p>The Bashir possessed a steam pinnace. It was allowed to fall from its davits
                        ; it filled and sank in eight to ten fathoms of water. I asked a Moorish
                        naval officer about this some six months later. “Oh, that’s all right,” he
                        told me. “We know where it is.” Amazing person : I believe the pinnace is
                        there yet. </p>
                    <p>An English naval officer was invited to take over the command of El Bashir,
                        after her galley had been set afire by the crowding in it of half a dozen
                        smoking cooks. The Englishman went aboard to inspect, and was shown round by
                        a few of El Bashir’s numerous commanders. After a deal of trouble, the key
                        of the powder and ammunition magazine was found in a flag looker, and a Moor
                        led the way thither, a cigarette in one hand and a lighted candle in the
                        other ! The key of this place ? Oh, the paymaster had that, and he was <cb
                            n="2"/>ashore. Of the other place ? It was with the first lieutenant,
                        and he was engaged at cards in the forecastle with the crew. There were at
                        least five commanding officers who were to be above the English commander.
                        Needless to say, the latter gentleman returned to Gibraltar. </p>
                    <p>At length, however, it did seem that English seamen were to man and command
                        El Bashir. Then an official reminder of the Powers’ agreement on that point
                        was issued, and the English promptly withdrew. Immediately then the
                        captain’s and engineers’ berths were offered to Germans, and by them
                        accepted. When I went aboard her, these gentlemen received me most
                        hospitably. I felt that when news of their disgusted resignations reached me
                        I should understand, and sympathise. Till then I thought I could, at all
                        events, appreciate the peculiar nature of their positions. </p>
                    <p>There was not half a pound of paint aboard El Bashir. There was not the
                        wherewithal to get up sufficient steam to raise her anchors. She had not
                        enough of stores aboard for an L.C.C. ferry boat. She had nothing, saving
                        her very beautiful and rotting hull, her beautiful rotting fixtures, and her
                        beautiful rotting engines. Conning tower, torpedo tube (but no torpedoes),
                        search-light apparatus, four 100 mm. Vavasour pivot guns (from Newcastle),
                        six small quick-firers, two field guns ; every intricate modern appliance
                        this cruiser had ; all were rotting and rusting away into useless old metal,
                        for lack of a little cotton waste and a little ordinary care. </p>
                    <p>But what of the German captain ? you ask. In reply, let me remind you that
                        there remained always the half-dozen or so of Moorish over-commanders,
                        including his ruling excellency the paymaster, and the Moorish temperament,
                        to be reckoned with. The men ate and spilled their food over the decks, they
                        smoked all day long and all over the ship, discipline was absolutely unknown
                        among them, and they were entirely without sense of hours of duty. They
                        squatted about in the Sultan’s satin-upholstered and gorgeously ornate
                        apartments, “The Sultan has plenty of money,” they said, ‘and, then, no
                        Sultan would ever go aboard a ship !” </p>
                    <p>I was glad that she was sold before the final stage of dissolution should be
                        reached. And now the Power that once terrorised the seas retains only its
                        two old merchant steamers, Al Hassanee and Sid et Turki, for the conveyance
                        of grain and stores and the pickled heads of rebels (when such are to be
                        had) from port to port This latter considerable portion of their business
                        led, one is pleased to say, to the resignation of the only Englishmen
                        employed on these ships, which are now run by other Europeans. </p>
                    <p>There is a lesson for European statesmen in the history of the latter-day
                        Moorish navy, and some of them are learning it, laboriously, just now at the
                        beauteous city of the Karueen, at Moulai Idrees’ well-watered capital of
                        Fez. </p>

                    <head>JAPANESE TACTICS.</head>
                    <p>Col. Kawimura, of the Japanese Army, has contributed to a German magazine an
                        article upon Japanese tactics, in which there are some points of interest.
                        He says that the Japanese think that they have surpassed their European
                        models in the methods of attack as much as in the defence. In the firing
                        line one man fires while his neighbour digs, and their work is interchanged.
                        This is done in a manner different from European methods, since the Japanese
                        have learned to throw up small defences with the spade while they themselves
                        are lying down, so that the firing line is practically hidden in the ground.
                        The advanced troops thus being protected, it is possible to bring forward
                        strong reserves. Indeed, the practice is to bring practically the whole
                        force into contact with the enemy, and Col. Kawimura says that only a strong
                        reserve is kept echeloned behind the flanks. The Japanese officer also says
                        that movements of troops take place generally in the night, and that the
                        methods of night marching and fighting have constantly been practised in
                        time of peace, all being done in complete silence, and the orders being
                        given by means of a small pocket lantern. But the real gist of the Colonel’s
                        remarks is that the technical ability of the Japanese is used to support the
                        attack and not to lead them into the defence. For this reason they conduct
                        their artillery fire upon the German and not the French system—the batteries
                        united in a mass, the range ascertained, and then a violent fire, but no
                        dispersion against a supposed enemy established in a position which cannot
                        be seen, and which is not known. Much is due to the Germans, but the
                        Japanese are not servile imitators. </p>
                    <p>Major Loeffler, of the Saxon staff, recently contributed to one of the German
                        service magazines an article emboding his conclusions as to Japanese
                        tactics, and he also insisted very strongly upon the great value of fire
                        power. He attributes much importance to the artillery, but remarks that it
                        has never led to decisive results. The brave infantry, always advancing,
                        half-buried in the ground, even under the most violent and continuous fire,
                        has completed the victory. The changes in arms have not led to any essential
                        change on the battlefield, and to-day, as a hundred years ago, the form of
                        the combat is based upon superiority of fire. Major Loeffler points out that
                        the Russians, owing to the terrible nature of the Japanese fire, have lost
                        heavily, even on the defence, because the counter-attack is prescribed in
                        their regulations. He admits that counter-attack is necessary, but remarks
                        that it should not extend to every sector of the line of defence. The
                        Japanese always endeavour to obtain victory by enveloping movements, making
                        first a violent frontal attack in order to hold the adversary, and to lead
                        him to employ all his forces.</p>

                    <head>PANAMA CANAL TROUBLE.</head>
                    <p>It is common knowledge in New York and Washington that President Roosevelt’s
                        great domestic worry is the matter of the Panama Canal. Until the President
                        appointed Mr. Theodore P. Shonts as chairman of the Isthmian Canal
                        Commission, with full power to put an end to the terrible muddle and tangle
                        into which the Works and Administration alike have been allowed to drift, it
                        looked as though the Panama Canal would never become an accomplished fact. </p>
                    <p>Now, however, we find wholesale discontent among the canal employés, and
                        hospitals filled to overflowing with yellow-fever patients. The President
                        was very deeply impressed by the opinions of Dr. Amon Jenkins, who, in South
                        America, the West Indies, and elsewhere, has made yellow-fever the study of
                        his life. “The opening or closing key to Panama,” remarked Dr. Jenkins to
                        the writer, “is yellow-fever ; make no mistake about that. And if that key
                        be turned rightly the canal will be finished economically and soon ; but if
                        the fever is allowed to be rampant, we shall have another 'French Folly’ on
                        our hands, and may become a laughing-stock among the nations.” </p>
                    <p>The chief engineer of the Panama Canal, Mr. Wallace, is returning home ; and
                        in spite of the alluring prospects, held out to clerks, store keepers, and
                        other white employés, American workers in the Canal Zone are returning on
                        every steamer with lurid stories of never-ending miles of reeking
                        mangrove-swamps, full of the deadliest mosquitoes and every sort of venomous
                        insect and reptile. </p>
                    <p>In spite of the investigations conducted in Cuba and elsewhere by American
                        experts like Dr. Finlay and Surgeon-Major Reed, yellow-fever remains one of
                        the most deadly and mysterious of diseases. Some months ago, when the
                        rosiest inducements were held out to the American youth, and Chief Engineer
                        Wallace was in Washington, white employés were arriving at Colon and Panama
                        fifty at a time. Now the arrivals have diminished to the smallest groups ;
                        and at the Government building on the Isthmus there is positive
                        consternation. </p>
                    <p>Although the Americans who arrive are among the hardiest pioneers of Alaska
                        and the North-West, they are appalled by the conditions confronting them ;
                        and one authority on the Canal Zone is certain that there are not fifty
                        Americans in all the vast works who do not fix a mental limit, and a short
                        one at that, to their stay, irrespective of high salaries. Until the dense
                        Isthmian jungles and forests are swept away, malaria must continue to do its
                        terrible work. Even Panama and Colon remain incredibly filthy towns, in
                        spite of all the American doctors can do, and so deadly is the fever of the
                        Canal Zone that even Jamaica negroes are killed off like flies. </p>
                    <p>Many responsible men are shaking their heads and pointing out that if the
                        French company spent 300,000,000dols. and failed, may not Americans do the
                        same, or worse ? Undoubtedly De Lesseps treated his white employés far
                        better than Americans are being treated in the Canal Zone to-day, when,
                        strange as it may seem, not the slightest amusement or entertainment is
                        provided, and the men complain of a total lack of interest in their welfare
                        in this hideous and debilitating region. </p>
                    <p>There are no reading rooms nor any places of recreation, such as would be
                        provided for ordinary soldiers ; and in spite of high wages the white
                        employés are returning to the United States in hundreds. Asked the principal
                        reason why, the men pointed to the impossibility of living in the Canal Zone
                        for even one month, with a broiling sun alternating with drenching rains,
                        causing the mangrove swamps to steam and reek. Is it any wonder the American
                        hospitals are overflowing with fever patients ? The Canal Commission have
                        built a number of weird-looking hotels like Chinese pagodas, but here the
                        principal item on the menu is the toughest of bull beef, killed and cooked
                        the same day. </p>
                    <p>In the principal administrative division--that of the great Culebra Cut,
                        forming the high backbone of the Isthmus—there is positive chaos of every
                        kind. As the old French trolley-car system is dismantled, the white employés
                        have every morning and evening to walk half a mile in slippery mud, six
                        inches deep, exposed to the scorching and pitiless sun or drenching rain ;
                        and to hear the curses of the engineers, inspectors, supervisors,
                        yard-masters, foremen, trackmen, steam-shovel-men, and others. Leading the
                        “strenuous life” in this way is indeed a lurid experience. </p>
                    <p>Newcomers are amazed to find everything a Babel of confusion, with
                        subordinates questioning the authority of their superiors, and no man
                        knowing what his duties are. Meanwhile, at home, until within the last few
                        weeks, one heard on every side glowing appreciations of the Canal—when it
                        shall be finished ! It is to shorten the water distance between New York and
                        San Francisco by 8,000 miles, and practically the same distance to Yohohama,
                        Shanghai, and the Philippines. </p>
                    <p>“By the time the Canal is opened,” says another optimist, “the United States
                        will have a hundred million inhabitants.” Meanwhile the most disquieting
                        rumours are being received from the Canal Zone, and more eloquent than these
                        are the crowds of returning employés who would not remain another day on the
                        Isthmus, even at a salary ten times greater than they receive in the United
                        States. </p>

                    <head>A MOORLAND SHEEPWASHING.</head>
                    <byline>BY AN OBSERVER.</byline>
                    <p>There is nothing prosaic about the life of a moorland shepherd. Those who
                        imagine there is know precious little about the care and anxiety attendant
                        upon the duty of keeping an eye upon large flocks, whose peculiarity is to
                        wander into forbidden pastures in search of vegetable tasty bits. Lonely the
                        shepherd may be in the sense that at certain periods he enjoys little human
                        intercourse ; his company is of another kind. Besides his woolly charges, he
                        has his trusty, helpful dogs, sharing with him bed and board, and equally
                        obedient to his behests whether audibly expressed or implied by motion of
                        the hand. With him, too, are birds in variety. The grouse is a permanent
                        resident on these elevated territories, and at this season they are joined
                        by the plover and other birds who seek the moors for breeding purposes.
                        Apart from his pastoral duties, the shepherd, if so disposed, need,
                        therefore, never lack theme for study and observation. </p>
                    <p>The washing of the sheep, like the lambing, comes as a dramatic interlude in
                        spring. It is an anxious time, for the operation is not without risk. The
                        gathering of the sheep together is an arduous task of itself, because of
                        their nomadic disposition. In these exposed altitudes the sheep can scarcely
                        be said to live on the fat of the land. Heather, whin, cranberry, and blue
                        berry bushes you will find, and only now and again do yon come across
                        patches of herbage. The locality I have in mind chiefly develops clumps of
                        long, wiry grass that is too coarse even for ovine mastication. Early in the
                        year this tough and apparently lifeless vegetation is frequently set fire
                        to, often out of pure mischief, with the result that the hilltops are ablaze
                        for days, recalling the spectacular effects of the prairie fires of the Wild
                        West. Although far removed from human habitations, these moor fires do much
                        damage, and if they occur in the spring, as they did this year, the birds,
                        hares, stoats, and other “varmin" get a shock from which they do not soon
                        recover, while many pay the penalty of being roasted alive. The only benefit
                        is that the “fog,” as it is called in some parts of the north, gets a fresh
                        start, and the sheep pasturing in the neighbourhood are able to nibble the
                        stuff when it begins to shoot again from the peaty soil </p>
                    <p>The thin small voice of the bleating lamb is borne across the hill on the
                        wings of the western breeze ; Simeon, the shepherd, hardened and tanned by
                        the exposure his calling involves, is rounding up his flock. From one moor
                        to the next, along well-beaten sheep-tracks, the flock is driven, the ewes
                        crying for the lambs and the lambs for the ewes. One sheep, excited by the
                        bustle of the occasion, leaps an imaginary obstacle and others immediately
                        follow suit, as sheep are wont to do, reflecting the influence of example,
                        and, in this case, its folly. </p>
                    <p>The day has been anticipated in more ways than one. A week ago a stream that
                        comes leaping and splashing over glacial boulders in the valley was dammed
                        up at a point conveniently near the sheepfold, where the fleecy flock are
                        ere long securely penned, This horse-shoe-shaped valley, one of the many
                        that link up the rugged Pen nines, has a peculiar repeating echo. Shout or
                        whistle when quiet prevails, and the sound is flung from side to side a
                        dozen times, the last echo being quite distinct as, finally, it seems to
                        leap over the sky-line and lose itself on the plateau beyond. The mingled
                        bleatings of the sheep, the barking of the dogs, and the shouts of the
                        shepherd and his assistants all come back in confused echo suggesting
                        pandemonium. </p>
                    <p>Into the peaty water strides one of the men, and a companion hauls from the
                        pen an unwilling sheep. A third man brings the struggling creature down the
                        bank and launches her willy-nilly into the bath. There the terrified sheep
                        is taken in hand by the washer, who cleverly turns her this way and that,
                        endeavouring by vigorous laving and rubbing to rid the fleece of the
                        imparities of a twelve-month. Then, turning her head shorewards, he sets her
                        free, and the ewe climbs the bank dripping and exhausted and so unlike
                        herself that her crying lambs scarcely recognise her. </p>
                    <p>Thus one by one the adult members of the flock are dealt with until all are
                        sweet and clean as hand labour and fresh water can make them. The operation,
                        which is the preliminary, of course, to shearing, is neces-sarily somewhat
                        prolonged and trying to the men who engage in it, and they are not sorry
                        when the last sheep has been tubbed. Then the straggling community, still
                        loud in lamentation, are once more gathered together and gently driven back
                        to pasture, there to browse and dry their sodden woolly coats in the genial
                        sunshine. </p>

                    <head>THE “POTEMKIN."</head>
                    <p>The “Daily Mail” Odessa correspondent gives the following account of how the
                        mutinous battleship met the fleet sent to subdue or sink her:—“Shortly after
                        dawn five battleships hove in sight off Langeron Point. The ‘Potemkin’
                        proceeded at once to meet the battleships, signalling to them as she steamed
                        ahead. To the surprise of everyone, the squadron turned tail, and got out of
                        sight of the watchers on Odessa’s towers. At 12.35 they returned in line
                        abreast, followed by three torpedo-boats and three destroyers. The
                        ‘Potemkin’ issued forth to meet them. Signal flags broke out from her
                        halyards in a long succession of messages. We could make out the flags, but
                        the code used was not the international, and we could not penetrate its
                        secrets. Meeting apparently with no favorable response, the 'Kniaz Potemkin’
                        declared for action as the battle fleet, extended in a mile-long line, with
                        the torpedo craft astern, slowly swept past her. Every gun that could be
                        pointed to the ships was trained upon them. The gun crews were at their
                        posts, and not a man of the mutineers was visible save one, who calmly went
                        on flooding the deck with a hose in anticipation of gunfire from the foe. </p>
                    <p>“Again the ‘Potemkin’ and the squadron exchanged signals which no one on
                        shore could read. Slowly the fleet passed up the bay, and then the
                        ‘Potemkin’ put out to sea. Suddenly the punitive squadron put about and came
                        round facing her. The commander of the ‘Potemkin’ kept all available guns
                        trained on the opposing fleet, and when he lay midway between the ships and
                        the shore he had a broadside pointed to the town and the other to the ships,
                        as if threatening the Admiral that if attacked from seaward he would shell
                        Odessa. After more signalling the ‘Potemkin’ returned to her anchorage and
                        the fleet sailed away. The ships steamed six miles away, and the ‘Potemkin’
                        started slowly steaming after them.” </p>
