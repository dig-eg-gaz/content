                    <head>THE SUPPRESSION OF LOTTERIES.</head>
                    <p>At last the Government have put a stop to the sale of lottery tickets in our
                        public streets, and in future this nuisance will cease. This is a matter for
                        congratulation from every point of view, though we fear it will press
                        somewhat hardly, for a time, upon those who have gained a scanty living by
                        the sale of the tickets. Our only regret is that all lotteries without
                        exception cannot be dealt with in the same summary fashion. Perhaps before
                        long all lotteries will share the same fate, for the present exceptions are
                        illogical. However, the Government is to be congratulated on having done
                        something, though apart from the injurious effects of gambling upon the
                        moral nature of the individual-a matter which hardly admits of argument-we
                        see no reason why any one class of lottery should be exempted from the
                        general rule. The object for which the tickets are sold has nothing at all
                        to do with the principle involved, and it looks to us as if the practice so
                        prevalent everywhere, of raffling for articles at bazaars held for religious
                        and other objects, and which is <cb n="6"/> openly countenanced by the
                        clergy of all denominations, may have had something to do with this
                        exemption of lotteries for charitable objects from the law that has just
                        come into force. We hear from a correspondent in Cairo that some working
                        girls, earning only P.T. 3 to 5 per day have been known to spend as much as
                        P.T. 2 of the money so urgently wanted at home in the purchase of lottery
                        tickets. Perhaps the new law will render this impossible for the future, but
                        it is greatly to be regretted that lotteries of all kinds have not been
                        suppressed, now that the matter has once been taken in hand.</p>
                    <p>There is a case in which British influence, if it is to be exerted at all for
                        the moral improvement of the Egyptian people, should have been able to make
                        itself felt to the fullest extent possible. It is notorious that in England.
                        it is found impossible to check the distribution of the millions of
                        prospectuses of foreign lotteries that are circulated throughout the
                        country, and there need be no fear that gambling propensities will not find
                        far too many opportunities for their indulgence, let the law be ever so
                        strict and the endeavour to make people moral ever so earnest. But we claim
                        that as far as law can be made effectual in closing the door to facilities
                        for gambling of all kinds and reducing these to a minimum, so far it should
                        be unsparingly applied, and we consider that in the present instance a great
                        opportunity has been missed for a determined stand to be made against the
                        practice of doing things by halves, and stopping short at a halfway house in
                        carrying through a much-needed reform. Surely on such a question as this our
                        British advisers could have led the Egyptian Government to see the
                        advisability of dealing with it in a firm and effective way, and by a
                        drastic measure have dealt a forcible blow to a practice so objectionable
                        from both the individual and the collective standpoints, as gambling by
                        means of lotteries.</p>

                <div type="item">
                    <p>THE MIXED COURTS AND THE S.P.C.A.</p>
                    <p>One of the minor charms of the Capitulations is that while the native can be
                        punished with all the rigour of the law for cruelty to animals, the European
                        almost invariably gets off scotfree, however brutal he may have been. The
                        judgments given by the Mixed Courts at Cairo prove this, and the most
                        cursory review of such cases shows that the upshot was a general judgment of
                        acquittal. The grounds on which the Court based its leniency were that the
                        police had not proved that the wounds were recent, and that in some
                        instances the injuries may have been mere scratches or simply due to chafing
                        from the harness. In each case the certificate of the veterinary surgeon
                        stated that the animals were found to have wounds, and that the alleged
                        sores were not due to mere chafing, but required from fifteen to twenty
                        days' treatment. It is obvious that these judgments were nothing more nor
                        less than cases of miscarriage of justice and misplaced leniency. The result
                        of such a state of things is deplorable, for the police are naturally
                        discouraged in their efforts to bring these inhuman offenders to justice,
                        who, merely because they are Europeans, are enabled to escape. The police
                        and the S.P.C.A. are doing excellent work at Cairo, and their efforts ought
                        to receive the hearty support of the tribunals. Not only are the judges
                        lenient, but the law is at fault. For example, no power exists whereby
                        animals belonging to Europeans can be. sent to hospitals, while in the case
                        of natives there is such a power. Surely both should be placed on the same
                        footing. But it is useless to clamour for any extension of the law in this
                        respect, if the Mixed Courts persist in regarding cruelty to animals as an
                        absolutely venial sin on the part of Europeans resident in Egypt. The
                        judgments which we have stigmatised above are in our opinion entirely
                        unwarrantable, and afford deplorable examples of purposely perverted
                        leniency,</p>

                        don't come back then w expel you," to which the pupils retort, "We promised
                        to strike and have got a week's holi day in consequence. If you don't ask us
                        to come back very politely we shall not come back at all.</p>
                    <p>We are glad to hear this morning that the recalcitrant pupils of the college
                        have decided to return on Saturday, while continuing their protest against
                        the tone of the letter forwarded to their parents by the head master. Great
                        satisfaction will be felt at the close of an un- fortunate series of
                        incidents.</p>

                        <p>The French cruiser "Encernet,"which arrived at Suez last Monday from
                            Djibouti, will remain at this port for three weeks in order to be
                            overhauled, and to change her crew. The "Encernet" will subsequently
                            return to Dji- bouti. </p>
                        <p>The British cruiser "Diadem" anchored yesterday evening in the Suez roads
                            at 8 o'clock. She will sail in a few days, after finishing coaling,
                            bound to China, and on her way she will call at Aden and Trincomalee.
                            This morning 1,420 Egyptians pilgrims arrived at Suez from Tor by the
                            Khedivial Mail Line steamers: 700 by the S S. "Rah- manieh," 520 by the
                            S.S. "Missir," and 200 by the S.S. "Callioubieh." All of them will leave
                            Suez to-morrow by special trains for their res- pective villages. </p>

                    <head>A GRAND NATIVE WEDDING.</head>
                    <p>Yesterday afternoon and evening, receptions were held at Idris Bey Ragheb's
                        fine house near Abdeen Palace, on the occasion of the marriage of his
                        daughter, Fitnat Hanem, to Mohamed Bey Suleiman, son of Mahmoud Pasha
                        Suleiman. The road leading to the house, the court, garden, and reception
                        hall were beautifully and tastefully decorated with flowers, lanterns, and
                        fairy lamps. Whoever was responsible for the floral decoration, deserves the
                        utmost credit for his taste. The first reception was held at 5 p.m., the
                        second at 9 p.m. An enormous member of guests were present, at one time
                        reaching the imposing total of 15,000. The buffet, which was largely
                        patronised, was under the care of Mr. Wild, the popular manager of the Savoy
                        Hotel, and we need not say that it did him credit. Music was supplied by the
                        Egyptian Army Infantry Band.</p>
                    <p>Among those present were Mustapha Pasha Fehmy, Boutros Pasha Ghali, Fouad
                        Pasha, Fakhry Pasha, Dr. RuckerJenish, Aziz Pasha Izzet, Thurneyssen Pasha,

                        Fehmy, Hassan Pasha Assem, Ibrahim Pasha Mahmoud, Prince Radziwill,
                        Fabricius Pasha, M. Rolo, M. Sciortino, M. Anders and many other well-known
                        members of native and European society, whose names we have not space to
                        quote.</p>
                    <p>A reception will be given to ladies this evening at Idris Pasha Ragheb's
                        house, and to-morrow there will be a reception at the house of the fortunate
                        bridegroom. Our most hearty congratulations are duo to the young married

                    <p>The recent negotiations between the Egyp- tian Government and the Eastern
                        Telegraph Company have led to a decision to reduce, in principle, the cable
                        rates to England from 1s. 5d. to 1s. per word. This decision is not
                        officially announced, and the date of the coming into force of the new rate
                        is not yet known. The last reduction was on July 1, 1904, when tho rate was

                    <head>PRIVATE THEATRICALS AT BULKELEY.</head>
                    <p>Yesterday evening, Mrs. Lang Anderson gave a most charming entertainment in
                        Alderson's Garden to her numerous friends, who numbered between three or
                        four hundred. The pro- gramme consisted of two farces, with an inter- lude
                        in the shape of a violin solo, Mariani's "Abandono" exquisitely rendered by
                        Miss Euna Anderson, whose skill kept the whole audience in an enraptured
                        silence, which at the close gave plane to tumultuous applause. The guests
                        were invited for 9 o'clock, and shortly after that hoar the theatre
                        presented a most brilliant aspect, the ladies most richly gowned, their
                        dresses blending with the large number of military uniforms. It is quite
                        impos- sible to mention who were present. Suffice it to say that the
                        gathering was representative of British society in Ramleh and Alexandria.
                        The host and hostess, assisted by the Misses Anderson were indefatigable in
                        attending to their guests, all of whom were unanimous in pronouncing the
                        entertainment an immense success. The first play given was "Petticoat
                        Perfidy," in which Mrs. Borton and Mrs. Gedge undertook the parts of the
                        rival ladies, Mrs. Montresor and Mrs. Norwood Jones. They were simply
                        perfect in their acting. As for Miss Lang Anderson, in the role of Juliette,
                        the French soubrette, she fairly brought down the house by her espiegle
                        rendering of the part. Her impersonation of the false Russian Princess was
                        excellent and was acknowledged to be fully up to professional achievement.
                        The second face, "A Regular Fix," was quite as amusing as "Petticoat
                        Perfidy" and kept the aydience in roars of laughter. The principal part fell
                        to Mr. J. R. Bassett, who filled the rele of Mr. Hugh de Bras te perfection.
                        The part was somewhat trying, and called for a good deal of histrionic
                        ability. But Mr. Basset never faltered from start to finish, and his
                        vivacity and the aplomb with which he met his difficulties kept the audience
                        spellbound with amusement Mr. E.T. Pool was also excellent as the old
                        solicitor, and his "make up" was per- fect. In fact the "make up's" were all
                        ex- tremely good, and Miss V. Aldereon, as the old housekeeper, Mr. Douglas
                        Allen, as the bailiff, and Miss E. Allen as Matilda Jane, looked (as well as
                        acted) their parts to perfec- tion. Mrs. Gedge and Miss Lang Anderson kept
                        up the high standard of acting they had displayed in the previous farce, and
                        the scene in which the former went into hysterics was a very capable
                        piecoeof acting. Mr. P. J. Byrne and Mr. G. M. Sharpe were equally good in
                        their roles, and from the begining to the end not one of the actors or
                        actresses showed the slightest sign of faltering, and there was never any
                        need of a prompter. Both the pieces could not in fact have been better
                        acted, and immense pains had evidently been taken to ensure per- fection.
                        After the dramatic part of the enter- tainment, an adjournment was made to
                        the buffet, and the pleasant evening was brought to a close with a
                        dance.</p>

                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette. Sir,—I was glad to seoethis matter
                            brought forward so ably in your leading article, and so forcibly
                            seconded by the writer of "Under the Mosquito Net." Perhaps I may be
                            allowed to trespass on your kindness to tell of the results of two
                            years' work for the inauguration of such an establishment in this city.
                            The idea was forced upon me by overhearing a young man remark that there
                            are but two amusement to be had here,—getting drunk and the frequenta-
                            tion of the places at which, on the authority of Solomon, the dead are
                            unseen guests. Here was the truth bluntly stated, and I was obliged to
                            think the matter over.</p>
                        <p>As I generally act after having lain a-think- ing, it was not long before
                            I was in communi- cation with England regarding funds for a Young Men's
                            Association. For a time I thought the ship I had launoched was going on
                            very well, but suddenly she struck on a rock and foundered. That rock
                            was the question of nationalities. I maintained that the association
                            should admit all Europeans, the people who had the money said it should
                            only admit Englishmen, I refused to have anything to do with it on their
                            lines, they refused the funds on mine, and things came to a stand still,
                            where they are likely to remain until the end of the ages.</p>
                        <p>Yet I did not despair. There is in Cairo, not a hundred miles from the
                            old Alhambra, a very fine hall, and I decided to try to persuade the
                            person who presides over its destinies to do something to stem the tide
                            of vice and intemperance, and draw young men from the saloons by
                            providing healthy amusement for them elsewhere. The answer I got was as
                            follows : "If these men are not going to be converted, and to attend our
                            meetings and Bible classes, they are as well in the saloons as here."
                            There was nothing further to be said; it was a case of "Ayt sint quod
                            sunt, aut non sint,"</p>
                        <p>Thus a splendid concert hall, which might, under proper management, be
                            the means of keeping many young man away from the bqttle and worse, is
                            allowed to waste its sweetness on the desert sir, because, in the
                            opinion of its diredtress, a concert, like all other amusements, is of
                            the Devil.—I am, etc.,</p>

                    <p>Messieurs,</p>
                    <p>Malgré mon désir de vous retenir ici le moins longtemps possible, je veux
                        ajouter quelques mots au rapport de votre Comité et vous entretenir encore
                        un peu de certaines questions qui touchent aux intérêts généraux du Commerce
                        de l'Egypte.</p>
                    <p>Depuis quelques années, le pays vit dans une ère de prospérité croissante qui
                        a peu d'exemples dans l'histoire économique des peu- ples, et cette
                        prospérité, si grande déjà, n'a fait que s'accentuér pendant l'année qui
                        vient de s'écouler. C'est là un état de choses écla tant aux regards de
                        tous, une constatation que chacun est heureux de faire et je ne crois pas
                        utile d'émailler de chiffres cette courte allocu tion pour faire ressortir
                        davantage et mieux toucher du doigt une situation incontestable et
                        incontestée.</p>
                    <p>Mais au milieu du riant tableau de l'avance ment de l'agriculture, du
                        développement fruc tueux du Commerce et de l'Industrie, de l'essor général
                        des affaires, il y aurait bientôt quelques ombres, si l'on n'y prenait
                        garde.</p>
                    <p>La situation si satisfaisante de l'Egypte im- pose à tous, Gouvernement et
                        particuliers, des devoirs nouveaux et impérieux. Eu ce qui con- cerne
                        l'Etat, je laisserai de côté tout ce qui ne le touche pas d'une façon
                        directe et absolue; mais j'estime que, plus la prospérité d'un pays est
                        grande, plus aussi doivent être grandes la clairvoyance et la prévoyance des
                        hommes qui le gouvernent. Dans un pays comme celui-ci en particulier, l'Etat
                        acquiert une responsa- bilité énorme en raison de la façon dont le pouvoir
                        s'exerce. C'est au moment où le pays est dans un heureux moment que les
                        regards doivent se tourner vers l'avenir avec plus d'acuité, c'est alors que
                        la prévision des be- soins futura est la plus indispensable et doit être la
                        plus consommée, car la roue de la Fortune est parfois arrêtée par un grain
                        de sable et les moindres fautes dans l'Administra tion ou dans l'Economie
                        politique peuvent être le point de départ d'un arrêt dans l'essor de la
                        fortune publique, voire le signal de sa dé croissance.</p>
                    <p>Là où existent des Institutions parlemen- taires, on peut dire que le
                        Gouvernement est dirigé par les intéressés eux mêmes qui sont ainsi, en
                        quelque sorte, les agents de leur for- tune; içi l'initiative de l'Etat,
                        partant sa res- ponsabilité, est entière; mais les commerçants n'en seraient
                        pas moins coupables s'ils n'u- saient de tous les moyens pour éclairer le
                        Gouvernement et lui faire parvenir des avis. autorisés. Pour cela il n'est
                        qu'un moyen vrai ment pratique, ce sont les Unions profession- nelles
                        groupées autour de la Chambre de Com- merce et formant avec elle un tout
                        indis- Boluble.</p>
                    <p>Comme vous le dit le rapport de votre Comité, ces Unions ou Associations
                        commen- cent à surgir; on commence à comprendre dans tous les milieux
                        commerciaux l'intérêt qu'ont les personnes s'occupant dh même genre d'af.
                        faires, à s'entendre pour discuter les intérêts généraux et communs de leur
                        corporation. Cet intérêt devient chaque jour plus intense au fur et à mesure
                        que le développement du commerce amène un plus grand nombre de personnes ou
                        de firmes à exercer une même profession. En effet, une foule de problèmes
                        qui res taient ou pouvaient rester dans l'ombre, il y a peu de temps encore,
                        réclament impérieuse ment une solution maintenant; l'essor même des affaires
                        crée de nouvelles difficultés qu'il fauf vaincre et pour cela s'unir, sous
                        peine de Voir les efforts rester stériles. Au précepte de Machiavel:
                        "diviser pour régner," opposez la magnifique devise: Union fait la Force."
                        Je sais bien que nombre de commerçants on d'industriels craignent les
                        ententes, et je les comprend un peu, lorsqu'il s'agit de Trust, de Cartell,
                        de Comptoir ou de Syndicat destinés à réglémenter des productions, des prix
                        d'achat ou de vente, etc., et je trouve bien naturel le sentiment qui porte
                        chacun à vouloir garder son indépendance absolue dans sa manière I de
                        traiter les affaires; mais les associa</p>
                    <p>仁</p>
                    <p>tions dont je vous parle en ce moment ne doivent avoir pour but que la
                        solution des problèmes généraux dans l'intérêt de tous, et ne pas toucher à
                        la liberté indivi duale dans l'exercice de la profession, n'y le a <cb n="2"
                        />donc pas de raisons, pour que ces associations ne se multiplient pas
                        rapidement, tout milite, au contraire, en faveur de leur formation; que,
                        dans chaque branche industrielle ou commer- ciale, un homme d'initiative et
                        de décision se mette à la tête du mouvement et nous verrons bientôt, comme
                        en Europe, chaque profession améliorer ses conditions d'exploitation et en
                        cas de besoin se défendre energiquement et avec succes une foule d'ennuis,
                        d'abus, d'en- traves dont tous se plaignent en les subissant, et que chacun
                        en particulier est impuissant à réprimer, disparaitront devant la pression
                        générale et la volonté universelle de les faire</p>
                    <p>cesser.</p>
                    <p>C</p>
                    <p>J'ajouterai encore sur ce sujet qu'il ne faut en aucun cas, vouloir
                        transformer ces associa- tions en instruments de combat ou en machi- nes de
                        guerre contre qui que ce soit; elles. doivent avoir pour but d'éclairer le
                        gouverne- ment, les administrations, et même tout le public sur les besoins
                        des professions qu'elles représentent ou sur les abus dont elles souf frent;
                        montrer les améliorations &amp; apporter, indiquer les moyens de ramener la
                        prospérité disparue ou ceux à employer pour empêcher les affaires de
                        péricliter. Elles doivent aussi faire acte de cette sage prévoyance dont je
                        vous parlais tout à l'heure et en éclairant de conseils judicieux les hommes
                        d'Etat chargés de la difficile mission de gouverner, être autant que
                        possible les propres instruments de leurs destinées. Le rôle de ces
                        associations doit donc ètre tout pacifique et diplomatique ; cela n'exclut
                        l'énergie ni dans les décisions, ni dans les moyens à employer pour aboutir;
                        mais je le répète, le but doit être d'édifier paisiblement et non de briser
                        avec fracas. Ainsi elles prépa- reront pendant la prospérité les armes qui
                        leur seront nécessaires pour combattre au jour où viendrait l'adversité.</p>
                    <p>La prévoyance de l'avenir est pour les parti- culiers comme pour les
                        Gouvernements upe des qualités des plus éminentes et nous devons toujours
                        avoir à l'esprit ce qu'en dit si juste- ment Charron dans son livre de la
                        Sagesse "La prévoyance est un grand remède contre tous maux, lesquels ne
                        peuvent apporter grande altération ni changement étant arrivés à un homme
                        qui s'y attendait, comme au contraire ils blessent et endommagent fort ceux
                        qui se laissent surprendre."</p>
                    <p>Comme je vous l'ai dit tout à l'heure, vous trouverez toujours dans la
                        Chambre de Com- merce Internationale, l'Alma Mater qui sera prête à vous
                        protéger et à diriger vos efforts elle prendra sous son égide toutes ces
                        Unions, elle leur viendra en aide, elle fera siennes les justes
                        revendications qui lui seront présentées et qui revêtiront alors la forme
                        d'un vo général. On se demanders peut-être pourquoi il est nécessaire que
                        les Associations profes- sionelles se groupent autour de la Chambre et pour
                        quelles raisons il faut que ce soit elle qui doive être chargée en dernier
                        ressort de présenter aux diverses administrations compé- tentes les
                        désidérata exprimés par ces Unions. Il y a à cela deux raisons
                        principales:</p>
                    <p>La première c'est que, malgré tout le soin avec lequel les délégués des
                        Associations étu- dieront les questions, leurs conclusions seront toujours
                        empreintes de l'esprit particulariste que revêtent les désirs exprimés par
                        les inté- ressés, malgré leur bonne foi et la volonté d'y échapper. De plus
                        il est extrêmement rare que les questions commerciales ou industrielles si
                        particulières qu'elles paraissent ne touchent pas, par certains côtés, à
                        d'autres professions que celle qui est la principale intéressée et qu'il
                        peut être nécessaire aussi de les consulter pour que les intérêts de, tous
                        soient sauve- gardés. Par conséquent il est nécessaire que le Comité de la
                        Chambre, rassemblant tous les avis, toutes les opinions, envisageant et
                        étudiant les questions sous leur aspect d'en- semble plus général et les
                        dépouillant de ce que l'on appelle les questions de clocher, présente alors
                        des réclamations ou des vœux qui sont positivement la résultante de
                        l'intérêt universel. Il est facile de comprendre qu'il faut éviter à tout
                        prix ces tiraillements bizarres d'associations demandant énergiquement des
                        choses contre lesquelles d'autres associations protestent avec non moins de
                        vigueur. En second lieu la Chambre, émanation de tous les commerces, de
                        toutes les industries, de toutes. les nationalités représente la fédération
                        des intérêts du pays tout entier et son autorité sera toujours supérieure à
                        celle des Associa tions qu'on pourrait encore accuser quelque fois de ne
                        représenter qu'une fraction insigni- fiante du Commerce général.</p>
                    <p>J'espère que ce ne sera pas en vain que j'aurai fait appel à vos sentiments
                        de défense et de prévoyance solidaires et que l'an prochain. à pareil
                        époque, la Chambre verra à côté d'Elle, pour le plus grand bien de tous,
                        beaucoup de nouvelles Associations ou Unions profession- nelles, en même
                        temps qu'elle constatera que le nombre de ses membres se sera accru con-
                        sidérablement.</p>
                    <p>J'ai terminé, Messieurs, et je vous prie de me pardonner d'avoir retenu votre
                        attention aussi longtemps; mon excuse est dans l'immense désir que j'ai de
                        voir l'Industrie et le Com- merce du pays continuer leur marche ascendante
                        et fructueuse et si mes paroles peuvent y con- tribuer pour une si petite
                        part que ce soit, je me tiendrai fort heureux.</p>
