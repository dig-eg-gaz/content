                    <head>A WORD OF WARNING.</head>
                    <p>Our columns contained on Saturday last two articles side by side, between
                        which at first sight there is little connection, but which, nevertheless,
                        bear one upon the other in u way that does not appear on the surface. One
                        was headed “Egypt’s Mines: a Boom in London,” the other "Lord and Lady
                        Cromer, an interesting sketch.” It is to one paragraph in each article that
                        we wish to call our readers’ attention. Egyptian gold mining has of late
                        attracted much attention, and it is while it is as yet in its. infancy, — we
                        had almost written its second infancy, but that term is significant of
                        dotage rather than a renewal of activity—that decisions must be formed, and
                        steps taken to ensure that in the future there shall be no trouble in
                        consequence of the overlooking of due precautions in the initial stages of
                        development of the gold i mines. In the article to which we refer, and which
                        appeared in the “Financier,” we find the following :— </p>
                    <p>“There is ono point which should not be overlooked just as Egyptians are
                        entering upon a phase of activity that will last just as long as the market
                        is maintained in a healthy condition, and that is the question of labour.
                        This not a burning question, nor happily can it ever be made a party ques-
                        tion, as in the case of the Rand. But in these vast areas of the Upper Nile
                        the population is exceedingly sparse, and consequently labourers are few. In
                        the near future labour will have to be imported, hut this can he done easily
                        from India, the coolies there finding congenial surroundings in the valley
                        of the Nile. The point does not arise imme- diately because the mines are
                        only in the development stage, but it will later, and it is as well to
                        realise the fact now instead of ever allowing it to become a market factor,
                        and ultimately a paralysing mining one.” We will put this into other words,
                        and see how well it fits in with the extract from the other article, which
                        runs as follows "Our prosperity is as true as the sunshine, without clouds
                        of rain ; many millions are waiting to be used. This is the testing point in
                        the history of Egypt It wants the iron hand in the velvet glove to keep down
                        the incoming stream of h peculate re, some honest bringing progress and
                        advancement, some driven by that hell-fire, the gamblers’ in- stinct, and
                        the last dishonest, ready to sacrifice anybody and anything to get hold of
                        the alluring millions.” </p>
                    <p>The meaning of this is dear and precise. Let ns proceed to read into it the
                        true significance of the other, bearing in mind what had been said before in
                        the same article:—Never mind the cold douche which Lord Cromer once
                        administered and which bid fair to give Egyptian mining it quietus ; in
                        Egypt and the Sudan lies enormous wealth in the way of ancient gold mines
                        and newly- discovered gold areas, to which the wealth of the Rand is as
                        nothing. Get your foothold there. Never mind the Egyptian nation to whom the
                        wealth rightly belongs. Secure the land, and secure the right to import
                        cheap foreign labour, so that foreign capital may have for its working
                        machinery a class of labour that will not have any interest other than those
                        of the people who employ them. We might add a good deal more that may notbe
                        implied by the writer, but would most cer- tainly result, from the
                        importation of Indian coolies into Egypt and the Sudan, it behoves the
                        authorities to use the utmost vigilance in this matter so as to make it
                        impossible for any future British Agent to sanction such a pro- ceeding.
                        Prevention is better than cure, and forewarned is forearmed. One of the most
                        ex- perienced mining engineers of the day to whom we referred the
                        question—we mean Mr. Alford —told ns that the proposal to employ coolie
                        labour was a perfectly practical ore, com- mercially speaking, whatever it
                        might be politically. We think it oar duty to make the most emphatic protest
                        in our power against the proposal being even considered possible to be
                        entertained, either now, five, ten, or twenty years hence, or during the
                        existence of any lease or concession that may be granted. We have not the
                        slightest wish to discou- rage the development of the mining industry in
                        Egypt, on the contrary we foresee a great future for it. If, as seems
                        possible, land development may undergo somewhat of a check through the
                        Assouan dam decision, it may well be that capitalists will turn their at-
                        tention to the mineral wealth of the country, and there is something very
                        fascinating in the thought of the old workings being re- opened, and the
                        almost fabulous wealth of ancient times again obtained. But our desire is to
                        see this wealth distributed. over as large an area as possible and to
                        prevent its going into the hands of the men who are... “dishonest, ready to
                        sacri- fice anybody and anything to get hold of the alluring millions.” Lord
                        Cromer possesses the iron hand in the velvet glove, and, ail the “Finaucier”
                        writer admits, has used it in the past with effect. His work in Egypt is not
                        as yet within measurable distance of being ac- complished, and the
                        phenomenal prosperity of the present times only places fresh burdens on his
                        shoulders, in place of those of which the smooth currents of late years have
                        in some measure relieved him. We would call upon all to give him most hearty
                        and generous support, and if in the true interests of Egypt Lord Cromer has
                        to make a firm stand against importunate capitalists, eager for their own
                        interests only, and careless of the well-being of the people, as so many of
                        these prove them- selves, we trust that it will never be a reproach to the
                        British community resident in Egypt, that at any critical moment that may
                        come, they failed to give his lordship the strong backing he has every right
                        to expect from them. </p>

                    <p>THE EXPANSION OF CAIRO- The petition that has been sent in to the Government
                        by the residents and proprietors of Boulac-avenue will, it is to be hoped,
                        meet with the attention it deserves, for it is not only a fair statement of
                        the interests of the petitioners but also of those of the entire community.
                        As we pointed out some, little time ago when dealing with the ques- tion of
                        house accommodation in Cairo, one of the really pressing questions of the
                        day is the facilitating of the expansion that the city is now undergoing.
                        More and more every day the residents within what were formerly the limits
                        of the town are being pushed outwards from the centre to make way for the
                        steadily growing need of ampler accommodation for the purely commercial and
                        business demands on the available house and building space. The results of
                        the difficulties arising from the pre- sent condition of affairs are highly
                        injurious to all the best interests of the town and of the community, and
                        the one real, and indeed only, effective remedy that can be applied is the
                        opening up of the vacant spaces lying within a three or four-mile radius
                        from the centre of the city. That this may be done it is essential that the
                        Nile may be so bridged that it may cease to be the formidable barrier it now
                        is to the natural growth of the town. The existing bridge is situated in
                        perhaps the wont possible site that could be chosen for this purpose, and
                        that upon which work has already been commenced at, or rather just beyond,
                        Foum el Khalig, though it will meet a very important demand and will have a
                        very great effect upon the expansion of Ghizeh, will do but little for Cairo
                        itself except indirectly, by in some degree relieving the pressure upon its
                        residential accommodation. The bridge advocated by the petition to which we
                        have referred would, however, do infinitely more, and if accompanied by the
                        provision of a tramway service at this point, would unques- tionably do more
                        to meet existing difficulties than any other measure that can be proposed.

                        organs, and his description of the various reasonant organs of the human
                        frame- in themselves very lucidly described-was rendered still more plain by
                        a large diagram of the head and throat, The importance of the proper

                    <head>TERRIBLE ACCIDENT</head>
                    <p>THREE MEN BURIED ALIVE</p>
                    <p>A terrible accident occurred at Alexandria yesterday afternoon about 5
                        o'clock, by which three men lost their lives. In Stamboul street, just
                        behind Groppi's establishment, building operations are proceeding, and at
                        the time mentioned the foundations of the house being built gave way,
                        burying three native masons in the debris. Towards evening, the dead bodies
                        of two of the men were recovered, while the other remained buried under a
                        mass of earth and stone. From investigations which we have made, it appears
                        that at a depth of four metres these men were engaged in building up the
                        earth i nthe form of an arch. Th carelessness of native workmen is
                        notorious. It seems that in forming the arch they had taken away some earth
                        on the side of the escarpment. This weakened the layer of earth on top and
                        caused the landslip. Under the circumstances the blame for the unfortunate
                        accident must fall on the victims themselves, as no one but they can tell
                        the stability of their position. Had they been simple workmen, the
                        responsibility would lie with the employers, who should have capable
                        overseers.</p>

                    <p>Referring to the announcement which appeared in our columns yesterday, we are
                        informed that the Savoy Hotel, Assouan, will not now be included in the
                        above company, as stated, owing to the fact that the necessary arrangements
                        have not been concluded with the Anglo-American Company. The capital of the

                    <p>STATE OPERA</p>
                    <p>We hear that a petition is circulating among the abonnes of the Khedival
                        Opera House (and obtaining numerous signatures), copies of which will be
                        addressed to the Minister of Public Works and to Lord Cromer, Mr Vincent
                        Corbett and Sir William Gastin. The petitiondeals with the decision of the
                        Socitete Artistique to bring an Italian company over in the season
                        1905-1906, in spite of the decision taken some time ago, and aproved by the
                        Government, to bring French companies over in alternate years. The
                        signatories of the petition complain of this breach of the regulations
                        pointing out that the arrangement previously made enabled good new operas
                        (which by the concession must be produced to the number of four a year) to
                        be brought before the Cairo public. They disclaim all nationalist bias and
                        assert that the plea of the societe Artistique, viz, that a good French
                        company cannot be procured, is utterly untenable. They therefore beg the
                        Minister of Public Works to intervene on behalf of the Government and the
                        public. In our opinion the best way out of the difficulty would be to revoke
                        the concession as soon as possible, and hand over the entire business to a
                        good impressario.. The proverb "Too many cooks" is alarmingly true in Egypt.

                    <p>(from our Correspondent)</p>
                    <p>Suakin, March 16</p>
                    <p>During his recent visit to Suakin, the Sirdar distributed several robes and
                        other valuable gifts, such as medal dresses, watches, revolvers, knives, and
                        shaving articles, to a large number of sheikhs of tribes, clergy, and
                        faithful guides and attenants for their loyal services these few years to
                        the Government. After this ceremony was over he delivered an eloquent
                        address in English which lasted 45 minutes, and which was then interpreted
                        into Arabic by his Arabic secretar, Shaheen Bey, and afterwards again
                        interpreted into Hadendow by the Commandant of Police, Mohamed Bey
                        Ahmed.</p>
                    <p>In the evening his Excellency was entertained at dinner at the Moudirieh.
                        Afterwards a reception was held, when Saghcolaghassi Aly Effendy
                        Ahmed,Deputy-Inspector of Suakin Moudirieh, addressed his excellency the
                        Sirdar in English as follows: "Your Excellency,-I have been chosen by the
                        Egyptian officers, officials and employes of the Government of Suakin to
                        stand respectfully before your Excellency and to express their happiness on
                        your visit to this province and town. All the people of whatever station,
                        the richest and the poorest, the highest and the lowest, have taken this
                        oppurtunity to welcome you by their shouts and respond to the consideration
                        and goodwill you have ever shown to all. All whom you find around you are
                        anxious to assure you of their warm feelings and pleasure. The whole Sudan
                        recognises and is grateful for the wise and good administration of the
                        coutnry. The whole Sudan recognises and is ggrateful for the manner in which
                        the happiness and well-being of all classes are considered. Not only the
                        whole Sudan, but the whole world recognises the spledid way in which the
                        country has thriven during the years which you have been Sirdar and Governor
                        General of the Sudan, and wonders at the magnificent manner in which the
                        resources of the coutnry are being developed. It is true that during this
                        period all departments of the GOvernment have accomplished much, but in this
                        province we watch perhaps more keenly than others, the miles of railway
                        which are joining the Nile and Red Sea, and the plans for the development of
                        the ports of the Sudan. We know that all that has been the result of your
                        master spirit and encouragement. I am not able to express all that is on my
                        mind, but specially we would thank your Excellency for the honor of your
                        visit to us this evening, and in this way showing that you have a warm heart
                        and kind feelings for all those serving the Government of this country. I
                        ask all who are present to drink the health of his Excellency the Sirdar of
                        the Egyptian Army and the Governor-General of the Sudan, El Ferik Sir
                        Francis Reginald Wingate Pasha." The following congratulatory order was
                        published after the Sirdar's departure:-El Miralai Howard Bey, Mr. Kerr, and
                        the military officers and officials of the Egyptian Army and Sudan
                        Government for their admirable arrangements for his recetion, and for their
                        good and hard work to which the very marked improvement in the condition and
                        progress of the town and province since his last inspection in 1901 is due.
                        "He was much struck with the smartness and turn out of the guard of honor
                        furnished by the 3rd Battalion, and the excelence of the organisation and
                        the careful arrangements made for the treatment of the sick in the military
                        and civil hospitals. The interest taken in education as evinced by the
                        satisfactory state of the school and scholars, was most marked. He also
                        wishes you to convey to El Miralai Macauley Bey his great appreciation of
                        the hard and valuable work done by him and his staff on the new Railway, of
                        which the substantial progress already made is the best testimony. In
                        conclusion he would like to express to you, your officers and officials, and
                        to all classes of people of Suakin, his cordial thanks for the loyal and
                        hearty reception on his arrival and hospitatlity extended to him during his
                        stay." (Signed): LO Stack, Kaimakam, Mil. and Private Secretary.</p>

                    <p>Major General Sir Ronald Lane and Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Kelly Kenny,
                        who have respectively held the positions of Military Secretary and Adjucant
                        General to the British Army, are leaving Egypt on Monday next by the Bibby
                        SS Staffordshire from Port Said Sir Ronald Line is staying with Mr. Gould
                        until tomorrow when he returns for a few days to Cairo.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday Sir Ronald paid a visit to Victoria College in company with Mr.
                        Gould and was very much pleased with this institution.</p>
                    <p>The "Journal du Cairo" remarks:- On donne comme probable la nomination de M.
                        Sheldon Amos, juge au Tribunal indigene de re instance du Caire, comme
                        conseiller a la Cour d'appel indigene en remplacement de M. Coghlan.</p>

                    <p>The Italian man of war "Liguria" is expected to arrive at Alexandria shortly
                        with the Duke of the Abruzzi, who is on his way home after a voyage round
                        the world.</p>
                    <p>It is not generally known that the credit for the suggestion of England's
                        purchase of the "St. James Gazette", whose 75th birthday is to be celebrated
                        by a banquet in London. When an oppurtunity offered of buying the Suez Canal
                        shares which now form so important a national asset, it was Mr. Greenwood
                        who suggested the purchase to Disareli. Disareli jumped at it, and the thing
                        was done. The statesman got the kudos, but to the journalist belongs the
                        credit.</p>
                    <p>Egypt has been from the beginning the background for a career of much
                        distinction in the case of Captain Colin Keppel, who has been recently
                        appointed to succeed Sir A Milne in command of His Majesty's yachts. During
                        the attempt to relieve General Gordon, in the subsequent rescue of Sir C.
                        Wilson under Lord Charles Beresford, on the Nile in 1898, when he commanded
                        the flotilla, and at the CB, Captain Keppel won unqualified praise for his
                        ability and courage. As a midshipman be participated in the bombbardment of
                        Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>Mr JIR Dempster, whose sudden death we annonced yesterday, was chief engineer
                        of the New Egyptian Compsnys Nile reclamation works.</p>
                    <p>Mr.ALP Weigall has been appointed inspector to the Antiques Service at an
                        annual salary of LE 400.</p>

                    <p>Assiout, March 24</p>
                    <p>Our new Moudir, Hassan Bey Wassif, arrived </p>
                    <p>here here two days ago and was warmly welcomed </p>
                    <p>by the people. Assoiut expects a great deal</p>
                    <p>of from him. He is distinguished among the</p>
                    <p>mondirs the provinces for his intelligence and</p>
                    <p>experience, which we hope he will use for the</p>

                        <head>THREE DEATH SENTENCES IN 20 DAYS.</head>
                        <p>The Court of Assiout has delivered three</p>
                        <p>Death sentences since the beginning of March.</p>
                        <p>The first was the case of a young man of about</p>
                        <p>22 years of age, who murdered his father in</p>
                        <p>order to inherit on and a half feddans of land</p>
                        <p>which the latter possessed.</p>
                        <p>The second was the case of a certain Awad</p>
                        <p>Said Bekbit of Awlad-cl-Sheik (Ghirgeh) who</p>
                        <p>murdered three persons in one minute. This man</p>
                        <p>intended to murder the emdeh of his village,</p>
                        <p>because the latter had accused him of crimes</p>
                        <p>the perpetrators of which were unknown.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, he went with his rifle to the house</p>
                        <p>of the omdeb, in the month of August 1903,</p>
                        <p>with the intention of shooting him. Arrived</p>
                        <p>there he fired but missed the omeh. The</p>
                        <p>shot, however, took effect on two men who</p>
                        <p>were sitting near by, killing them on the spot.</p>
                        <p>The criminal fired again at the omdeh and</p>
                        <p>a third man was killed by the second shot.</p>
                        <p>The prisoner confessed his crime and was </p>
                        <p>condemned to death.</p>
                        <p>The third case occurred at Mellawi Station.</p>
                        <p>Two months ago a certain Mustapha Abdul</p>
                        <p>Ghani was shot there, and on equiries being</p>
                        <p>Institied the murder confessed, and named</p>
                        <p>a merchant of the place as being his associate.</p>
                        <p>The latter was condemmed to death, as</p>
                        <p>it was proved that he had played the most important</p>
                        <p>part in the commission of the crime.</p>
                        <p>It is unual to have three judegments</p>
                        <p>of dead passed in three weeks in a single</p>
                        <p>court. But crime is increasing every day,</p>
                        <p>and it would occupy a great deal of space</p>
                        <p>daily to tell of the crime in Assiout alone.</p>
                        <p>There must be something wrong in the </p>
                        <p>machinery of the police; and that this is</p>
                        <p>the case will be proved in my next letter.</p>

                    <p>RUSSIA TO-DAY.</p>
                    <p>TO THE EDITOR of the "Egptian Gazette ”</p>
                    <p>Sir,—The letter in your issue of yesterday is an excellent demonstration of
                        the truth of the old saying that certain folks rush in where angels fear to
                        tread.</p>
                    <p>If the writer of the article in question knew anything of the subject, even
                        to the extent of the little knowledge which is a dangerous tiling, he would
                        be aware that the position of the Russian Army to-day and that of the
                        Federals after the Battle of Rappahannock are as different as light is from
                        darkness.</p>
                    <p>The Federals were defeated, it is true, but they were near their bases, and
                        did not depend</p>
                    <p>For the supply of ammunitions and provisons on</p>
                    <p>the limited carrying power of about for thousands</p>
                    <p>miles of single line railway, with a disloyal personnel.</p>
                    <p>The writer has been directly concerned in a responsible way with the
                        commissariat of a force of 20,000 fighting men, at a distance of less than
                        1,000 miles from their base, and be knows how many anxious days and
                        sleepless nights were passed in order to keep the kettles boiling.</p>
                    <p>That Russian can raise another 500,000 men nobody doubts, but that she can
                        ever transport them to the seat of the war, or deed them even if they were
                        once there, is as impossible as to teach a horse to live on sawdust.</p>
                    <p>The reference to the Anglo-Boer War shows as much ignorance of military
                        matters as the remarks on Rappahannock.</p>
                    <p>True it is that the British were far from their base, by the seas was an open
                        highway, and we could send down any number of men we could recruit, and
                        limitless supplies of munitions and provisions.</p>
                    <p>Against us was an army of say 80,000 men, which included every fighting man
                        of the whole populations, and when that force was worn out, there was no
                        hope replacing it.</p>
                    <p>But with Japan it is otherwise. Her population is sufficient to enable her to
                        keep up her present armaments and her financial credit such that she need
                        fear no lack of the sinews of war.</p>
                    <p>The present position of affairs is a striking proof of the verity of the
                        verse of Cowper’s hymn quoted by your correspondent.</p>
                    <p>Truly God moves in a mysterious way. His arm has struck down the ruthless
                        assassins of His people.</p>
                    <p>“Our God hath crushed the tyrant</p>
                    <p>Our God hath raised the slave;</p>
                    <p>Hath mocked the counsel of the wise,</p>
                    <p>The valour of the brave.</p>
                    <p>Then glory to His holy Name”</p>
                    <p>From whom all glories are,</p>
                    <p>And glory to the little Japs</p>
                    <p>Who chased the Russians far.</p>
                    <p>I trust he great historian will forgive me, if ghost can forgive, for the
                        termination I have to put to his lines.</p>
                    <p>At the risk of being considered naughty, I mist quote a verse on which name
                        into my head on reading the conclusion of Mr. Atwood’s letter:</p>
                    <p>“He moves in a mysterious way To drive Oyama forth.</p>
                    <p>He never budges towards the south. But always towards the north.</p>

                    <p>Kidney disease does not usually come on with sharp pain. If it did it would
                        not be so dangerous, because the patient would at once seek treatment and
                        relief.</p>
                    <p>On the contrary, most often it comes on quietly — may have been working in
                        the system for years before the patient suspected the real cause of his
                        trouble.</p>
                    <p>There may have been backaches, limbaches, neuralgia, sciatica, rheumatism, a
                        nervous, irritable feeling, or a generally tired feeling, weak heart,
                        dropsy, etc.</p>
                    <p>He did not know these were symptoms of kidney disease, and so he doctored the
                        symp­toms, and not the kidneys.</p>
                    <p>Thus the trouble kept growing worse, until disturbances of the water
                        appeared, or there was gravel, or retention of the urine, or backaches — or
                        some such plain sign of kidney trouble that there could be no doubt.</p>
                    <p>Doan’s backache kidney pills should be taken at the first sign of anything
                        wrong. There is no other safe way, because kidney complaints are the most
                        dangerous of all discuss, except consumption. Doan's pills are a great aid
                        and stimulant to the kidneys. They strengthen the kidneys, and help them to
                        perform properly that most important of all functions — the filtering of the
                        blood, — help them to flush off, and carry away with the surplus water, all
                        those impurities which the blood gathers up in its circuit of the body. In
                        no other way can you be well.</p>
                    <p>This medicine has been in use by the Quakers for 72 years, and is today made
                        of the same roots and herbs as it was 72 years ago. It cannot be improved by
                        adding to, or taking away a single thing. Its effects are only on the
                        kidneys and bladder — not on the bowels. This is the reason for its great
                        success: It does one thing only, hot it done that one thing well.</p>
                    <p>Doan's backache kidney pills are for sale by all chemists and druggists for
                        P.T. 13 per box, or P.T. 71 for 6 boxes; or they may be had by poet from the

                    <p> SPORT AT SUEZ The E. T. 0. cricket ground at Suez has been
                        prepared for the coming season, and the X I is in very good form, ready to
                        compete with any team from any man-of-war that may wish to challenge
                        them.The first hockey season at Suez has been very successful Five matches
                        hare been played by the E. T. C. team against teams, one from H. M. S.
                        "Hogue,” one from H.M.S. "Barflour," and three from the cable ship
                        "Electra." Of these matches, the E. T. C. won four and lost one. The winning
                        team was from H. U. S. "Hogue." The football season consisted of fifteen
                        matches. One of the most sporting Association teams at Suez consists of the
                        pupils of the Government Schools, who are very keen on the game and show any
                        amount of pluck. They played the E.T.C. eleven nine times, and secured four
                        goals against seventy during the season with indomitable perseverance. A
                        large number of football matches were arranged with the various cable ships
                        calling at Suez, and there were also matching against H.M.S “Hogue” and Port
                        Said. The victory of the E.T.C eleven over Port Said was more decisive, and
                        they scored six goals to nil. Although the Port Said eleven was picked team,
                        selected from the best players of the large English colony there, they were
                        entirely defeated. We regret to say one of the Port Said team is still in
                        hospital. The Suez Golf Club is very flourishing thanks to the energetic and
                        genial secretary, Mr. Hoseason. Owing to the organizing genius of this
                        gentleman the club has been brought up to the highest pitch of prosperity
                        and numbers nearly half a hundred members, including all the “cream’ of the
                        English society of Suez and Port Tewfik. There links are amongst the best in
                        Egypt, and many patrons of the royal and Antient game aver that the Helouan
                        links do not hold a candle of those of Suez. Two golf competitions are held
                        every month, one bogey and one stroke, and substantial prizes are always
                        competed for. The club unfortunately is on the point of losing one of its
                        most enterprising members, Mr. George Owen. This prominent member of the
                        English colony at Suez is a thorough sportsman and is most popular. He is
                        keen member of the Golf Club committee and exerted himself greatly in the
                        construction of the new links Mr. Owen has been appointed to the responsible
                        position of superintended of the Eastern Telegraph Company at Bombay, and a
                        banquet was given in his honor on Saturday. He has been the presiding genius
                        of golf at Suez and is an all-around sportsman. A fine bowling groom has
                        recently been laid out at the Golf Club and, this addition to the many
                        distractions of Suez has been greatly appreciated. A large number of ladies
                        have taken bowling, and this innocent recreation appears to attract many
                        votaries. The Golf Club has also laid out a croquet “lawn” The word "lawn”
                        at Suez is used in symbolical sense, as there is not a blade of grass for
                        many miles around. The “lawn” consists of carefully rolled sand, chosen for
                        its hard surface, and it makes an admirable ground. The Golf Club is greatly
                        appreciated by the English colony at Suez because it forms a convenient
                        place of assembly for local gossip of an innocent and harmless character.
                        The two tennis clubs at Suez have lately received many new members. The two
                        clubs are formed of the Suez and Port Tewfik residents and the members of
                        the Eastern Telegraph Staff. Every week there are three "at homes" on the
                        club’s grounds. A tournament is now being played between the members of the
                        E. T. C, Club. </p>

                    <p>BRITISH TRADE WITH EGYPTA correspondent recently wrote to the President of
                        the Board of Trade, drawing attention to the fact that, according to the
                        latest report to hand, British commerce with Egypt showed a distinctly
                        shrinking tendency. It was farther suggested that the Government would do
                        well to establish some system of trustworthy inquiry in all cases where
                        there was a falling off in trade with other countries. In reply the
                        correspondent has been furnished with the figures for the last ten years,
                        representing the proportion borne by imports from the United Kingdom to the
                        total imports into Egypt as follow:1895, 31.5 per cent. ; 1896, 31.1 per
                        cent . ; 1897, 33.4 per cent ; 1898, 35.1 per cent. ; 1899, 37.9 per cent ;
                        190n, 37.6 per cent ; 1901, 36.5 per cent; 1902, 36.8 per cent t. ; 1903,
                        35.3 percent ; 1904, 34.0 per cent It is farther pointed out that, "although
                        the proportion of imports derived from the United Kingdom has declined
                        slightly during the last few years, it is still greater than in the first
                        few of the years included above."It further appears, from the official
                        reply, “that the fluctuations in the shore figures from year to year arise,
                        to a large extent, from the variations in the price of coal, the imports of
                        which are derived almost entirely from the United Kingdom. If oral be
                        excluded, the figures will appear as follow “1896, 28.1 per cent, 1896. 28.0
                        per cent; 1897, 30 8 per cent ; 1898, 31.4 per cent. ; 1899, 32.9 per cent ;
                        1900, 82.4 per cent; 1901, 82.3 per cent; 1902, 33 0 per cent. ; 1903, 31.8

                    <p>n'hésitent pas à se purger, quand elles en ont besoin. Elles ne craignent ni
                        le dégoût ni la fatigue, parce que, à l'opposé des autres purgatifs,
                        celui-ci n'opère bien que lorsqu'il est pris avec de bons aliments et des
                        boissons fortifiantes, telles que vin, café, thé. Chacun choisit, pour se
                        purger, l'heure et le repas qui lui conviennent le mieux, selon ses
                        occupations. La fatigue de la purgation étant annulée par l'effet de la
                        bonne alimentation, on se décide aisément à recommencer autant de fois que
                        cela est nécessaire.</p>
