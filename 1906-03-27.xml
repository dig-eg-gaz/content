                    <head>THE FRONTIER QUESTION.</head>
                    <p>As was to be expected, the news of the projected bombardment of
                            <placeName>Akaba</placeName> has received an official denial. The
                        question of Tabah - not of Akaba, which is unquestionably Turkish—will be
                        decided, if anywhere, at Constantinople and we believe that Sir Nicholas
                        O’Conor’s representations will finally persuade the Ottoman Government to
                        withdraw its troops from Tabah and the Nekb el Akaba. But though the
                        incident will, we believe, be terminated to the -satisfaction of the British
                        and Egyptian Governments it must not be supposed that we shall hear no more
                        of the Sinai frontier question. On the contrary, unless that frontier is
                        properly delimitated further incidents of this sort are probable, especially
                        when the completion of the Damascus Aleppo-Birejik and the Eregli-Birejik
                        lines link Constantinople and the Anatolian provinces with the Red Sea. We
                        admit the difficulty of persuading the Porte to come to any agreement as to
                        the delimitation of the frontier, and we realise that strong action on the
                        part of the Home Government may throw the Porte into the arms of a rival
                        European Power—a result that our statesmen obviously cannot desire.</p>
                    <p>The desire of the Ottoman Government to make Akaba a supply base for the
                        Hedjaz railway is natural and laudable enough, and in view of recent events
                        in the Yemen we can understand that the Porte is extremely anxions to
                        safeguard its position in Arabia by every means in its power. It is
                        possible, therefore, that British diplomatic representations may be regarded
                        with a certain amount of suspicion at Yildiz for the myth of British and
                        Egyptian designs on Arabia and Syria has been sedulously propagated in the
                        Turkish Empire. But, after making all allowances for Ottoman mistrust, the
                        foot remains that the Tarkish troops have crossed the Egyptian frontier and
                        have refused to evacuate the positions which they have occupied and that the
                        Government of Egypt and the British Government, which has important
                        interests to defend in this country, cannot, out of deference to the
                        Sultan,abandon their demand for the evacuation of the district now occupied
                        by his troops.</p>

                    <head>THE PRINCE TOUR !</head>
                    <p>"The Daily Telegraph,” in a leading article, reviews the tour of the Prince
                        and Princess of Wales in India, and adds the following interesting comments
                        on the visit to Egypt. Remarking that the tour is not concluded with the
                        farewells said in India, the journal alludes to the call which the Renown
                        makes at Port Said "to give the Royal,party an opportunity of seeing at
                        least a few of the wonders of Egypt” Some of those wonders date back to the
                        most remote periods of antiquity—a thousand yeas are to Egypt no more than a
                        hundred elsewhere in the Old World, and no more than ten in the New —others
                        belong to the last few years of our own time. The latter stand to the credit
                        of a handful of Englishmen rather than to the credit of England. No one can
                        be particularly proud of the Egyptian policy of British statesmen during the
                        critical eighties of last century, and for some years later. They did not
                        know their own mind, and waited on events. Happily for England, however,
                        there was one Englishman in Egypt who did know his mind, and British
                        statesmanship has since retrieved its reputation by giving him its implicit
                        confidence. The regenerate Egypt, which is now the envy and wonder of the
                        world, is the handiwork of Lord Cromer, assisted, as he has been, by a
                        succession of brilliant men, trained under his direction. In spite of the
                        Capitulations, in spite of persistent opposition offered in the early years
                        by other nations, in spite of the enormous debt by which Egypt was saddled,
                        and the evil tradition of Ismail’s ruinous extravagance, in spite of the
                        entirely anomalous position of the British resident and the British
                        Government in a country nominally independent, save for the suserainty of
                        the Saltan, Egypt has been recreated on a sound financial and commercial
                        basis. The prosperity of the country has leaped up in the last demule, and
                        for the first time for centuries the wretched, downtrodden fellaheen have
                        had their full share in the bounties which have been scattered along the
                        Nile Valley. Where the fellah earned two piastres he now earns three ; the
                        Government have rescued him from thelooal usurer, reduced his taxes, and
                        raised the tide and overflow of the Nile, on which the welfare of Egypt has
                        always depended. To the south, the great provinces of the Sudan have been
                        reclaimed from the most atrocious savagery, and a railway now runs from the
                        Red Sea across the waste of sand to the new capital which has risen on the
                        ruins of Gordon's Khartoom. The work is not yet finished. Indeed, it has but
                        just begun. Hardly more than the foundations, in the opinion of those who
                        have faith in Egypt's fata re, have been laid, and vast schemes of
                        irrigation will take many years and many millions before they can be carried
                        into effect. But the triumph already achieved is a splendid monument of what
                        capable Englishmen oan do in the way of governing men, if they are not
                        hampered by interfering politicians 'at home. The Prince of Wales does well
                        to conclude his Indian tour with a visit to Egypt. But for India there would
                        be no British Agent in Cairo ; but for Indian experience it is hardly
                        conceivable that Englishmen would have been able so soon to set Egypt on her
                        feet again. The visit of the Prince and Princess is the best compliment that
                        can be paid to the organising genius of Lord Cromer.</p>

                        <p>Before a well-filled house last night at the New Khedivial Hotel, M. Paul
                            Kookanaki, the celebrated violinist, with whose success in both
                            Alexandria and Cairo our readers are well acquainted, bade farewell to
                            an Egyptian audience. M. Kochanski gave his final performance and, it
                            goes without saying, scored a final success. His hearers were throughout
                            the programme held in a trance, and the applause at the conclusion was
                            such that he had to oblige with an extra number. We hope that this
                            distinguished young violinist will not be long before he pays this
                            country a visit again. </p>

                            Ordinary shares (being at the rate of 20 per cent. on the paid-up
                            capital) and of 10s. 9d. on the Deferrred shares. After writing off all

                        <p>This is a very satisfactory result on the first year’s working of this

                            has, it must be remembered, practically been only of nine months'

                    <head>GAS FOR FUMIGATING SHIPS.</head>
                    <p>This morning some highly important experiments were made on board the S.S.
                        Prince Abbas, of the Khedivial Mail Steamship Company, in order to
                        demonstrate the practicability of abolishing quarantine in Egypt by
                        destroying all microbes, microorganisms, insects, and vermin in the holds
                        and cabins of vessels by means of gas without any resultant damage to the
                        fixtures, bedding, clothingi etc.</p>
                    <p>Similar experiments to the one which began this morning have been taking
                        place within the last few days at the Government Hospital at Alexandria in
                        order to show the Sanitary Administration and the Municipality the efficacy
                        of the system. In this instance Dr. Gottschlich has microbes, bugs,
                        mosquitoes, et hoc genus omne in test tubes plugged in cotton wool, and then
                        again embedded in the centre of mattresses. In every instance the microbes
                        were sterilised and the insects killed. </p>
                    <p>One experiment gave great satisfaction. The gas was simply blown into the
                        building where the bedding, etc., were exposed,with the result that all the
                        living organisms hidden therein were rendered innocuous.</p>
                    <p>In this morning's experiments on board the steamer the gas was blown into the
                        hold. The identical system has been adopted by many shipowners of the world
                        for it is extremely practical not only as a disinfectant bat as a
                        fire-extinguisher, as exactly the same systems is used for
                        fire-extinguishing as for diainfecting.</p>
                    <p>This morning’s experiments were watched with great interest by a number of
                        officials of the Quarantine Board and of the Khedivial Mail Company.</p>

                    <head>GOVERNMENT EXPERIMENT.</head>
                    <head>BUILDING HOUSES FOR ITS OFFICIALS.</head>
                    <p>The following communication has been made to the Press :—</p>
                    <p>During the past year the inadequacy of the exiting house accommodation in
                        Cairo has made itself increasingly felt, and numbers of Government officials
                        with fixed incomes find that their rents have been raised to a figure so
                        high as to be practically prohibitive, or that they are simply served with
                        notice to quit. In the latter case it is always difficult and some­times
                        impossible to find suitable accommodation elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>Possessors of urban land seem desirous of holding on for a rise and the
                        possibility of resale at a profit rather than of utilizing their land at
                        once for building purposes. There would therefore appear to be no reason to
                        anticipate that the inconvenience will be overcome in the near future by the
                        ordinary operation of the law of demand and supply.</p>
                    <p>As it is obviously undesirable that Government employés should be compelled
                        to pay rents beyond their means or, in the ease of those holding the more
                        responsible posts, to find houses at such a distance from the Ministries as
                        to be inaccessible if their presence is suddenly required, it has been
                        decided by the Ministry of Finance to proceed forthwith to the construction
                        of a few experimental houses on Government land at Ghezireh, to be let to
                        Government servants at rents representing an adiquate return on the capital
                        expended.</p>
                    <p>The boilding of some sixteen or eighteen houses of three types at rents of
                        £150, £105, and £200 per annum, as well as two sets of flats at £100 to £120
                        per annom will be entered on at once.</p>
                    <p>Though these rents will be beyond the means of any but the better paid
                        officials, it has been found impossible, in consequence of the high value of
                        the Ghezireh land, to fix them below these figures. It is hoped that the
                        hooses will be ready at the end of the year ; the flatts will require
                        considerably longer to complete. The houses will be held on a yearly
                        tenure.</p>
                    <p>Should the experiment prove to be a success and should the want of proper
                        accommodation still regain acute, the shceme will be farther extended.</p>
                    <p>Applications from officials desirous of renting the new houses must be
                        addressed not later than April 10 to the Under Secretary of State, Ministry
                        of Finance. In case more applications are received than can be dealt with
                        this year, the Ministry of Finance will decide as to what measures shall be
                        taken to ensure an equitable distribution; the Government is aware that the
                        present experiment will not benefit the smaller officials.</p>
                    <p>With their case it is far more difficult to deal and it can indeed only be
                        properly dealt with by private enterprise. A concession has lately been
                        given to a company on very favorable terms for the creation of a suburb
                        beyond Abbassieh, and it is hoped that as soon as the tramway is completed
                        officials on small salaries will be able to find houses there in sufficient
                        numbers and at a moderate rent.</p>
                    <p>Should this unfortunately prove not to be the case it will be for the
                        Government to consider what steps can usefully be undertaken to ensure
                        adequate housing accommodation for this class of its servants.</p>

                    <head>TELEPHONE COMPANY OF EGYPT</head>
                    <p>Tha delays in telephonic communication complained of recently by the Cairo
                        public are caused, we are informed, by the fact that the difficulties of
                        operating are very great at the present time on account of the renovation of
                        the machinery of the switch­boards at the central exchange of the head
                        office, which ameliaration has been going on since June and has to be done
                        at night gradually so as not to entirely interrupt the service. It is
                        expected that this work, which will cost over £1,000, will be completed in a
                        few weeks, when, without doubt, there will result a great improvement in the
                        general working of the service.</p>
                    <p>We learn that the new list of Cairo subscribers for the present year ought to
                        have been distributed in January but owing to a strike of printing hands of
                        the firm in Cairo who undertook the work and contracted to deliver there
                        handbooks by the 31st December last, there has been a great delay, but they
                        will now be ready for delivery to subscribers early next month.</p>
                    <p>We are farther informed that, like all old established concerns, the
                        Telephone Company has been losing lately many of its oldest and most
                        efficient hands through offers of higher pay elsewhere hy the numerous new
                        companies lately started in Egypt, who require employes with local knowledge
                        and linguistic attainments.</p>
                    <p>It is interesting to note, as showing the immense progress in commercial
                        matters going on in this country lately that the figures show the number of
                        telephonic communications on the Cairo and Alexandria system of the company
                        to have increased by quite fifty per cent, since last winter</p>

                    <head>THE SUEZ ROAD.</head>
                    <head>POSSIBILITES AS A MOTOR TRACK.</head>
                    <head>SUEZ TO CAIRO IN FOUR HOURS.</head>
                    <p>A Suez Correspondent, signing himself "C.C.,” writes as follows : —</p>
                    <p>When one considers the ever-increasing number of motorists in Cairo at the
                        present time, and the difficulty of getting a really good ran, it is
                        somewhat surprising that the Suez Road—the old Anglo Indian mailronte—
                        should have received so little attention. Here we have a magnificent stretch
                        of road, some 80 feet wide, and over 80 miles in length, which might be made
                        one of the finest motorcourses in the world ; at pretent, however, in some
                        places, the surface is strewn with loose stones; in others, the way lies
                        through heavy sand, and through the rough beds of former watercourses.</p>
                    <p>From a motorist's standpoint, owing to the flatness of the country, and the
                        absence of any obstruction to the view, this track posesses advantages
                        unobtainable elsewhere. The keen, dry air of the desert should also be an
                        inducement to these who visit Egypt seeking health and for those who desire
                        variety, there is more than a suggestion of novelty and freedom in the
                        route, which remains much the same as described by Burton in his "Pilgrimage
                        to Al-Madinah and Mecca” fifty years ago.</p>
                    <p>Still may be seen standing the ruins of 15 halting places, some of which were
                        built by Waghorn, when he planned this highway to the Bast in 1830. Also the
                        summer palace of Abbas Pasha— grandson of Mahomed Ali — opposite the 8th
                        station from Cairo, and known as Dar el Baida. Two stations farther on is
                        the tomb of Sheikh Takroori,the Pilgrim's Tree, and 18 miles from Suez, the
                        old Fort of Adjroud, in Barton’s time considered to be the ‘‘Key to
                        Suez.”</p>
                    <p>Its charm, however, lies in the open desert with its exhilarating atmosphere.
                        For some 25 miles from Cairo the road ascends to a vast undulating plain,
                        known to the Bedouins as the Wadi Jeffrs, which extends for 20 miles or
                        more, after which the ground slopes very gradually to the sea. A more
                        perfect course for motoring could hardly be imagined. Were it repaired,
                        perhaps some enterprising person would start cars on hire during the tourist
                        season, and the trip across the Arabian Desert to the Red Sea might then
                        become one of the many excursions from Cairo.</p>
                    <p>I first explored this road with a companion in March, 1909, on a bicycle. It
                        was then in a very bad state, being intersected by numerous dry
                        watercourses. In 1903 these gaps were filled in—I think by the Khedive —and
                        the repairs remained until 1905.</p>
                    <p>On the 25th ult. for the fourth time, I took the desert track to Cairo, on
                        this occasion on a motor bicycle, and found it in many places cut up by
                        watercourses involving heavy labour in crossing them. In some of these sandy
                        spots the tracks of a motor car which visited Suez last autumn, and
                        apparently had great difficulty in getting along, were still visible.</p>
                    <p>Could not the Automobile Club be induced to take the matter up, and put the
                        road into thorough repair? The Suez Cycling Club has made a track to
                        Adjroud, over which one can average 90 miles an hour. Were the track equally
                        good throughout, the distance between Cairo and Suez oould be accomplished
                        by motor in less than four hours.</p>
                    <p>Sixty years ago, the Indian mail despatches need to be sent from Suez to
                        Boulac in five and a half hours by this road. </p>

                        <p>The retirement of Mr. Bellamy Storer, the United States Ambassador at
                            Vienna, who has been lately travelling in Egypt, is stated to be the
                            result of strong disapproval expressed in the American colony there with
                            regard to Mr. Storer's action in keeping too exclusively to aristocratic
                            circles. It is urged that the retiring Ambassador was by no means
                            sufficiently democratic to please Americans in Vienna, and it was
                            remarked at the time that he even absented himself from Vienna on
                            Thanksgiving Day. Mrs. Storer, it is stated, showed marked leanings

                        <p>House of Commons.—Mr. Winston Churchill announced that he did not propose
                            to introduce a representative Government in East Africa at present, but
                            Lord Elgin was considering the question of introducing some form of
                            Crown Colony Government. Any suggestions regarding the development of
                            the country would receive fall consideration.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Morley said that he was unaware of any negotiations on the subject of
                            the introduction of Indian coolies into the Transvasl.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Gladstone has introduced a Bill extending the Workmen’s Compensation
                            Act to practically every person working for his employer, including
                            seamen but excluding clerka and domestics. <hi rend="bold">(Reuter)</hi>

                    <div type="item">
                        <p>This extension of the scope of the Workmen's Compensation Acts of 1897
                            and 1900 is quite logical for, if the principle underlying the Act is to
                            be carried to its logical conclusion, the provisions of the Act must be
                            extended to all accidents, whether caused by misconduct or not, and to
                            all trades and industries.</p>
                        <p>The great principle underlying the provisions of the Act, was that the
                            trades and industries of the country should he chargeable with the
                            maintenance of those workmen who were injured in the carrying on of
                            those trades and industries, and with the maintenance of those who were
                            dependent upon the earnings of the injured workmen. To a certain extent,
                            no donbt, the Act has achieved its object.</p>
                        <p>So far as the Act is concerned the trades and industries of the country
                            are only made chargeable through the instrumentality of the individual
                            employer, because it is the individual employer who is personally
                            responsible to the injured workman. The liability thas imposed upon
                            employers has been met by different kinds of insurance, the bulk of
                            which is transacted by the existing accident insurance companies.</p>
                        <p>The latest figures to hand of the working of the Act are those for 1904.
                            The number of cases under the Workmen's Compensation Acts dealt with in
                            England and Wales by county court judges and county court arbitrators
                            was 1.780 in 1904, the largest number yet recorded. The number his
                            steadily increased from 999 in 1899.</p>
                        <p>The great majority of claims were, of course, settled by agreement. Even
                            in cases of death, in which large sums would generally he payable, not
                            more than 25 percent came in any way before the courts. £80,281 was
                            awarded on account of death—an average of £177 10s. Id. each case.</p>
                        <p>Of the olaims for compensation finally fettled in 1904 within the
                            compensation of the courts, the decision in 1,207 cases was in favour of
                            the applicant, and in 269 in favour of the respondent.</p>
                        <p>ln 452 cases the compensation was awaided on account of death ; and in
                            all of them the deceased bad left dependants.</p>

                    <p>M Le Bargy was, if possible, finer than ever last night (Saturday). His
                        Perdican is a great part, growing in interest through the play, till the
                        climax of intensity arrives at the end. The fountain scene with Rosette,
                        etceped in 'irony' for the audience—the Greek irony is carried out to the
                        fall when Perdican next meets Camille —was pure charm, Rosote playing up to
                        her lover in the most admirable fashion. Indeed, Mile. Demsamond was most
                        excellent throughout in that part, thoroughly naive and adoring, without
                        comprehension. The other parts are more or less comic after their kind, and
                        were broadly and fairly well interpreted. It is a singularly perfect play,
                        in diction and situations, a very model of drama intensifying from calm to
                        climax with its successions of gaiety and sorrow, love and remorse after
                        understanding. Mile. Barety was, of course, all that Camille should he,
                        disdaining her cousin's proposals "to order,” trying the sohool girl
                        philosophy tests of his love and men's love in general, then changed by
                        jealousy into woman, loving, then understanding, and finally renouncing. One
                        wonders if those two would have remained apart in real life.</p>
                    <p>La Nuit d'Octobre we have already seen in Cairo. Mme. Moreno was the nurse
                        and M. Monteux the poet. M. Le Bargy was, of course, infinitely superior ;
                        the light and shade of his intonations throughout, and especially the music
                        and power shown in his renunciation, which he calls nature to witness,
                        marked his representation as a masterpiece, descriptive and imaginative to
                        the highest degree. The sudden change of metre in this very renunciation
                        enhancer the effect. Between Mile. Barety and Mme Moreno the contrast is
                        more subtle and less obvious. Certainly Mile. Barety is more human, a woman
                        impassioned, almost loving rather than exalting and inspiring. Her voice,
                        too, is deeper and warmer, and her gesture more that of a "mortal.'’ What
                        other word is there? Of course both gave to the fall the value of every
                        syllable : but this certainly struck me as the distinctive feature. Mme.
                        Moreno’s voice is higher in pitch, more silvery, with a "ring” in it, and
                        possibly even more finesse in certain intonations, and this and her gesture
                        seemed to give at once the impression of the immortal strengthening her
                        poet, even by loving reproof. It would have been good to see her with M. Le

                    <p>But whatever this distinction, this performance was super excellent. La Nuit

                    <head>LE DEDALE.</head>
                    <p>This was a very pronounced "dédale,” not at all easy to follow. The audience
                        (I write without fear or hope that these lines will he read by those most
                        conoerned) were more than usually trying. Something most be wrong with the
                        ventilation to cause such constant coughing, but apart from that the lack of
                        stillness and attention was always conspicuous, and alas ! the actors seemed
                        to he well aware of it ; and much that had been at most foreshadowed in the
                        first four performances was noticeable last night: the acting was overdone,
                        much less "nuance” was perceptible, and less conviction—the performance was
                        almost provinoial Of coarse M. Le Bargy and Mlle Baréty cannot help showing
                        to advantage, bnt the difference could not be overlooked : they were not
                        acting as they can but ; and their colleagues lapsed at onoe into the ultra
                        "theatrical” in voice and gesture. It was a great pity, as it gives us less
                        hope for the remaining performances. But it is not to be wondered at : when
                        "overacting” and overemphasis receive more applause than real subtlety and
                        fine delicate interpretation, the performers, however great they may be
                        however thorough and devoted to their art, cannot be expeoted to exert
                        themselves as they would before those who note and appreciate every
                        slightest shade of appropriate inflexion and demeanour. Mile Bernon was
                        good, and M. Danvillier was, for most of the time, more satisfactory than in
                        Le Duel. Bnt as a whole the performance was disappointing : it might, if met
                        half-way by the andienoe, have been so brilliant. We mast hope for better
                        laok for the remaining nights. After all, the length of the play was
                        possibly largely theoanse ; the strain of five aots perleotly presented
                        would have been too scantily repaid.</p>

                            where a wing of the battalion formed the baokbone of the defence. He was
                            signalling officer for the greater part of the siege, and in the

                            was with the gallant Rangers in hard fighting which marked Bailer’s
                            advance to Ladysmith, including Colenso, Spion Kop, Tagda Hjights (where

                    <head>THE CAIRO SYNDICATE.</head>
                    <p>The following ingennoaaly framed article is from the "Financial News” :--</p>
                    <p>A couple of months ago attention was directed in these colnmns to the growing
                        in proveraents of thfc Egyptian coil indnstry. It was pointed out that at
                        present the coil which is consumed in the Land of the Pharaohs has to be
                        imported at great coast, and, in addition, a supply has to be procured for
                        the vessels at Suez and Port Ssid, which are making use of the world’s
                        greatest waterway. These considers ions render it self-evident that if the
                        coal reionroea of Egypt could be developed op to each a point as to render
                        the country independent of ontside assistance in the matter of fuel, a great
                        advanoe would have been made, and a profitable indnstry would have been
                        opened up to exploitation.</p>
                    <p>This is the view which was taken by the persons who were responsible for the
                        formation of the Cairo Syndicate. They considered that if the property
                        acquired by that company were anything like whet it reprinted it to be
                        nothing it was nothing short of a national asset, and - its development
                        nothing less than a matter of national concern ; for they had a concussion
                        which is estimated to aggregate 80.000 square miles, within eight days of
                        London, and easily accessible from the coast. And although of this vast area
                        only the central portion has so far been examined, the discoveries up to the
                        present are reported to inolnde coal, copper, and promising indications of
                        payable gold. At the moment, the ooal me wares are regarded ar the best of
                        the assets; but there n no knowing how well the others may turn out,
                        especially as the gold-bearing area is believed by the company's engineers
                        to inolade the site of the historic Ophir Mines. Samples of the coal have
                        arrived in London, and the tests made are stated to show it to be of
                        excellent quality. It should be added that some oil has been fonnd to exist
                        at points on the property ; but it is at the moment impossible to say what
                        value may ultimately be attached to this additional asset. At present, the
                        oil resources may be regarded merely as a make weight, though, as everybody
                        knows, oil resources have a way of showing themselves in the most unexpected
                        manner, and making themselves the foundation of the moat colossal fortunes.
                        The Cairo Syndicate has had a report from its representative on the
                        properly. His own words will tell the tale better than it can be told in any
                        other way:--</p>
                    <p>"The coal bearing strata is at the present from 8 or 9 to 12 in. in in
                        thickness, and the coal I easily detached from the country rook. When we
                        shall have reached the main seam I am confident we shall have reached the
                        main seam I am confident we shall have a clean one, with well-defined over
                        and under clays. We may reach it in days or, perhaps, weeks, but, having no
                        sata to go upon, it becomes a simple question or pick and drill and
                        patience. </p>
                    <p>"That the venture is now something more than a prospect is certain, and fully
                        warrantsthe expenditure of some capital. As an example I should like to work
                        with three shifts of men each twenty-four hours. I can only afford one shift
                        of nine hours. With three shifts I coild develop rapidly. At present it is
                        bat slowly. Until I can leave the work with safety I cannot examine the
                        country between here and Akabah ; but one piece of good news I have gleaned
                        out from an Arab who comes from the place, viz., that it is only three days’
                        march to the coast, where, he says, there is a kind of port, Darned
                        ‘Dahabil,’ and that it is downhill all the way. This must be so, as the
                        tannel month is 2.750 ft. above sea level. A drop if that extent is 35 miles
                        to the ocean, will be of enormous advantage in the event of a railway being
                        built, as haulage of loaded trucks will be reduced to a minimum.</p>
                    <p>Thas far of the coal. The gold resources of the concession are, perhaps, even
                        more likely than the coal to strike a sympathetic and romantic chord in the
                        breast of the investor. In this case samples of tailings from snoient damps
                        have been sent home and assayed to Mr. Artbar Clandet (Assayer to the Bank
                        of England), with the result that the four samples show gold to the extent
                        of 18 dwt., 15 dwt, 17dwt.. and 18 dwt. respectively. There assays refer
                        only to the tailings ; bat farther samples of the actual quartz, which hears
                        evidence of considerable richness, are said to be now in the hands of
                        Mesers. Johnson, Matthey and Co. The sample came from mines on the property
                        of the Cairo Syndicate, which are conveniently aitaated as regards tbe Red
                        Sea and have a good supply of drinking water. What is regarded as the proved
                        gold and other mineral bear-ing land covers an area of three or four square
                        miles ; but it seems there is do reason for believing this to be the fall
                        extent. Anyhow, an enormous amount of work has been done in the past on the
                        property, but only done with the result of doing little more than
                        "scratching the surface," owing to the very primitive engineering knowledge
                        and appliances which were at the disposal of the ancient miners. A depth of
                        60 ft. to 100 ft. sems to have been the limit and all the work has been done
                        with hammer and small, round pointed gouge.</p>
                    <p>Here, then, is an ancient goldfield, which may piossibly have been the source
                        of some of the great wealth of the Oriental despots of the past, now being
                        opened up for the benefit of British enterprose and the British inverstor.
                        At least, the British inverstor can go into it if he cares to do so; but he
                        need not to trouble unless he likes, for the company's engineer says that
                        the money necessary for the purpose can be raised in Egypt and Syria at the
                        present momont. He adds, in conclusion, the emphatic statement that "this
                        mine will pay handsomely, and the Cairo Syndicate not only posesses a mine,
                        bnt really a goldfield.” If the cautious East is so willing to go into the
                        enterprise, there is little wonder that the impnlsive and enterprising West
                        as represented by the Cairo Syndicte, has thrown itself with vigour aud with
                        energy into the task of development.</p>

                    <head>ABBATE PACHA'S INTERESTING LECTURE.</head>
                    <p>The above was the subject of a lectare delivered by H.E. Dr. Abbatî Paoha
                        under the auspices of the Société Khedrviale de Géogra phie on Saturday
                        afternoon last in the presence of the Govenor of Khartoum (Staunton Bey) and
                        a moat distinguished audience. So great was the concourse of auditors that
                        many had to reunin standing daring the delivery of a lectare if exceptional
                        interest. The span of life allotted to mortals and the limits imposed by age
                        upon human faculties rarely permit an individual to speak of events half a
                        century old with a vividness of recollection and an elaboration of detail as
                        if they had happened yesterday. It was this which lent exceptional interest
                        to the remarks of Dr. Abbate Pacha, but it was not this alone. </p>
                    <p>Auddience Spellbound.</p>
                    <p>The details themselves were related with such force and precision that the
                        audience—composed largely of ladies—abso lately spellbound. For a whole hoar
                        and a half we learned to ba accompanying the traveller upon his two
                        journeys, undertaken under ciroumstances of the greatest diversity. In 1856
                        Dr. Abbate formed part of the suite whioh accompanied on his desert trip
                        Saïd Pacha, and many wore the fatigues aod adventures encountered by those
                        who journeyed to Khartoum in those distant days. A picturesque account was
                        given of the Korosko desert enlivened by one or two amusing incidents, as,
                        for instanoe, when, at last, the Nile was reaohed and amidst rejoicings the
                        expedition halted upon its banks, the late Zuficar Pacha invited some of his
                        companions to be seated upon what seemed to be a piece of black rock but
                        subsequently turned out to be a sleeping crocodile !</p>
                    <p>Then and Now,</p>
                    <p>Khartuam upon Dr. Abbate’s former visit was but a collection of hots with a
                        mission garden in the centre and a Government House which formod a kind of
                        caravansary. And now —whit changes and transformations, have taken place!
                        The old city is no longer recognizable. Gordon’s headquarters has become the
                        most European of capitals in Central Afrias. It is in every sente a modern
                        dwelling-place where few Orientals reside. Indeed, in his soconnt of Khartum
                        Dr. Abbate did Dot differ in substanoe from Mr. Edward Dicey, who described
                        it as the city of "magnificent distance". Omdurman was next passed in
                        review. It still retains most of its former characteristics and is occuoied
                        chiefly by the natives of the Sudan. But even there British civilisation and
                        habits have penetrated, for, strange as it might appear the black battalions
                        might be seen playing football and cricket. Abbate Pacha had a goos word to
                        say for the Sudanese women, who are hard working and industrious. They still
                        far outnumber the men- who are lazy lords of creation- owing to the
                        protraced and decimating war which culminated in the overthrow of the
                        Mahdi.</p>
                    <p>Tribute to Gordon</p>
                    <p>The lecturer paid an extremely elequent tribute to the heroism of Gordon and
                        ascribed the foundation of the Sudan’s regeneration to his glorious
                        martyrdom. The recent journey to Khartoam in a "train de luxe" was then
                        contrasted with that of half a century provions. That trip was undertaken at
                        the traveller’s own expense and from a sheer desire to compare ith former
                        impressions. Dr. Abbate’s praise of the present administration was in every
                        respect unqualified, and, coming from such an independent source. it most be
                        undoubtedly well-marited. Altogether the lecture was one of the most
                        enjoyable we have attended, and delivered by a man in his eighty fourth
                        year, in a dear voice and without a traoe of fitigue towards the end was a
                        veritable tour de force.” A letter was read from the Sirdar (Sir Reginald
                        Winagate) expressing his regret that he was unable to be present. This was
                        but fitting homage to one who has for so many years laboared in the cause of
                        humanity and civilization.</p>

                    <head>KHARTOUM LABOUR MARKET.</head>
                    <head>BUILDING AND HOUSING.</head>
                    <p>The building trade in Khartoum is at prewsent so brisk and the call for
                        building materials is so heavy that a remarkable rise in the prices of
                        skilled labour and materials has been the result. By the end of this year
                        the time limit for quite a number of plots will expire and owners are
                        expediting building operations so as to leave Government no room for
                        complaint or, what is worse, confiscation. It has been observed that in
                        spite of the high cost of building the new houses are more substantial and
                        in better taste than the earlier efforts for providing accomodation. This
                        desirable result is due to the rise in the price of land justifying larger
                        investments in buildings.</p>
                    <p>The labourer class finds it hard to procure accommodation in Khartoum. One
                        could suggest Omdurman for the homing of this class on account of the
                        cheapness in time and mory such a move would entail, the cheapest rate of
                        transport between the two towns b ing P.T. 2 per day per had averaging a
                        total of P.T. 52 per working month. The only other alternative in view of
                        this difficulty would be for Government to insist upon a higher scale of
                        building iu the 3rd class quarter of Khartoum. But such a step would be open
                        to criticism as people purchased land there ia accordance with terms
                        approved by the Government and it would not be so easy to alter these terms
                        unless come inducement be held out. ( ‘Sudan Times.”)</p>

                    <head>THE EGYPTIAN SCARAB.</head>
                    <p>AN INTERSTING WORK.</p>
                    <p>Nearly everyone who comes to Egypt nowadays buys one or more specimens of the
                        little stone beetles known as Soarabs; but few who do have any clear idea of
                        what scarabs were made for, or why one scarab should differ from another in
                        value a fact out of which the dealers suck no small advantage. To all such
                        unlearned buyers, Mr. Newberry’s book will come as a godsend ; for his
                        twenty years’ reputation as an explorer is a sufficient guarantee for the
                        accuracy of its information, and it is impossible tor anyone to rise from a
                        perusal of the hundred pages whioh accompany its liberal allowance of forty
                        five plates without a very clear idea of the several varieties of scarab now
                        extant and of their meaning. Mr. Newborry will have nothing to do with any
                        new-fangled theories about scarabs being used as money, but says at once
                        that Dr. Birch was right when be laid down years ago, that they were seals
                        and nothing but seals. He also shows by many excellent and clear examples
                        how, before the use of keys came into fashion, seals were used for the
                        purpose of sec ring many things which prudent people now keep locked np,
                        sach as wine aud provisions. Hence, he thinks, a scarab or seal engraved
                        with ths first owner’s name or device, was once as necesary an appendage to
                        a good housekeeper as the bunch of keys was to tbe careful matron of the
                        last centnry, and he mentions in support of this that whenever scarabs have
                        been found in graves, the occupant of the tomb has nearly always proved to
                        be a female. He traces also the gradual evolution of the Egyptian seal from
                        the cylinder which the first conquerors of Egypt seem to have imported from
                        their Asiatic home to the finger-ring, often consisting of a scarab mounted
                        on its longitudinal axis, from whioh came in turn car modern "signet” rings.
                        For scarabs were not in use during the whole period of pre-Christian Egypt’s
                        florescence. Mr. Newberry tells ns that althongh a few occur at the end of
                        the end of the sixth dynasty, they only came into fashion daring the twelfth
                        and disappeared soon after the twenty-sixth. Why this should have been is
                        only one of the many puzzles whioch Egypology has for us.</p>
                    <p>In the twelve hundred or so specimens of which Mr. Newberry here gives
                        excellent reproductions, every possible variety beems to have been included.
                        By far tbe greatest number bear simply the. names of their owners, or at
                        most their names and titles, and the Royal Superintendent,” "singing
                        ladies,” scribes, and priests to whom they once belonged, doubtedless used
                        them for signing letters or authenticating deeds. More rare, as might
                        ecxpeetcd, are the scarabs belonging to Royal personages, which were, no
                        doubt, generally broken when their owners died as tbe "broad seal” of
                        England still is at the demise of the Crown. Rarer still are those which
                        bear the names of gods the purpose for which a god could use a Real not
                        being very obvious, although it is, of course, possible that his ministers
                        might require it now and then for the alienation of Church lands. More
                        common, again, are those scarabs which are engraved with no name, bnt merely
                        with a pattern of more or less intricacy. Snoh patterns were, no doubt, like
                        tbe trade mark still used by men of business, and might suoceed in
                        persuading the purchaser of merchandise that he was, in the language of the
                        advertisements, getting what he asked for. Yet there are a few specimens iu
                        Mr. Newberry's plates which seem to fall into none of the categories but to
                        have been made for ornament merely. Such are the few which bear "wishes ”
                        often singalarly I modern in tone, such as "May Ptsh give a Happy New Year,
                        from the Prince Shashanq (the Egyptian form of the Biblical Shishak, by the
                        way) to his mother, Ka-ra ma ma,” or the one or two huge ones five or six
                        innhes long, made by command of the great Pharaoh Amenhotep III to
                        commemorate his marriage with Queen Thyi, and the enormo is "bugs" that he
                        made when he wont hig game shooting after lions and wild cattle, Perhaps the
                        modern objeot whioh most olosely corresponds to this last kind is the
                        medal.</p>
                    <p>Finally, Mr. Newberry assures his readers that, although there is
                        occasionally a little "faking” of the glaze over difficult to detect, there
                        are hardly any altogether bogus or forged scarabs. Such objuots, he thinks,
                        would require skill aud knowledge far bnyond that possessed by the modern
                        dealer, and the expense of manufacture and importation would be prohibitive.
                        A comfortable saying, yet the prioe of rare scarabs is rapidly rising, and
                        we suspeot that before long the supply is likely by such means to catch up
                        the demand.</p>

                            <p>"The Egyptian Gazette" Series is the most artistic collection to be

                        <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                        <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers
                            the accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by
                            which they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange
                            them as accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that
                            none of them are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home
                            there are several things to be considered. To begin with there is the
                            difference in climate between Egypt and the various points at which you
                            may arrive in Europe.</p>
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                            January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so
                            warm as Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more
                            uniformly warm than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt
                            far too early in the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is
                            perfect. The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                        <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent
                            at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on
                            each of the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of
                            Europe.</p>
                        <cb n="3"/>
                        <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                        <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth,
                            Southhampton, London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones
                            are as follows:—</p>

                        <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                            Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines
                            are also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by
                            travellers to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to
                            Alexandria, without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made
                            without change in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                        <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                            Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German
                            Levant line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                        <cb n="5"/>
                        <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by
                            P.&amp;O. Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd
                            Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
                        <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little
                            luggage is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several
                            good and responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed
                            charge to deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                        <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by
                            the fast Mail Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to Brindisi. One of these
                            leaves port Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the
                            Indian <cb n="6"/>mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                        <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                            attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats"
                            having been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to
                            Brindisi. If you are going straight through to England you will find the
                            train waiting at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without
                            changing. It has complete arrangements for sleeping and eating on board,
                            and you should arrive in London on the fifth day from leaving Port
                            Said.</p>

                        <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers
                            which leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to
                            TAORMENA, one of the most charming and popular places on the island.
                            Giardini is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina
                            is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the town is
                            much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                            restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent
                            of Etna and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and
                            Saracenic remains that are found all over the island, are an endless
                            sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a
                            Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by
                            the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be
                            seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                            about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                            delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city.
                            The Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of
                            S. Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The
                            Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also
                            worth a visit.</p>

                        <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                        <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every
                            Wednesday during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3
                            days.</p>
                        <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino
                            Co.’s steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave
                            it without wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely
                            places on its bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that
                            takes you to Sorrento [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                        <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can
                            will devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and
                            interesting portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are
                            too well-known to need comment here.</p>
                        <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five
                            hours brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent
                            admiring the City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence
                            itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the
                            local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is
                            the most attractive and fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the
                            Viale dei Colli, one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago,
                            goes winding up through the hills a distance of four miles. The most
                            delightful excursion outside Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its
                            Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is made first by ordinary
                            train from Florence to St. Ellero, thence by cog-wheel railway to
                            Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                            striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                        <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a
                            fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night
                            should if possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile
                            at sunset.</p>
                        <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near
                            Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient
                            half-way house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable
                            and the air and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy,
                            with the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European
                            cities and a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and
                            deliciously cool breezes from the surrounding mountains and the
                            Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                        <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                            gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings,
                            are a constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn
                            in Genoa. Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches
                            containing exquisite marble columns and historical paintings, and the
                            incomparable Campo Santo filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                        <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                        <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                            Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful
                            windows illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and
                            the monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                        <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                            SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal
                            springs, change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are
                            at Salsomaggiore.</p>

                        <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                            delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                            vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage
                            or bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every
                            turn. The approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any
                            other sea port. The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of
                            the sea, no hills behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of
                            Campaniles appear above the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering
                            town rises like a fairy mirage out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                        <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                            lakes.</p>
                        <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in
                            one-and-a-quarter hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                        <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is
                            very beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                            enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo,
                            Cadenabbia, and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio
                            opposite. The walk from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio
                            is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake
                            Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in
                            two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>
