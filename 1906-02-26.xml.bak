                    <head> THE GERMAN EMPEROR.</head>
                    <p> We do not wonder at the enthusiasm with which all Germans celebrated their
                        Emperor's silver wedding yesterday. Few monarchs have. deserved better of
                        their country than the Emperor, and if his people just now are inclined to
                        mark the anniversaries of his birth and marriage with an especial warmth
                        they have reason enough for their inclination. Fortune and a matured and
                        brilliant stroke of policy have raised him within the past twelve month' to
                        what is scarcely less than the dictatorship of Europe. His Majesty at this
                        moment holds a position of actual and potential power almost Napoleonic in
                        its range and effectiveness Carlyle long ago declared that Europe by, Sedan
                        had exchanged a mistress for a master. His words have come true, and if the
                        German people are thrilled by the evidences of their truth with a new
                        exaltation, with a supreme consciousness of being on the crest of the rising
                        wave, and with a fresh and zealous pride in their ruler, who shall blame
                        them ?</p>
                    <p> Popular estimates of heirs-apparent are rarely worth much. Even if they were
                        their usefulness would still be limited ; for the weight of a crown, the
                        sudden change in duties, surroundings, advisers, and interests radically
                        modify | h e character. History is foil of instances where men were one
                        thing as Crown Princes and quite another as Kings. It is, therefore, nothing
                        strange that William II. should seem to-day a totally different being from
                        the youth whose abrupt accession eighteen years ago to the most powerful
                        throne in Europe sent a shiver of alarm from London to Moscow. The alarm •
                        was not unnatural. The coolest headed states. men shared it. At the time
                        nothing else seemed possible. Both as Prince William and as Crown Prince the
                        present Emperor had done nothing to reconcile foreign Powers to the idea of
                        his new position. Royal rhetoricians are usually disquieting, and the young
                        Prince haul net only genuine powers of declamation which he seemed only too
                        anxious to show off, but he invariably chose the most disturbing of all
                        topics on which to exercise them. The world had no option but to catch the
                        rattling of the sabre and the beat of the war drum through all his impetuous
                        periods. The uneasiness redoubled during the brief and pitiful tragedy of
                        his father's reign. The Crown Prince appeared to sink the son too much in
                        the coming Emperor. He should have kept in the background; instead, he took
                        every opportunity of posing before the people in full pageantry of war. He
                        might at least have held his tongue; instead, his speeches multiplied in
                        vehemence and fervid imagery. Europe found it hard to forgive his struttings
                        and line-light effects. It wrote him down as a rather self-willed and
                        theatrical youth, consumed with Chauvinism, and lending himself with an
                        avidity that seemed more French than German to the easy histrionics of
                        militarism. Wherever he went the full stage effects of a regimental setting
                        went with him. Whenever he spoke it was in flaming apostrophe of the sword
                        and martial glory and he heroic deeds of the most warlike of his ancestors.
                        It was inevitable that the world should see in him little more than a
                        prancing German edition' of Harry Hotspur, dashing, heady, with an instinct
                        for flashy and inopportune display, and terribly given to sounding the
                        charge.</p>
                    <p>‘To do the big thing in the big way." That, one is convinced, is the
                        direction in which the balance of the Emperor's nature overwhelmingly
                        inclines. He is a man who may be touched on many sides, whom things stir
                        quickly and strongly. Above the fundamental bent towards whatever is clean,
                        manly, and above board, above the range of glowing sympathies, there is his
                        strong imaginative, aid yet stronger dramatic, sense to appeal to. No one
                        manages to throw scab feeling into little international courtesies His
                        telegrams of condolence to the widows of Marshals MaoMahon and Canrobart
                        were, in' their way, quite perfect. He has something, perhaps a good deal,
                        of the Crusader temperament. He is profoundly moved by tales of heroism, by
                        the clash and jar of elemental life, and he has himself set an example of
                        triumph over disabilities that does not fall below the heroic level. His
                        left arm, AS everyone knows, has from his birth been practically useless. He
                        has met the affliction by training the right arm to do the work of two- an
                        easy feat to record, not so easy to accomplish. Many men simply throw up the
                        race on smaller pretexts than that, and a King who had not the right fibre
                        in him would be peculiarly seduced into making himself out a martyr of
                        circumstances. The Emperor has never been one of that kind. So far from
                        sitting down under his handicap, he rose to conquer it. In his list of
                        accomplishments there is a guarantees of something more than mere
                        versatility, and more even than a liking for the wholesome, manly things of
                        life: there is proof of so immense strength and discipline of character,
                        energy, will power, and of that “infinite capacity for taking pains” which,
                        if it be not genius, is at least as solid a foundation as one could wish for
                        any head of a State. Look at it which ever way you please, it takes a man to
                        win such a match with Fate as that. No weakling could have done it; no one
                        with any SERIOUS FLAW IN HIS character could have done it. </p>

                    <p>The third day a party flourists were visit¬ing the Mahdi's and Khalifa’s
                        capital, and were taken over the public school, where some hundred and fifty
                        boys and girls were being instructed in arithmetic, grammar, foreign
                        languages and all the other knowledge which is supposed to develop and
                        elevate the youthful mind. The party was shown over the school by a British
                        official, who has laboured most energetically and most successfully in what
                        may be regarded as a somewhat ungrateful task. He was accompanied on his
                        tour of inspec¬tion by a Pasha who had served as an officer in the Mahdi’s
                        army, who in the old regime had been eminent as a slave-trader, and who on
                        the fall of the Khalifa had thrown in his lot with the British, and who had
                        been promoted to high rank as a faithful adherent of British rule, end a
                        sincere convert to British ideas. When the inspection was over the Pasha
                        asked his British colleague what the school cost. He was informed that in
                        round numbers the cost was £5' 0 a year. On hearing this the veteran
                        slave-dealer said, with a sigh, “To think that only a dozen years ago you or
                        I could have brought the whole lot, toys and girls, for £50,” </p>

                    <head>The Sucrecries Bairam Bey' Conclusions Must Go Into Liquidation </head>
                    <p>Saturday’s hearing of the Sucreries case proved interesting enough after a
                        banal opening Me. Carton de Wiart having demanded the approval by the
                        Tribunal of the settlement arranged by the company and the majority of its
                        creditors, and given a number of cogent reasons for its approval, Me. Padoa
                        Bey wished to make certain observations, but the Court finally ruled that
                        Bairam Bey, who represented the Government, should speak first. Bairam Bey
                        then rose and gave his conclusions as to the granting of the concordat,
                        which may be summarized as follows. 1 </p>
                    <p>The approval of a concordat preventif, even though voted for by all the
                        creditors could only be granted by a Court if the debtor had been
                        unfortunate, i.e , had suffered from causes over which he had no control and
                        of good faith. In this case the debtor was a fictitious person —a
                        joint-stock company - and there could be no question of good or bad faith in
                        connection therewith. The Sucreries Company qua company was an abstrac¬tion
                        ; who personified it ? Its administrators or its shareholders in general
                        meeting! The text of the law now in force and European.* precedents left no
                        doubt that the administra¬tors alone were capable of legally representing
                        this fictitious personality.</p>
                    <p>In this particular case the administrators had paid dividends from the
                        profits of secret and at first successful speculation. It had accepted M.
                        Cromer’s bills and had increased its expenditure at a time when its
                        factories were working at a loss. The drawing of a distinction between the
                        members of the board who were responsible for these proceedings and those
                        who were ignorant of them should not influence the Court. Members of the
                        board who were kept in ignorance of the truth should have insisted on
                        verifying the accounts sub¬mitted to them and insisted before the
                        respon¬sible parties on their undoubted rights. Moreover, the board, on the
                        collective principle, was an undivided legal personality, and no distinction
                        could be drawn between its mem¬bers. Therefore, as the board was a
                        personality and had not acted in good faith, nor been unfortunate it must go
                        into liquidation.</p>
                    <p>After some discussion as to whether Me. Carton de Wiart as counsel for the
                        party interested could reply to the Attorney General, represented by Bairam
                        Bey, the Court ad¬journed Judgment will be given on March 8,</p>

                    <p> Signor Serato and Mme. Malatesta gave their farewell concert at the Savoy on
                        Friday, and in spite of a somewhat thin audience, owing no doubt to the
                        second day’s racing at Ghezireh, both the celebrated violinist and his most
                        efficient accompanist outvied all their previous successes. Signor Serato’s
                        rendering of Veracini’s sonata was beautiful in the extreme, but never has
                        he been heard to such good effect as in Max-Bruchs concerto in sol minors.
                        The Adagio movement in special, with its plaintive melody, could not have
                        been given with more fine feeling and purity of expression. The Rondo
                        brillante of Schubert’s was also a treat for the musical and those not so
                        highly gifted, and as an encore he gave a well-known Polonaise of
                        Vicuxtomps’ which was absolutely masterly in its treatment. Mure. Malatesta,
                        gave two solos, that delightfully quiet and simple Albumblatt fur Elise of
                        Beethoven’s, and Chopin's Polonaise la bornolle maggiore, which is such an
                        absolute contrast and which gave Mme. Malatesta every opportunity to display
                        her undoubted mastery of her instrument.</p>
                    <p> It is much to be regretted that this is the last occasion this season that
                        we shall I hear these two musicians, who have made such a success for
                        themselves, but we trust; that Signor Serato’s coming season in London will
                        add fresh laurels to his reputation. </p>

                    <p>Carnival has suddenly burst forth in virulent form and the street’s of Cairo
                        yesterday were filled with streams of overladen carriages and b 'By
                        onlookers, and on every side were seen pedestrians jigging along in
                        fantastic attire, and the toot of the tin and paper trumpets were heard in
                        all directions. Very soon after lunch there was a general exodus in the
                        direc¬tion of Ghezreh and many fearfully and wonderfully decorated cars were
                        to be seen in the procession. A huge sun helmet formed the canopy over an
                        equally enormous up-side down straw hat wherein sat a collection of the
                        typical tourists, blue-veiled, blue spectacled, and attired after the
                        fashion of Caran D'Arche. Then again followed a windmill fashioned of pink
                        satin and gaily decorated with crimson flowers wherein was ensconced a fair
                        incognita. A ponderous fort on wheels was peopled with a host of sailorboys,
                        another car supported a enormous crescent moon from which peeped out a
                        motley crowd of Pierrota, a scarlet figure sitting astride of a cask in
                        front of it. Another CAT represented an elephantine typewriter, and , yet
                        another illustrated the sad fate and punish meet doe to speculations various

                        preceding Sunday. The Ghezreh Palace was crowded during the afternoon and
                        teas were served for over two thousand people, and this number could have
                        been only the smaller half of those who were on the grounds. The drive home
                        even was a matter of difficulty, and the crowd of onlookers at the fur her
                        end of the bridge was almost as dense as that upon the course. Naturally the
                        English contingent was in the minority, but these who were there appeared to
                        be enjoying themselves, and a fair number of those who stayed away were
                        inclined after¬wards to regret the fact.</p>

                    <p>Never this season has there been such a collection of decorations worn by the
                        gentlemen, or so many beautiful frocks and wonderful jewels displayed by the
                        ladies, as on the occasion of the Austro-Hungarian ball at the Savoy Hotel,
                        Cairo, on Friday last. The ball room was filled with guests of all
                        nationalities and dancing became a matter of great difficulty as the evening
                        wore on. At about half past ten the strains of the Austro-Hungarian nations'
                        anthem announced the arrival of Count Koziehrodsky, Minister of that
                        country, who was accompanied by Count Stadnicky and M. Emilo Charles
                        Welunscheg, secretaries to the Agency, M. de Hahn, and the other members of
                        the Agency and Consulate. It would be impossible to enumerate ail those who
                        were present, but noticeable among the some six hundred guests were Mr. and
                        Countess Valda Machell, M Moise Cattaui Bey, M. and Mme. de la Boaliniere,
                        Princes Louis and Antoine d’Orleans, the Prince of Siam, M. and Mme de

                    <p>Very beautiful was the dress worn by Mme De Martino Pachs of gold-spangled
                        gauze with pink satin and roses at the corsage. and aiming eyes falored in
                        the wake of Mme de Vries in her wonderfully fitting frock of a thick
                        embroidered crepe de Chine which some said was amber-colored while others
                        declared it pink. On one half of the draped crossover bodice appeared
                        glimpses of diamentee gauze which also showed at the opening of the long
                        tunic skirt. Lady Valda Machell was wearing her wedding dress, a stiff white
                        brocade em-broidered with light sprays of silver, and her jewels included a
                        diamond and ruby tiara and a handsome dog color of pearls with diamond

                        admired in their pretty frocks of spangled gauze Mme. Cattaui was in an

                        the bodice, and Mrs. Nungovich’s dress of white velvet embroidered with
                        softly glowing beads . of various shaded was finished with tiny revers of
                        pink velvet. As before remarked. the display of jewels was something unique;
                        the value of the pearls alone must have ran into only thousands of pounds,
                        and the diamonds would have ransomed many a king, </p>

                    <head>GHEZIREH PALACE HOTEL. INNISKING KILLINGS FAREWELL MIRTH AND SADNESS
                        COMBINED </head>
                    <p>There was a note of sadness under the gaiety of Thursday’s dance at Ghezireh
                        Palace Hotel, for the thought was present in the minds of most that it was
                        the last occasion on which the popular officers of the Royal Inniskilling
                        Fusiliers would make merry within 'hose historic walls. Men may come and men
                        may so, but whoever takes their place it will be a long time before the
                        gallant Inniskillings are forgotten, and there were many, we fancy, who felt
                        that no future could quite make up for the past. It was tactful inspiration
                        that led to the orchestra bursting forth with the strains of "Auld Lang
                        Sync” at the beat of midnight, and one ventures to think that both Royal
                        Inniskilling Fusiliers and Cairo Society will have their thoughts in common
                        whenever they hear those well-known bars again. Naturally there was a big
                        dinner given in honour of the departing guests and many a farewell had to be
                        gone through daring the evening, for part oft he regiment was leaving the
                        following day and time was short and opportunities few.</p>
                    <p> There were numerous other dinner parties in progress at the same time, for
                        Ghezreh Palace Hotel and the 8avoy run each other hard on the score of
                        popularity and far be it from us to say which is the more favored. Certainly
                        the surroundings and architectural beauties of the former attract many
                        blessed with a sense of the artistic, but then there are solid advantages
                        connected with 'he latter which cannot be gainsaid. Prince Louis and Prince
                        Antoine d’Orleans were among the hosts on Thursday evening, and Col. and
                        Mrs. Gordon, Mr. and Mrs. Hewetson, Capt. Rainsford, Lady Lamnson, Mr. and
                        Mrs. Pepper, Mr. and M-s. Williamson Wilson, Mr. Phillips, and Mrs. Andrews
                        were all entertaining parties of various sizes. Conspicuous among the crowd
                        who afterward is congregated in the large hall and ballroom were the Count
                        and Countess Larsche and Sir James Blythe with his family party consisting
                        of Captain and Mrs. Rome and his pretty unmarried daughters. Major and Mrs.
                        Wynne were also there, the latter wearing a particularly graceful Empire
                        dress, the short bolero edged with a narrow pleating from beneath which
                        flowed the soft and filmy skirt Mrs. Hewetson is one of the lucky few who
                        are always irreproachably gowned, and her black frock molded her beautiful
                        figure to perfection. Mrs. Home too was much admired in her gauzy frock
                        glittering with faint lines of silver sequins, the bolero with its apologies
                        for sleeves being fashioned entirely out of heavy dull silver tissue. Mrs.
                        Smart who brought her young and charming daughter, was wearing a blue
                        chiffon trimmed with lovely lace, and Mrs. Roper, in black with jetted
                        corsage showing folds of golden tissue at the décolletage, was wearing many
                        fine diamonds, notably a diamond snake enrolling her throat. Mrs. And Miss
                        Leveridge were among their friends, the latter wearing a fresh and dainty
                        softly hued muslin, and Mrs. Morgan was in a pretty lace frock adorned with
                        tiny wreaths of chiffon roses. One of the Miss York’s wore an extremely
                        dainty frock of grey moonlight silk with wreaths of very pale pink chiffon
                        roses. Miss Phillips looked her best in a pretty shade of blue with folds of
                        pink and cluster of roses at the décolletage, and Miss Rees was in cream
                        lace with a large bunch of violets in the corsage. Mrs. Hunter was wearing a
                        curious but becoming combination of grey and copner colour, the latter
                        appearing as ceinture and at the neck, and Mrs. Armstrong had on a very
                        handsome grey chiffon velours with applications of dull silver passemanterie
                        on the bodice. </p>

                    <p>Major J. A. Burdon, Resident at Sokoto reports that there is no doubt that 3
                        British officers and 25 native soldiers have been killed. The disaster is
                        attributed to the horses having bolted and breaking the square. The garrison
                        at Sokoto is safe. The local chiefs are loyally co-operating for the
                        suppression of the rising. Reinforcements are expected at Sokoto on the 28th

                        reasonable to suppose that the activity will be at least well maintained, if
                        not increased, in the future. Engineering and building operations of all
                        kinds are in progress throughout the country. Large sums of money are to be
                        expended on public works. Private houses, flats and offices are on all sides
                        being erected, and the demand for snob buildings is ever , increasing.</p>
                    <p>The following is an extract from the note by the Financial Adviser on the
                        Budget for 1906</p>
                    <p>‘‘Roughly speaking, it may be said that Egypt, is actually spending from L.E.
                        300,000 to L.E. 400,000 annually on public buildings ; not, I think, an
                        extravagant sum, having regard to the revenue of the country and the fact
                        that everything has to be provided ab initio, hospitals, post offices,
                        prisons, asylums, schools, police stations, to say nothing of Gouvernorats,
                        and other Government buildings of practically every description.</p>
                    <p>“Of course in the above figures are not included great works of public
                        utility of a remunerative nature, which are charged to Reserve Fund.”</p>
                    <p>With the working capital at its command, the Company will be in a position to
                        take full advantage of the increasing prosperity of the country, and to
                        undertake engineering and building contracts of the largest kind. Hitherto
                        it has been found that Where any works of magnitude have been executed in
                        Egypt, the preponderance of contracts has been secured by European firms. As
                        regards the erection of buildings, as distinguished from other works, the
                        Company will be in the favourable position of being able to complete them
                        from basement to roof, including their equipment throughout with electrical
                        and sanitary appliances ; thus the profits on minor contracts can be secured
                        to the Company. There is a great demand for small residential houses in
                        Cairo and Alexandria, and a wide field is open to the Company to erect small
                        houses in suitable localities, according to the plans and requirements of
                        purchasers, and to have the cost of erection secured by Mortgages payable in
                        instalments, with the usual interest there on, extending over a period to
                        suit the convenience of clients.</p>
                    <p> The Company will in the first instance acquire and amalgamate the businesses
                        carried on by the well-known firms of Engineers, Contractors and Builders,
                        Messrs. McClure and Dorling, of Alexandria, and Messrs. G L. Pezzi and Co„
                        of Cairo and Alexandria. Both firms are highly respected, and have been
                        entrusted with numerous important contracts by—amongst others—the Egyptian
                        Government, H. H. The Khedive, the British Govern¬ment, the Egyptian State
                        Railways Administration, the Prisons Department, the Quarantine Board, the
                        British Schools, the Alexandria Water Company, etc. etc.</p>
                    <p>Messrs. G. L. Pezzi and Co., who have been established since 1865, in
                        addition to their business as Contractors and Builders, canty on the
                        lucrative business of supplying the building trade with paints, papers, and
                        other building materials and requisite.</p>
                    <p>The immediate vendors to and promoters of the Company are Messrs. Barc’ay,
                        Hicks and Co., of Cairo (hereinafter called “the Vendors”), who have agreed
                        to acquire the said businesses from their respective proprietors with a view
                        to the re-sale thereof to the Company at a profit, the particular of which
                        appear from the statements hereinafter contained. The proprietors, Mr. T.
                        McClure, Mr. S. Dorling and Mr. G. L. Pezzi who will be the first Managing
                        Directors of the Company, show their confidence in the Company’s future, not
                        only by taking six-sevenths of their proportion of the purchase price, other
                        than the valuation of the stock and plant, entirely in fully paid shares,
                        but they have also agreed, by the undermentioned Agreements (4) and (5) that
                        during the first five years their salaries as Managing Directors shall not
                        be payable in any year in which the Company shall not have earned profits
                        sufficient to pay a dividend of 7 per cent, on the initial paid-up hospital,
                        and have further agreed to retain a holding of 10 000 shares during their
                        term of office, and to deposit the certificates of such shares with the
                        Company.</p>
                    <p>Both businesses will be taken over by the Company as going concerns as from
                        the 1st day of October, 1905, and the Company will have the benefit of all
                        profit realized from that date. The property to be transferred to the
                        Company will include, besides the goodwills of the two businesses, the
                        benefit of all pending contracts, the benefit of the existing agreements for
                        the business premises, the book debts from the 1st October, 1905, and the

                        the goodwills is fixed at £30 000. The Vendors have also agreed in
                        consideration of the further payment of £6,000 in cash to subscribe or
                        procure subscriptions for 75,000 shares in the Company ; 12,0 00 of these

                            King's Royal Riple Corps</head>
                        <p>The above well known rivals met on Satur¬day week to decide who should
                            hold the above shield for the season 1906. The ground was in the best of
                            order as both teams entered the arena each confident of victory. The
                            captains lined their men out in the following order : King's Royal Rifle
                            Corps—goal, Pickervince ; backs, Swinbourne, Ventimore; halves, Craston
                            Wilson and Bruke; forwards, Mitchell, Bicknell, Booth, Soouter and
                            Ketterick. Royal Inniskilling Fosilier’—goal, Lieut. Vernon ; backs,
                            Robinson and Reid ; halves, Millar, Walker, and Smyth ; forwards, Black,
                            Hutton, Cun¬ningham, Greer and Walsh.</p>
                        <p>The Inniskillings won the spin of the coin and decided to defend the city
                            goals. Booth started the ball rolling before 7,500 spectators. The
                            Rifles got away in fine style but Smyth robbed Mitchell and play was
                            transferred towards Pickervince, but Venimors cleared well Some
                            give-and-take play now ensued until Bruke got away and gave to Soouter,
                            who had a nice ran towards Vernon, but his parting shot went wide. On
                            the kick off Black got possession and centered well and Cunningham gave
                            the sphere to Greer, who rent in a fast shot across the goal month,
                            where Black, who was lying handy, had no troubles in scoring the first
                            goal for the inniskillings amid cheers.</p>
                        <p>On resuming the Rifles got on a fast ran, Booth giving his wing men
                            plenty of chances, bat over-eagerness spoiled all attempts. Good play by
                            Smyth brought play well down but Broke, who was playing a fine game,
                            robbed Black and play was transferred toward" Vernon. The latter in
                            saving conceded a corner which was sent behind. On the kick-off the
                            Inniskillings got away, Cunningham having a shot at goal, but the
                            custodian was in fine fettle and saved the situation. Play now took a
                            turn towards Robinson and Company. The left wing of the K.R.R. were
                            playing a fine game. Once or twice Ketterick had very hard lines, his
                            shots, which were of the international order missing the poet by a
                            hair's breadth. The Inniskillings now took play in hand. Black, getting
                            away on a good run, sent across where Greer got possession and with a
                            last shot he sent np the second goal. The ball had just been centered
                            when Greer, accepting a golden opportunity, scored again. The Rifles now
                            took play in hand and Vernon had to be on his best behaviour or a goal
                            would have been scored. Each goal was visited in turn np and down the
                            field, the pace being a hot one. The Inniskillings now scored again per
                            Hutton. Nothing of importance occurred from this up to half time, the
                            score reading :—</p>
                        <p>Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers ... 5 goals King’s Royal Rifle Corps Nil </p>
                        <p>After the usual interval and refreshments play was once more resumed. The
                            start was a bit sensational as the Rifles bombarded the Inniskillings’
                            goal, and it was more by good look than guiding that Vernon kept a clean
                            sheet. The Inniskillings now advanced per Cunningham, but they were
                            forced to retire, Craston relieving and Burke got away and sent in a
                            daily cutter to Vernon, who just managed to save. The Rifles bad hard
                            lines in not (poring but their shots lacked the necessary aging.” Good
                            only by Walker changed the scene of operations and play was around
                            Pickervince and be had a few iho‘8 to deal with, one shot from Blaok
                            being weh saved. Midfield play now followed until </p>

                            The start was a bit sensational as the Rifles bombarded the
                            Inniskillings’ goal, and it was more by good look than guiding that
                            Vernon kept a clean sheet. The Inniskillings now advanced per
                            Cunningham, but they were forced to retire, Craston relieving and Burke
                            got away and sent in a daily cutter to Vernon, who just managed to save.
                            The Rifles bad hard lines in not (poring but their shots lacked the
                            necessary aging.” Good only by Walker changed the scene of operations
                            and play was around Pickervince and be had a few shows to deal with, one
                            shot from Black being well saved. Midfield play now followed until
                            Souter got away on his own centered well. Burke, receiving, gave
                            Bicknell, who missed the post by inches. Play for a while was in favour
                            of the Rifles, and it made Vernon look out for his p’s and q’s. Play now
                            became some what slack, Cunningham introducing some tricky work. Hutton
                            and Black were combining but Swainbourne was one too many for them. Time
                            and again he robbed when all seemed lost. The Rifles forwards now showed
                            some fine combination but score they could not do. They planted the ball
                            everywhere except the proper place. The Inniskillings now wakened up and
                            Walsh got away on a dashing run and centered well to Cunningham, who in
                            turn gave to Black sent well across to goal mouth. Walsh, getting the
                            sphere sent in as swift shot, but the custodian brought off a very
                            clever save. The Inniskillings were pressing very hard when offense
                            spoiled any chance they had. Both teams were completely fagged out. It
                            was now mearing up to full time as the Rifle strove hard to score,
                            Ketterick striking the upright in the attempt. The excitement was
                            intense as Booth sent past. On the kick-off Greer got away on a nice run
                            and dodging Wilson he gave to Walsh, who with a high a shot sent the
                            ball into the left top corner of the net. With only two minutes to go
                            the Rifles made one more attempt but it was useless ,, the ball finding
                            the back of the net. Shortly after the referee’s whistle sounded for
                            full time leaving the Inniskillings winners of the shields and one of
                            the best contested matches ever seen in Cairo by the following score:
                            Royal Innisking Fosiliers… 5 goals King’s Royal Rifle Corpos …Nil </p>

                    <p>The first tie of the Gordon Challenge Cap was played on Saturday before a
                        large crowd of residents and visitors. The opposing sides were : THE
                        TOURISTS MOSQUITOES 1. Mr. Paravioiui 1. Cant. Stockwell 2. Mr. Pickering 2.
                        Mr. Gore Graham 3. Mr. de Frev lie 3. Capt. Bartlett Back, Co). Sparkes
                        Back. Mr. Dudgeon </p>
                    <p>Umpire, Captain Rome. 1st Chukker.—The Mosquitoes were first on the ball, ran
                        it down, and narrowly missed scoring, Bartlett hitting wide and losing a
                        good chance. From the hit out the tourists worked the ball up the ground and
                        Dudgeon, in trying to save, scored a subsidiary against his side. Counting.
                        the Mosquitoes took the ball down the ground but Sparkes weaved wel1, the
                        ball was worked back to the Mosquitoes’ goal and from a melee in front
                        Paravicini put it through. Scrambling play ensued, though the Tourists
                        continued to press and Pickering scored for them again. It was a sticky
                        chukker in which the tourists did most of the pressing and scored 2 goals
                        and 1 subsidiary to nil. </p>
                    <p>2nd Chnkker.—For the first half of this chukker the game was confined to the
                        Tourists’ end, the Mosquitoes missing one or two chances of scoring.
                        Bartlett, however, with a brilliant ran down the field, scored the fret goal
                        for his side. The same player shortly afterwards made another fine ran bat
                        hit wide with his last shot. Dudgeon cantered well with a near side shot and
                        Sparkes, in trying to save, hit behind. From the resulting penalty Bartlett
                        scored. It was another rather sticky chukker in which the Mosquitoes were
                        better and scored 2 goals to nil.</p>
                    <p>3rd Chukker.—Pickering get away from the throw-in but glimpsed a chance of
                        scoring. Give- and-take play followed, first one side then the other
                        attacking. Bartlett, on a fast white pony, with a great run the whole length
                        of the ground, locked like getting a certain goal, but the hall bumped and
                        Sparkes cleared. The Tourists then attacked and from a hustle in front of
                        the posts snickering scored with a very neat shot. The same player again
                        scored short¬ly afterwards, putting the Tourists 2 goals ahead. Then came
                        the best piece play of the day. Bartlett got on the ball near his own goal
                        and brought it right down, well backed up by Graham and Stockwell, the
                        latter finally scoring a good goal. This was and very much better chukker,
                        of which the Tourists had slightly the better and scored 2 goals to 1.</p>
                    <p>4th Chukker.—With seven minutes to play the Mosquitoes were 1 goal and 1
                        subsidiary to the bad. They played up hard and looked like scoring, but
                        Sparkes saved well. Up and down the ground the ball travelled. Dudgeon, in
                        trying to meet the ball, let in de Freville, who however missed chance. Tune
                        was finally called with no farther ad¬dition to the score, the Tourists
                        winning a good, hard, even game by 4 goals 1 subsi¬diary to 3 goals.</p>
                    <p>For the winners Sparkes and de Freville were best, the former being very safe
                        and his hitting true and clean. For the losers Bartlett WAS brilliant; his
                        hitting WAS hard, sure and straight, he was beautifully mounted, and always
                        on the ball.</p>

                        player of the R.E. team, however, won by another fifteen, thus making the

                    <p> A Londres, le Consolide anglais a hausse hier de 1/8 a 90 5/8. L'unifice est
                        restee in chargee a 10. La National Bank est renseignee en reprise de 1/4 de

                        reperdu 1/8 a 10. </p>
                    <p> A Paris, l'action Credit Foncier Egyptien s'est tenue a 793. La Banque
                        d'Athenes a reactionre de 3 francs a 142.</p>
                    <p>Notre marche des valeurs a ete, ce matin tres anime sur les Land Allotment,
                        le Delta Land, les Hooker, ainsi que sur l'Immobiliere et quelques autres
                        titres. </p>
                    <p>Le compartiment des Banques conserve son calme. La Nationa; et l'Agricole
                        sont negligees a leurs prix d'hier.</p>
                    <p>La Banque d'Athenes est revenue a 143 Le Comptoir Financier a progresse a 5
                        7/8. En bonne tendance, le Credit Foncier s'est inscrit en clouture a
                        795.</p>
                    <p>Les parts de jouissance Eaux du Caire ont remonte a 278279. L'Immobiliere a
                        avance a 367-368. La part de fondateur Enterprise and Developmrny a encore
                        gague plus d'une livre et demie a 12 3/4.</p>
                    <p>L'Agricole du Nil a reagi a 272; la part de fondateur a 6 1/4. Le Wardan
                        Estate a repris de 1/8 a 7 1/8; par contre, la part e fondateur a fleci a 5
                        1/2.</p>
                    <p>L'action Land Allotment avance a 3 13/16; la part de fondateur atteint 130,
                        avec beaucoup de transactions, pour cloturer a 124.</p>
                    <p>L'action Soceite d'Enterprises Immobilieres et de Travaux continue a se
                        traiter aux abords du pair; la part de foundateur est toujours demandee a
                        L.E. 7 1/2.</p>
                    <p>Rien de tres particulier a signaler dans le groupe des Hotels.</p>
                    <p>Parmi les petites valuers, grand mouvement, comme hier, sur les actions Delta
                        Land et Hooker; les premieres out cloture de 3 1/16 a 3 1/8 et les secondes
                        a 1 1.16. Les Salt and SOda on fait 24 sh.</p>
                    <p>Nous avons di hier que la valeur intrinse que d la Delta Land etait de
                        beaucoup superiure a son cours actuel; nous allons l'etablir.</p>
                    <p>Au debut de ses operations, la Delta Land a fait l'acquisition, a un prix
                        derisoire, d'un domaine de 1,800,000 metres a Maadi, sur la ligne de
                        He'onan. </p>
                    <p>Ce terrain est admirablement situe a proximite de gare et peut, d'ores et
                        deja, etre vendu au prix de P.E. 50 le metre en moyenne.</p>
                    <p>En deduissant pour les routes et les squares public, une superficie enorme,
                        voire 600,000 si l'on veut, il restera 120,000 metres qui pourront rapporter
                        environ 600,000 livres.</p>
                    <p>La Societe possedait, en outre, il y a deux mois, au Caire et dans les
                        provinces, des proprietes d'une valuer de 200,000 environ et, la valuer
                        intrinseque de l'action etati a ce moment calculee a 4 livres.</p>
                    <p>Depuis lors, la Societe a achete, au prix de 160,000, l'actif de la Soceite
                        des Moulins francais. On estime a 100,000 le benefice qu'elle tirer de la
                        revnete de cette affarire.</p>

                        <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>

                        <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers
                            the accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by
                            which they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange
                            them as accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that
                            none of them are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home
                            there are several things to be considered. To begin with there is the
                            difference in climate between Egypt and the various points at which you
                            may arrive in Europe.</p>

                        <cb n="2"/>

                        <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                            January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so
                            warm as Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more
                            uniformly warm than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt
                            far too early in the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is
                            perfect. The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>

                        <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent
                            at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on
                            each of the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of
                            Europe.</p>

                            Southhampton, London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones

                        <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                            Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines
                            are also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by
                            travellers to Egypt.</p>

                        <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to
                            Alexandria, without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made
                            without change in 4 1/2 hours.</p>

                        <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                            Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German
                            Levant line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>

                        <cb n="5"/>

                        <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by
                            P.&amp;O. Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd
                            Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>

                        <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little
                            luggage is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several
                            good and responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed
                            charge to deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>

                        <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by
                            the fast Mail Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to Brindisi. One of these
                            leaves port Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the
                            Indian <cb n="6"/>mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>

                        <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                            attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats"
                            having been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to
                            Brindisi. If you are going straight through to England you will find the
                            train waiting at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without
                            changing. It has complete arrangements for sleeping and eating on board,
                            and you should arrive in London on the fifth day from leaving Port
                            Said.</p>

                        <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers
                            which leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to
                            TAORMENA, one of the most charming and popular places on the island.
                            Giardini is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina
                            is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the town is
                            much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                            restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent
                            of Etna and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and
                            Saracenic remains that are found all over the island, are an endless
                            sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a
                            Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by
                            the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be
                            seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                            about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                            delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city.
                            The Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of
                            S. Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The
                            Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also
                            worth a visit.</p>

                    </div>

                    <div type="article">

                        <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>

                        <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every
                            Wednesday during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3
                            days.</p>

                        <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino
                            Co.’s steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave
                            it without wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely
                            places on its bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that
                            takes you to Sorrento [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>

                        <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can
                            will devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and
                            interesting portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are
                            too well-known to need comment here.</p>

                        <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five
                            hours brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent
                            admiring the City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence
                            itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the
                            local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is
                            the most attractive and fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the
                            Viale dei Colli, one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago,
                            goes winding up through the hills a distance of four miles. The most
                            delightful excursion outside Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its
                            Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is made first by ordinary
                            train from Florence to St. Ellero, thence by cog-wheel railway to
                            Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                            striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>

                        <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a
                            fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night
                            should if possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile
                            at sunset.</p>

                        <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near
                            Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient
                            half-way house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable
                            and the air and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy,
                            with the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European
                            cities and a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and
                            deliciously cool breezes from the surrounding mountains and the
                            Mediterranean in summer.</p>

                        <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                            gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings,
                            are a constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn
                            in Genoa. Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches
                            containing exquisite marble columns and historical paintings, and the
                            incomparable Campo Santo filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>

                        <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>

                        <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                            Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful
                            windows illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and
                            the monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>

                        <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                            SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal
                            springs, change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are
                            at Salsomaggiore.</p>

                        <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>

                        <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                            delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                            vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage
                            or bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every
                            turn. The approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any
                            other sea port. The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of
                            the sea, no hills behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of
                            Campaniles appear above the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering
                            town rises like a fairy mirage out of the calm lagoon.</p>

                        <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                            lakes.</p>

                        <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in
                            one-and-a-quarter hours by train by way of Monza :</p>

                        <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is
                            very beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                            enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo,
                            Cadenabbia, and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio
                            opposite. The walk from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio
                            is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake
                            Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in
                            two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                            hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated
                            on the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M.

                        <p>LOCARNO, may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This

                            is an excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated
                            above the town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings,
                            “Entombment," by Ciseri, and ‘Tho Flight into Egypt,” by Bramantion.</p>

                            Pilatus, Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other
                            excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing
                            scenery on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to
                            the lover of nature.</p>

                        celui-ci n'opère bien que lorsqu'il est pris avec de bons aliments et des
                        boissons fortifiantes, telles que vin, café, thé. Chacun choisit, pour se

                        occupations. La fatigue de la purgation étant annulée par l'effet de la
                        bonne alimentation, on se décide aisément à recommencer autant de fois que
                        cela est nécessaire.</p>
