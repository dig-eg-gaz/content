                    <head>THE LATE GRAND MUFTI.</head>
                    <p>In Sheikh Mohamad Abdon, whose death occurred at Ramleh yesterday, Egypt has
                        lost a man who can ill be spared. His career was in many ways most
                        remarkable. The son of a simple village Sheikh, he took the highest honors
                        that Al Azhar could give in his 30th year, but instead of devoting himself
                        to the study of theology, or to that life of repose varied by occasional
                        controversy on matters of dogma which is followed by so many Eastern
                        theologians, he sought more practical and beneficial objects and soon became
                        editor of the “Journal Officiel" of the day. Those were the later years of
                        Ismail Pasha, when a huge debt and oppressive methods of administration were
                        sowing the seeds of revolution; and Sheikh Mohamed Abdou’s liberal
                        sympathies were roused by the spectacle of the Egyptian people staggering
                        under the burden laid upon it by grasping Ministers and exorbitant foreign
                        creditors, from the bondholders to the petty usurers who plied their trade
                        in every village. He joined the Arabist party in 1882, animated by the hope
                        that some remedy might be found for the misfortunes of his country, and did
                        his utmost to keep the Nationalist cause unstained by fanatical excess.</p>
                    <p>He failed, but had the revolutionary leaders been men of equal moral fibre,
                        and imbued by as liberal ideas, the history of Egypt might have taken a very
                        different course. The revolution failed and Sheikh Mohamed Abdou was exiled.
                        He withdrew to Beyrout, where he devoted himself to the study of theology
                        and philosophy, acquiring a far wider knowledge of these subjects than
                        almost any living Moslem, and devoting great attention to the various
                        European systems of philosophical thought. His energy in the cause of
                        charity and education was unbounded, and did not distinguish between
                        Christian or Moslem, Jew or Druse. Even the most conservative and fanatical
                        of his opponents admired him, and his marriage with the daughter of Sheikh
                        Hamada, a well-born and venerable Moslem of Beyrout, was made the occasion
                        of great rejoicing. </p>
                    <p>On his return from banishment, Sheikh Mohamed Abdou showed himself, as ever,
                        a partisan of justice and reform. He was appointed judge of the Native Court
                        of First Instance at Benha in 1892, and showed that neither his exile nor
                        his theologioal training had unfitted him for legal eminence. He rose to a
                        judgeship in the Court of Appeal and in 1899 replaced Sheikh Hassouna el
                        Nawawi as Grand Mufti of Egypt, after being previously appointed a member of
                        the council of administration of his old University of Al Azhar. Unlike his
                        predecessor, whose views were, and remain, uncompromisingly conservative,
                        Sheikh Mohamed Abdou showed himself a Liberal and a reformer in thought and
                        act. A Moslem "Broad Churchman"— if we may use the term —he had no reverenoe
                        for the “letter that killeth,” and while a sturdy defender of the cardinal
                        points of the Moslem faith, had no patience with its numerous accretions
                        which have come down from pagan times or have been accepted by Moslems at a
                        later date, though quite unwarranted by the “noble Koran." This eagerness to
                        discover the living spirit of Islam, the true intentions of its great
                        founder, was manifested in his attitude towards marriage and the seclusion
                        of women. Sheikh Mohamed Abdou pointed out that the Koran admitted plural
                        marriage if a husband could treat his wives with equal justice and regard
                        them with equal affection, but that in practice this was an impossibility,
                        and that monogamy therefore was the only possible form of marriage to the
                        civilised man. He condemned the seclusion of women as being post-Islamio in
                        its origin, a practice introduced from the further East, baneful in its
                        effects and unwarranted by the precepts and the practice of the first and
                        most glorious centuries of Islam. His eagerness to promote and support
                        female education in Egypt was well-known, and he was a strong and undaunted
                        opponent of all forms of obscurantism. </p>
                    <p>Sheikh Abdou’s zeal for good works was immense—and practical. He preferred
                        the foundation of technical schools to indiscriminate alms-giving, though
                        always ready to assist the needy and helpless. His tolerance and
                        fair-mindedness in religious questions—which are unhappily not shared by
                        some of his critics—were the signs, not of latitudinarianism, as his
                        opponents pretended, but of an enlightened and liberal faith. Christian
                        missionaries and Indian philosophers, Orientalists and students of all
                        creeds and nationalities who visited him were charmed by his urbanity and
                        astonished by the wide range of his knowledge. His relations, with the
                        Ministry of Justice, with which he was continually brought in contact, were
                        most cordial, and all British and Egyptian officials who were privileged to
                        make his acquaintance found in him not only an erudite scholar, but an able
                        and liberal-minded man of affairs. That he should have made enemies was
                        inevitable. The path of the reformer in the East is strewn with thorns, and
                        the last two years of the Grand Mufti’s life were to some extent embittered
                        by the intrigues of which he was made a victim, and which culminated in the
                        denunciation of his father-in-law to the Turkish authorities in Syria. This
                        blow undoubtedly hastened the end of the distinguished Sheikh, who had
                        already been compelled to resign his position in the administration of the
                        University of Al Azhar through an ignoble intrigue in which certain
                        prominent Nationalists played an unworthy part. His ideas were perhaps too
                        far in advance of the times to have been appreciated by the mass of his
                        co-religionists, he was perhaps too careless of the feelings of the
                        religious conservatives of Islam, and his influence among the Moslems of
                        India and the Near East aroused jealousy in Egypt and suspicion in Turkey.
                        But his deeds will bear fruit in the future ; a new school of cultured and
                        Liberal Moslems may yet do him honor, and his “Nationalist’’ opponents will
                        blush one day to remember their attacks on a straightforward man who did
                        more for the mental and spiritual life of the modern Egyptians than any
                        other Moslem of his day. A worthy successor to Sheikh Mohamed Abdou will not
                        easily be found. </p>

                        <p> We deeply regret to announce the death, which took place at Seffer,
                            Ramleh, at 5.15 p.m. yesterday, of Sheikh Mobamed Abdou, Grand Mufti of
                            Egypt. The deceased, who succumbed to cancer of the liver, had been
                            ailing for some considerable time past, but it was only within the past
                            week that fears were entertained of a fatal issue. Indeed, it was Sheikh
                            Mohamed Abdou's intention to have left a week or two ago on a voyage to
                            Europe and Morocco. However, “Man proposes and God disposes,’’ and the
                            sheikh who has done so much, and seemed destined to do so much more, for
                            the enlightenment of his co-religionists has passed away at the
                            comparatively early age of 57 years. His death will be deeply mourned,
                            not only by the Moslems in Egypt, and indeed throughout the East, but by
                            a large number of friends and admirers of other faiths. </p>
                        <p>The deceased’s body, which is to be interred at Cairo, was removed this
                            morning from Mohamed Bay Rasim’s house at Seffer station, where he died,
                            and conveyed by tram-car to the Ramleh Railway terminus, where it
                            arrived at 10 o’clock. On its arrival there the body was met by all the
                            notables who were able to be present, among whom we noticed the Acting

                        <p>This train left at 11 a.m. for Cairo, where it was due to arrive at 2
                            p.m. Among those who accompanied the mortal remains of the late Grand
                            Mufti to the Capital were Mohamed Shakir, Sheik el-Ulema, and the other
                            ulema of Alexandria, besides the family and relatives of the deceased,
                            who had come down from Cairo to be present with him at the end. On their

                            the usual ceremony, after which the interment will take place at El

                            received the final certificate of the “Alimieh.” He was appointed editor

                            mutineers of the revolution, was exiled and condemned in 1882. Going to
                            Beyrout, he there married the daughter of Sheikh Hamada. At Beyrout he
                            engaged in religious and theological studies, and was finally pardoned
                            in 1892. Shortly after arriving in Egypt he became judge of the Court of
                            First Instance at Benha and afterwards at Zagazig. He was then promoted
                            to a judgeship in the Native Court of Appeal. In June, 1899, he was
                            appointed Grand Mufti of Egypt by H.H, the Khedive in place of Sheikh
                            Hassouna el Nawawi, and was a member of the Council of Administration of
                            Al Azhar from 1894 until his retirement recently. </p>

                        <head>NILE BRIDGES.</head>
                        <p>We learn that no project for the construction of a bridge from Boulac to
                            Ghezireh has as yet been decided upon, but the question is receiving
                            full consideration at the hands of the officials of the Public Works
                            Department, who recognise the great advantage to be derived by direct
                            communication with Ghezireh by the continuation of Boulac road by means
                            of bridge. Soundings have been taken and various schemes have been
                            examined, but no decision can be arrived at until the return of the many
                            Government officials who are at present away on leave. We also learn
                            that an offer for the supply of funds has been made by a local
                            syndicate. We are unable to learn the terms upon which this offer was
                            made, but the acceptance of it is, we understand, very doubtful.</p>
                        <p>Before any such scheme can be finally fixed upon we anticipate seeing the
                            work of widening the Kasr el Nil Bridge started, and this will be a
                            great advantage for its present width makes it altogether inadequate for
                            the immense amount of traffic which passes over it. The work will, we
                            understand, be commenced before the completion of the bridge at present
                            in course of construction at Rodah, and therefore there will be no means
                            of decreasing the traffic, which will of necessity become much more
                            congested by the space which will be sacrificed to the work of widening.
                            Would it not be better to delay the alteration of the Kasr el Nil Bridge
                            until such time as there is another bridge to relieve the traffic to
                            some extent ?</p>

                        <p>The number of feddans of land under cotton cultivation in the Behera
                            attacked by the cotton worm amounted on the 8th inst. to no less than
                            40,443. The largest infected area is in the markazes of Teh el Baroud
                            and Kafr Dawar, and the number of boys available in these markazes
                            having been exhausted, reinforcements were drafted in from Sheibrakhit
                            and Damanhour. It having, however, been found that the total number of
                            corvéables in the whole province was no longer sufficient to cope with
                            the pest, the Ministry of the Interior authorised the importation of 800
                            boys from Gharbieh, and within 24 hours of the reception of the order
                            the whole number was despatched and placed at the disposal of the Moudir
                            of Behera. It is hoped that the total number now engaged in Behera
                            province, more than 50,273, will suffice to deal with the eggs as fast
                            as they are laid and avert the possibility of serious damage. </p>

                            this company is to facilitate the exportation of the products of
                            Thessaly to Egypt and Turkey. It is announced also that negotiations
                            have been opened for the purchase of three new steamers of 5,000 tons
                            each, with a speed of from 15 to 17 knots. </p>

                        <head>THE MAKING OF THE SUDAN.</head>
                        <p>A little while ago a paragraph in “The African World” announced the fact
                            that the Suakin Railway would be completed early next year. Subsequent
                            advices show that the work of construction is being pushed ahead with
                            commendable energy. The value of the line to the Sudan and its
                            population cannot be over-estimated. It will carry goods from Khartoum
                            to the sea in twenty-four hours, where six days are now required for
                            transportation along the 1,500 miles of rail and river between the Sudan
                            and the Egyptian ports. The advantages of the new arrangement are so
                            manifest as hardly to need mention. It is safe to say that no single
                            factor will contribute so largely to the development of the great
                            territory won from the Mahdi. The Sudan is capable of great
                            fruitfulness. Cotton and grain it should produce in abundance. But
                            markets are essential. The Suakin Railway provides the shortest cut to
                            the markets, which, without that or another railway, might, so far as
                            the Sudan is concerned, as well be non-existent. ("African World") </p>

                        <head>A PORT SAID NUISANCE.</head>
                        <p>A Port Said correspondent writes:—One wonders how long the suffering
                            inhabitants of Port Said will pot up with the incessant whistling from
                            steamers and tugs. There is no reason for it, the signals are
                            meaningless and not in conformity with the International Code; they are
                            also misleading. The Germans are the worst offenders, but they cannot
                            take a ship in or out of port without music. Once upon a time a steamer
                            that whistled for her agent had to wait half-an-hour after the last
                            performance, but that good rule has dropped into abeyance. In Australia,
                            Japan, Hong Kong, etc., anybody can indulge in the luxury of waking the
                            town up with the whistle, but he has to pay a heavy fine for his fun,
                            and there is no reason why it should not be same at Port Said. Steamers
                            also leave their masthead and sidelights on when fast to the buoys in a
                            most casual manner, so that it is impossible to tell if they are under
                            weigh or not: this will lead to a serious accident some day. </p>

                            <p>The committee have decided to consider the races for Earopean horses,
                                announced for next year, as sufficiently filled, and they will take
                                place as published subject as below. In consequence, however, of
                                these races not having received quite as much support as was hoped
                                they will all be left open until the 1st October next and other
                                subscriptions can be taken before that date. Existing subscriptions
                                will hold good. </p>
                            <p>Unless 20 subscriptions are received for the Continental Stakes, the
                                stakes will be reduced to L.E. 250, of which L.E. 30 to the 2nd and
                                L.E. 20 to the 3rd horse. Subscription L.E. 5 and nomination L.E. 5
                                on 1st December 1905. </p>
                            <p>The stakes in Lord of Rosna Stakes, Centenary Handicap, and
                                International Handicap will in any case remain as published. </p>
                            <p>The National Stakes for Arabs and E.C.B.’s, Class II., will also be
                                left open till 1st October, 1905, and if by that date at least 10
                                subscriptions have not been received the stakes will be slightly
                                altered, viz.: L.E. 100 to the 1st horse with a sweepstakesof L.E. 2
                                to go to 2nd horse. Subscriptions and nominations to remain as at

                        <head>ON THE HEDJAZ RAILWAY.</head>
                        <byline> BY P. P. G.</byline>
                        <head type="sub">VIII.</head>
                        <p>While I walked about the slopes N. of Ma’ân and watched the trains
                            steaming out with railway material, sleepers, rails, ballast, and so
                            forth to carry on the line to the south, I suddenly noticed that it was
                            growing strangely dark and that a brutally cold wind had sprung up. I
                            next discovered that it was raining half a mile away and that the rain
                            was moving rapidly in my direction. There was no sort of shelter
                            anywhere near me : I was a good mile from the station, the nearest tents
                            were a good half-mile away, and it struck me that a European rushing
                            into a tent might cause considerable surprise and annoyance to its
                            occupants. In this I was mistaken for there were several Italian workmen
                            at Ma’ân, and soldiers were quite familiar with the sight of Europeans,
                            but had I thus sought refuge the chances were in favor of my getting
                            into a tent where Turkish women were quartered and causing a panic among
                            their spouses. One always does the wrong thing under such circumstances,
                            and after my experience with the tinned meat I had no desire to tempt
                            fortune any farther. </p>
                        <p>The rain arrived while I was looking aimlessly about me, preceded by a
                            violent gale that caught up all the dust in the desert for the rain
                            which followed it to lay again. Then came the rain and soaked me to the
                            skin but brought its recompense with it. While I ran down a gully
                            looking for some cleft or projecting rock where I could take cover, I
                            put up two gazelles which dashed like the wind across the wadi,
                            disappeared over a slope, and appeared again a moment later like two
                            brown flecks on the black plain that ran eastward. </p>
                        <p>When I got back to the station I found a Circassian, who was helping the
                            Greek station-master, and would no doubt become a station-master himself
                            one day. He frowned and made fearful grimaces, which were emphasised by
                            the rugged ferocity of his features, over what appeared to be a piece of
                            simple addition. M. Nikola, the station-master, turned to me from time
                            to time with a resigned gesture of amused contempt while his
                            subordinate, gripping the pen as if it were a dagger, made error after
                            error, which he corrected with the aid of sand and a stout penknife. M.
                            Nikola ordered tea with lemons (Ma’ân supplies no milk) and we drank,
                            the Circassian in particular disposing of several cups and dipping his
                            pen into ink or tea with a sublime indifference. </p>
                        <p>The station-master was called away, the Circassian put away his papers,
                            eyed me, and then said something ending in—orsun. I took it to mean “can
                            you speak Tarkish” and replied in my best kitchen Arabic, that splendid
                            language spoken by Englishmen to their Egyptian servants and learnt from
                            the industrious Berberin, who, as everyone knows has <hi rend="italic"
                                >such</hi> a good pronunciation of Arabic. To my joy the Tcherkess
                            answered me in equally bad and simple Arabic, and we conversed with
                            numerous pauses while we wrestled with the right phrases that refused to
                            be uttered or even remembered. A soldier from Aleppo grinned at our
                            Arabic solecisms and threw in a word now and again. </p>
                        <p>Yes ! I came from Egypt and Aziz Effendim from—well, I doubt if he knew
                            himself. He had been in Egypt, had seen the Zoological Gardens, where an
                            elephant had impressed him, and knew the Mousky quarter. He also had
                            been to a theatre in the Esbekieh. Fearing “startling disclosures” I
                            changed the subject and asked him how he liked Egypt . . but alas ! he
                            absolutely refused to puff the British Occupation or say a word for the
                            Agency. The utmost he would allow was that Lord Cromer was skilled in
                            “politika.” For him Egypt was a hopeless place where you could not ride
                            about after the manner of Hybrias the Cretan, armed and overbearing, and
                            where fighting was forbidden. His brother had been as far as Italy and
                            had fought a duel there. He himself had been to Aleppo, where the people
                            were like mules, bastards, neither Turk nor Arab (this to the address of
                            the Halebi soldier), and thieves. He had been at Diarbekir and Kharpat
                            in the time of the troubles, where he killed three Armenians with his
                            revolver while they ran, and “we destroyed all of them and burnt their
                            houses.” Inshallah, there would be a war with the Bulgarians soon. As
                            for the Ingliz, why did they wish to take Arabia and sell guns to the
                            rebels? This to my address.</p>

                    <p>Few things are more remarkable in the intellectual development of the last
                        quarter of a century than the growth of archæology as a serious study, no
                        longer to be regarded, like Latin verses, as an elegance or added charm to
                        scholarship. It has altered the whole attitude of men’s minds towards
                        antiquity, and, to seek an analogy in a widely different quarter, may be
                        compared to the substitution of oral evidence for affidavits in the Court of
                        Chancery. The ancient tomb or inscription, statue or remains of a temple,
                        like the living word of the witness, are more likely to tell the truth than
                        any writing. In no department has the progress been more striking than in
                        Egyptology. A few years ago there was at most one exhibition in the year for
                        showing the work done ; now there are always two or three, and the progress
                        has been so great as to make necessary a division of labour. Thus there is
                        now open, for a month, in the library of the Society of Biblical Arcbæology,
                        37, Great Russell street, London, a most interesting display of antiquities,
                        mainly from the eleventh dynasty temple at Deire, Bahari, found daring last
                        season’s work by Dr. Edouard Naville and Mr. Hall. This funerary temple of
                        King Neb-hapet-Ra Meutuhetep (ILL) was discovered in the preceding season,
                        1903 4, and lies to the south of the great temple built by Queen Hatshepsu.
                        Two thirds of it have now been cleared away, and it is hoped that further
                        search may disclose the pyramid tomb of the King himself, which was called
                        Akh-asset, “Glorious are its seats.” From the site the explorers have been
                        allowed to bring home— for distribution among various museums — many
                        valuable, though fragmentary, remains. Had they been more perfect they would
                        perforce have been retained m Egypt. They are of exceptional interest as
                        including specimens of high relief work of which no other examples appear to
                        be extant, and they belong to tho eleventh dynasty, of which we had very
                        little knowledge. These remains have, in fact, opened a new chapter of
                        Egyptian art. The craftsmen of Egypt, like the architects of medieval
                        Cathedrals, are usually unknown by name ; but in this instance the name of
                        the chief artist has come down to us. He was Mertisen, who describes himself
                        on his tombstone as a master of artistic skill which he handed down to his
                        son. It is thought that he was the inaugurator of a new birth of Egyptian
                        art, just as his master, Neb-hap8t-Ra Mentuhetep, was the refounder of the
                        Egyptian kingdom under the headship of the Thebans. Of another King,
                        Usertsen III., three massive statues of black granite—mutilated, it is true,
                        but not to such an extent as to conceal the character of the face—are shown.
                        They represent him at different periods of his life, with a face rather of a
                        European than of an Egyptian or Semitic type. 'The mouth is large, but the
                        lips are thin and firm, and the nose would appear to have been somewhat
                        aquiline. The ears are of enormous size. What appears to be the earliest
                        instance of the newly-discovered eleventh dynasty style of high coloured
                        relief is the seated portrait figure of a Queen or priestess named Nefer
                        shushusa. There are also other similar figures—one with a flower in the left
                        hand, and another smelling a flower. A relief of a King holding the hand of
                        a Queen seems to commemorate a chief of the hunters of the desert by its
                        peculiarly cut inscription. From the shrine of the priestesses comes another
                        high relief sculpture of a man who is represented with the person below him
                        as walking in the temple. The remarkable feature of this fragment is a
                        “proto-Doric” octagonal column, and the whole affords interesting evidence
                        of the actual appearance of the columns of the ambulatory surrounding the
                        pyramid» To the left are two fragments showing the hinder parts of a dog and
                        of a man binding a bull for sacrifice, and above is one of the sacred cows
                        of Hathor licking her calf. Pieces of purely Theban work are two fragments
                        from scenes representing King Mentuhetep and his wife. On the right-hand one
                        is seen the upper part of tho Royal crown, and the beautifully carved
                        hieroglyphs and the wonderful prdservation of colour give singular interest
                        and charm to these remains. The inscriptions refer to the Qneen (Aashait). A
                        complete slab of this type is kept back in the Cairo Museum. A variety of
                        other objects assignable to this period are also shown—the King overthrowing
                        an Aamn, warriors armed with axes, boatmen, and reliefs of animals. The
                        drawing of the latter, notably a flamingo, is marvellously free and
                        accurate. </p>
                    <p>The specimens of later dynasties are of no inferior value and interest. The
                        most beautiful, perhaps, of the objects displayed is an alabaster head of a
                        cow, ascribed to the eighteenth dynasty. The sculpture is wonderfully true
                        to life. The eyes were inlaid with lapis, of which traces remain, and the
                        ears and horns were probably of silver. The cow was probably from a figure
                        of the goddess Hathor, dedicated in the Hathor shrine of the Great Temple. A
                        portion of a large funerary stela commemorates Userhat, priest of the
                        deceased Kings Amen-hotep III. and Tut-ankh-amen, and his wife, the singer
                        of Amen, Nefretari. These are ascribed to the early nineteenth dynasty.There
                        is also a great number of smaller objects— beads,blue-glazed faience, vases,
                        hieratic ostraka containing lists of names, accounts, letters, a literary
                        text, and a list of hieroglyphs which may have been school exercises. It
                        remains to b3 said that Dr. Borchardt contributes a series of very beautiful
                        photographs of the temple, and that Mme. Naville has made some admirable
                        coloured drawings of cows from the eleventh dynasty sarcophagi. It is
                        somewhat curious that the draghtsmanship displayed in work presumably of the
                        same age is very unequal. Some of the cows are freely and nataralistically
                        drawn, whilst others are conventional to the degree of being almost wooden.

                            the Aliens Bill. That is the third full Parliamentary day devoted to the
                            Committee on this measure, and the House has not reached the middle of
                            the first clause. The amendments have been uniformly directed to making
                            the Bill unworkable, or intolerably cumbrous. It is merely a measure of
                            police for the protection of ratepayers from burdens which ought not to
                            be placed upon them, of English workmen from being crowded out of home
                            and employment by some of the lowest populations of Europe, and of
                            society at large from persons incapable of making good citizens. It is
                            constantly treated by the Opposition as if it were an invasion of the
                            rights of man and an attack upon the privileges of persons more worthy
                            of our care than the subjects of the King. </p>

                        <p>The Radicals find themselves in a dilemma, which, as usual, they have
                            made for them selves ; as a witty lady said at the beginning of the last
                            century, “I’ve often heard of people running their heads against stone
                            walls, but I never knew of any but the Whigs who built stone walls to
                            run their heads against” No Radical supports. in ' theory the strange
                            anomaly by which one Member of Parliament represents what may be called
                            a, one-vote power, while another, with only the same privileges in the
                            House of Commons, stands for a ten-vote power. Radicals are mostly
                            ideologues, and equal electoral districts would best coincide with their
                            absurd theories about the literal equality of men, and for that matter
                            of women and men. Why not of men, women, and children Î Therefore, they
                            cannot conscientiously oppose the principle of redistribution. </p>

                            some member would ask for a return showing the number of officers

                            troops in the command, on the one hand, in each British command, and, on

                            That return, we suspect, would astonish the House of Commons even more

                        <p> The suggestion which has been made—it may almost be called a threat—that
                            certain highly placed officials should be impeached, under certain
                            circumstances, in connection with the War Stores scandal, at once takes
                            us back to the days of an earlier generation. One had imagined that
                            Warren Hastings was the last great example of a great impeachment. To
                            day he affair would be less picturesque and dramatic, if not essentially
                            less tragic. Tho galaxy of oratorical talent that made that protracted
                            trial so astounding has passed with the classics from the House of
                            Commons, and oratory as an art is on the down grade. There is, of
                            course, the possibility that an impeachment might serve to revive this
                            lost art, though the possibility lends no sufficient attracting* to the

                                deep impression in Paris, has appeared in the “Echo de Paris.” He
                                says that France is willing to conclude an understanding with
                                Germany, because that implies a régime of peace, but she will not
                                conclude an alliance with her, because that involves chances of war
                                contrary to the interests of France. M. Delafosse then inquires what
                                the German Emperor had to reproach France with as regards Morocco.
                                His answer is, absolutely nothing. The German Emperor demanded in
                                haughty terms the territorial integrity of Morocco, the independence
                                of the Sultan, and the open door. But those three points were
                                distinctly accepted in the text of the Franco English Agreement.

                            <p>The “Cologne Gazette” declares that in view of the reservations with

                                lesson of the “Franco-German incident” is described as being that
                                “reforms in Morocco can only be achieved by means of an
                                international understanding aid not by the initiative of a single

                        PEOPLE.</head>
                    <p>Though sharing the traditional reluctance of our old nobility to emerge from
                        aristocratic privacy and come before the public-as the subject of a
                        newspaper article, the Right Hon. Lady Haldon has expressly permitted the
                        publication of a statement recently made to a representative of the Press
                        regarding her wonderful cure by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. </p>
                    <p>Recognising that the words of a titled lady in her position must necessarily
                        bear great' weight with the public, and earnestly <figure>

                        </figure> desiring that the benefits she had derived from Dr. Williams’ Pink
                        Pills should be publicly acknowledged. Lady Haldon waived all personal
                        reluctance and told a story which cannot but impress every reader.</p>
                    <p>‘For the sake of all sufferers,” said her ladyship, “I want to tell you what
                        Dr. Williams* Pink "Pills for Pale People did for me when I had given up all
                        hope, after tho best professional treatment. </p>
                    <p>‘I have been a great traveller. Five years ago, when residing Tn Australia,
                        my heart became seriously affected. Symptoms of advanced Anaemia showed
                        themselves. One of the results was most acute Indigestion. I suffered
                        severely in the back and under the shoulder blades, including an especially
                        severe oppression of the chest. The most careful diet brought no relief.
                        Even after a glass of water my discomfort was almost unbearable. Food of any
                        kind caused me snob misery that I ate less and less, till I was practically
                        starving myself. In walking the shortest distance palpitations of the heart
                        would make me feel as though I were suffocating. </p>
                    <p>“As anæmia developed I grew alarmingly ill ; I could not sleep at night ; my
                        whole system was deranged. My nerves broke down, my bead ached constantly,
                        until my eyesight became affected. </p>
                    <p> “My illness seemed so deeply rooted that I determined to go to the Clinique
                        de la Caroline, in Switzerland, where I was attended by eminent physicians. </p>
                    <p>“But about August, 1903, while I was travelling by train and nearly prostrate
                        with one <cb n="4"/> of my attacks, I casually picked up a small pamphlet
                        referring to Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People. I became so
                        interested in some cures mentioned therein that I determined to give a trial
                        to this medicine.</p>
                    <p>“Within three days I was astonished at the marvelous improvement. I procured
                        further boxes of the pills, and very soon I was delighted to find that all
                        traces of my complaint had practically vanished. </p>
                    <p> “I could now walk long distances with an entire freedom from pain. My
                        appetite had returned with a heartiness that surprised me, and my general
                        health was suoh as I had not enjoyed for many years.” </p>
                    <p>In every class of society the curative powers of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
                        have been proved repeatedly in diseases arising from too little or
                        impoverished blood. For men as well as women they are invaluable in Anæmia,
                        Indigestion, excessive weakness, Decline, Consumption, Rheumatism, Sciatica,
                        Paralysis, Locomotor Ataxy, Nervous Disorders. Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co.,

                        <p>Encore une fillette qui vient de se noyer sur la plage de l’Ibrahimieh.
                            Des familles entières ne sachant plus où aller prennent leur bain aux
                            extrémités de Kaït Bey et de Silsileh. On peut même voir la file des
                            baignants se continuer jusqu’au Sporting Club. Aussi peut-on piévoir
                            pour la saison d’été une série d’accidents dont la Municipalité aura sa
                            part de responsabilité, puisqu’en s’opposant à la reconstruction de
                            bains au Port-Est elle force la population à faire usage d’emplacements
                            dangereux. </p>
                        <p>En effet, tandis que les fonctionnaires municipaux s’empressent
                            d’accorder des centaines de concessions pour l’occupation de voies
                            publiques où la circulation est déjà trop entravée, ils opposent une
                            indifférence et meme une hostilité systématique à tous ceux qui
                            demandent l’autorisation d’installer des établissement de bains. Dans le
                            premier cas, l’employé ne se contente pas d’accorder la concession, il
                            va lui-même chez le concessionnaire lui porter ses papiers ; dans le
                            second, au contraire l’entrepreneur ne rencontre que des tracasseries :
                            le gouvernorat le renvoie à la Municipalité, celle-ci aux gardes côtes,
                            ceux-ci à la Douane, aux Ports et Phares, aux bâtiments de l’Etat, aux
                            Ministères etc., tant et si bien que l’entrepreneur découragé renonce à
                            son dessein. Et cependant une concession de bains rapporte plus au
                            budget qu’une concession de trottoirs. Pourquoi donc cette différence
                            d’attitude de la part de la Municipalité ? Serait ce que les concessions
                            de la voie publique rapportent davantage a ses fonctionnaires ? </p>
                        <p>On le dit. En attendant le public souffre de la privation de bains.
                            Certains n’hésitent même pas à courir les dangers de la plage libre.

                        <p>Décidément l’Administration Municipale se moque des contribuables ; non
                            seulement elle a rendu impossible la promenade près de la mer, mais
                            encore toute promenade en ville. La poussière des terrassements couvre
                            Alexandrie d’un manteau, qui, avec le degré d’humidité dont nous
                            souffrons actuellement, forme une espèce de colle. L’administration,
                            fidèle à ses principes, fait la sourde oreille à toutes les
                            réclamations, mais elle n’oublie pas de percevoir le 2 % <hi
                                rend="italic">manu-militari</hi>. Il ne nous reste donc plus qu’à
                            faire un appel aux pompiers qui ont donné plusieurs fois des preaves de
                            leur zèle. Ils peuvent aisément avec une pompe arroser en quelques jours
                            toute cette surface avec de l’eau de mer. </p>

                        <p>Si les Alexandrins au plus fort de la canicule sont privés de bains,
                            exposés à des rafales de poussière, empoisonnés par les bouches d’égout,
                            ils peuvent du moins se féliciter de nourrir à leurs frais d’heureux
                            fonctionnaires et de leur payer des congés annuels de trois mois et demi
                            pour se reposer de travaux qu’ils n’ont point faits et échapper pendant
                            les mois les plus pénibles à l’abominable situation qu’ils ont créée à
                            Alexandrie. Dernièrement encore un simple farache était proposé par la
                            Délégation pour des vacances officielles ! Il est à souhaiter dans de
                            telles conditions que la Municipalité arrive à un tel développement des
                            emplois municipaux qu’il y ait place pour toute la population. On
                            habitera l’hiver des villas à Ramleh et on ira passer l’été en Europe.
                            La ville vulgaire sera abandonnée aux étrangers avec tous ses
                            accessoires, le quai, le tout l’égout, les plages de Kaït Bey et de

                        présidence de M. Amb. A. Ralli. </p>
                    <p>Présents MM. Ahmed Bey Eyoub, P. Fenderl, Dr G. Valensin, G. Zervudachi,
                        Soliman Bey Abani, Dr Schiess Bey, membres, I Sedky Bey, secrétaire. </p>
                    <p>La Délégation autorise la Compagnie de Ramleh à installer un kiosque au
                        terminus de la ligne de la gare de Ramleh, à titre provisoire, pour la durée
                        d’une année, moyennant paiement des droits règlementaires. </p>
                    <p>Communication est donnée d’une lettre du 4 Juillet du Ministère de
                        l’Intérieur informant que le Gouvernement regrette qu’il n’y ait pas
                        possibilité de déferer au désir de la Municipalité au sujet du débarquement
                        des bovidés provenant de Russie et de la Macédoine, à Chatby, pour y purger
                        la quarantaine, vu qu’il n’y a pas d’autre emplacement disponible pour
                        servir au débarquement des bovidés susvisés. </p>
                    <p>Le Ministère remet copie d’un règlement contenant certaines dispositions
                        relatives au transport des animaux en question. </p>
                    <p>La Délégation tout en émettant un avis favorable aux dispositions prises en
                        vue d’un meilleur traitement des bêtes, espère que la mesure ne sera que
                        provisoire, vu les grandes objections soulevées par elle au choix de
                        l’emplacement précité. </p>
                    <p>Interpellé au sujet d’une question touchant l’application de l’art. 4 de la
                        loi organique municipale relativement à la confection des listes
                        électorales, le Gouvernement est d’avis qu’il y a lieu de continuer à faire
                        figurer dans les listes 1. les occupants de bureaux, magasins, chounahs,
                        aussi bien que les occupants de maisoin d’habitation 2. de cumuler, pour

                        d’habitation et des bureaux ou magasins, ou des différents magasins occupés
                        par la même personne et dûment inscrits en son nom. </p>
                    <p>La Délégation renvoie cet avis au comité de révision, qui l’avait provoqué. </p>
                    <p>Communication est donnée d’une lettre du 7 juillet du Département des Travaux
                        Publics relative à l’ouverture de nuit des ponts du Mahmoudieh et des

                    <p>La Délégation adjuge à M. Pizzolante Francesco di Luigi et Hag Saad Sabla, au

                        dans la nécropole ptolémaïque de Chatby. </p>
                    <p>La Délégation proposera à la Commission l’ouverture d’un crédit de LE. 260
