                    <head>"TO EMPIRE VIA DENISHWAI."</head>
                    <p>The appearance of Mr. Wilfred Scawen Blunt's "Secret History of the
                        Occupation of Egypt" and the first anniversary of the Denishwai incident
                        appear to have afforded further material for a fresh tirade by those who are
                        anxious to prove, and would be proyd if they could do so, that England's
                        administration of Egypt has been morally detrimental to both countries, and
                        that we are occupying a country which it is our bounden duty to leave to its
                        own devices. We do not refer to the Nationalist Press of Egypt, headed by
                        Mustapha Kamel, for ever since the appearance of the English and French
                        "Standards" we hąve been surfeited with "Denishwai," and our worthy
                        oontemporary appears to delight in vain reiterations on that subject. A bas
                        les Anglais is the Pasha's motto, for <cb n="6"/> he realises that as long
                        as we remain here, his power and inflaence in the country will be
                        infinitesimal. He should also realise, how. ever, that under no
                        circumstances could we grant a constitution to a country which would give
                        himself and his colleagnes any power. So long as the national party chooses
                        to be represented by an irrational press, they must be content to be
                        considered as pseudo-patriots.</p>
                    <p>We will refrain from again pointing out what immense benefits the greatest
                        Pro-Consul of the era and his loyal supporters and assistants | have
                        bestowed upon the country, but we might remark that having put our hand to
                        the plough we are not going to turn back, until the task is completed. That
                        Egypt is ready for selfgovernment is contended by few, and enge few are
                        without exception Anglophobes.</p>
                    <p>In an article appearing in the "New Age," which we reproduce in another
                        column, under | the heading of "To Empire vi&amp; Denishwai", the writer
                        endeavours to show that the British Administrators do not understand the
                        temperament of the people they are governing. Such an accusation, however,
                        is utterly confounded by the bond of friendship and genuine loyalty which
                        exist throughout the vast British Empire. In every corner of the world mal.
                        contents will be heard to give voice to imaginary grievancos, and
                        unfortunately there are always | a few who take a pride in decrying their
                        own nation, and to whom the word loyalty, the watchword of every healthy
                        nation, has no meaning</p>
                    <p>"The Denishwai picnie", says the writer of | the article in question, "is
                        diagnostic of the</p>
                    <p>most serious imperial disease - complacent | failure to understand."
                        Accepting for the moment the hypothesis that the British officers implicated
                        in the affair had caused the outrage by a lack of understanding, we still
                        fail to see how such a conclusion can be drawn from the incident. Is the
                        writer under the misap prehension that Egypt is governed by a mili tary
                        administration ? As we have remarked before, it is possible that the death
                        of Captain Bull and the brutal ill-treatment of his fellowofficers might
                        have been avoided had they stuck to their guns and made a forcible
                        resistance to the first onslaught, bụt this is very | doubtful and wonld
                        most certainly have in volved seriously wounding not a few of the natives
                        and possibly inflicting a certain loss of life on the village It was amply
                        evidenced at the trial that the villagers had pre-arranged an attack on the
                        officers ; and that five men could have defended themselves against such a
                        mob is very, very doubtful, however bold a fase they might have offered.
                        Reconciliation (for nothing) was the measure decided upon on the spur of the
                        moment by the officer in command, and the result was as we know. It must be
                        remembered, too, and this indeed, is the main point, that Lt. Col.
                        Pine-Coffin understood at the moment of his arrival on the scene of the
                        commencement of the attack, that Lt. Porter had accidentally shot the
                        younded woman, whereas she had been shot by her fellow villagers at the
                        moment when they wrested the gun away from Lt. Porter, who had put his gun
                        at "safety,"</p>
                    <p>The real facts of the case, however, are not regarded by those whom we
                        criticise, it being their ambition to prove to the world that our
                        administration of this country is unjust, hogy they may rest assured that
                        the distorted representations of the incidents apon which they base their
                        arguments are recognised by the | large majority of those who take an
                        interest</p>
                    <p>in this quarter of the globe. Both the Govern. ment and the Opposition have
                        expressed in the</p>
                    <p>highest terms their recognition of the excel. | lence of the Anglo-Egyptian
                        administration of the country, and the Seoretary for Foreign Affairs is one
                        of the strongest supporters of Lord Cromer's policy. Were we to evacuate
                        Egypt at the present moment we would incur the just blame of not only the
                        majority of Egyptians, but also of the whole of Europe, whose interests we
                        safeguard as well as those of the country and our own.</p>

                            forest lands, the authorities of the Province of Kassala have offered
                            600 feddans of forest land for free cultivation. 300 feddans have
                            already been taken up by one of the leading citizens of Kassala. The
                            couditions stipulated are that the tenant must clear at least 100
                            feddans each year and put it in a condition suitable for cultivation.
                            The Government, on its part, agrees to grant him free use of the land
                            for six years. No rents, or taxes of any sort will be collected. At the
                            termination of the six years, the land will revert to the Government.

                            such emergencies, but the speedy and powerful naval dockyard tugs were
                            soon despatched by Rear-Admiral Fisher. when news of the disaster was

                            was injured. The vessel is being lightened, and is expected to get off

                            discovered in Italy for the export of Neapolitan debutantes for Egyptian

                            agency for the white slave traffic, managed by the Mafia, and having its
                            headquarters in the City of Catania, has been exposed by the police.
                            Sixty arrests have been made. The agency has been in full working order
                            for several years. Shiploads of young Italian girls from the Southern
                            provinces have been transported to Cairo and other towns of the Orient
                            under cover of false passports. In appears that the traffic was greatly
                            facilitated through the unlimited demand for Neapolitan débutantes for

                    <p> Sir Edward Grey replying to Mr. Robertson, concerning the retirement of Mr.
                        Lambert, said that there was no ground for reflection on Mr. Dunlop's
                        conduct. In view of the growing demand on the English side of the school it
                        was necessary to promote an English professor to the vacancy.</p>
                    <p> LONDON, July 16. House of Commons. In reply to Mr. Rutherford who declared
                        that Mr. Lambert's resignation was due to differences with Mr. Dunlopand
                        demanded Mr. Dunlop's resignation, Sir E. Grey said that he understood that
                        M. Lambert resigned in conseqnence of a misunderstanding with the Ministry
                        of Instruction with reference to leave of absence. In view of | the growing
                        demand to enter the English side of the school the Egyptian Government
                        promoted one of the English professors to the vacancy. There was no ground
                        for the suggestion that the appointment was contrary to the spirit of the
                        Anglo-French agreement of 1904, and there was no reason whatever for | the

                    <p>The "Egyptian Standard" seizes the oppor. tunity of the rumoured resignation
                        of Mr. Dunlop, as given by our contemporary, to indulge in a series of
                        reflections, of which the following is an extract :- This assertion does not
                        surprise is in the least. We had foreseen it and foretold it. For, after an
                        open blunder it is rare if a British official - even if he be paid by Egypt
                        for services he never rendered her - remains long in the post he took no
                        pains to cover with glory.</p>
                    <p>Naturally it will be stated that reasons of health dictated his resignation.
                        May his health improve. It is our earnest wish. But let it improve in
                        England and not in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>And once again, in the name of the whole Egyptian people and nation, we
                        repeat the national claims : Let nobody replace Mr. Dunlop.</p>
                    <p>The moment for the abolition of the Educational Advisership has arrived. It
                        could not be more favourable.</p>

                        remarkable example of his Highness's enterprise and sagacity and deserves to
                        rank as one of the most noteworthy undertakings in the Egypt of to-day. It
                        is not long since the country between Alexandria and the Tripolitan frontier
                        was almost unknown. Few Europeans had ever traversed it, and the Bedouins of
                        the Awlad Aly tribe, who dwelt there, were notorious for their lawlessness.
                        A few years ago the Khedive's attention as an agricolturist was drawn to
                        this neglected part of Egypt, and his investments in land there induced him
                        to study the means of locomotion. His Highness first constructed a road,
                        which gave way to a line of light railway, which subsequently was
                        transformed to the existing normal gauge line, so familiar to excursionists
                        from Alexandria to Kingi Mariout, who go thither in the spring to enjoy the
                        wonderful wealth of flowers that floorish so luxuriantly after the rains of
                        winter The railway was begun seven years ago and has been carried on
                        continually westward until at the present time railhead is now 174
                        kilometres from the Alexandrian terminus of the line at Wardian. From the
                        end of the line his Highness has constructed an excellent load as far as
                        Mersa Matrouh, 287 kilometres from Alexandria. A road was originally made
                        along the route now followed by the line, but as the railway is pushed
                        forward the former means of communication, being no longer necessary, is not
                        kept in repair. The system of construction is twofold. The normal gauge
                        extends 105 kilometres from Wardian. At Taba dul (Arabic "transhipment",)
                        between Al Amied and Sidi Abdul Rahman, the work of changing from the narrow
                        to the broad gauge is proceeding at the rate of 540 metres daily. The
                        railhead of the narrow gauge line is now at 13 kilometres west of Dabbah, or
                        69 kilometres from Tabadul, and 113 kilometres remain to be laid before
                        Mersa Matrouh is reached. At the present time the rails in hand amount to
                        150 kilometres of broad and 10 of narrow gauge. The railway will not stop at
                        Mersa Matrouh but will go on to Sidi Berani and thence to the frontier at
                        Solloum. At the present time from the terminus at Wardian to railhead a vast
                        amount of work is in hand. At Wardian a new terminus is being built, which
                        will cover twenty feddans. It is to be fitted with a restaurant and all the
                        other appurtenances of an up-to-date first class railway station. Next year
                        the Khedive's line will be brought into connection with the passenger
                        traffic of the Egyptian Government Railway's terminus at Alexandria by means
                        of a line from Moueslah, the junction near Mex, to Bab-el-Ghedid station.
                        There is now a connection for goods traffic between the two railway systems.
                        A new station is to be built at Moueslah junction in the course of this year
                        in order to facilitate the connection and in January next it is hoped that
                        the first through passenger train from Bab-el-Ghedid to El Amrieh will begin
                        to run daily. A new iron bridge over the Mareotic Canal at Mexis nearly
                        finished for the broad gauge trains. Its cost was £2,500. A large engine
                        house has just been completed there. It is not only on the Alexandrian side
                        of the line that such I progress is in evidence, but all along the 161
                        kilometres of railway from Wardian to Debba the signs of development
                        continue without a break. As soon as the causeway between Lake Mareotis and
                        the Salt Lake has been passed, the line from the first three stations,
                        Abd-elKader, Amrieh, and Kingi Mariout, has | recently been endowe? with an
                        expensive new German system of semaphores for signalling. Every ten
                        kilometres along the line well-built quarters have been erected for the
                        gangers to live in. At each station there are separate platforms, for
                        passengers and goods. The Khedive is not merely going to run a line through
                        the district, but his Highness intends to run branches to suitable spots
                        where there are prospects of developing the country. For example at Kingi
                        Mariont a turn-table for engines has | been put into position as there is to
                        be a branch Aline from that station to the sea coast, as in time a seaside
                        resort for Alexandrians may come into being there. Further on at Gherbanyet
                        station a new siding has just been built for the transport of gypsum. His
                        Highness owns about four hundred feddans of gypsum-bearing land in the
                        immediate neighbourhood. At Hammam a large condensing station has only been
                        finished a few days ago at a cost of £3,500 and a similar installation is to
                        be erected at Dabba. The water, although excellent for drinking purposes at
                        Hammam is so much impregnated with lime that condensers are necessary if the
                        boilers are not to be impaired. The progress of the line necessitates the
                        sinking of wells, and a great number have been made by the Khedive. At
                        Hawarieh a well has just been sunk 35 metres deep at the cost of £800.</p>
                    <p>It is not necessary to enter into any minute detail as to the many other
                        subsidiary works which such a gigantic andertaking entails. The line has
                        already proved a success and fully justified his Highness's foresight in
                        opening up this hitherto neglected part of Egypt. All along the coast there
                        are signs that once the country was populated and the remains of ancient
                        cities are numerous, such as Taposiris and Saint Menas, and others sites
                        further to the West.</p>
                    <p>Through the Khedive's initiative the prosperity of the country is returning.
                        In ancient times the wines of Mariout were celebrated throughout the ancient
                        world, and at Kingi | Mariout his Highness has succeeded in growling
                        fortyfeddang of excellent grapes. The I barley of the country is famous and
                        olives find <cb n="4"/> a congenial soil here. Now that the railwa secures
                        easy communication with Alexandri there is every reason to believe that the
                        ancier prosperity of Mariout will return, and the firs who recognised the
                        potentialities of th: renaissance was the Khedive, whose labour are now
                        beginning to bear fruit, as the financis details of the railway, which we
                        will deal wit in another article, will amply prove.</p>

                    <p>On Tuesday morning a fire broke out i Sharia Mohamed Aly, Darb el Menaguemal
                        to which the Fire Brigade was called at 11.5 a.m. On the call being given
                        three steamer were immediately on the spot, which adjoir the fire station,
                        and in spite of the powerfu hold already obtained by the fames, con batted
                        the flames with great success consi ering the extreme difficulty of the
                        approache and the low pressure obtainable from th hydrants. Such was the
                        violence of the on break, that two floors of the tenement hous in which the
                        fire originated were practical burnt out, and the firemen had all their wor

                        which threat ened to spread in the direction of th Police School at the
                        back, in the vicinity which was an establishment with a large sto of

                        alread caught fire, but was saved by prompt measure taken by the brigade. *
                        Enormous difficulty attended the suppressic of the fire owing principally to
                        the extrem difficulty of access from the front, and th wind which caused a
                        forced draught from tl back in the open space surrounding the Poli School. A

                    <p> There are numbers of Armenians and Syrians from the United States, who have
                        settled in Egypt and other parts of the Ottoman Empire, after having
                        obtained American citizenship. All of these will be affected by the new
                        citizenship law which came into effect on July 1st.</p>
                    <p>The provision of the new law which is responsible for their worries is that
                        reading as follows:</p>
                    <p>"When any naturalised citizen shall have resided for two years in a
                        foreign-State from which he came, it shall be presumed that he has ceased to
                        be an American citizen, and his place of general abode shall be deemed his

                    <p>It is provided that such presumption may be overcome on the presentation of

                    <head>WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.<lb/>ALEXANDRIA MUNICIPALITY'S SCHEME</head>
                    <p>An interesting article appears in the June Monthly Journal" of the British
                        Chamber of Commerce for Egypt on weights and measures in Alexandria, in
                        which the writer remarks that thanks to the provisions of the Capitulations,
                        a Municipality in this country has no control over a European retailer's
                        weights and measures. It is true that if such a shopkeeper be found in the
                        possession of false weights or measures he can be prosecuted in the Mixed
                        Tribunals, but, as the maximum fine is only the nominal sum of £1, it is
                        obvious that the penalty does not act as a deterrent.</p>
                    <p>About two years ago, the Alexandria Municipality, in consequence of the
                        numerous complaints on the subject, decided to institute as an experiment a
                        system of voluntary inspection under which retailers could have their
                        weights verified bye the anthorities and certified as correct. This scheme
                        was placed before the Ministry of the Interior who replied asking the
                        Municipality cot to move further in the matter for the moment, as a much
                        wider scheme was then under the consideration of the Government. The scheme
                        is, apparently, still under consideration, for nothing tangible has been
                        done during the intervening two years, and the Municipality has, therefore,
                        decided not to wait any longer but to proceed on its own account.</p>
                    <p>It is proposed to distribute thoroughout the town standard weights and
                        measures in kilogrammes okes and metres) which will be under the control of
                        Municipality employés. The public will then be invited to have their
                        purchases weighed or measured, as the case may be, with a view to checking
                        the retailer's figures. No charge will be made to the public provided the
                        weight does not exceed 10 kilos, but, in order to protect the service
                        against abuse, a charge of one millieme per kilo will be made for each kilo
                        above ten.</p>
                    <p>Another part of the scheme consists in the stamping of shopkeepers' weights
                        and measures, and the continued inspection of the same afterwards. For this
                        purpose, in view of the Capitulations, it will be necessary for all
                        retailers wishing to avail themselves of the privilege to sign an agreement
                        authorizing the Municipal officials to enter their premises at all times to
                        verify the weights. On this undertaking being given, the shopkeeper will be
                        allowed to advertise the fact that his premises are under Municipal
                        inspection so far as his weights and measures are concerned. The stamping in
                        the first instance will, probably, be done free of charge.</p>
                    <p>It is admitted that the scheme is only a tentative one, and is merely put
                        forward by way of experiment. Although many difficulties may crop up, which
                        at the present time cannot be foreseen, the idea seems to us to be a good
                        one and a distinct step in the right direction The success of the whole

                    <p>A small Museum of Zoology has been started in connection with the Gardens,
                        and is housed for the present in the old watchmen's rooms in the north-east
                        corner of the grounds, near the lion house and African aviary. The specimens
                        are being arranged in two series : for instruction and for research.</p>
                    <p>Eventnally, it is hoped, they may be arranged in three series : -</p>
                    <p>1st. For instruction to the general public : every specimen exhibited should
                        have its definite purpose, should be good of its kind, should have all
                        available skill and care spent upon its preservation and method of
                        exhibition, and the number of specimens exhibit ed should be strictly
                        limited according to the space available ; few things are so depressing to
                        the ordinary visitor to a Museum, whether of natural history or other
                        objects, as long series of exibits all, from his point of view, practically
                        the same; this is particularly felt by that large number of visitors to
                        Museums who can spare but a short time for their visit.</p>
                    <p>2nd. For instruction to students, and all such other visitors who may have
                        the time or inclination to see more than is provided by the first series of
                        specimens.</p>
                    <p>3rd. For study and research by naturalists working at the various branches of
                        zoology this series should be large numerically, but stored in boxes or
                        cabinets, which both on account of expense as well as convenience of access
                        should occupy as small a space as is compatible with their proper
                        classification and preservation from damp, insects etc. * No specimens
                        should be admitted into the collection unless they fulfill one of the
                        following conditions</p>
                    <p>S enaste 1st. Are of such spectacular or lotal interest that they are
                        calculated to give ocular instruction to the ordinary visitor.</p>
                    <p>2nd: Illustrate the fauna of Egyptsand the Sndan.</p>
                    <p>3rd. Are of use to the staff of the menagerie for purposes of reference to
                        points of anatomy, nomenclature, variation, etc. OF</p>
                    <p>On the 31st December 1906 the collection comprised -</p>
                    <p>Exhibition Series, 9 Mammals, 17 Birds, 2 Reptiles, 4 Fish, also some Horns,
                        Eggs, Coral, etc.</p>

                    <p>Yesterday the firm of Khalifa Naggar of Cairo and a number of other brms
                        suspended payment. It is boped that if the creditors exercise forbearance
                        the serious consequences of these disasters will be greatly mitigated. We
                        are informed that if the case of Khalifa Naggar be carefully handled, the
                        creditors should get a great proportion of their money back. It is said that
                        the liabilities of Khalito, Naggar amounted to more than half a million on
                        the 14th inst. In the case of Sabal Brothers their assets are reported to be
                        superior to their liabilities. The firms, who have suspended payment besides
                        that of Naggar are Palacci Fils, Haïm and Company, Sahal Brothers, Behor
                        Hamaoui and Sons, Zananiri Elias.</p>

                    <head>THE BOURSE AND BANKING CO.OF EGYPT LIMITED.</head>
                    <p>Monsieur l'Editeur de "l'Egyptian Gazette"</p>
                    <p>En Ville. L'Association des Courtiers en valeurs dans sa séance d'hier a pris
                        une détermination au sujet du règlement des actions de cette Société, qui à
                        mon avis peut engager les diverses agences dans leurs rapports mutuels, mais
                        qui n'a aucune valeur en ce qui concerne leurs rapports avec leurs clients
                        vendeurs de ces mêmes actions. Comment peuton obliger un actionnaire qui est
                        vendeur d'une certaine quantité d'actions en vertu d'un contrat fait au mois
                        de Février, de se conformer à une décision prise an mois de Juillet ? Dans
                        aucun pays du monde la loi n'a d'effet rétroactif, et je ne vois trop quel
                        motif légitime l'on pourrait invoquer pour léser d'une façon si manifeste
                        les intérêts des actionnaires.</p>
                    <p>Il est de notoriété publique qu'à un certain moment les actions de la Bourse
                        and Banking ont été poussées par les agissements de certains spéculateurs à
                        des prix nullement en rapport ni à la valeur intrinsèque du titre, ni à la
                        situation du marché | financier, qui donnait déjà des signes non équivoques
                        de crise. Il résulte en outre de source autorisée, que les paquets d'actions
                        achetés par ces spéculateurs étaient cédés par MM. les administrateurs à des
                        cours variant entre £ 1 et 23. Par la combinaison adoptée par l'Association
                        des Courtiers ce sont donc ces Messieurs qui viendraient à bénéficier d'un
                        arrangement auquel en toute équité ils ne devraient pas participer. Il ne
                        faut pas oublier que ces Messieurs, par leur coupable négligence ont permis
                        qu'une Société fondée au mois de Février, I'put gaspiller dans l'espace de 4
                        mois un capital de £ 130,000. Eh ! bien, ne vous semble-t-il pas étrange que
                        le jour que l'on nous propose un arrangement ils soient les premiers à en
                        tirer un avantage ? En effet, supposez un souscripteur qui a vendu 100
                        Actions au prix de £ 13 ; par l'arrangement décidé il ne toucherait que £
                        37). Par contre, un administrateur qui s'est défait de ses actions, ou du
                        moins d'une bonne partie, à un cours minimum de £ 13, touche en vendant 100
                        Actions une somme de £ 75. Je trouve que l'Association des courtiers, avant
                        de prendre une délibération aussi grave, aurait dû s'assurer que les
                        administrateurs ne profitaient pas d'un seul centime d'un état de choses
                        dont ils sont seuls responsables, et pour lequel dans tout autre pays, ils
                        auraient peut-être encourus les rigueurs de la loi. Veuillez agréer,
                        Monsieur l'Editeur, etc.</p>

                    <head>A COPTIC GRAMMAR</head>
                    <p>The Coptic Grammar of Father A. Mallon of the Society of Jesus, å description
                        of which was given in " The Egyptian Gazette" some two years ago, has met
                        with such success that a second edition has been called for, and has qust
                        been published by the Imprimerie Catholique of Beyrout. The new edition does
                        not Hiffer very widely from its predecessor, but Pére Mallon has embodied
                        all the corrections und valuable additions which Coptic scholars have in
                        their reviews or by personal communimation suggested to him. The grammar and
                        the supplementary Chrestomathy of specimens of Coptic literature is founded
                        upon the Boharic variant of the Coptic language, and to prevent confusion in
                        the student's mind between its vocabulary and the Sahidic, everything
                        concerning the latter has in this edition been separated, and is printed
                        together in the portion of the Grammar treating of Morphology. For a full
                        knowledge of the Sahidic, however, scholars will turn to the Coptic Grammar,
                        of Steindorf, which is based upon the Sahidic: "The Chrestomathy of texts is
                        in the new edition augmented by no less than 35 pages presenting the history
                        of Joseph as contained Gin Exodus 39-44. This is given from a Paris
                        manuscript, but that is carefully collatmed with another at Rome, and all
                        the variants given. For this comparison Père Mallon is indebted to Professor
                        M. J. Guidi, who has for the purpose devoted much time to this work in the
                        Vatican library. The most praiseworthy portion of the supplement to the
                        grammar is the splendid bibliography extending to over 50 pages and
                        referring to every treatise, essay and monogrraph upon every dialect of
                        Coptic; this is undoubtedly the most complete catalogue of Coptic studies in
                        existence. In cases where an "editio princeps' of great importance is
                        specified, such as the "Acta Pauli" of Carl Schmidt at Heidelberg, the most
                        important reviews of the edition are also enumerated. This bibliography
                        indicates the existence of Coptic manuscripts in out ofthe-way places,
                        inaccessible to European stirdents. Forinstance, it appears that a long
                        Coptic papyrus containing the laws and rules governing the great monastery
                        of Saint Phoibanon at Jémé is now in the Museum of the University of Kazan.
                        Whilst the grammar is principally one for the Boharic dialect, specimens of
                        texts in other versions are given, and are excellently arranged for the
                        purpose of comparison. Thus, part of the 5th chapter of Zachariah is printed
                        in the Sahidic and Achminic as well as Boharic; Isaiah 1 in the latter and
                        in Sahidic and Fayoumic are provided, whilst portions of Isaiah 23 are given
                        in Boharic and Memphitic. A vocabulary of all Sahidic words to be found in
                        the specimen texts of that dialect printed in the Grammar is provided, as
                        well as the very complete Boharic dictionary printed as accompaniment to the
                        Grammar.</p>
                    <p>Whilst it is reasonable to suppose that the richest part of the harvest of
                        Egyptian, Greek and Latin papyri has now been gathered, there can be no
                        doubt but that thousands of Coptic manuscripts will yet be discovered in
                        Egypt, preserved in the ruins of old houses or in the cemeteries of
                        Christian Egypt, and anyone desiring to acquire an adequate knowledge of
                        Coptic to edit and study the new texts, which will certainly in many cases
                        embody most valuable literature, cannot do better than master Père Mallon's
                        excellent grammar.</p>

                    <p>In this new novel by the author of "The Scarlet Pimpernel," we are taken into
                        a very wonderful country indeed, among the lost people of ancient Egypt, who
                        are supposed by the author not to have perished from the face of the earth,
                        but to have a kingdom of their own to-day. This kingdom, "the world
                        forgetting, by the world forgot," is supposed to be situated among steep
                        mountains beyond the inaccessible sand dunes that surround the Libyan
                        desert.</p>
                    <p>The period that undoubtedly followed the | death of Quen Neib-akrib and the
                        close of the sixth dynasty is practically a blank to Egypt ologists. It
                        marks the elose of the old empire, strangers appear to have overrun Egypt,
                        and for four centuries the history of ancient Egypt is unknown. Neither
                        tombs not temples mark the changes and vicissitudes which befel this
                        wonderful people who built the great pyramids and carved the Sphinx. | It is
                        the descendants of those people, retaining their ancient langnage and
                        customs, among whom the reader is introduced. He is not carried back into
                        the past, the past is brought to him. Two young and adventurous spirits who
                        had been school chums, after much adventure and hardship, finally pass the I
                        gates of Kamt and discover these people.</p>
                    <p>The father of one of these young men had been a celebrated Egyptologist and
                        had devoted himselt particulary to searching for traces of these lost
                        people. He had reconstructed the blank page in Egyptian bistory after a
                        theory of his own, which the son proved a correct one, though it had been
                        greatly scoffed at, and he had also reconstructed the language of ancient
                        Kamt, and this he taught to his son and his son's friend, together with the
                        hieroglyphic and muneiform writings of the ancient Egyptians. He spent his
                        life in these researches and passed a rich heritage of knowledge to his son.
                        By means ol an ancient papyrus left him by his father the son locates the
                        newer kingdom of the ancient people and finally enters into its wonders and
                        glories with his friend</p>
                    <p>Knowledge of the language and of manners and customs stands the adventurers
                        in good stead. The yonng Egyptologist persuaded the people of Kamt that he
                        has been sent to rule among them by the great god Ra himself. He becomes
                        engaged to marry the widowed Queen of Kamt, but falls in love with a
                        princess, her niece. Bat one must go to the book itself for the story, which
                        is of absorbing interest and worked ont with such a cleverness of detail
                        that it seems as real as some of the romances of Jules Verne. There are
                        gorgeous descriptions of fêtes and festivals and sacrifices, the stately
                        pageantry of ancient Egypt passes in all its solemn glory before the mental
                        vision, and every page is full of color. Scarcely since Flaubert have
                        ancient people heen so realistically pictured (Dodd, Mead and Co.</p>

                    <p>SIR R: SLATIN INTERVIEWED.</p>
                    <p>Reuter's representative has had an inter view with General Sir Rudolf Slatin
                        (Inspector General of the Sudan), who is on a short visit to this
                        country.</p>
                    <p>Speaking of the position in the Sudan he said: "The position of affairs is
                        entirely satisfactory, financially and politically. The revenue shows an
                        annual increase, and this without having recourse to increased taxation In
                        fact, on the contrary, we are trying om best to reduce taxes where
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>The people generally are satisfied, and if as sometimes happens, new laws
                        have to be • enacted which go against their traditions, they</p>
                    <p>realise that they are for the public good, and cheerfully sıbmit.</p>
                    <p>One of the most important signs in the Sudan is the remarkable increase of
                        popula tion, and by this I do not inean the removal of people from other
                        regions, but the great increase in the number of children, which is åt inost
                        hopeful sign for the future of the country. The people are most anxions to
                        have their children educated, and a satisfactory proof of their confidence
                        is that they are sending so many that the applications are more numerons
                        than our schools are able to accept. The Gordon College is already bearing
                        good fruit, as the Government is being supplied there with land surveyors,
                        &amp;c.'</p>
                    <p>Dealing with the native situation, Sir Rudolf said : "The tribes are
                        peaceful. Of course, inter-tribal questions and jealousies arise when it is
                        necessary for the Government to keep · der ; but there is nothing to give
                        rise to any anxiety. With regard to the Senussi movement, this has very
                        little influence in the Sudan. It has a certain weight in Egypt, but it is
                        chiefly in Darfur and the west. In the Sudan it is practically nil."</p>
                    <p>Asked about the recent manifestation of the Pan-Islamic movement, Sir Rudolf
                        said that it was a very dificult question to discuss, but added that he did
                        not consider the people of Egypt or the Sudan were fanatical.</p>
                    <p>"One must always remember," he added, "that they belong to a different
                        religion from our own, and that in Egypt, particularly people who are
                        discontented with the Government, are always ready to use their religion to
                        stir up the population against their rulers."</p>
                    <p>On the subject of general development Sir Rudolf Slatin said:</p>
                    <p>"New commercial stations have been opened, one leading to the Blue Nile and
                        one on the Baro, and trade is beginning to flow from Abyssinia to the Sudan
                        by this means Of course, at the beginning it is slow, but great development
                        may be looked for. We are on good terms with the Abyssinians. although
                        occasionally there is trouble with raiders who are outlaws in Abyssinian ter
                        ritory.</p>
                    <p>"As regards water communication, we are improving the rivers in every way we
                        can We continue to clear the sudd, and dredger have been ordered for
                        deepening the chan nels. The Atbara-Port Sudan Railway is working most
                        satisfactorily, and trade along this route is increasing.</p>
                    <p>"We are now engaged in building a bridge over the Blue Nile at Khartoum and
                        extend ing the railways through the fertile country between the White and
                        Blue Niles.</p>
                    <p>"There is no necessity to construct a rail way connecting the Sudan with
                        Uganda whil there is a splendid waterway to Gondokoro We must, of course,
                        have a line of communica tion from north to south, but there is n necessity
                        for a Cape to Cairo railway on thi section while we have better and cheape
                        transit by boat."</p>
                    <p>"With regard to motor traffic in the fa away districts of Bahr-el-Ghazal and
                        Souther Kordofan, roads are being made and improve so that motor lorries can
                        be employed." .</p>
                    <p>Concerning the situation at the Lad Enclave, Sir Rudolf said that the
                        relatior between the Anglo-Egyptian and Congo Fre State Governments were
                        friendly, as the latte had evacuated the territory claimed by th former.

                    <head>"TO EMPIRE VIA DENSHAWAI."</head>
                    <p>* (From The New Age.) Just about a year ago a party of British officers got
                        mixed up in a village row at Denshawai, in Egypt. They had gone to amuse
                        themselves by shooting pigeons, the domesticated pigeons of the villagers,
                        and had apparently not been | careful to get permission. By accident an</p>
                    <p>Egyptian woman got wounded, the officers were mobbed and lost their heads,
                        two of them ran for help while three were beaten by the crowd, and one of
                        those who ran dropped dead.</p>
                    <p>Now it does not need a very profound knowledge of the psychology of the
                        British officer to recognise in this incident all his characteristic bravado
                        and stopidity. The | officers had not taken the trouble to either understand
                        the language or the humanity of the villagers, who were treated as creatures
                        of another species.</p>
                    <p>Consequently at the first sign of the breakdown of the formal nexus of
                        behaviour which enables the British officer to communicate with the Egyptian
                        village, the officers were hopelessly bewildered, lost their heads and gave
                        way to panic.</p>
                    <p>Had there been anyone at headquarters to put the matter right by a stiff
                        reprimand, matters would have been no more serious than a schoolboy's row
                        with a gamekeeper. But apparently those at headquarters got even more
                        panic-stricken than the officers, and without the excuse of the hubbub and
                        turmoil of a riot, gave fanatic orders for arrest and trial of the riotous
                        villagers 1 As a result four men were hanged, and eight men were flogged and
                        some imprisoned.</p>
                    <p>On the face of it, this story sounds incredible ; one imagines there must be
                        something more behind it. That something more, accordJing to Lords Cromer
                        and Grey, is an Egyptian</p>
                    <p>National movement which has to be sternly suppressed.</p>
                    <p>But even granting that there is an Egyptian Nationalist movement, is there
                        any evidence at all that the mobbing of soine stupid men at Denshawai had
                        anything to do with it ? In fact, there is no justification whatsoever for
                        this belief, there are no reasons, only motives, and the motives are those
                        of bewildered fear.</p>
                    <p>Now, even if Denshawai were a separate incident, it would be a very serious
                        matter to recognise that our administration in Egypt is so fatally
                        wrong-headed. Whatever other conclusions we may draw, it is at least certain
                        that out administrators, do not understand the | temperament of the people
                        they are governing.</p>
                    <p>The question becomes, have they made any | effort to understand ? How many,
                        for instance,</p>
                    <p>of those officials who are thrown into contact | with the people of the
                        country can understand</p>
                    <p>their language or are versed in the etiquette of their social life?</p>
                    <p>In South Africa many Boers keep their hats on their heads when they enter a
                        room and expectorate at leisure on the carpet. This conduct would be
                        considered a little ontra in London.</p>
                    <p>Is it not perhaps possible our officials transgress in an equally serious
                        manner? Is there, indeed, any adeqnate provision to prevent such possible
                        offences ? T'he shooting of domesticated pigeons does not sound as if there
                        were.</p>
                    <p>The matter, however, is by no means confined to the one incident. The
                        Denshawai picnic is diagnostic of the most serious imperial
                        disease-ccmplacent failure to understand. One can parallel it almost detail
                        for detail in the incidents which occurred before the late Natal campaign ;
                        the failure to understand, the refusal to try to understand, the sudden
                        panic of minor officials spreading up into the central administration; the
                        harsh measures of retribution, the imagination of a big national| ist
                        "Ethiopian" movement. All these things were parts of the Richmond incident
                        which precipitated the Natal campaign.</p>
                    <p>If an administration will only go on irritating a people, whom it does not
                        understand, long enough, if it will only go on telling them they are
                        dangerous traitors nursing nationalist dreams, that people will come to
                        believe and act upon the Government's suggestions. The question finally is
                        one of the possibility of zavoiding this kind of stupidity.</p>
                    <p>Empire has no meaning for a Socialist, unless it means the co-operation of
                        autonomous units. Can we understand and co-operate with the Egyptian people
                        and with the other alien races within our boundaries? If we are to do so it
                        will need a very much greater effort to understand, and it will mean that
                        our administrators sball be really compelled to study the language, habits,
                        and customs of the people amongst whoin they are going at first hand. And
                        this means in all probability the scrapping of a good deal of our
                        upper-class public schoolboy machinery in favour of a school-board
                        polytechnic-educated human being.</p>
                    <p>The time, indeed, may not be far distant when we shall be compelled to insist
                        on the public-school coming up to a decent educational standard.</p>
                    <p>From the national point of view that is, and not their class point of view.
                        When one reads in the Blue books that in the Denshawai hangings and
                        floggings "all possible humanity was shown," and "the arrangements reflected
                        great credit on all concerned," and then parallel this with a quotation from
                        the Natal shooting correspondence where a clergyman of the Church of England
                        certifies that the men were shot "with the utmost humanity," it is clear
                        that the disease is deep-seated.</p>
                    <p>Unless our administrators can realise that other races and classes are human
                        beings, and can understand them as human beings, there is no future for our
                        Empire.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile there are some Denshawai natives still in prison. We have made them
                        our enemies, that is the worst of stupidity, <cb n="3"/> but there is no
                        reason why they should be kept there any longer.</p>
                    <p>We are glad to see that a petition signed by Egyptian notables was presented
                        to the Khedive on June 28, the anniversary of the "hanging" incident; and we
                        hope that the petition will be supported by questions in the House of
                        Commons..</p>

                    <p>TRADE WITH EGYPT.</p>
                    <p>It was hoped at one time, says the "Monthly Journal" of the British Chamber
                        of Commerce for Egypt, that the financial crisis through which we are
                        passing would not affect to any appreciable extent this branch of the import
                        trade, piece goods dealers, as a rule, being free from any desire to
                        purchase stocks and shares ; but the suspension of the Cassa di Sconto has
                        quite dissipated that hope, as this establishment appears to have been in
                        direct financial relation with various firms interested in the trade.
                        Business during the month of June has been extremely quiet. A few small
                        sales of cheap goods may have been made; a few orders for the season may
                        have been booked : and that is about all that can be reported. No revival is
                        likely to take place until the present uneasiness and want of confidence
                        have passed away. :</p>

                    <p>AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY.</p>
                    <p>The following partieulars of the importa tion of agricultural machinery into
                        Egypt are given by the " Bulletin " of the International Chamber of Commerce
                        at Cairo. For some years the importation of agricultural machinery into
                        Egypt has shown a remarkable development, as the figures below will prove
                        :</p>
                    <p>1902 ... ... ... LE. 54,305 1903 ... ... ... , 88,509 1904 ... ... ...
                        103,380 1905</p>
                    <p>... ....... 116,936 .1906 ... ... , 204,640 In 1906 the imports were derived
                        as follows - United Kingdom, L.E. 184,223 ; Switzer. land, L.E. 21,961 ;
                        Germany, L.E. 11,824 Ainerica, L.E. 11,439; France, L.E. 3,800 other
                        countries, L.E. 1,387. Egypt is essential ly an agricultural country, and
                        the Sudar appears likely to become one, so in the near future trade in
                        agricultural machinery is bound to develop still more. At the present time
                        ir Egypt ont of an area of nine million feddans only six millions are under
                        crop, the remaining three million feddans will be cultivated wher the
                        schemes of irrigation drawn up by th Government have been realised.</p>
                    <p>Schemes are also on foot for largely increas ing the agricultural resources
                        of the Sudan and this will naturally lead to a large demand for the
                        necessary implements. The work o education of the peasants is being carrier
                        out by means of agricultural exhibitions on ganised by the Khedivial
                        Agricultural Society</p>

                    <head> TRADE IN THE LEVANT. </head>
                    <p> OUR RIVALS IN TURKEY. </p>
                    <p> "Trade with Turkey" was the subject of an address given at a special meeting
                        of the London Chamber of Commerce last week by Mr. A. T. Waugh, British
                        Consul at Constantinople. The President (Sir Albert Spicer, M.P.) explained
                        that Mr. Waugh was present in accordance with the comparatively recent but
                        excellent idea of the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade that British
                        commercial representatives abroad should, when in this country, pay visits
                        to the more important commercial centres for the purpose of consultation
                        with business men. Mr. Waugh said that fifty years ago our manufacturers and
                        merchants had no rivals in Turkey, but now only 37 per cent. of the total
                        imports of that country were British. We ought to do better. The Turks were
                        changing their ideas and habits. What we called civilisation was creeping
                        in. They were learning to use foreign goods, only slowly at present, but the
                        change might become rapid. German trade with Turkey was growing very fast,
                        thanks to subsidised steamships, the establishment of banks, the building of
                        railways, and other means. The Germans were sparing no efforts to secure
                        Turkish trade, of the value of which they were fully convinced. Italians,
                        too, were making great commercial progress in the Sultan's dominions. It
                        would be worth our while to learn from these competitors, and we must do so
                        if we wanted even to hold oar own. For one thing he personally desired
                        co-operation ; that was the school opened in Constantinople two years ago to
                        educate the sons of British parents. The boys were being specially trained
                        for business | life in Turkey, and of course they learned to read and write
                        the native language, an accomplishment of which most foreign residents were
                        extremely ignorant. The school was a tardy attempt to do for Britain what
                        every other Great Power had already done in Turkeyfoster a resident colony
                        of its subjects. As for the 3 per cent, which the Macedonian Agree ment
                        permitted the Sultan to add to the import duties, the effect would not be
                        great. Turkey, being the only Free Trade country apart from our own, would
                        take all the foreign goods she wanted, whether the duties were 8 or 11 per
                        cent. </p>

                    <p> Dr. Adler, Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew congregations of Great Britain,
                        'has been paying an official visit to Scotland, and, according to the
                        "Scottish Review," he administered one or two hard knocks. </p>
                    <p> Referring to the General Assemblies, Dr. Adler said it grieved him to read
                        about missions to convert the Jews in face of the terrible amount of vice
                        and drunkenness and irreligion prevailing among their own co-religionists
                        and fellow citizens. Surely there was sufficient work for these minister to
                        do without attempting the conversion of the Jews, and surely they ought to
                        know what enormous sacrifice Jews in Scotland were making to preserve houses
                        of prayer. </p>

                    <p>NOTES ET CRITIQUES</p>
                    <p>Le Caire, Mardi 16 juillet. Le taux de l'escompte libre à Londres s'est
                        maintenu hier à 3 5/8 pour cent. Au Stock Exchange, le Consolidé anglais a
                        avancé de 1/8 à 84 3/4. L'Unifiée 'a haussé de 1/4 à 101 1/4. La National
                        Bank a rétrogradé de 1/4 à 19 1/8. L'Agricole est restée in variée à 7 3/4,
                        de même que la Daïra Sanieh à 13 1/2 et la Delta Light à 9 3/8.</p>
                    <p>A Paris, la Bourse est restée fermée hier à l'occasion du lendemain de la
                        fête nationale du 14 Juillet</p>
                    <p>La nouvelle baisse de la National Bank a Londres, jointe à la propagation sur
                        place de toutes sortes de racontars, a influé aujourd'hui défavorablement
                        sur notre marché des valeurs. D'où un nouveau tassement sur la plupart des
                        cours. Il importe peut-être de ne pas perdre de vne que le recul de la
                        National Bank est dn a des ventes à terme, qui, comme en Juin dermier,
                        pourraient bien finir par créer un découvert et déterminer une forte reprise
                        à l'approche de la liquidation de fin de mois. Pour ce qui est des
                        informations pessimistes, elles se rapportent simplement à des affaires
                        d'ordre pour ainsi dire rétrospectif, dont les principales sont en voie
                        d'arrangement. Il n'y a donc pas lieu de s'émouvoir outre mesure de ces
                        maneuvres du parti baissier. Il suffirait de bien peu de chose pour amener
                        un revirement subit.</p>
                    <p>En attendant, la National Bank a Aéchi, sans opérations importantes, à 18
                        15/16. L'Agricole s'est tassée à 7 5/8-11/16. Les parts de la Société
                        Générale Egyptienne ont été négoriées à 33.</p>
                    <p>Le Crédit Foncier a été delaissé à 680 ; l'obligation à lots ancienne est
                        revenue à 307308. La Béhéra a été cotée 19 3/4 ex-right. Les parts de
                        fondateur Société Immobilière d'Egypte sont tombées à 460 et celles de
                        l'Enterprise and Development à 11. L'Union Foncière a décliné à 4 5/8.</p>
                    <p>La Delta Light a progressé à 9 5/16. Les Héliopolis ont été traitées à 236 ;
                        leur part a avancé à 10. Les Jouissances Eaux du Caire ont reculé à 170. La
                        Brasserie des Pyramides a faibli à 85. Les Menzaleh ont été tenues à 3
                        1/2.</p>
                    <p>Dans le groupe des valeurs hôtelières, les Nungovich ont clôturé à 15. En
                        bonne tendance, les Egyptian ont atteint 5 1/2 pour finir à 5 3/8-7/16.</p>
                    <p>Parmi les petites valeurs, les Delta Land ont été cotés 1 7/16 ex-coupon. Les
                        Estates se sont raffermis à 0 11/16.3/4. ,</p>
                    <p>Après une discussion fort animée, l'assemblée générale extraordinaire de
                        l'Association des courtiers en valeurs d'Alexandrie a adopté hier les
                        mesures proposées par le comité de l'Association relativement à la suite à

                    <p>"Lie Trésor turc a de plus en plus besoin d'argent. Après les avances
                        successives, dont il a été parlé ces derniers temps, de la Banque Impériale
                        Ottomane et de nombreux autres prêteurs, on annonce comme prochaine
                        l'émission d'une partie de l'emprunt 1904 de deux et demi millions de livres
                        turques. Il s'agit d'un emprunt dit "du timbre" mais gagé sur les excedents
                        de la Dette publique et prévu par le décret-annexe publié lors de
                        l'unification de la Dette. Le gage consiste dans les 75 % revenant au
                        gouvernement, turc de l'excédent des recettes au-delà de £2,157,375
                        nécessaires au service de la Dette privilégiée, des Lots et de la Dette
                        entière. Cet excédent s'élèverait cette année à L.T. 393,015, ce qui
                        donnerait pour la part du Trésor L.T. 294,762 pouvant servir de gage à
                        l'emprunt. Déjà l'année dernière à pareille époque il a été parlé de ce
                        projet d'emprunt. Il est vraisem. blable que la Banque Ottomane a fait an
                        Trésor diverses avances gagées sur ces excédents, et peut-être s'agit-il
                        aujourd'hui de ces petits prêts successifs en même temps que de l'émission
                        du solde de l'opération."</p>
