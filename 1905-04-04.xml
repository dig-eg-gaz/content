                    <p>Tangier, April 3.</p>
                    <p>The curtailing ol the Kaiser’s visit here is now explained by a statement to
                        the effect that the Emperor received on board a message from the Sultan
                        virtually bailing him as a protector against France. The Kaiser, declining
                        to endorse such sentiments, refused to land. The German Minister ultimately
                        persuaded him to charge his mind, otherwise German prestige would have
                        suffered considerably. The Kaiser went- direct to the German Legation, and
                        did not enter the Moorish Palace, which had been specially prepared for him.
                        The upshot of it all is that the Moors and French are alike offended.</p>

                    <p>Referring to our remarks in yesterday’s issue with reference to the new site
                        chosen for Victoria College, we now learn that the committee has concluded
                        au exceptionally favorable arrangement with Mr. Perioles Glymenopoulo, who
                        not only has ceded to them a superficies of about 130,00Q pics of land at
                        Ramleh fronting the Khedivial Palace, at the very reasonable price of P.T.
                        15 per pio, but has also made the very generous offer to lend the committee
                        of the Victoria College a sum of £15,000 for the spuse of three years at 5%
                        interest in order to enable them to commence the~work of building the new
                        oollege at once, which would not have been possible blit for this offer, as
                        we understand that the committee were not in a position to commence the
                        building until such' time as they had been able to dispose of the land on
                        which the present college stands. There is now no necessity for any hurry in
                        disposing of same.</p>
                    <p>Needless to say, the munificent offer of Mr. Glymenoponlo has been accepted
                        by the committee, and we certainly think that the thanks of the entire
                        British community are due to this geutlemeu for the great interest, and
                        disinterestedness he has shown in the matter.</p>

                    <p>One of the most popular excuses for war is</p>

                    <p>of this doctrine, our experience in Egypt</p>

                    <p>Mr. Justice Kekewich, .inthe Cbancgry Divi- sion on March 27, commenced the
                        hearing of an action by Dr. Robert William Felkin against the Palmerston
                        Industrial and Finance Corpora- tion, Ltd., and Mr. Alfred Bridge, of 15,
                        Cockspnr-street, S.W., claiming rescission of an agreement to take 800
                        shares in the Sudan Exploration, Ltd., and a declaration that defendants
                        were liable to indemnify plaintiff in respect to all expenses incurred by
                        him in relation to the trasaotion. In the alternative, plaintiff asked for
                        damages for misrepresenta- tion.—Mr. P. Ogden Lawrence, K.C., and Mr. J.H.
                        Simmons appeared Tor the plaintiff; Mr. Ashton Cross for the Palmerston
                        Corporation; and Mr. W.J.L Ambrose for Mr. Bridge. Mr. Lawrence said Dr.
                        Felkin had spent some time in Egypt, and knew the Sudan well. When he
                        returned to England, unfortun- ately for himself, he got mixed up with the
                        defendant Bridge, who w*s.a company promoter, le was first attracted to
                        Bridge by an adver- tisement in a London pspet for a gentleman to act as
                        director of a public company, and willing to subscribe £1,000. Bridge's
                        exact relationship to the Palmerston Corporation counsel said he did not
                        know; but he appeared to have drawn cheques in the name of the corporation
                        and in the name of the directors. Generally he appear- ed tb he the company
                        himself. Bridge first got ! )r. Felkin interested in the Palmerston
                        Corporation, and then, finding that the plaintiff mew a great dial about
                        Sudan cotton-plant- ing and transport, he brought to his notice the Sudan
                        Exploration Cdmpany. Bridge told plaintiff that if he would take 800 £1
                        shares le should have them' for £1,000, and that he would accept, on behalf
                        of the Palmerston Corporation, a bill accepted by Dr. Felkin at three
                        months. Bridge also said that he wonld be able to sell for plaintiff enough
                        of the shares which he controlled, so as to give plaintiff cash to pay for
                        them-1 that was to say, that they were shares which would go up on the
                        market Plaintiff was to retain the balance of the shares left Counsel said
                        he thought he would be able to show that the corporation did not control the
                        shares. Subse- quently Dr. Felkin attended at Bridge’s, office, and accepted
                        a bill drawn by Bridge. The bill was endorsed by Dr. Bryant The bill found
                        its way into the hands of a moneylender named Lsvene, having been discounted
                        by Bridge, who received a cheque for £800. Plain- tiff had not been ablS to
                        ascertain what became of the £800, and whether it went into the Palmerston
                        Company's coffers, or into Bridge’s hands. When the bill matured Bridge gave
                        the money lenders two other bills, the pre- mium for renewal being £125.
                        Plaintiff went to Bridge’s offioe and accepted the bills, whioh were again
                        endorsed by Dr. Bryant. The plaintiff was unable to find the money to meet
                        the bills, and-there was no sale of the shares, which plaintiff believed
                        were never in the pos- session or nnder the control of the Palmerston
                        Corporation at all. The money lender brought an notion against the drawer,
                        the endorser and the acceptor of the bills, and judgment was obtained
                        against both drawer and endorser. Mr. Ambrose, interposing, said that judg-'
                        merit was against Bridge, but not by oonsent. Proceeding, Mr. Lawrence said
                        plaintiff settled the action by paying the moneylender, as he was advised
                        that whatever remedy he bad was in the present aotion. Counsel contend- ed
                        that plaintiff never had any consideration, and that be never saw the
                        shares, and he did not believe that the defendant corporation ever
                        controlled them. He believed that the £800 was got out of him by Bridge for
                        his own person- al benefit. The corporation had put in a defenoe stating
                        that it was always willing and ready to hand over the shares to the
                        plaintiff, and it denied that the policy and business of the corporation
                        were controlled by Bridge, nor did it admit that such representations were
                        made by Bridge as alleged by the plaintiffs. The defendant Bridge had
                        pleaded that if he did make any statement or representations concerning the
                        present or future value of the shares in the Sudan Exploration Company, they
                        were boua fide expressions of opinion. The plaintiff, Dr. Felkin, was
                        called, and was under examination when the Court adjourned.</p>

                        8oudan. ^ For some years private Syndicates have been exploring oonoesffons
                        granted by the Egyptian and Soudan Governments with tery satisfactory
                        results; districts previously unexplored have been opened up, aud laud
                        hitherto of little value is now steadily improving in price, and is in great
                        demand. The irrigation and reclamation schemes projected are likely to still
                        farther increase the investment demand for laud In view of the above, it ia
                        proposed that this Company shall pay epeoial attention to business connected
                        with land development irrigation schemes, aud reclamation works. It is
                        generally admitted that the many industries of Egypt, unler the careful

                        intended to act as financial- agents in JJoodoi^ Fans and elsewhere for laud
                        development, mining and other oompanies, and i. is anticipated that
                        considerable profit will result from this source. In view of the increasing
                        interest of Freooh Investors in Bgyptian Securities, it is proposed to open
                        a Branch Offise ia Paris at a.: early date. As the success of Company of

                        unequalled. Mr. Hooker has consented to act tor a period of three years, at

                    <p>It has been truly said that “ Nothing goes right while the stomach is '
                        wrong.” 5 It is therefore important in treating lung troubles to keep the
                        digestive organs in a healthy condition. That is just what Angler’s Emulsion
                        does; it promoted appetite, aids diges- tion and improves nutrition, while
                        at the same time it soothes and heals the lungs and air passages. It is this
                        combined effect upon the respiratory and digestive’organs that makes it
                        superior to any other remedy for lung affections and wasting diseases.</p>

                        site of the ancient Opis on.the Tigris. From Hit to Gama, past the ancient
                        Babylon, is the Euphrates. The Hindia Canal is the branch which leaves the
                        Euphrates hear Mosaib and joins it again at Sawama, after flowing through
                        -the Sea of Nejef. From Beled to Gama, past Bagdad and Am.ara, is the

                        limestone quarries and bitumen springs. From Hit to the Persian Gulf, on a
                        length of some 930 kilometres, the river rolls its yellow water through an
                        open, plain, bounded on the west by the desert. Uu the east pr left bank,
                        islands of the gravelly desert are met with south of Feluja and again near
                        Mosaib. - , Ffom Hit to Feluja, on a length of about 130 kilometres, the
                        river is broad,, varying m width from 250 to 450 metres, the current is
                        about 3 kilometres an hour, aud the average . depth 3.50 mptres. The valley
                        is narrow, liable to overflow in places in high floods, and irriga- tion is
                        in great part carried on by “charads” where water is raised in bullock skms

                        going down and up an incline. . From Feluja to Mosaib, a distance of some 90
                        kilometres, the average width of the river is 250 metres. The trough of the
                        Euphrates is some 3 metres deep down to the level ot low supply, and a flood
                        of 3.50 metres puts the country under half a metre of water, against which
                        it is protected by dykes, which are not very effective, and are occasionally

                    <p>The following articles translated from “A1 Chark” give a fair, idea of one
                        side of native opinion in reference to the A1 Azhar crisis : — “We refrained
                        from reproducing the rumours published by our contemporaries in Cairo with
                        regard to A1 Azhar until the storm had passed and the agitation was brought,
                        to silence, and until our colleagues had saved themselves the trouble of
                        disoussions and explanations. Now that tranquillity has beeu restored and
                        the weather has resumed its former calmness, and the reser- vists of A1
                        Azhar have been allowed a free hand,- we may asktba reformers these
                        questions: What will A1 Azhar become hereafter 1 and what will be the
                        condition of its graduates once they have acquired the religious sciences
                        taught in it ? Will it be more than a religious college wherein nothing but
                        the Mohamedau law is taught, and the sheikhs, on being graduated, will they
                        be acquainted with anythihg else besides religious questions ? Where will
                        this great army get their daily bread once they have left A1 Azhar and
                        become Ulema in reli- gion and' Imams of the believers I There is no

                        deserves much medita- tion. The Grand Mufti of Egypt, Sheikh Mo hamed Abdou,
                        as well as Sheikh Abdilkarim Silmajo, have both resigued their poits in the
                        Council of Administration at Al Azhar owing to the objection of the majority
                        of the sheikhs there to include any worldly (modern) science in the
                        curriculum and insisting on confining themselves to religious studies
                        exclusively.” “In our issue of yesterday we expressed an opinion regarding
                        A1 Azhar and said we won- dered whether thfese Ulema, with no experience of
                        anything except religious matters, would be able to earn their living. A
                        Moslem friend has just sent us the following communication in response to
                        our questions : You have asked an important question with freedom aud
                        courage at a time when other papers have passed over the terrible weakness
                        in the re- gulations of the greatest Mohamedan uni- versity. Endless
                        discussions are now going on in this connection, and a great number of our
                        .earned sheikhs are complimenting each other on their escape from tne board
                        of examinations, and are thanking God that they will no more become
                        mathematicians, geographers, natural- ists, or chemists. This greatest ot
                        universities contains ten thousand students ; each one ot them is strong
                        enough to remove a mountain ; Alexander, Haunibal, and Bonaparte, who
                        covered the world' with fire and blood, had not stouter bodies nor stronger
                        arms ; neither were ihe students at Paris greater in number when in 1892 a
                        prime minister apologised to them and excused himself. I had occasion to see
                        a party of students at A1 Azhar whom I suppos- ed to be moving rocks and
                        speaking mountains. I noticed one of them had a dispute with another on a
                        certain matter of opinion, and a nig fight ensned : boxing, and biting were
                        indulged in freely, and the earth trembleu with cries. On another occasion I
                        heard some sheikhs speaking there ; so sweet were, their words, so plehsaut
                        tneir conversation, so clear tlieir: minds, and so excellent their- charac-

                        weapons to Islamism, its peace,and its war. This force should be converted
                        into virtnonsness ; this youthliilness into righteous- ness ; this
                        intelligence and ability into fortresses and fortifications. A1 Azhar should
                        be the centre of all hopes, and the object of the greatest care and
                        attention. If.it become ill it should be doctored, and if it become crooked
                        it shonld be put straight. But if all means have failed and there is no hope
                        of recovery it is then right that it? should be thrown down stone by stone
                        and demolished to the ground. “Have you ever seen a young sheikh in hi»
                        first year at Al Azhar 1 It he preached in >■ village abd said to the
                        inhabitants, ‘ God com- mands you not to sell your cotton,’ do you i-hink
                        any one of them would dare to sell one pound of cotton 1 And if he were to
                        say that Ghina was a town at a short distance from Ghirgeh, and that it was
                        rushing upon them to deprive them of their properties; would there be any
                        one without a naboot, a rifle, or an axe, and would you hear anything but
                        screams and cries 1 If plagiie, cholera, or fever prevailed in an epidemic
                        form and this y.iung sheikh of Al Azhar came and said, ‘ 0 people, there is
                        no contagion in Islamism, al is due to destiny,’would the Sanitary Adml
                        nistration find any one to hearken to its idvice or follow its precautions ?
                        Such is tb> fluence of these sheikhs upon the puhlii uinda that it is
                        absolutely necessary that they should he intelligent and well-instructed. Al
                        Azhar contains two distinct parties : the one composed of those who go. to
                        study and learn, and the other of those who oonsider Al Azhai asylum ora
                        place of retuge for those wli'i scape from military service or are tire' >f
                        judicial supervision, or are sick of thi world and its disappointments. The
                        former ac in accordance with the ‘ Holy Hadith ’ : Seel knowledge though in
                        China ; the latter atten- i t Al .Azhar not with the intention to study but
                        merely on woount of itn being a ' Tikia ’ wherein the greatest desire is to
                        be left quiet in their beds, and be served with their daily food regularly.
                        “This is the real cause of what is at present called disorder and trouble at
                        Al Azhar, and which in reality is but a noble struggle for the better. Now
                        that the reformers have relin- quished their posts iu the administration of
                        that uuiversity, and that the reactionary party has gained a complete
                        victory over the pro- gressive party, the only answer to yonr ques- tion is
                        that the numerous body of students have completely detached themselves from
                        public society so that they do not understand the public nor do the public
                        understand them; they aot in a way which the public will not fol- low. When
                        this great army finds itself without -work and without sustenance, it will
                        spread itself among the people and infect their minds with every species of
                        ignorance. It will ingra- tiate itself amoDg'the public by means of mi-
                        racles and wonders, and will exert influence on their admirers with canning
                        sorcery and magio to deprive them even of their clothingi The country will
                        encounter enormous difficulties through this army. No cultivation will be
                        com- pleted, no cotton will be sold, no precautions will be taken against
                        epidemic diseases, no modem project of the oivilised world will be
                        considered until the learned adviser has been consulted. It will not be
                        unusual tosee acommonmanarguing firmly that the sun sets in the sea, and
                        that there is a special moon for each month, and that no man should seek his
                        bread but that the bread follows the man wherever he goes, and so on. I pray
                        the gracious God that He may not reduce Al Azhar to such a state, and that
                        that institution may be restored to its ancient position in the Moslem
                        world, and that its members may become a strong army of pro- gress and
                        usefulness.</p>
