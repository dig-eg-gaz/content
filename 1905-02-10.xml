                        inopportune to enquire into the relative advantages offered by this route as
                        against the present means of communication via Alexandria, Port Said, and
                        Suez. We do not intend to touch upon the Political aspect of the question,
                        other than to say that both the harbour and railway works are a natural
                        consquence of a settled and far- scing administration, and that similarly to
                        the building of the line from Haifa to Khar- toum, so will the completion of
                        this project remain a tribute to the prompter and to the executors concerned
                        in the undertaking.</p>
                    <p>Looking, however, to immediate results, say for the five years following on
                        the opening of the line, it promises no commercial advan- tages over the
                        existing route. On the contrary, the freight will be higher and the duration
                        of the journey longer. Liverpool and London steamers ask 15s. more per ton
                        to Sualin than to Alexandria and stipulate transhipment at the latter port
                        Antwerp lines demand 55 frs per ton in addition to the ordinary rate to
                        Alexandria. The Austrian Lloyd hand their goods for Suakin over to the
                        Khedivial Line at Port Said, the Khedivial vary naturally retaining
                        two-thirds of the total rate from Trieste to Suakin. Only vessels
                        occasionally carrying full Government cargo, perhaps also the
                        Florio-Rubattino Line, will call direct at Suakin, and it will be years
                        before inland trade and commerce will be remune- rative enough to render
                        Sheikh Barghoot a regular port of call. It is expected that some of the
                        Abyssinian trade miy be diverted towards Suakin, but apparently the Austrian
                        Lloyd do not share this opinion, as they are making arrangements to develop
                        Abyssinian traffic via Tadjurs Bay and to establish a regular line through
                        that channel. Nor in the matter of the export of gum can Suakin compete with
                        Sues in facilities. At the latter port all homeward-bound vessels have to
                        call for provisions, to land and embark passengers, and to unload their
                        heavy cargoes for distribution all over Egypt In order to replete their
                        holds, they practically take in gum at ballast rates and for all
                        destinations. It is, further, not to be overlooked that fully half of this
                        staple product is taken up by Cairo dealers, who as- sort and otherwise
                        handle the gum at Cairo before reshipment.</p>
                    <p>In a spirit of competition, Nile navigation companies can always afford to
                        further lower their rates for gum as well as for general merchandise via
                        Alexandria and Halfa, and the Egyptian Railways Administration may also see
                        its way to make a reduction rather than forego the business altogether. The
                        remark has been thrown out that the railway rate between the junction at
                        Damer or Berber to Halfa could be increased, but one can hardly credit the
                        authorities as being keen on such an artificial measure, which would be more
                        productive of harm than good, and little likely to attain the object
                        desired.</p>
                    <p>As for tourists, Suakin is of no consequences, unless some travellers from
                        India care to “do" the Sudan and Egypt from that point; but few firat-class
                        steamers could afford to call unless they carried a fair number of
                        passengers booked in that direction, and that is very questionable. The
                        risks generally, to both passengers and freight, are greater via Suakin than
                        by the Nile route, and the journey is rougher and longer. Cotton exports,
                        too, can be rele- gated for consideration beyond the tens of our review.
                        There will be nothing of any magnitude for another five years at least For
                        the Public Works, however, the new line should prove both convenient and
                        economical, as also for the import of heavy and bulky mater- ials of all
                        descriptions. A great impetus will necessarily be given to the conveyance
                        and introduction of Bengal coal. The fuel question, in fact, appears to be
                        an argent matter, but that again is primarily for Government re- quirements.
                        This is of no momentary interest to the public at large, nor will it be till
                        the time when there is a free supply of water for irrigation purposes. The
                        main feature therefore of the Suakin harbour and railway is concentrated in
                        the fact of their being the earnest commencement of a network of public
                        works in the country, of which this will famish a most important link.</p>

                        of 1888 requires to be regarded as seperate and distinct from that of egypt.

                        was a party to the convention with a certain reservaation which, she
                        maintained, absolved her from complaince with its stupulations in 1898. By
                        the anglo-french agreement of april 8 1904, she declared her adherence to
                        the stipulations of the suez canal treat, but that- i am quoting from the
                        anglo french agreement itself- the last sentence of paragraph 1 and that of
                        paragraph 2 of article VIII. of this treaty will remain suspended. Is not
                        this another reservation which, unimportant though it be, may enable her, at
                        any time, to take up the position which she assumed in 1898, or, by parity
                        of reasoning, enable other powers to maintain that the suez canal convention
                        is inoperative. I confess that i do not consider the situation as entirely

                    <p>The performance of fedora at the khedivial opera house last night, thanks to
                        signa pandolfini, was a great success. Signa pandolfini is a thorough
                        artiste and an actress of a very high order. Her rendering of fedora was, if
                        possible, better than her tosca. Signor Giraud was variable, though
                        undoubtedly good in the last act; his singing in the second act was not at
                        all that we should have wished: he sang more than once sharp (one natural
                        was turned into sharp) and did not always seem to have hold of his note.
                        Inaccuracies were numerous and hardly justified, and he seems to have a
                        difficulty in taking really high notes. We may mention a most admirable high
                        C by signa pandolfini. Signor rubini delivered his solo very effectively in
                        act 1. Signor Polese was good and sang well, but he has not the sme chance
                        as in la tosca; he is a real chef de police, and as such probably finds
                        diplomacy too tame an occupation. The chorus is unusually good, and the
                        khedivial theatre heave-in that branch-spent their money to real advantage.
                        Indeed, in theatrical accessories cairo need not fear competition, so long
                        as the present conditions are in force. Rigoletto is to be given tonight. We
                        hope that some improvement will be effected therein. In this connection it
                        is interesting to note that in alexandria-as in cairo-signor tomisani seems
                        to have scored a brilliant success in that opera. Though our fellow critics
                        may take exception to his methods, a glance at the scores of the operas in
                        which he sings will show that he handles his high notes with an ease and
                        dexterity apparently foreign to his better known rivals of the state
                        theatre. Whatever his compatriots may think of his tone, it undoubtedly
                        pleases the anglo-saxon in general; and we could wish that-but we are
                        criticising the khedivial theatre, and it is as well to remind our readers
                        that siberia, also by giordano (whose compositions seem to be above the
                        average) will be given on saturday. Let us mention, before we close, that
                        signora tromben really showed to advantage in her part. As long as great and
                        startling efforts are not required of her, she is quite pleasing.</p>

                    <p>The performance of I Puritani yesterday evening served once more to show the
                        incomparable talent of signora isabella svicher. this gifted ladys vocal
                        organs are very extended; she possesses more than three octaves, which is
                        phenomenal. She recieved a perfect ovation at the end of the 2nd act, and
                        was repeatedly called before the curtain. Sig tomisani, in the difficult
                        role of lord arthur, also obtained a great success, and sig. baldelli, as
                        sir george, distinguished himself. We were more than surprised to find a
                        sparsely filled house last night. It is astonishing that, when such a rare
                        opportunity of hearing one of the bright particular lights of the operatic
                        world is afforded alexandrians, they do not flock to the theatre. A more
                        fickle public than is that of alexandria it would be impossible to find. Has
                        a soiree noire, with all its debasing suggestiveness, been announced, it
                        would be safe to say that the playhouse, which is now adorned by such
                        brilliant artistes, would have been filled to overflowing. Tomorrow evening,
                        carmen will be given, with signa bellincioni in the leading role, and we
                        hope to see a bumper house.</p>

                        provisions he had only a bag of sea biscuits and he carried two empty water
                        bottles. On the morning of the 27th January, after having passed the attaka
                        mountains, he encountered near the shore about half a dozen native
                        fishermen, who recieved him cordially and gave him fish and bread to eat.
                        After a good rest, gilbert proceeded in the direction of the mountains,
                        where he took shelter for the night. Early on the following day, he
                        descended the mountains and went on his way, meeting with no untoward
                        incident, but next day, at about noon, he encountered two bedouins, whom he
                        asked for water. The latter gave him to understand that if he followed them
                        they would take him to some wells, which the traveller did without the
                        slightest suspicion. On the way he made them aware of the fact that he was a
                        poor man, and that on account of this he was obliged to walk to suakin in
                        order to find employment. After several hours walk, seeing no trace of
                        water, and being exhausted, he proposed that they should all have a rest,
                        and accordingly sat down on a rock. Suddenly the younger of the bedouins,
                        who was at a distance of about 50 yards from gilbert, began to swear at him,
                        and raising his gun, fired. Gilvert was slightly wounded in the back, but
                        his bag prevented a serious wound. The bedouin afterwards reloaded his gun
                        and asked gilbert to place all his belongings at a certain spot. This was
                        done without hesitation. While the bedouin was occupied with his gun,
                        gilbert managed to creep from rock to rock, and, favored by the darkness,
                        succeeded in eluding the bedouins. After a long march the whole of the night
                        he arrived at daybreak at a small coast guard station, where he was well
                        recieved. Here he remained till the 1st inst., when he was offered a camel,
                        and, in company of a coast guard named mahmoud, he reached the attaks
                        mountains, where there is a coast guard station. The governor of Suez was at
                        once advised of the matter, and, accompanied by the chief of the police, a
                        doctor, and several gendarmes, proceeded to the spot to hold an enquiry.
                        Finally, gilvert was conveyed to the french hospital at suez, where he still
                        remains, on account of his wounds.</p>

                            wednesday evening to witness the final heat in the ablove handicap, when
                            a most enjoyable and exciting game was played between sergy. white,

                            (owing 70). The back-mark man commenced well, and quickly rubbed off his
                            points, but after this was unable to get going agin for some time. his
                            opponent meanwhile, by breaks of 20,12, and 15, was forging ahead
                            steadily and at one time held the lead by 62 points and appeared to have
                            the game well in hand, but the back mark man, nothing daunted, played a
                            most plucky game, and ultimately won, amidst great applause, by the
                            narrow margin of one point.</p>
