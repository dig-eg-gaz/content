                    <p>"How much is this the greatest event in history, and how much the best 1" So
                        exclaim- ed Charles James Fox in the first enthusiasm of the French
                        Revolution. We do not know whether the Battle of Mukden is likely to be
                        reckoned among the best events in history, but beyond question it is one of
                        the greatest We are not referring merely to the terrific scale of the
                        engagement itself, though nothing to equal it is to be found in the
                        authentic annals of mankind. If we dismiss the half-mythical battles of
                        ancient and mediaeval times, no such hosts of organized and disciplined
                        troops have ever been in action before ; and it may be that neither the
                        hordes of Xerxes, or Genghis Khan, or Tamerlane, or any other of the leaders
                        of armed races, ever left such an appalling multitude of dead and maimed men
                        on a battle-field as that which now strews the blood-stained hills and
                        valley of Manchuria. But it is not only this aspect of the matter which
                        gives the Titanic combat and the whole campaign its unique character. Great
                        battles, if none so great as this, there have been before, and will be
                        again. But perhaps there is no instance on record of an Empire shattered and
                        humbled with such startling rapidity. It has sometimes been said that there
                        is no parallel for the rise of Russia to the first rank among European
                        Powers. Is there any parallel for the swift completeness of its fall t
                        Empire, have been overthrown and have perished in the past; but we can
                        scarcely recall a caw in which the collapse has not been preceded >'? a long
                        period of gradual decadence and a contracted struggle with a steadily
                        growing rival. Egypt, Assyria, Persia, Parthia, came to naught, but it was
                        the work of centuries. Carthage was crushed, but only after generations of
                        struggle and three great wars with a mightier rival. Rome itself forfeited
                        its power eventually ; but the process of decay went on from age to age, and
                        from one widely-separated disaster to another. Spain, which in its
                        arrangement, its haughty pretensions, and its fierce grasp over two
                        continents, was a prototype of Russia, waned away into insignificance ; but
                        not until France and Britain and Holland had been hammering at the huge
                        fabric for two hundred thirty And Russia, till a few months ago, seemed as
                        mighty, as menacing, as impervious to external assault, at any of the
                        world-em- bracing States of the past. For a hundred and fifty years and more
                        that vast bulk has brood- ed, enormous and threatening, over Europe and
                        Asia. The history of the eighteenth and nine- tenth centuries is largely the
                        history of the rise of the Muscovite Tsardom to ah but the first place in
                        the hierarchy of the na- tions. From her first emergence out of mere
                        barbarism Russia assumed this haughty hurdle, and it was almost
                        unquestioningly conceded to her. "God has given me power over the nations,"
                        was Peter the Great's exulting exclamation. "Russia," said Frederick the
                        Great, "is a terrible Power. In another half century she will be making all
                        Europe tremble." The forecast of the astute Prussian monarch has been
                        fulfilled. Europe has been trembling over Russia ever since. As Metternich
                        said, Russia is a Power hungry-always wanting something more ; and the
                        statecraft of the West has been constantly occupied either in giving Russia
                        what she wanted or endeavoring more or less successfully to keep it from
                        her. The fear of Russia, the dread of that vague and massive force, is the
                        dominant note in all the international politics of the nineteeth century ;
                        and the relations with one another of Great Britain, France, Germany,
                        Austria, and Turkey were deeply influenced by it Russian aggression, Russian
                        ambition, Russian designs, were the perpetual subject for dis- cussion in
                        the cabinets, the chancelleries, and the newspapers ; but nobody hinted a
                        doubt of Russia's power, which went on growing to all appearance greater and
                        more pervasive from year to year. If she was to be arrested on her path, if
                        the momentum of that cosmic force was to be checked, it was not questioned
                        that it would take some almost impossible combination of the other naval and
                        military states to perlorm the task. Such was Russia, and so did Russia
                        tower aloft before the eyes of the world a short twelve months ago. And now,
                        Never could there be a more striking illustration of lines which when Byron
                        wrote them seemed exaggerated enough "A thousand years scarce serve to form
                        a f " [state, An hour may lay it in the dust" So it has been. As things go
                        in the cycle of history, it is but an hour since the hand was raised that
                        has dashed Russia helpless and broken^to the earth. It is no age-long
                        contest, no Thirty Years War, or series of public campaigns, that has
                        crumbled the strength of the Colossus and shivered its feet of clay: and no
                        combination of famous traditional opponents Iim been needed. A single small
                        nation which, before these events, was not even ranked among the leading
                        states of the world, has done the deed. Japan, "little Japan," as we should
                        have said a year ago, struck, and Russia fell. The Great Power of Europe and
                        Asia was revealed as a Great Weakness. Her navy was swept out of existence.
                        Her armies, ill-led and ill-organized, fought bravely enough; but .hey were
                        beaten, again and again, without one single gleam of success, until this
                        last fight has overwhelmed them in irretrievable loss. Russian diplomacy,
                        Russian foresight, Rusian obedience to the Autocracy, the Russian soldiers,
                        the Russian fleets—what are they Unlay 1 So sudden and speedy has been the
                        cataclysm that we can hardly yet grasp its full mowing add importance. As
                        for the possible and prospective results, a volume might be written. But for
                        the moment let us be content to familiarize our minds with the portentous
                        event as strange and significant as anything that has been witnessed for
                        centuries —the swift and tragic overthrow, by a despised and unknown
                        antagonist, emerging, as it were, from a hidden corner of the earth and
                        seas, of the mighty Empire that seemed to hold the fate of Europe and Asia
                        in in insatiable hands,</p>

                    <p>The Russian retreat continues very slowly. The Japanese, who are worn out,

                        remain in Manchuria, and has accepted the command of the First Army Corps.
                        It is believed that the Russian preparations will be renewed. The
                        mobilization will largely be undertaken, for the purpose of strengthening
                        the position in the event of peace negotiations. The place of origin of
                        Linievitch's dispatches is not disclosed. They are, apparently, oomipg from
                        the Sungari, where the forces from Russia are reaching him.(Reuter.)</p>

                        50,000. The Russian casualties from the commencement of the battle at Mukden
                        to Tieling are estimated at 175,000, including the prisoners. The damage to
                        the bridges is impeding the pursuit and will probably give the Russians time
                        to concentrate and reinforce, and to erect defenses with a view to holding
                        the line from Chaug chun to Kirin. Chang-chun is on the railway due west of

                    <p>Notice has been given to the Suez Canal Company that the Third Squadron of
                        the Baltic Fleet will arrive hereon Friday morning at dawn. I am not yet in
                        a position to give you full details of the composition of this squadron,
                        which is commanded by. Admiral Nqgobatoff, but of the 12 vessels four are
                        battleships, namely "Nicolai I" (flagship), "Admiral Aptaxini," "Admiral
                        Qushakoff," and "Admiral Scuiavin." There is one cruiser of very ancient
                        date, tho "Vladimir Monomak," and three transport, namely, "Livonia,"
                        "Kuronia," and "Swire." The hospital ship, "Koetrona,",has join ed this
                        squadron, which also included floating repairing shop in the vessel
                        "Rusenia." This accounts for 1O of the 12 ships com- prising this-squadron,
                        and I-think that in all probability,the other two will be the second- class
                        cruisers "Don" and "Okean" or else the transports "Aiphane" and "Stroganoff"
                        which, according to the Russian papers, are with the fleet. Thirty Russian
                        officers arrived here yester- day by the P. and the S.S "Mongolia" arid are
                        waiting for the Russian steamer to take them to Odessa. They're stopping at

                        speech made by the chairman (Mr. J. W. William- son): Gentlemen, — You have
                        heard the report read by the secretary: there is very little more; that 1
                        can add to the information contained, therein. Ot the total issued capital
                        of£60,000 a sum of £lO,OOO was paid, in shares, for the purchase of-your
                        Khatatbeh estate. A sum of about £15,600 has been expended on canals and
                        irrigation works. About £18,000 was expended: on buildings, machinery,
                        cattle, wells, leveling of lands. And all working expenses up to the 31st
                        December last, on which date we had a cash balance in the back, of about
                        13,600. This, together with the new issue of i£5,U00 shares at £6 5s.,
                        will-give us a working capital of over £60,000. As most of the necessary
                        building/ and canals are now finished, I consider we have ample lands to
                        bring our undertaking to a successful issue.</p>

                        <p> Sir,Neither the letter of "Navigator":nor the statement of the position
                            of the Ports and | Lighthouses Administration, in pegard to the very
                            severe conitiojams of the International Chamber of Shipping, help to
                            satisfactorily clear ap the highly important questions arising out of
                            the circumstances attending the wreck of the SS. "Cairo." In the scoount
                            published in the Gazette" of Setardey, last of| the official standpoint,
                            not one of the criticians passed by the Chamber of Shipping is answered.
                            Half of the article consists of an elaborate attempt to ignore the
                            existence of that institution-and, to bolster, up the argument; tha
                            ludicrous plea is put forward that its name does not appear in the
                            "Indicateur Egyptian." The remaining portion of the argument consists of
                            a severe lecture to the Chamber on its impertinence in having the
                            audacity bito discuss the matter at all because the affair Jis sub
                            judice.". According to this, no public body should discuss any matter of
                            pnblic, interest, about which a case was entered in the courts until
                            judgment had been finally givenmonths and possibly a year or two:after
                            it had happened-by the Mixed Court of Appeal. The Chamber is then
                            gravely informed that it should confine itself to matters affecting the
                            general interests of the shipping community 19 a whole." In the opinion
                            of coverybody I have discussed the matter with, the case Loft the
                            "Cairo" not only affects the entire shipping community but also concerns
                            the Egyptian public as a whole, and I am much indebted to the Chamber
                            for having the "impropriety-" to use the official expression--of airing
                            its views in the local Press. What the publie want to know is who was
                            responsible for the ten hours' delay in getting to the steamer.
                            "Navigator" states that "the official who is responsible for the port of
                            Alexandria and the interests thereof is the Captain of the Port." If
                            this is so, the Administration ought to publish &amp; plain statement of
                            the case, on behalfot that official, instead of trying to throw dust in
                            the eyes of the public by begging the question. The Chamber of Shipping
                            has made charges of the gravest concern to all who use the port of
                            Alexandria, and the public expect those charges to be rebutted. The
                            public do not care whether the captain of the "Cairo" did or did not use
                            the I published hydrographic instructions for entering by the Boghaz
                            pass, or whether the "Teir el-Mina" should or should not have watertube
                            boilers. What we want to know is whether &amp; passenger and mail
                            steamer that founders within sight of Alexandria can be allowed to
                            remain without any assistance at the meroy of the winds and waves for
                            ten hours and yet for not a single official of the Ports and Lighthouses
                            Administration to be responsible ? Unless the Administration makes &amp;
                            plain and straighforward statement in answer to this question, the
                            public will have only one answer, and if the "official standpoint," as
                            given in Saturday's "Gazette," be correct, the responsibility is
                            obvious. — I am, etę, </p>

                        forte diminution des ddpenses en mfime temps qu'un forte augmentation des
                        recettes. La valour des annuitds en 1904, capital et intdrfits compris,

                        1903. La diminution dans la superficie et la valeur des locations provient
                        de ce que 11,525 feddans louds pour L.R 10,764 ont dtd vendus et consignds

                    <head>THE COTTON WORM. THE PREMIER'S CIRCULAR.</head>
                    <p>Mustapha Pasha Fehmy's circular on the method to be employed in the
                        destruction of the cotton worm deserves to be given at length in English. It
                        is accompanied by a plate, drawn up by the Khedivial Agricultural Society,
                        giving figures of the cotton moth, its pupa, larva, add eggs. The circular
                        re- marks that since its appearance some years ago the worm has done great
                        damage, and instances the destruction of nearly half the crop in the Behera
                        province last year. The best way of combating the pest is to attack the eggs
                        as soon as they are laid, especially in cases where the cotton has begun to
                        form at the beginning of June. If young plants coming up in April are
                        attacked at the moment they come up from the soil the only thing to do is to
                        gather all the cater- pillars that can be found and sow afresh. In June the
                        eggs which are laid by the parent insect on the under side of one or two
                        leaves per plant near the stem in groups sometimes containing 300 ova,
                        should be picked and burnt 'Throwing them into canals and sakjehs is quite
                        useless. Incubation lasts three or four days, and it is of great import ance
                        to pick the leaves as soon as the eggs are laid. After two or three dayB the
                        newly- emerged larve quit the leaf and spread in all directions. They grow
                        rapidly, reaching maturity in from 18 to 22 days, when they drop to the
                        ground and pupate. The pupal (chrysalis) stage lasts from 8 to 10 days.
                        Within 24 to 48 hours of emergence Hie female is capable of laying eggs, and
                        this process occurs thrice in the summer, the first brood emerging in June
                        (we have seen the month in May, by the a ay), the next in July, and the
                        third in August. No risk is run if leaves on which ova have been deposited
                        are picked and burned without delay. Negligent cultivators are the cause of
                        great loss and damage to their more intelligent neighbours— hence the
                        Khedivial decree, the chief provi- sions of which we gave in our issue of
                        Saturday last In cases where the measures given above have been carried out
                        it is necessary to irrigate the cotton rather rapidly some 30 days after the
                        eggs have been laid, when the chrysalis has been 4 or 5 days in the ground
                        In June the bersim, on which the cotton worm also feeds, is all but over: as
                        soon as it has been cut the ground should be ploughed, and, if there has
                        been evidence of the existence of the pest on the bersim, it should be first
                        irrigated. Tho third generation of the cotton moth is most distinctive,
                        since the broods of June and July receive less attention than they deserve,
                        and after the bersim has disappeared all the caterpillars live on the
                        cotton. It is therefore necessary to insist on the importance of ener- getic
                        measures being taken in Juno and recom- menced in July and August. After the
                        promulgation of the decree in- structions will be issued for tho
                        organisation; of a service charged with its administration and with power to
                        take measures against any abuse that may arise from its application. We may
                        remark in this connection that the female cotton moth is attracted by light,
                        and that the destruction of females by this means might be pursued part
                        passed with the campaign against the ova. A lantern reflecting on to a white
                        sheet attracts this and many other moths, which fly against the sheet and
                        can be destroy- ed by a handy boy. Males are more numerous and should also
                        be destroyed for it takes two to make a caterpillar. The statement in the
                        circular that the moth is a new arrival in Egypt is of some interest if
                        accurate. Stand- ing, whose catalogue of the Palaearctio Lepi- doptem is the
                        standard work on the subject, gives its distribution as follows: Prodenia
                        littoralis. —Crete, Syria, Egypt, Canary Islands, Madeira and Africa in
                        general, Southern Asia, the Malay Archipelago, and Central America. Like
                        most insect pests the moth evidently has an unpleasantly wide
                        distribution!</p>

                    <head>THE STATE OPERA SEASON REVIEW OF PERFORMANCES</head>
                    <p>It is less easy than it might appear to review this subject ;so many
                        modifications inter vc"c and change any opinion one may form ; so many
                        alternations of good, bad, or indif ferent affect one's idea of each and all
                        the performances. But we must attack our subject: too much excuse argues a
                        weak case. On the whole, it was a disappointing season. To give the worst at
                        once, the repertoire was small, and not varied ; the singers, with one or
                        two exceptions, were not all that we consider Cairo has a right to expect;
                        staging, aud chorus, and orchestra were certainly good : there we bad our
                        money's worth. For details we may commence with the conductor. Maitre
                        Zuccani is undoubtedly a musician, and he has his orchestra well in hand;
                        they play in tune and in time; but his forte is climax rather than
                        interpretation, and, most vital point, he sacrifices the voices to the Test.
                        This was proved in Tristan and Mefistofele, the two test operas. Signor
                        Walter, to cite the chief case, has a beautiful voice, but not of that
                        strength one would desire. M. Zuccani, even by merely following his muBio
                        exactly, still more by appropriately modifying certain parts, could have not
                        only shown Signor Walter's voice at its best, but, we claim, would in no way
                        have missed his effects. He overvalues these, and therefore over emphasises
                        them, neglecting the quieter passages in anticipation of the loud and more
                        startling climax, where it may occur or be introduced. For repertoire, we
                        have said that variety and sufficiency was lacking ; for ourselves we modify
                        this by thanking the company for 6ix performances of Mefistofele, one of the
                        greatest Operas ever written. Even we could have welcomed more performances
                        of Tristan and Isolde. True, the presentment was imperfect; but such works
                        as these do not depend upon pre- senitment The rest was mostly Siberia, La
                        Tosco, Fedora, time after time, and far more often than necessary. Here,
                        again, we modify our statement, unfortunately at the expense of the company.
                        Rigoletto, as we have had to avow before, was so bad as to bar a section of
                        the company from appearing in any promi- nence : that naturally excluded all
                        similar operas. In fact, it would seem to us that the whole burden was borne
                        by the three or four principal singers ; and this may largely account for
                        such frequent repetition. Certainly the operas given were interesting,
                        Siberia and La Cabrera especially so; La Tosca showed us how Mile Pandolfini
                        can act; likewise Madame Butterfly and Fedora. For Mefistofele we would
                        refer to our colleague of the "Sphinx" He has evidently taken it as
                        seriously as any one,—perhaps more so— indeed it is far above any of the
                        rest As to the singers themselves, this is a far harder task. We at once
                        state that no per- sonal criticism is intended, and that a critic should, in
                        our opinion, never attack an artiste unless that artiste has failed—or has
                        not tried to use bis or her powers adequately. We therefore only blame two
                        of these, viz., the conductor, as before mentioned, who, we think, might
                        have (we are indeed convinced that he could have) thought more of his music
                        than of his "effects," and the light tenor, M. Andreini. M. Andreini has a
                        charming voice, and can and does sing well, and we are persuaded that he
                        could have made Rigoletto a success. We will touch on one other case. Mile.
                        Pinto, the leading soprano, has a fine voice and understands the use of it:
                        why should she, now and again, inflict on us an unwarrantable vibrato ? The
                        death of Marguerite, parts of Siberia, the duets in Tristan, were so
                        admirable and thorough, that we venture to affirm she would have done just
                        as well in those very details which proved sc trying elsewhere. For Mile.
                        Pandolfiui no one has anything but praise : it is a real plea- sure to see
                        such acting, and to listen to such singing. Signor Giraud, to us, seemed
                        really good in Siberia and in La Tosca, and his acting in Tristan was
                        excellent. Signor Bravi has a most charming voice, and as Faust he is at his
                        best. Both these artistes, we must say, have their special parts, and we
                        would not expect or desire perfection in what obviously does not suit them.
                        Signor Nani has a fine big voice; and this again is the same case. Signor
                        Polese also is a clever actor, especially in La Tosca. The rest all show
                        plenty of merit in due proportion. Signor Walter is, next to Signora
                        Pandolfini, the greatest artist of all, but we have already said that his
                        voice had not a fair chance. The impression, produced by this season as a
                        whole, is, in a few words, as follows: the voices were not (with the
                        exceptions of Mile Pinto and Sig. Nani) strong enough for the theatre. This
                        we affirm to be in fact the fault of the theatre in part and that of the
                        conductor. We say that the ensemble did not justify the choice, that however
                        good all concerned may be in their respective theaters, they do not and
                        cannot give us what we should have here. One is reminded of a "team" chosen
                        at hazard, for individual merit, instead of a company, a unity, which should
                        give that adequacy of result demanded by the condi tions. We cite in
                        conclusion, and from neces- sity, not from any idea of controversy with
                        other Cairo papers,—the Verdi Theatre. That theatre was an "Opera Comique,"
                        in no way supplanting, but supplementing, our Grand Opera. We do not care to
                        think that com- parison should be needed: each enterprise should stand by
                        itself: and for the Grand Opera to have to avow that the "Verdi" has done
                        better, — even as well — has encountered it on its own ground, is at least
                        illogical. Of course, for such singers as Signa. Svicher, or Signa
                        Bellincioni no such statement cau apply : but surely it should not be
                        necessary to compare the other voices : the Khedivial Opera gives us one
                        side, the "Verdi" an- other if both attempt the same objects.</p>

                        <p>The change in weather which occurred monday became more pronounced
                            yesterday, when Alexandria was plunged into the depth of winter again.
                            The morning was wet, several heavy showers of rain falling. At noon,
                            there was quite a squall of wind, rain and hail. The afternoon was
                            showery and uncertain and towards the evening the wind rose again. The
                            barometer is now sightly rising. </p>
