                            consider it critical. The "Standard" is not surprised that the Japanese
                            are bitterly aggrieved at the assistance given to their enemy, but
                            trusts that they will refrain from any. semblance of dictation. Tokio
                            will be playing the game of St. Peters- burg by introducing into the war
                            a new factor of au incalculable magnitude.</p>
                        <p>The "Morning Post" says that nobody in England dreams of escaping the
                            obligations of the Japanese alliance. The maintenance of tho entente
                            cordiale is only possible if Great Britain and France will abstain from
                            assisting their respective allies. People in Great Britain rely on the
                            chivalry of the French to strictly observe neutrality. (Reuter.)</p></div>

                    <p>Khartoum, May 2. One of the most important irrigation schemes under
                        consideration in the Sudan is the pro- posed canal across El Ghezireh,
                        whereby the White end Blue Niles will be connected,and so form a main canal
                        which will extend to Khar- toum. Great difficulties are likely to be en-
                        countered in the realisation of the scheme, but when the canal is completed
                        it will prove of the greatest utility to the lands it will traverse, and
                        will repay all the difficulties of construc- tion.</p>

                        country enjoys in the English Press at the present time, appears to have
                        given many people at home and in the colonies the opinion that it is a
                        likely country to emigrate to. We have received some letters asking for
                        advice on the subject, of which the following is a sample:—</p>
                    <p>"Dear Sir,—There are a lot of young men down here, who are wishing to go up
                        to Egypt or in that direction. If you could advise mo through your colomns
                        as to what prospects there are likely to be you will greatly oblige.—Yours

                    <p>In regard to the above, we earnestly advise these young men of the Orange
                        Free State to refrain from starting for Egypt without having first obtained
                        satisfactory, assurance as to the situations they will fill on arriving
                        here. To come to Egypt on the look-out for something to "turn up" may in
                        some cases turn out a successful venture. But for "a lot" of young men to
                        arrive here on the off chance of finding appointments will only lead to
                        disappointments.</p>

                        At the monthly meeting of tho association Mr. A.CD. Crommelin, the presi-
                        dent, intimated to its members that if was imperative that every class of
                        observation should be taken. With this end b view endea- vours are being
                        made to dispatch parties or observers to Egypt and Labrador, the object
                        being, of course, to take full advantage of the fact that this year, for the
                        first time for many, there will be a long totality, of eclipse visible in
                        these and other accessible places. As the association lacks nothing b zeal,
                        energy, and enterprise in the pursuance of both observation red research, it
                        is certain that the arrange- ments for the sending of observers to Egypt and

                        October, 1906. It will contain 250 rooms and will accommodate 280 people. </p>

                        remark that it is a little strange that this gentleman is a prominent member
                        of the only shipping association in England which has no con- nection with
                        the Chamber of Shipping. The Chamber has for a length of time been at the
                        root of all the agitation for a reduction in rates on ships going through
                        the Canal and fo the appointment of a representative "tramp" owner on the
                        board. In Mr. Hughes, the Bri- tish ship-owner, it is firmly believed, will
                        be moat ably represented. He is a gentleman whose connection with one of the
                        most goahead firms in England is well-known, and if reductions and drastic
                        alterations are in any way possible, tip interest of the British ship owner,

                    <head>THE PIGMIES AT CAIRO. SIR H. JOHNSTONE'S OPINION.</head>
                    <p>In regard to the permission, sanctioned by Lord Cromer and the Foreign
                        Office, for the pigmies to leave Cairo for England, as announc- ed in our
                        issue of yesterday, it is worth noting that the humanitarian protest that
                        has been raised against Colonel Harrison's enterprise of bringng specimens
                        of the pigmy or Akka race from the African interior is met by the more than
                        sufficient reason that the little people have desired for some years past
                        for a few of their people to make the trip. And the views put forward b the
                        follow- ing conversation, coming as they do from an independent and eminent
                        authority, should correct a deal of illusion that has been generally
                        entertained concerning the project and its aims.</p>
                    <p>Sir Harry Johnstone, interviewed by a Pressman, illustrated several of his
                        points by drawing attention to a couple of water-colour sketches from his
                        own accomplished pencil. One represented a man and woman of the races in
                        question; the other a native of a neighbouring tribe of higher caste and
                        origin. The pigmies—both typical—reveal a copper- coloured tinge of skin, an
                        obesity of build possibly due to overmuch squatting, and certain negroid
                        qualities of feature — the swollen lips, spatulate nose, receding forehead
                        and half-frizzy hair. The type in the sketch alongside might rank as an
                        aristocrat not only in this region but anywhere else, by virtue of a certain
                        nobility and command in his facial expression, and a featuring not unlike
                        the faces that come to light in the mummies of his ancestral Egypt But it is
                        with the baser race that we are at present occupied, and Sir Harry Johnston
                        had some- thing to say at the outset regarding his own attitude in the
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>THE HUMANITARIAN VIEW.</p>
                    <p>"I never resented interest," he said, "on the part of persons in England
                        whose concern is for races unable to protect themselves, as no doubt Exeter
                        Hall and all that it implies have again and again kept the British nation in
                        the right track as regards its treatment of defenceless people. At the same
                        time, the parallels advanced by those who wrote to protest against Colonel
                        Harrison's bringing these people to England were not altogether correct. My
                        own action was quoted in having, first, stopped a German who kidnapped a
                        large number of pigmies in the Congo forest for the purpose of exhibiting
                        them in Paris and, secondly, for having sent back pigmies to their homes who
                        had come to us at their own wish in order that they should be taken to
                        England to greet England's new King.</p>
                    <p>"With regard to the first case, the German in question was refused permission
                        by the Belgian authorities in the Congo Free State to recruit pigmies for
                        conveyance to the Paris Exhibition. In spite of this prohibition he had
                        entered the forest where these pigmies lived, had lured them to his camp by
                        small presents of trade goods, and had then suddenly kid- napped a number of
                        them whom be placed in bonds and conveyed out of the forest by devious
                        tracks until be reached British territory."</p>
                    <p>THEIR DESIRE TO SEE ENGLAND.</p>
                    <p>"Did they show their gratitude?" we inquir- ed.</p>
                    <p>" Certainly. One result of my conveying these pigmies back to their own homes
                        was a much-increased interest in the white people, especially those of the
                        race that ruled in Uganda; and it is a fact that a few-months afterwards
                        several pigmies came to me at Entebbe and asked to be taken to England to
                        see the new King. At that time, however, I was in indifferent health, and
                        did not feel able to take upon myself the responsibility of conveying these
                        little people to England, looking after their health and comfort, and then
                        taking mea- sures to have them safely transported bock to their homes.</p>
                    <p>"In Colonel Harrison's case I happen to know that he has omitted no
                        formality, and that the pigmies really wish to accompany him to see what
                        England is like. About four years ago the wife of a German official in
                        German East Africa took two pigmy women back with her to Berlin, who had
                        previously been in her service in Africa, and proved very deft
                        maid-servants. They stayed about a year in Berlin, and on their return to
                        the interior of East Africa appeared to have brought back very favourable
                        accounts of the way in which pigmies were treated by white men."</p>
                    <p>CONSIDERATIONS OF PIGMY HEALTH.</p>
                    <p>"There is no reason, of course," we remark- ed, "why the present visit should
                        not have the same happy results."</p>
                    <p>"No," was the reply, "but I do not think that it would be right that these
                        pigmies who have come with Colonel Harrison should be made a show of. Let
                        them spend two or three months in our country and then return to their own
                        land. If they are able to take back favorable impressions, and, above all,
                        if their health has not suffered, then it may be time to conaider an
                        invitation for a large number to come amongst us, as the Somalis have done,
                        and exhibit their curious and interesting dances and songs."</p>
                    <p>On this same question of health—and, after all, it is the most important
                        aspect of the question—Sir Harry Johnston forbore to say anything for fear
                        of being betrayed into pro- phecy. He remarked, however, that the pigmies
                        are hardy enough while leading a forest life, and it is only when they
                        emerge into glaring sunshine like that of Egypt that they exhibit any
                        physical weakness or discomfort. The natural retort to this is that England
                        is not likely to disturb their physical balance by sunshine in excess ; and
                        after this view on our part. Sir Harry passed on to discuss their remarkable
                        natural powers and quickness of a apprehension. He recounted how is his
                        first <cb n="6"/> dealings with them he was at a loss for fear mouths,
                        simply because of their ignorance of any language he was acquainted with;
                        but when they set themselves to master the rudi- ments of Arabic their
                        progress was amazing.</p>

                    <head>DIPLOMATIC AND MISSIONARY ASPECTS.</head>
                    <p>"If only these pigmies are properly treated," Sir Harry continued, "and sent
                        back with good reports, it may have the most potent effect b bringing this
                        race into touch with so much civilisation as would benefit them. In this
                        respect we cannot do better than persuade the Church Missionary Society of
                        Uganda to establish a branch of their mission b pigmy- land, to do for the
                        pigmies just what it has done for the Baganda—that is to say, not to attempt
                        to turn them into coloured imitations of white people, dressed in utterly
                        unsuitable white men's clothes; but to teach them to lead healthy, happy,
                        and useful lives.</p>
                    <p>"The work of the missionaries in Uganda has been so absolutely successful
                        that it ought to serve as a model for all mission work in other parts of
                        Africa. This opinion is echoed, I may say, by every recent administrator of
                        those parts of Africa. In a way, it reminds me of the work of the French in
                        Tunis. The French have everywhere introduced law, order, safety, comfort,
                        cheapness, and celerity of transport into Tunis without disturbing one
                        particle of the picturesqueness of the country. In the same way, missionary
                        work in the Uganda Protectorate has relieved the people from a most
                        oppressive and bloodthirsty from of religion, and from an immorality which
                        was rapidly leading to depopulation. It has done more, for it has introduoed
                        just that amount of the white man's civilisation which is suited to the
                        native of equatorial Africa; and yet, marvellous to relate, there is no cant
                        and no hypocrisy. I should strongly recommend, as the first missionary to
                        the pigmies, such a man as Mr. A. B. Fisher or Mr. Maddox, both of whom have
                        done such excellent work b approaching and rendering friendly hitherto
                        recalcitrant tribes on the western borderland of Uganda."</p>

                    <p>My friend, have you heard of the town of Yawn, On the banks of the River
                        Slow, Where booms the Wait—a-while flower fair, And the Some-time-or-other
                        scents the air, And the soft Go-easys grow </p>
                    <p>It lies in the valley of What's-the-use, In the province of Let-her-slide ;
                        That old "tired feeling" is native there— It's the home of the listless
                        I-don't-care— Where the Put-it-offs abide.</p>
                    <p>The Put-it-offs smile when asked to pay up, And they say "Well do it

                        steals them away, And the creditors beg, steal, or borrow. </p>

                    <p>It is very rare for a soldier to leave money in his will to the officers or
                        men of bis regi. ment; it is still more rare for him to be in 1 position to
                        do 30. On September 12 lust ther died &amp; Mr. Thomas Good, formerly &amp;
                        sergeant in the 14th (mw the Prince of Wales's Own) West Yorkshire Regiment.
                        By his will he has left estate of the value of over £7,000 to the officers
                        of the 2nd Battalion of the regimen, which he calls his "old happy home." He
                        wishes the money expended in the purchase and maintenance of an officers'
                        library in the regiment, and in the purchase of plate for the mess if any
                        money remains over. The good oli soldier also left two houses at Ryde for
                        the use of old officers of the regiment, at &amp; nominal rent. In the High
                        Court of Justice the bequest, 80 far as the library is concerned, was
                        declared Bound nd in order, but it was held that the gift of the two ho es
                        failed for perpetuity, an! that there was a consequent intestacy,</p>
                    <p>It is impossible to pronounce &amp; sound opinion at present on the reported
                        friction between the Commander-in-Chief in India and the Military Member of
                        Council. It seems, how ever, to be clear that a dual system of control
                        exists, which, it is conceivable to believe, must be very objectionable to a
                        man of the power and temperament of Lord Kitchener, leavir 2 the policy of
                        the system out of the question in the administration of the Army in India it
                        is necessary, for instance, for all proposals involving policy emanating
                        from the Com. mander-in-Chief to be submitted to the Military Department for
                        sanction, so that his powers Are seriously curtailed. The result is that,
                        though Lord Kitchener is at the head of the Indian Army, and, in the eyes of
                        the public, responsible for its entire working, in practice he has no
                        control over such matters as finance, equipment, guns, ammunition, etc. That
                        there is a serious disagreement on the subject between the Government of
                        India and the Commander-in-Chief is very probable. No doubt there are two
                        sides to the question. It is held by the Indian Council that the department
                        of the Military Member of Council represents the administrative side of the
                        Army, and that of the Commander-in-Chief the execu tive side. To alter this
                        would, they fear, turn even an ordinary Commander-in-Chief into a sort of
                        military dictator; and knowing what they do of Lord Kitchener of Khartoum,
                        the Council anticipate being ruled with a rod of iron. The difficulty is a
                        very serious one, involving the possible withdrawal of perhaps our greatest
                        soldier from the most important military cornmand in the Empire.</p>
                    <p>
                        Two professions are not over-stocked. Whil. the Church
                            laments &amp; scarcity of curates, the Ariny suffers from a dearth of
                            officers. In the Foot Guards alone, says Colonel the Barl of Erroll in
                            the "Nineteen'h Century," the deficiencies amount to between forty and
                            fifty, and the Cavalry are abou. the same number below their
                            establishment. The reason given by his Lordship for the defection is
                            that the offioer with means and other opportunities is having his spirit
                            broken by hard work and barder criticism, and that the officer without
                            means cannot ponrisb inilitary ardour on star. vation wages. The
                            deduction is that we must either pay more or grumble less. Which really
                            leaves the public without an alternative, for drop criticism they
                            cannot, nor would it be good for the Army if they did. As Lord Erroll
                            believes in fox hunting and polo as the best training for a Cavalry
                            officer, it is obvious that he would have as incrase the rate of pay to
                            an alarming extent A living wage for the officer of his Lordelip's ideal
                            would be equal to the income of a landed proprietor ; and if the Anny is
                            to go without officers till the nation makes up its mind to such an
                            expend. iture we shall be in a very bad way indeed. There is, of conte,
                            a counsel of 'moderation : to get on as well as we can without fox
                            hunting As an element of military Education, and to pay fairly, though
                            not extravagantly. Thereby we may make the Army a desirable profession,
                            instead of a play ground for some, starvation for others,

                        CONSULS--AND CAPITULATIONS</head>
                    <p>IV</p>
                    <p>Our great commercial treaty with Turkey in 1675 assurel liberty of trade and
                        naviga. tion, release from slavery, and freedom from molestation. Disputes
                        between Englishmen were to be settled by the Ambassador, or local consul.
                        Disputes between Englishmen and natives were to be settled by the native
                        judge in the presence of the Ambassador or his ropresentative. The fees of
                        the chiaux for commission in recovery of debt were cut down to two per cent.
                        and 'not an asper more.'</p>
                    <p> Thus there was an end put to chowsing, and to the arbitrary, imprisonment
                        and torture of consuls or private individuals. This treaty was confirmed by
                        another in 1861, which stated :-"Fair construction of treaty. Turkish "right
                        of internal administration. It is always " understood that Her Britannic
                        Majesty does "not pretend by any article in the present "treaty to stipulate
                        for more than the plain " and fair construction of the terms employed, "nor
                        to preclude in any manner the Ottoman "Government from the exercise of its
                        rights of - internal administration, where the exercise </p>
                    <p> of these rights does not evidently infringe " upon the privileges socorded
                        by ancient "treaties or by the present treaty to British "subjects or
                        British merchandise. ". </p>
                    <p>Now, the treaty of 1675 laid down :</p>
                    <p> "Article X. Injuries inflicted by an Eng. "lishman. Interference of
                        Ambassadors. If "åny shall calumniate an Englishman by " asserting that he
                        hath been injured by him, " and producing false witnesses against him, "our
                        judges shall not give ear to them, but " the cause shall be referred to his
                        ambassador ' in order to his deciding the same and that " he may always have
                        course to his pro"tection. </p>
                    <p>"XV. That in all litigation occurring be"tween the English and any other
                        person, the</p>
                    <p> judges shall not proceed to hear the case " without the presence of an
                        interpreter." </p>
                    <p>XXIV. That if an Englishman shall be in. " volved in any law suit or other
                        matter con"nected with law, the judges shall not hear "nor decide there on
                        until the ambassador, "consul, or interpreter shall be present."</p>
                    <p>"XLII. Criminal suits. Extra-territorial "jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p>"It an Englishman happens to commit - manslaughter or any other crime, or be
                        " thereby involved in a lawsuit, the governors " of our dominious shall not
                        hear the case " until the ambassador or consul be present, " but they shall
                        hear and decide it together, " without their presuming to give the English
                        "any molestation by hearing it alone."</p>
                    <p>Such are the capitulations relating to British subjects throughout the
                        Ottoman Dominions including Egypt. For civil suits in Egypt special
                        conventions were made in 1875, the various Christian countries, Burope and
                        the United States, combining their separate rights in the Mixed Tribunals,
                        which assumed a certain amount of jurisdiction instead of the consulates.
                        But there does not seem to be any similar abrogation of the Capitulations in
                        criminal cases. To understand this matter arught one should have lived at
                        Constantinople before coming to Egypt, and the contrast would then be vivid.
                        At Constantinople under the Capitulations if a foreigner commits &amp;
                        breach of the peace, assaults a native or resists the police, he is tried in
                        the native court in presence of a consular dragoman who acts as an assessor:
                        But if a similar offence is committed in Egypt the foreigner is tried by bis
                        consul, and the police or native plaintiff must appear as witnesses. By this
                        custom the foreigner gains something in addition to the capitulations, while
                        the native police (or individual) has lost its rights under the
                        capitulations,</p>
                    <p> Some readers may say: "That this all very well, but we are not going to be
                        tried by a native court, we prefer our own consular court." In the first
                        place, the respectable reader is not likely to be tried in either court for
                        drunk. enness, disorder, breach of the peace; but if he were tried in the
                        native court, bis consul would attend himself or send an experienced
                        dragoman, and if the latter did not approve of the sentence, he would not
                        sign it, and it would remain in abeyance for reference to the Consul.
                        general. Under Article X. above-quoted, the consul.general would decide if
                        it were a case of calumny and false witness. But these references would be
                        very rare; the various consular delegates would act all the year round with
                        the natives judges, and one great result would be achieved, -- the police
                        would be improved. Now, the capitulations are mutual. The British defendant
                        in Turkey is brought up before the Turkish police court, and the Turkish
                        defendant in England is brought before the English police-court. But the
                        British defendant in Egypt is brought before his consular court If the
                        present composition of these courts is defective, they can be improved;
                        foreign judges can be appointed as in the mixed civil tribunals ; but there
                        can be no doubt that the proper place to try the foreigner accused of a
                        breach of the peace is the tribunal of the Egyptian Government and not his
                        consulate. Those who profit by the present anomaly are the 'undesirables',
                        the drunk-and-disorderlies, gain blers, smugglers, keepers of low houses,
                        sellers of improper pictures and literatare. It behoves serious respectable
                        people to consider the situation. </p>
