                    <p>Paris, May 9. The Japanese Minister has not lodged a formal protest, but
                        pointed oat the facilities accorded to the Russians for concentrating and
                        revictualling in Indo China. M. Delcassé as- sured him that France will
                        scrupulously respect neutrality. (Reuter.)</p>
                    <p>Paris, May 9. The French resent considerably the charge that they have
                        violated the neutrality. They insist that they have done everything possible
                        from the moment Admiral Rodjestvensky arrived unannounced at Kamaranh. They
                        are certainly now bestirring themselves to move on Admiral Rodjestvensky
                        whenever he shows signs of stopping in French waters. (Reuter.)</p>
                    <p>Paris, May 9. France has given formal orders to prevent the, junction of
                        Rodjestvensky’s and Niebo- gatoff’s squadrons in Indo-Chinese waters.
                        Admiral de Jonquiecres confirms the depar- ture of the Russian squadron from
                        Vanfong for an unknown destination. (Reuter.)</p>

                    <p>London, May 9. The newspapers admit that the situation is unsatisfactory but
                        do not consider it critical. The "Standard” is not surprised that the
                        Japanese are bitterly aggrieved at the assist- ance given to their enemy,
                        but trusts that they will refrain from any. semblance of dictation. Tokio
                        will be playing the game of St. Peters- burg by introducing into the war a
                        new factor of au incalculable magnitude.</p>
                    <p>The "Morning Post" says that nobody in England dreams of escaping the
                        obligations of the Japanese alliance. The maintenance of tho entente
                        cordiale is only possible if Great Britain and France will abstain from
                        assisting their respective allies. People in Great Britain rely on the
                        chivalry of the French to strictly observe neutrality. (Reuter.)</p>

                    <p>St. Petersburg, May 9. The Russian correspondents in Manchuria concur in
                        believing that the Japanese are moving slowly and surely under the screen of
                        advanced posts so impenetrable that our cavalry can learn nothing.

                        Emperor to the naval recruits on tLe 9th March. The Emperor Wil- liam said

                        he hoped it would riot be punished some day as Russia is now being punished
                        by Japan, which is acting as God’s scourge like Attila and Napoleon.

                    <p>Khartoum, May 2. One of the most important irrigation schemes under

                        countered in the realisation of the scheme, but when the canal is completed
                        it will prove of the greatest utility to the lands it will traverse, and
                        will repay all the difficulties of construc- tion.</p>

                        given many people at home and in the colonies the opinion that it is a

                        At the monthly meeting of tho association Mr. A.CD. Crommelin, the presi-
                        dent, intimated to its members that if was imperative that every class of
                        observation should be taken. With this end b view endea- vours are being
                        made to dispatch parties or observers to Egypt and Labrador, the object
                        being, of course, to take full advantage of the fact that this year, for the
                        first time for many, there will be a long totality, of eclipse visible in
                        these and other accessible places. As the association lacks nothing b zeal,
                        energy, and enterprise in the pursuance of both observation red research, it
                        is certain that the arrange- ments for the sending of observers to Egypt and
                        Labrador will be brought to a satisfactory completion.</p>

                        it is expected that the hotel will be ready for the reception of visitors by
                        October, 1906. It will contain 250 rooms and will accommodate 280 people. </p>
                    <p>The construction of a new wing to the Cataract Hotel at Assouan has already
                        been commenced. This wing will accommodate 75 visitors.</p>
                    <p>The Grand Hotel at Assouan is also being enlarged this year and rooms for 75
                        tourists are to be provided.</p>

                        all its properties are bound to rise in value, and the board of di- rectors

                        the Chamber of Shipping. The Chamber has for a length of time been at the
                        root of all the agitation for a reduction in rates on ships going through

                    <head>THE PIGMIES AT CAIRO. SIR H. JOHNSTONE'S OPINION.</head>
                    <p>In regard to the permission, sanctioned by Lord Cromer and the Foreign
                        Office, for the pigmies to leave Cairo for England, as announc- ed in our
                        issue of yesterday, it is worth noting that the humanitarian protest that
                        has been raised against Colonel Harrison's enterprise of bringng specimens
                        of the pigmy or Akka race from the African interior is met by the more than
                        sufficient reason that the little people have desired for some years past
                        for a few of their people to make the trip. And the views put forward b the
                        follow- ing conversation, coming as they do from an independent and eminent
                        authority, should correct a deal of illusion that has been generally
                        entertained concerning the project and its aims.</p>
                    <p>Sir Harry Johnstone, interviewed by a Pressman, illustrated several of his
                        points by drawing attention to a couple of water-colour sketches from his
                        own accomplished pencil. One represented a man and woman of the races in
                        question; the other a native of a neighbouring tribe of higher caste and
                        origin. The pigmies—both typical—reveal a copper- coloured tinge of skin, an
                        obesity of build possibly due to overmuch squatting, and certain negroid
                        qualities of feature — the swollen lips, spatulate nose, receding forehead
                        and half-frizzy hair. The type in the sketch alongside might rank as an
                        aristocrat not only in this region but anywhere else, by virtue of a certain
                        nobility and command in his facial expression, and a featuring not unlike
                        the faces that come to light in the mummies of his ancestral Egypt But it is
                        with the baser race that we are at present occupied, and Sir Harry Johnston
                        had some- thing to say at the outset regarding his own attitude in the
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>THE HUMANITARIAN VIEW.</p>
                    <p>"I never resented interest,” he said, "on the part of persons in England
                        whose concern is for races unable to protect themselves, as no doubt Exeter
                        Hall and all that it implies have again and again kept the British nation in
                        the right track as regards its treatment of defenceless people. At the same
                        time, the parallels advanced by those who wrote to protest against Colonel
                        Harrison’s bringing these people to England were not altogether correct. My
                        own action was quoted in having, first, stopped a German who kidnapped a
                        large number of pigmies in the Congo forest for the purpose of exhibiting
                        them in Paris and, secondly, for having sent back pigmies to their homes who
                        had come to us at their own wish in order that they should be taken to
                        England to greet England’s new King.</p>
                    <p>"With regard to the first case, the German in question was refused permission
                        by the Belgian authorities in the Congo Free State to recruit pigmies for
                        conveyance to the Paris Exhibition. In spite of this prohibition he had
                        entered the forest where these pigmies lived, had lured them to his camp by
                        small presents of trade goods, and had then suddenly kid- napped a number of
                        them whom be placed in bonds and conveyed out of the forest by devious
                        tracks until be reached British territory."</p>
                    <p>THEIR DESIRE TO SEE ENGLAND.</p>
                    <p>“Did they show their gratitude?” we inquir- ed.</p>
                    <p>" Certainly. One result of my conveying these pigmies back to their own homes
                        was a much-increased interest in the white people, especially those of the
                        race that ruled in Uganda; and it is a fact that a few-months afterwards
                        several pigmies came to me at Entebbe and asked to be taken to England to
                        see the new King. At that time, however, I was in indifferent health, and
                        did not feel able to take upon myself the responsibility of conveying these
                        little people to England, looking after their health and comfort, and then
                        taking mea- sures to have them safely transported bock to their homes.</p>
                    <p>"In Colonel Harrison's case I happen to know that he has omitted no
                        formality, and that the pigmies really wish to accompany him to see what
                        England is like. About four years ago the wife of a German official in
                        German East Africa took two pigmy women back with her to Berlin, who had
                        previously been in her service in Africa, and proved very deft
                        maid-servants. They stayed about a year in Berlin, and on their return to
                        the interior of East Africa appeared to have brought back very favourable
                        accounts of the way in which pigmies were treated by white men.”</p>
                    <p>CONSIDERATIONS OF PIGMY HEALTH.</p>
                    <p>“There is no reason, of course,” we remark- ed, “why the present visit should
                        not have the same happy results.”</p>
                    <p>"No," was the reply, "but I do not think that it would be right that these
                        pigmies who have come with Colonel Harrison should be made a show of. Let
                        them spend two or three months in our country and then return to their own
                        land. If they are able to take back favor- able impressions, and, above all,
                        if their health has not suffered, then it may be time to con- aider an
                        invitation for a large number to come amongst us, as the Somalis have done,
                        and exhibit their curious and interesting dances and songs."</p>
                    <p>On this same question of health—and, after all, it is the most important
                        aspect of the question—Sir Harry Johnston forbore to say anything for fear
                        of being betrayed into pro- phecy. He remarked, however, that the pigmies
                        are hardy enough while leading a forest life, and it is only when they
                        emerge into glaring sunshine like that of Egypt that they exhibit any
                        physical weakness or discomfort. The natural retort to this is that England
                        is not likely to disturb their physical balance by sunshine in excess ; and
                        after this view on onr part. Sir Harry passed on to discuss their remarkable
                        natural powers and quickness of a apprehension. He recounted how is his
                        first <cb n="6"/> dealings with them he was at a loss for fear mouths,
                        simply because of their ignorance of any language he was acquainted with;
                        but when they set themselves to master the rudi- ments of Arabic their
                        progress was amazing.</p>

                    <p>“If only these pigmies are properly treated," Sir Harry continued, "and sent
                        back with good reports, it may have the most potent effect b bringing this
                        race into touch with so much civilisation as would benefit them. In this
                        respect we cannot do better than persuade the Church Missionary Society of
                        Uganda to establish a branch of their mission b pigmy- land, to do for the
                        pigmies just what it has done for the Baganda—that is to say, not to attempt
                        to turn them into coloured imitations of white people, dressed in utterly
                        unsuitable white men's clothes; but to teach them to lead healthy, happy,
                        and useful lives.</p>
                    <p>"The work of the missionaries in Uganda has been so absolutely successful
                        that it ought to serve as a model for all mission work in other parts of
                        Africa. This opinion is echoed, I may say, by every recent administrator of
                        those parts of Africa. In a way, it reminds me of the work of the French in
                        Tunis. The French have everywhere introduced law, order, safety, comfort,
                        cheapness, and celerity of transport into Tunis without disturbing one
                        particle of the picturesqueness of the country. In the same way, missionary
                        work in the Uganda Protectorate has relieved the people from a most
                        oppressive and bloodthirsty from of religion, and from an immorality which
                        was rapidly leading to depopulation. It has done more, for it has introduoed
                        just that amount of the white man’s civilisation which is suited to the
                        native of equatorial Africa; and yet, marvellous to relate, there is no cant
                        and no hypocrisy. I should strongly recommend, as the first missionary to
                        the pigmies, such a man as Mr. A. B. Fisher or Mr. Maddox, both of whom have
                        done such excellent work b approaching and rendering friendly hitherto
                        recalcitrant tribes on the western borderland of Uganda."</p>

                    <p>My friend, have you heard of the town of Yawn, On the banks of the River
                        Slow, Where booms the Wait—a-while flower fair, And the Some-time-or-other
                        scents the air, And the soft Go-easys grow </p>
                    <p>It lies in the valley of What’s-the-use, In the province of Let-her-slide ;
                        That old “tired feeling" is native there— It's the home of the listless
                        I-don't-care— Where the Put-it-offs abide.</p>
                    <p>The Put-it-offs smile when asked to pay up, And they say "Well do it
                        to-morrow” ; And so they delay from day unto day, Till death sidles up and
                        steals them away, And the creditors beg, steal, or borrow. Calendar of
