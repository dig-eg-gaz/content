                    <head>THE DENISHWAI AFFAIR AND THE PRESS.</head>
                    <p>To abstain from comment on matters that are literally subjudice is a prudent
                        and an equitable course, and in our opinion the attitude of a section of the
                        Press during the recent trial was decidedly ill advised. A court composed as
                        was the special court which tried the Denishwai prisoners, does not require
                        the advice of the Press as to its duties, nor does it need coaching on legal
                        points, and the attitude which assumes from the outset of a trial that
                        justice will not be done cannot be commended for its fairness or wisdom. The
                        court found that the crime was premeditated, that the officers were not
                        responsible for the wounding of a woman and three fellaheen (which in their
                        opinion was caused by the accidental explosion of <persName>Lieut.
                            Porter</persName>'s gun for which several of the robbers were
                        struggling), that <persName>Major Pine Coffin</persName>'s efforts to calm
                        the excited crowd were responded to by a general attack, and that the
                        officers were wounded, robbed, and treated with cowardly brutality by an
                        excited mob. Under these circumstances is inflicted the death penalty on the
                        most guilty of the accused, and in our opinion rightly.</p>
                    <p>Some of our contemporaries have enlarged on the thesis of one of the counsel
                        for the defence that elemency is higher than justice. We should have thought
                        that justice, the demand for which gave <placeName>England</placeName> her
                        Magna Charta, and <placeName>France</placeName> the reforms brought about by
                        the Revolution, was the one indispensable accompaniment of the
                        administration of a modern state, but in these days sympathy appears to
                        follow the criminal rather than his victim. The latter is pitied and buried,
                        but the criminal becomes the object of universal commiseration. Poor fellow!
                        He was so ignorant! He did not realize that when he planned the murder of a
                        man who had done him no harm he was doing wrong! Would not some of these
                        sympathetic critics demand fire and sword for the murder of one of their
                        relations? In our opinion the sympathisers with the criminal lose sight of
                        the fact that punishment via inflicted as a means to an end A. is hanged not
                        because he has murdered B., but to prevent the murder of others, and on this
                        principle the world has long acted and will long continue to act. Certain
                        States inflict the most rigorous penal servitude for life on the worst
                        criminals, exchanging for a rapid death a slower, but almost equally fatal
                        process, and dooming a number of respectable and honest persons to the task
                        of looking after some of the vilest human types. We cannot praise the
                        compromise.</p>
                    <p>As for the Denishwai judgment, the object of the judges was to prevent a
                        recurrence of similar outrage, and we shall be greatly surprised if
                        Europeans of all nationalities and the millions of respectable Egyptians who
                        dwell in the provinces do not benefit by the verdict and its publication.
                        The condemnation of the unfortunate wretches who meet their fate today may
                        prove the salvation of a host of honest peaceable folk, and when a section
                        of the Press demands clemency it appears to forget that a severe detterent
                        is often as necessary to the State as the eradication of a cancer to the
                        human body.</p>

                    <p>As telegraphed you this morning, the Special Tribunal assembled for the
                        passing of the sentences upon the prisoners who had been found guilty of
                        participating in greater or lesser degrees in the attack upon five British
                        officers at Denishwai on the 13th inst. ABout half past eight prisoner
                        No.16, <persName>Said Suleiman Kheiralla</persName>, was seized with an
                        epileptic fit and as the Court awaited his recovery and return before the
                        passing of judgment it was nearly nine o'clock before <persName>Osman Bey
                            Mortada</persName>, Secretary to the Court, began to read aloud the
                        lengthy document. The prisoner was attended to by <persName>Dr.
                            Nolan</persName>, who was in Court and went to his assistance.</p>
                    <p>Before the Court assembled the excitement of the audience was very evident,
                        and remarks were passed by all. It was noticed that the number of police
                        guarding the docks was doubled, that two were "told off" to guard the
                        leaders of the mob who had been placed together in the first row of the left
                        hand dock, and that behind the docks, on either side, was a detachment of
                        the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons. From this it was generally inferred that
                        the sentences about to be passed would be severe.</p>

                    <p>AS a detachment of the Army of Occupation left the city of Cairo on Monday,
                        the 11th day of June, 1906, marching down to Alexandria and after two days
                        arrived at a place near Kamsheesh, of Tala Markez, Memoufieh, on the morning
                        of Wednesday the 13th of the same month.</p>
                    <p>AS <persName>Major Pine Coffin</persName>, officer in command of this
                        detachment, desired to go pigeon shooting at Denishwai village, Chibil el
                        Kom Markez, having done so for the two previous years. He went there
                        accompanied by four other officers, <persName>Captain Bull</persName>,
                            <persName>Lieutenant Smithwick</persName>, and <persName>Dr.
                            Bostock</persName>. They arrived there at 2 p.m. on that day in two
                        carriages, two officers being in each, while the fifth was on horseback.
                        They were all in military uniform and bearing badges of their regiments.
                        They were accompanied by an onbashi of the Egyptian police, and by
                            <persName>Abd el Aal Sukkar</persName>, guide.</p>
                    <p>AS <persName>Lieut. Porter</persName> began shooting and fired about 9 shots
                        at flying pigeons, one after the other, when a fire broke out in the
                        threshing floor of <persName>Mohamed Abd el Nebi Moazzin </persName> which
                        was extinguished in five minutes. But the owner of the threshing floor
                        approached <persName>Lieut. Porter</persName> and seized his gun, when about
                        30 persons, some of hom took hold of the gun at the same time, and the
                        others surrounded the officer and followed him. They pulled the gun from
                        him, after which the gun exploded, two shots going off, and the wife of
                            <persName>Mohamed Abd el Nebi Moazzin</persName>, <persName>Amir
                            Ads</persName>, sheikh el ghaffir, <persName>Ali Dabshali</persName>,
                        and <persName>Mohamed Daoud</persName> received the charge from the gun.</p>
                    <p>AS while this was taking place on the south side, on the north side it
                        occurred that <persName>Captain Bull</persName> was aiming at a flying
                        pigeon and one of those who had met them took hold of the butt of the gun,
                        and prevented him from shooting <persName>Major Pine-Coffin</persName>
                        observed this and came to see what was the matter. At the same time he saw
                        the smoke of the fire in the threshing floor of <persName>Mohamed Abd el
                            Nebi Moazzin</persName> and that the man who was holding the gun pointed
                        to the same and aboutt nine persons came towards them with the guide behind
                        them shouting in English. "The natives surrounded the officers on the south
                        side."</p>
                    <p>AS <persName>Major Pine-Coffin</persName> went, accompanied by his two
                        comrades, towards the other officers, he saw that the crowd around them
                        increased and <persName>Lieut. Porter</persName> was unwilling to surrender
                        his weapon and he saw evil intentions in the faces of the crowd. He wished
                        to go back to the carriages and began to take the cartridges from his gun,
                        which he gave to a native. He also gave his watch to that man and ordered
                        his comrades to give up their guns. He went to the mob and arrested
                            <persName>Lieut. Porter</persName>, assisted by another officer, as a
                        criminal, and all turned to go to where they had left their carriages and
                        horse.</p>
                    <p>AS the crowd increased in numbers and in evil intentions, followed them with
                        sticks, bricks, and dry mud. <persName>Major Pine-Coffin</persName> was
                        felled by a blow on the head. He got up but was felled by another blow and
                        the crowd continued their attack until they reached the carriages. And as
                            <persName>Major Pine-Coffin</persName> saw that they continued to
                        attack, he told <persName>Capt. Bull</persName> and <persName>Capt.
                            Bostock</persName> to go to the camp for help. And although
                            <persName>Capt. Bull</persName> had received a severe blow on the head,
                        he obeyed the order, he ran on and looked back at no one. The heat was

                        unconscious. He received a sunstroke and was removed to the camp, where he
                        died at seven o'clock on the evening of the same day. <persName>Dr.
                            Bostock</persName> arrived at the camp after receiving several blows
                        which required several days medical treatment.</p>

                    <p>AS the crowd prevented the Major and his two comrades from getting into
                        carriages, pulled them about and beat them, throwing bricks and dry mud at
                        them, dragged them to the spot where was the wounded woman and made them sit
                        down, while some made signs of cutting their throats to make them understand
                        they meant to kill them as they had killed the woman, who was not killed.
                        They dragged them to the scene of the fire, beating them with sticks,
                        stones, and bricks, and kicking them while they were lying on the ground,
                        and placed tibn round them. The officers thought they were going to burn
                        them and <persName>Major Pine-Coffin</persName> fell senseless a third time
                        from the blows. Afterwards they took them to a place under a tree and the
                        ghaffirs began to arrive. The mob then withdrew and an officer of the police
                        from an outpost near the scene of the incident, who had been called by
                        telephone, arrived and the officers were taken back to the camp.</p>
                    <p>AS <persName>Major Pine-Coffin</persName>'s left arm was broken by a blow
                        from a nabout and <persName>Lieut. Smithwick</persName>'s nose was broken by
                        a stone and the officers received several injuries on different parts of
                        their bodies, as shown by the medical reports.</p>
                    <p>AS the first medical report of the examination of <persName>Capt.
                            Bull</persName> before his death confirmed afterwards that death was due
                        to concussion of the brain caused by the blows which he received on the head
                        and by sunstroke. The examination which the doctor of the Court made
                        confirmed that the blow had caused the concussion of the brain and that
                        though it was not sufficient in itself to cause death it weakened him and
                        made him to be quickly affected by sunstroke, so rendering death likely.</p>
                    <p>AS the crowd robbed the officers of such things as watches, key chain,
                        whistle, etc., as they also did their weapons,</p>
                    <p>AS the officials discovered some of the guns in some of the houses of the
                        people and also some of the stolen goods,</p>
                    <p>AS the act of beating was with the intention to kill and on the vital parts
                        of the body which caused the death of one of the injured, the incident is
                        considered as murder preceded, accompanied, or followed by the crime of
                        robbery by force. The punishment for such a crime can be taken from the
                        Egyptian Code,</p>
                    <p>AS this crime was committed againt officers who surrendered their arms and
                        were defenceless and were unable to escape. They showed no enmity and did
                        not provoke the aggressors by words or signs and cause them to act as they
                        had done,</p>
                    <p>AS this crime was intentional and previously arranged as is evident from the
                        fire and the sudden increase of the mob against the officer on the South
                        side and those who seized <persName>Capt. Bull</persName> and pointed to the
                        smoke. They were merciless to a blameless officer. PEople were present among
                        the crowd who were strong enough to prevent the murder, but these were more
                        severe and more merciless than the others.</p>
                    <p>AS what makes the crime worse is that it was committed against men who had
                        been service and could have shot the aggressors as they did the pigons, but
                        they had peaceful intentions. They surrendered their weapons, making them
                        defenceless.</p>
                    <p>AS the Court had spent three days in hearing the evidence of the witness, the
                        speeches of counsel for the prosecution and the defence, they verified that
                        the following were the criminals: -</p>

                    <p>On Monday a pretty wedding took place in the Garrison Chapel, Kasr el Nil,
                        the bride being Miss Alice Bartholomew, daugther of S.S. Major Bartholomew,
                        A.S.C., and the bridegroom, S. Sgt. F.C. Cross, R.A.M.C. The bride was given
                        away by her father. The Rev. Hardy officiated at the ceremony, the fine band
                        of the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers being in attendacne. After the service,
                        the band played a Wedding March, and the happy couple left the church amidst
                        showers of confetti and rice. At the exit an arch was formed by all the
                        military present who wore swords, the effect being very picturesque. A crowd
                        gathered outside the chapel, and Mr. and Mrs. Cross had to run the gauntlet
                        again, through showers of rice and confetti. Eventually reaching their
                        carriage, they drove to the British Head Quarters, where a reception was
                        held. The verandahs of the building were effectively decorated with palms,
                        etc., and the interior was also artistically arragned for the suspicious
                        occasion. The guests numbered quite a hundred, among those present being Lt.

                        Barrett, etc. The wedding preents were both numerous and handsome, and were
                        greatly admired by all. The happy couple afterwards left for Alexandria,

                        the sentences, and said that he was sure he could trust to the expression of
                        humanity of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and to those on whose

                    <p>Sir Edward Grey was questioned in the House of Commons last Thursday for the

                        give any further information on the subject, whether the officers were in
                        uniform, or in the execution of any military duty when the affray took
                        place, and whether he could give the text of that portion of the Khedivial

                        creditors of the unfortunate Egyptian Sugar Refineries Company and the
                        Official Receiver at Cairo at the beginning of the month. It has been
                        proposed to reduce the nominal value of the shares from 100f. to 30f., which
                        latter amount is said to represent, more or less, the actual value of the
                        security. Further, the Daira Sugar Corporation-the principal creditor- has
                        consented to claim only half of its unsecured debt, besides making other
                        concessions in connection with the installments which are due to to the

                        the railway line formerly belonging to the Sugar Refinery, an annual economy
                        of abou tL.E. 40,000 will be effected. As to the holders of bills, those who
                        voluntarily renounce 25 percent of their claims will have a preference over
                        the old shareholders, although ranking on the same level with the original
                        creditors. The latter will receive mortgage bonds instead of immediate
                        settlement. This arrangement was unanimously agreed upon at the creditors'
                        meeting, before it was sanctioned by the Commercial Tribunal of Cairo. At
                        the meeting, 22,783 creditors, with aggregate claims of L.E. 1,498,147, were
                        represented. The all important question which now arises is whether it will
                        be possible to continue the Egyptian Sugar fatories and to place them on a
                        paying basis. As has already been pointed out, besides those directly
                        interested in the question, the Egyptian Government, above all pays the
                        utmost attention to the development of the sugar industry in the country. So
                        far, the experts appopinted by the courts have not been able, after an
                        inquiry which lasted over two months, to give a definite answer to the
                        question. What they suggest is that a trial should be made with two sugar
                        factories, in order to see whether, with a judicious and economic
                        management, a satisfactory result can be obtained. </p>

                        literary form the remarkable services of Lord Cromer in the renascence of
                        Egypt. No Englishman has served the Empire with greater ability and with
                        less obtrusiveness than Lord Cromer. Probably no man of his eminence is less
                        familiar to the British public through portraiture and anecdote than he.</p>

                    <p>Mr. R.J. Price, M.P., who presided at the meeting of the Nile Valley (New)
                        Company last week, said that the company had passed through its
                        reconstruction in a most satisfactory manner, the existing shareholders
                        having taken the whole of the capital with the exception of the 5,000 shares
                        which were taken by outsiders. The board were holding a thousand shares in
                        reeserve for the benefit of any shareholders who, owing to absence, might
                        have been unable to apply. He did not think that a more successful
                        reconstruction could have been carried through. he had said that the company
                        would have a working capital of £30,000, but the board had been able to
                        improve on that, and the amount was £35,600. That was a very satisfactory
                        postiion, and the desire of the board was to use the money so that it would
                        give them the greatest bcredit and the shareholders the greatest benefit. It
                        had been decided to suspend crushing operations until more suitable motive
                        power was obtained, and in the meanwhile development work would be carried
                        on actively. When better motive power was obtained the copmany would be able
                        to crush regularly with, he hoped, good results, and he trusted they would
                        come across rich patches such as had previously characterised their
                        formation. In reply to questions the Chairman further stated that the
                        battery was capable of crushing only one thousand tons per month, but ten
                        stamps could be added to it. The cost of the machinery for the new motive
                        power would not exceed a thousand pounds.</p>

                        Serious damage has been done to property.</p>
                    <p>Six miners have been entombed in a colliery, probably as a result of the
                        earthquake, and all hope of rescuing them has been abandoned. The Rhondda

                        been caused by an explosion in a neighbouring mine. (Reuter)</p>

                        countermanding of the visit of the British Fleet to Kronstadt, said that the
                        Fleet would visit Swedish, German, and four Russian ports during July and
                        August, and he thought it quite out of the quesiton that the visit, which
                        was arranged some time ago, should be regarded as influencing the internal
                        affairs of Russia. (Reuter)</p>

                    <p>Mr. Asquith has again shown that the question of our Gold Reserve is still
                        engaging his attention. At a banquet in the Mansion House the other evening,
                        he suggested as a possible step towards assisting the Government in forming
                        a judgment on the matter, that the Banks might publish their returns at
                        shorter intervals. No doubt such action might do much towards assisting in
                        the solution of the problem, but of more importance towards that desideratum
                        woul dbe some plan by which returns could be obtained from the great
                        majority of Banks and bankers, who at present do not issue any statement,
                        even once a month.</p>
                    <p>The Bank rate was yesterday reduced to 3 1/2%, but up to the last minute the
                        possibility of such reduction was anything but certain, and although the
                        optimistic forecast in this column of last week has thus been vindicated,
                        the fall has come sooner than expected, and it may be that the Bank
                        authorities have been a little premature. It is true that the open amrket
                        rate was considerably below the official figure, which now can be easily
                        made effective, but the New York Exchange has had a sharp drop, and the
                        Paris rate is showing weakness, the former standing dangerously near the
                        gold-drawing point. Perhaps it would have been as well if the Bank directors
                        had delayed the "drop" until the turn of the month, for it would be
                        regrettable if we had a repetition of the unfortunate experience of two
                        months back, when the Bank rate was lowered only to be raised again after
                        the lapse of a fortnight.</p>
                    <p>Credits certainly seem to be ample and cheap for the moment. Call money has
                        been going at any price for several days, and today fetches only 2%, and
                        weekly loans can be had for 2 1/2%.</p>
                    <p>The discount rate, which had receded to 3 1/4% before the fall in the Bank
                        rate, now stands at 3 1/8 to 3 3/16%, and this is probably the bottom of it
                        for about a week to come, and without a great amount of business doing. As
                        the end of the month is approaching borrowers will probably be forced to
                        have recourse to the Bank of England next week, for the market's balance at
                        the institution are in none too healthy a condition.</p>

                    <head>The Stock Markets.</head>
                    <p>A few months ago, when the Tsar granted a Constitution to the people of
                        Russia, it was fondly hoped that brighter days were in store for that
                        country. Certainly, a period of comparative quiet followed, and this
                        strengthened the feeling of optimism. It was, however, but a lull in the
                        storm, which has now broken out again with increasing violence. The
                        massacres and bloodshed which horrified the whole civilised world last year
                        are being repeated, and the outlook is dark in the extreme.</p>
                    <p>That the situation is regarded with great gravity in Russia is to be gathered
                        from the telegram sent by five prominent members of the Duma to a
                        distinguished London journalist, Mr Lucien Wolf. In this message they point
                        out that the massacre at Bielostok was clearly "the beginning of an
                        organised massacre similar to the bloody October days."</p>
                    <p>Consequently the financial condition of Russia has been seriously affected by
                        the recent alarming events. It is said already that the Tsar is in need of
                        more money, and although the statement that a loan was being negotiated with
                        a commercial syndiacate here has been officially denied, it is expected that
                        the Governmnt will, in the near future, be compelled to ask for further
                        funds. Whether they will be successful in getting these is another matter.
                        It was understood, when the last loan was granted by the Continental
                        bankers, that there was to be no campaign against the Duma, and it is not to
                        be supposed that these shrewd financiers will view the deliberate breach of
                        the understanding that has taken place without a serious protest - a protest
                        which will probably make itself felt when Russia comes cap in hand, asking
                        for more assistance.</p>
                    <p>The "National Zeitung" aptly expresses the general feelings when it says that
                        "Europe will make the Russian Court, the Government, and the bureaucracy
                        rather than the Duma, responsible if the first step towards a constitutional
                        regime should be in failure."</p>
                    <p>As is well-known, both Germany and France have huge sums at stake in Russia,
                        and the events of the past few days have caused something like a panic in
                        the Russian groups on the bourses in Berlin and Paris. Large quantities of
                        the bonds have been offered and quotations have fallen to a lower point that
                        has previously been touched by these stocks.</p>
                    <p>The depreciations were, it is true, to some extent the result of speculative
                        operations in connection with the settlement in the new loan, but the main
                        cause was the extreme nervousness regarding the situation in Russia.</p>
                    <p>At the beginning of the week the stock markets here were an accurate
                        reflection of the feeling on the Continent, and depression was general. The
                        fine weather and the attractions of Ascot have combined to keep many members
                        away from the "House," and although the nervousness with regard to Russian
                        affairs is not now so pronounced, there is still no life in the markets,
                        which are idel. Even the reduction of the Bank rate to 3 1/2% has failed to
                        impart any activity.</p>

                        felt here also. Today there has been a relapse, and the closing prices
                        tonight for Consols are no better than 88 3/8 for cash and 88 7/16 for the

                        ever before in their history, the Fours declining to 78 1/4, or 1/4 lower
                        than during the dark days of late December, and 8 points below the quotation
                        at the beginning of April. It is almost inconceivable that nine months ago
                        these bonds were as high as 95. The Rentes relapsed on the St. Petersburg
                        Bourse to 72, a lower figure than was touched during the war. The closing
                        prices here for the Fours and the new loan are 78 1/4, and 2 7/8 discount
                        respectively. Japanese stocks have been supported, and the 4 1/2 percents
                        have advanced 1/4 to 97 3/4.</p>

                    <p>Although there has been little business done in this section the tone has
                        been more cheerful than for some time poast, and for once a satisfactory
                        batch of traffics has had a good effect. On the publication of the returns

                        home railway stocks. It is a most remarkable fact that they have been
                        neglected so long, in view of the splendid returns, and the even better
                        prospects for the future.</p>

                    <p>This market has been moderately active throughout the week, thanks to good
                        support from New York and the Continent. Baltimore and Ohio have again been
                        the feature, the shares having put on an additional four points. The present
                        popularity of these shares is due to the increased dividend, supplemented by
                        earnings on the common stock at a rate exceeding 13%. Southern Pacifics have
                        been bought, the market closely following the lead given to these shares by
                        Wall Street, and the price rising three points. Several of the other stocks

                    <p>There is very little to say regarding the Egyptian market. Prices have firmed
                        up in most cases, without any business taking place. National Bank of Egypt
                        are closing at 25 5/8 3/4, and Agricultural Banks are distinctly better at 9
                        3/4. Daira Sanieh Ordinary have been dealt in on the basis of 17 1/8 1/4,
                        and the Deferred are round about 100. Daira Sugar are still a very good
                        market at 4 7/8-5 7/8 ex dividend. Delta Land and Investment have gradually
                        risen from 3 3/8 to 4 buyers, without any shares changing hands, there
                        appearing to be no sellers on this side. Delta Preference are nominally 11

                        been in good demand, and close rather buyers at 1 1/2, with prospects of
                        going better. Abyssinia Banks are still at 3/8 discount, and Union Foncière
                        at 6 1/8 1/4. Egyptian Estates keep steady at 1 11/16, and the Deferred are

                        of business being transacted. The lowering of the Bank rate appears to have
                        been to a large extent discounted, but the easier money conditions may be
                        expected to exercise a favourable influence on this, as on other sections,
                        in the near future. Rand Mines are 1/32 higher on the week at 6 5/32, and

                        arrival at the Emperor's capital from Berlin of a small compoasite party,
                        including an architect, a locksmith, a house painter, and an agricultural
                        teacher. The Count, whose experiences have since been published, declares
                        that the building of a house at Addis Abeba is a work of eternity. A French
                        merchant told him on one occasion that his hut had been under construction
                        for the last eight months, and was not even then nearly finished. After the
                        first week the men demanded their wages and went away for a month or so to
                        spend them. There were one or two carpenters at the time in the Ethiopian
                        capital who were worse than useless, but an architect is a luxury hitherto

                    <head>BILLIARD TOURNAMENT.</head>
                    <p>The large hall in the Soldiers' Club, Cairo, was crowded with members of
                        Monday evening last to witness the final tie in the team competition. The
                        finalists were a team of the Lancashire Fusiliers captained by Pte.
                        Dickenson, and one of the K.R. Rules, by Lce. Corp. Robinson. As each
                        regiment consider they have the champion player amongst the rank and file
                        serving in Egypt, the Lancashire Regiment in Pte. Dickenson, and the Rifles
                        in Lce. Corp. RObinson, an exciting match between the two was expected, but
                        Pte. Dickenson, who won the toss, elected to play the weakest man of the
                        K.R.R. team, which caused a murmur of disappointment amongst the large
                        number of spectators when the name appeared on the board. Evidently
                        Dickenson's tactics were to establish a strong lead for his side and thus
                        encourage them to play a winning game. He, however, did not succeed, as was
                        expected, being evidently excited and consequently did not play up to his
                        form; he beat his opponent by 39 points.</p>
                    <p>In the second game, Lce. Corp. Robinson, who is a cool and attractive player,
                        had no difficulty in defeating his opponent, Pte. Judd, by 85 points, thus
                        giving his side a strong lead.</p>
                    <p>The third game was played by two Lewises, Lce. Corp. Lewis being the winner
                        of a well-contested game by 13 points.</p>
                    <p>In the last game Rifleman Greenaway had matters pretty well on his own way,
                        going right away from his opponent, Pte. BElding (who was not in his usual
                        form), and winning by 60 points.</p>
                    <p>The 1st prize (value £5.5) goes to Lce. Corp. Robinson's team; the 2nd prize
                        (vaule £2.10) goes to Pte. Dickenson's team, and the special prize of a
                        championship match cue to Lce. Corp. Fergusson for his break of 32.</p>
