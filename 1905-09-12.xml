                <p>Made in 70 Colors</p>
                <p>An artistic wall covering.</p>
                <p>This celebrated water paint is made in two qualities for Inside and Outside
                    work</p>
                <p>HALL’S SANITARY WASHABLE DISTEMPER is rapidly superseding wall papers in all
                    tastefully furnished homes. It is made in 70 artistic tints, and only requires
                    the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is quickly and easily applied
                    with a whitewash brush, with half the labour and at one third the cost of paint.
                    HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures cleanliness, and is pleasing to the eye. It appeals
                    alike to artistic and practical house decoration. HALL’S DISTEMPER is of special
                    value in hot climates. Owing to its cool, pleasing colours, great
                    weather-resisting and germ-destroying properties, it lends itself to every kind
                    of wall, wood, brick or stone coating, possessing all the advantages of paint,
                    colour- wash, and disinfectant at one third the cost of oil paint. It never
                    blisters in the hottest sun, and the fact that it can be washed adds greatly to
                    its sanitary advantages.</p>

                <head>THE SOLAR FCLIPSE</head>
                <p>LETTER FROM PROFESSOR
                    TURNER.</p>
                <p>Professor Turner, Savilian Professor of Astronomy, Oxford, writes to us from Cairo as follows :—Before leaving Egypt to-morrow I venture to send you a few hurried notes on the outcome of the eclipse operations BO far as they are known at present. The most note¬worthy point, perhaps, is the way in which Egypt has upheld its reputation for fine weather. From the other end of the line, Labrador, we have bad new ; apparently thick clouds prevented any observations at all. This loss untrtunatoly discounts to some extent the value of success at this end; for plates successfully taken here cannot be compared with Labrador plates for evidence of change. From Spain again we have disappointing news: the clouds did not entirely prevent observa¬tions but they have rendered their value very uncertain. Only from the other African stations have we really good news: Algeria seems to have done even better than Egypt, to judge from the enthusiastic telegram from Mr. Newall of Cambridge. We shall look forward with the greatest interest to the result of a crucial observation of Mr. Newall’s : he has tried without success at the eclipses in 1898, 1900, and 1901 to obtain evidence of the rotation of the corona, by photographing the spectrum on opposite sides of the Sun. The spectrum is extremely faint, and he requires not only fine weather but a long eclipse to get anything at all on the plates. In 1898 (India) and 1900 (Algiers) the weather was fine but the eclipse-times were short; in 1901 (Sumatra) the time was long but the weather was poor. It really seems as though there were a chance that he had got both weather and duration right this time, and if so, new facts of the greatest interest may be forthcoming. But this is not the only observation Mr. Newall was undertaking and be is quite certain to have other results of value as well.
                    Coming to the Assouan expeditions, we may all go home well satisfied. Our plates are now developed and we can form a rough estimate of the amount of success obtained, though the ultimate verdict cannot be pro¬nounced until a good deal of measurement and other work has been done on the plates. To coned r first the possible sensation of the eclipse, the possible discovery of a new planet by on? or other of the batteries of telescopes of the American expeditions which have be¬come famous under the name of “cross-eyed ladies," I am glad to hear that Professor Hussey’s plates are all right, to a casual inspection. What the objects shown on them are, whether stars on planets, can only be determined from careful measurement and we shall not hear for some months : but the plates seem to be all right On the other hand of oourae, there are no Labrador plates to compare with them and the plates taken by Professor Campbell in Spain, whence "light clouds” are reported, may not shew the fainter objects ; for it is astonishing how little cloud it takes to "put out" faint stars. So that even if a strange object is found on Professor Hussey’s plates, it may not be possible to determine in what direction it is moving, from lack of other observations at another time. It would be distressing to have such a fleeting glimpse of a new planet and then lose it for seven year’s (there ia no suitable eclipse again until 1912) but if this rather remote con-tingency is realised there is after all the cheering thought that the honor of discovery will belong to Egypt alone. Indeed the effect of our news from other stations, so far, has been to send up the betting on our "cross¬eyed lady” as compared with the other two starters, one of which has indeed scratched altogether, if we are not misinformed. But of course the betting has been wrong sometimes.
                    Professor Hussey has also got some fine photographs ol the corona. He can no longer hope to compare them with similar ones taken in Labrador, but they have an independent value in themselves. I may add that to the American party belongs the credit (of which Mr. Hussey has a large share) of making some very interesting observations on the shadow bands, which seem to associate their mysterious movements with the wind. So far as I know this is new and may be a distinct step, though confirmation is desirable. The Russian coronal photographs are being taken to Russia for development; but Dr. Doubinaki’s magnetograpb, taken in tomb No. 32, is developed and shews an interesting disturbance near the time of eclipse. We can¬not however say whether the association is accidental, until observations made elsewhere are collected and compared.
                    Coming to our own work I am glad to say that polarized-light photographs come out out very well. They shew so dearly to a casual glance the strong polarization that I have little doubt the measures will give very complete information. This work is perhaps a little technical and I will not dwell on it here : but, in brief, I feel sure that the right way of going about the work has now been found, after several only partially successful trials : and a line of investigation opened up which must be definitely followed in future eclipses, until we have say at least two cycles of eleven years each.
                    The photographs taken with the astro graphic telescope are also quite satisfactory, including the one through a green screen. Our disappointment awaited us in the big teles¬cope. There are always some disappointments at as eclipse and one most meet them philoso¬phically ; but of course it is rather distressing when they come in important pieces. The only comfort is that it was very largely out of our control. When the plates were developed the strongest image on them was that of the wood
                    forming the plate-holder which overpowered the corona altogether. It seems to be some sort of radio-active effect, which independent of any exposure to light: for Mr Kearney put in another plate and locked up the slide in the dark-room for a day, and got just the same result on development,The cause must be carefully investigated with a view to preven¬tion in the future and we may perhaps save a worse disaster: but it is had enough as it is, especially as so many people had given us help with the big telescope and we were hoping to shew them something of interest in return. However there are, as I have said, always disappointments at eclipses : they did not spare Professor Hussey, whose most im¬portant plate, to which half the whole time ot totality was devoted, has two mysterious marks upon it. We must be thankful for the successes and not grieve over the failures unduly.
                    We are all going home well-satisfied and deeply grateful to the country which has so hospitably guided us to success. Our indebted-ness to the Surrey Department, to the Rail¬way Administration, and to the Antiquities Department were recorded in your columns some weeks ago, but since then we have incurred many new debts of gratitude in each case. Mr. Keeling’s exertions on our behalf were never relaxed, and in the last few days were redoubled in order to get the big tele¬scope ready, and Mr. Kearney developed the plates of the British Expedition under the beat possible conditions at the Survey Depart¬ment. The Railways allowed us to put up the big telesoope at the railway station and I may add that the local fire-brigade flooded the ground for us, which would certainly have contributed largely to success if we had not been robbed of it in other ways, and we were much indebted to Mr. Hazel for help on the day of eclipse in numerous ways. But I am afraid to attempt a complete list, we had so many things done for us that it is almost impossible to remember them all, especially as many of them were done at a time when one is apt to be rather distraught. Even the weather was kind to us. Your readers may smile at the idea of anything else but I can assure you, Sir, that we took the matter more seriously On August the twenty-first it was quite cloudy all the afternoon. If the eclipse had happened on that day we should we have seen nothing at all. To consider that we had a certainty would be wrong, and the experience was valuable if only to shew what we escaped.
                    The official welcome accorded to the expedi-tions, no only the British and American, but the Russian also, by Mr. Mitchell Innas was not only an extremely pleasant incident for those concerned but has a wider significance on which it is scarcely necessary for me to comment But I am sure neither he nor others will mind my parting word being of Captain Lyons to whom we owe more than we can say. It is four years since we first spoke of this expedition, and he immediately said he would do all he could for us. We did not know until we came to Egypt how much this meant, but we know something of it now and we also know that he has carried out his promise.

                               <p>THE CHATHAM.
                                   (FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT).</p>
                                  <p>Port Said, Monday.
                                   The situation of the S.S. Chatham remains about the same in many ways, she being now almost completely under water, and having a slight list to starboard, though made securely fast to the Asian canal hank by heavy chains and ropes.
                                   On Saturday, I hear, a commission, which included all the canal company’s heads of departments and two British explosives experts, visited the ship, and held lengthy deliberations, the results of which are not public property. From what I gather, the great difficulty really lies in the fact that by this time the nitro¬glycerine in the dynamite, which long ago melt¬ed to a great extent, is now free in the water, with which the holds are full. This, I am told, renders all attempts at floating the vessel by pumping quite useless, and some method of raising her must be devised. Failing this it may become necessary to blow the ship up as she lies,an action which would involve thousands of pounds worth of damage to the canal and its environment. It is to be hoped that this disaster may be obviated, for it would mean the com¬plete stoppage of all traffic for some time and hundreds of other losses, commeroial and other¬wise.

                               <p>FIRE ON CANAL BANK.</p>
                                 <p>  On Sunday columns of smoke were observed from here rising from the bank of the Canal. This, apparently, came from the dry reeds and scrub with which the fresh water canal is lined, and it is presumed that some Arabs, who are to be found thereabouts in numbers in the quail season, had carelessly allowed their camp fire to do the damage. Much of the foluge of the trees is burnt and it will be some time before this portion of the bank will be recovered with vegetation.

                                   La situation de la SociEtE des raffiueries d’Bgypte eat plus embrouiltEe qne oelle de la raffinerie Say et sera plus longue k dEnouer. De grands mEnagements sont nEoessaires en rai¬son de la situation dea obligations, notamment.
                                   La raffinerie d’Egypte anxtermea de son oontrat d’aobat des Etabliaaements snoriera de la sociEtE Egyptienne, la Daira Sanieh, doit payer k cette dernidre une annuitE de 2,830.421 franca. Faute de paiement de cette annuitE, la situation de la Raffinerie d’Bgypte deviendrait naturellement dEseapErEe. C’eat de ce cOtE qao se portent les efforts des administrateura. Mais la correspondanoe qui a EtE engagEe avec le siEge social en Egypte ne ponrra reoevoir do rEponse avant la fin de la semaine.
                                   D’antre part, il faudra envoyer nn expert eu Egypte ponr savoir comment onMtE virEs les 25 millions de traies par M. Cronier sar la sociEtE.	ont-ellea EtE aealement

                                   D’antre part, on ne sait encore si one oonvo - cation dee aotionnairea ponr nne assemblEe gEn6rale est possible.
                                   Bn effet, la aociEtE ayant son siege an Cairo etEtant constitnEe en vertn dea lois Egyptiannea, o'est le rode de commerce Egyptien qui fixe les pon voirs.
                                   Il eat possible qua co oode ne reoonnafrae qn’an liquidateur qui aora nommE par les tri bnnaux du Cairo, le droit de oouvoquer lei aotionnaiies. On a done telegraphic poor de •mander des informations k ce snj9t Et lei administrateura et portoure de traites, ne se rEuniront qu’aprEa que les renseignementa seront venua dn Cairo.
                                   M. Cronier Etait k la fois liquidates de la socoesaion Henry Bay et da la SociEtE Henry Say et Cie. On sait que son rempla^ant poor liquidation de la succession Henry Siy, a EtE dEsignE vendredi: c’est M. Lemarquis.

                                   Le oinquiEme paquebot du type Moldavia, le A/ixj, eutrera en service l’automne pro chain.

                                   l'exploitation, le premier semestre de Fexer- oioe en roars n'a pas prEsentE de oontraste frappant oomparativement k la periodo oor- respondante de 1903-1904 :
                                   Tandis qne le trafio dei paasagers fait ree- aortir dea ohiffres presque identiques k oenx dn aemwtre correspondent, les enoaisaements aur le fret ont EtE pins ElevEs, par snite, prin- oipalement, d une progression dans le oom- meroe de sortie aveo la Chine etie Japon.

A on moment, il semblait y avoir nne perspective d aasElioration ponr les frets de retonr ; malhenrensement cette espE ranoe ne s’est pas rEalisEe et, quant k prEaent, les affaires en retonr, prune dans Feiiseiehle, ne sont en aocane fa^on satisfaisaotoa.

                <p>k-SCID IAs a lover of friction, I decided to pick a short story, named as “ The Road Man”, for this assignment. The story pertains to a young fellow who always noticed an elderly prophet that always carries a hefty wheelbarrow. I was very amused to this piece because I notice many similarities between the prophet and your average college student. For instance, when the narrator mentions, “ His skin, burnt almost black with sun and wind, his shaggy eyebrows and long white beard, suggest the prophets of ancient days”, reminded me of a college senior. As the prophet appears wore down from his exposure to the sun, one may compare that to how a senior appears exhausted, after years of sleep deprivation due to a tedious work load. Ironically, the narrator gave me the impression that he is a college freshman, because he is young and does not have the same years of experiences as to the prophet. Many college freshman will not understand a college seniors’ desire to undertake a tedious take due to the lack of experience. However, as the years pass by, college freshman’s will fulfill the seniors shoes, as the narrator will fill the prophet shoes. I believe this passage is very significant since it is still relevant after being composed 115 years ago.'AmAVDin”.

                <head>THE ROAD MAN.</head>
                <p>He is old and bowed , his skin, burnt almost black with sun and wind, his shaggy eyebrows and long white beard, suggest the prophets of ancient days. Perhaps, with their opportunities, he might have been even as they. Yet here he is, with his wheelbarrow beside him, engaged in the back breaking task of patching roads. Winter and summer alike, be the weather foul or fair, he is about the lanes, doctoring them with the remedies of a hundred years ago. Our roads in this region of Suffolk are very bad, turning to inches of dust in summer and the stickiest of sticky mud in winter, and they seem likely to remain so.
                    I come upon him suddenly, round a corner. Rain fell a days or two ago, and the surface is just becoming, for a brief period, tolerable; in fact, today, it is well enough. But the prophet is conscientious; he has detected some uneven places in the middle, and they must forthwith be filled up. The barrow is laden with stones from a heap a few hundred yards back, brittle, rotten flints, picked off the land, with nothing to recommend them but their cheapness. These will, at the slightest concussion, fly off into a dozen sharp and jagged pieces, which are, in their turn, ground up by the wheels of passing carts into a hundred smaller bits—such may possibly hare supplied the needless of the Stone Age—more subtle foes, in that the dust, which will presently cover the road, will also effectively conceal them and woe betide the unluoky cyclist who finds himself in the midst of them. The man with the motor, too, should beware ; some of them are large enough to do even him a mischief. I stop and inquire of the prophet what makes him resort to such things. His reply is to the effect that he is obeying orders, so i ask further, why such orders should be given, involving as they do the use of remedies ten times more felt than the disease itself. He pauses in his work, glad, I think, of the excuse for a moment's rest, and seats himself on his wheelbarrow. The wind is hissing pleasantly in the field of barley behind us ; we can watch the shadows racing over the marshes, and the grey aspens bending beneath the wind. It is a good place for the weighing of great matters, so I sit upon the green bank of the roadside to listen "We ha'tried granut," he begins, "times an agen we have, but thatcome expensive, an’ don't fare to be no mander o’ nse'' These are hard words; it would seem

                <p>A new system of testing the artillery effi¬ciency in India has been adopted by Lord Kitchener for batteries. In future, instead of a oompetition among batteries, there will be a general classification for merit, it being con¬sidered in India, as at home, that the old style of oompetition needed alteration.
                    Thus, instead of placing batteries ia order of merit for shooting powers, they will be j adged for stable management, equitation, tarn-oat, care of material, signalling, fitness for service, laying, fuse-setting, range taking, individual intelligence, fire discipline and fire taotics, and fire effect. In most of these items the marks will range from 30 to 60, bat for the last two the award will be 300 marks each.
                    The practice of batteries is divided into “instruction,” "test,” and "brigade” stages. In the first stage batteries will be kept until they are fit to prooeed to the testing or the the work in brigade.
                    The interest of the men will be secured in their batteries, not for a short competitive period, but for every day of the year, and no manner of work in a battery will be allowed to remain as non-mark earning. A battery will be judged upon its whole fitness, and not upon the special preparation inseparable from a oompetition.

                <p>Seine of the German newspapers—not the most influential and responsible of them, by any means—which aTe still under the impres¬sion that ft.juts and jeers at Ragland are popu¬lar with their readers, have fonnd, or at any rate sought, an opportunity in the visit of the Channel Fleet to the Baltic coasts. Their theory that this will gratify the German pnblio (writes a correspondent cf a London paper) ia perhaps erroneous. I have heard a good deal of indignation expressed at the journalistic at¬tempts to oreate ill feeling between the two countries. Some of the statements which have been made in the German Press, and repeated in England, are certainly inoorrect and even abrard. Thus it was said that such cheering as was heard at Swinemunde was due entirely to the efforts of English tonrists who "crowded into” the town. There is no truth in the statement. I was at Swinemuude from Sunday till Wednesday, with my eyes and ears well open all the time, and I will undertake to say that there were not forty English viaitore in the place, at an outside estimate.
                    Another of these journalistic fantaisies is that the German visitors to Swinemuude com¬mented freely on the dirty and nntidy appear anoe of the British ships, and on the lax disci- M pline that prevailed. They are said to have found rubbish lying about the deoks, gun

                    Two unique assets we possess. One is that large experience of the sea, under varied con¬ditions, whioh our world-wide Empire and our unequalled geographical situation enable ns to give our men. The German "Evolution¬ary Squadron” is often in harbour, and it knows, at best, only a small segment of the water-surfaoe of the globe. Nor do the Germans yet venture to fix responsibility and give power at the same early age as onrs^lvg*. Their junior lieutenants are very young, hut thiy are not boys like our midshipmen. Great, indeed, was the astonishment of the spectators on the Swinemunde "Bollwerk” when a donble- funnelled steam pinnace oame alongside under the oommand of one of these young gentlemen. He looked a mere child, with a pretty, soft, downy face like« girl’s. I heard a motherly German woman express an audible desire to take him up and kiss him. The middy did not understand the remark, but he would not have been oonfosed if be had. The crowd on the wharf wu nothing to him. He had his business to attend to.

No one doubts that the extermination of so many thousands of these pests removes one of the most dangerous spreading factors. In view of the suooess aohieved, the practice will be vigorously main tained. It is as safe a guarantee as oonld possibly be obtained of the prevention of a oholeraio outbreak in London from Continental souroes. The Port Sanitary Authority’s offi¬cials declare that DO effort will be spared in preventing cholera-infected people from passing up the Thames to Ixmdon. Iu addition to the Medical Offioer-in-Chief there are four boarding medical offiiers—two at Gravesend and two at SheerneM - besides other inspeo ton, Every person coming into port will be •temined, and the authorities will satisfy themrelves that all infected material has been destroyed.

                        Two unique assets we possess. One is that large experience of the sea, under varied con¬ditions, whioh our world-wide Empire and our unequalled geographical situation enable ns to give our men. The German "Evolution¬ary Squadron” is often in harbour, and it knows, at best, only a small segment of the water-surfaoe of the globe. Nor do the Germans yet venture to fix responsibility and give power at the same early age as onrs^lvg*. Their junior lieutenants are very young, hut thiy are not boys like our midshipmen. Great, indeed, was the astonishment of the spectators on the Swinemunde "Bollwerk” when a donble- funnelled steam pinnace oame alongside under the oommand of one of these young gentlemen. He looked a mere child, with a pretty, soft, downy face like« girl’s. I heard a motherly German woman express an audible desire to take him up and kiss him. The middy did not understand the remark, but he would not have been oonfosed if be had. The crowd on the wharf wu nothing to him. He had his business to attend to. The boat was filled with cooked bate and laoed ooata, for it WM land¬ing captains and commanders for the municipal fote; bat they paid no attention to the management OT navigation of the little steamer. The youngtter out of the school-room would see after that, of coarse. Conspicuous in hia neat blue uniform, with his dirk by his side, he WM quietly giving his orders to the bearded quartermaster at the wheel, pressing a small, imperative hand on the engine room tel^mph bell, keeping a vigilant eye on the Uuqeefate with tbrir ropes and boethuefa, and skilfoDy memsevriag the heavy craft thaeegh e ewMbg eMffit te the awkward, aakmown bwdb|
