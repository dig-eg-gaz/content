                    <p>The Denishwai affair has again come before the House of Commons, and on this
                        ocia- sion Mr. T. W. Rotertson. Mastapha Kamel's friend, was the originator
                        of the discussion. Hi began by stating that the authenticity of the letter
                        sent to Lord Cromer and translated in the White Book on Akabe was doubtod
                        “by men of all opinions, including Mr. Edward Dicey." He thus allowed it to
                        be inferred that the British Agency had either been the gnorant victim of a
                        stupid hoax, which even nervous with aa little acquaintance with the Arabic
                        language as Mr. Dicey could see through. or else Lord Cromer had
                        deliberately cruel the letter to bolster up his assertions about the unrest
                        in Egypt. He then turned to Mr. Findlay’s despatches on the Deni hwai affair
                        and declared that “he was not fit to no’d office as representing the British
                        Govern- -ment,” owing to the British Charge d'Afl tires' Opinions expressed
                        thereir. He then went n to oriti i-e Mr.Findley’s telagram to Sir Blward

                        scheme to sep Lord Cromer's aothority in Egypt through the instrumentality
                        of individual members of the House of Com- mons. These gentlemen are
                        probably quite un- conscious of the fact that theyarebeing merely used

                        asked the other night in the House of Commons t It is not improbable that

                        took to heart the signi- ficance of one passage in Lord Cramer's report,
                        where, in pointing out that the appli- ostion of , the term "benevolent
                        despotism" t> bit eystem of government is not quite' correct because
                        theoretically hie power* are ssbject to control, he eay* :—"In the first

                        oontro1, whiob can at all timM be exercised, of the British Parliament and
                        of British public opinion. In the third pleoe, the absolute freedom allowed

                    <p> Arrested for Carrying a Newspaper. </p>
                    <p> Nouri Bey, secretary to H. B. Mukhtar Pasha, has telegraphed from Alexandria
                        to the family at Mahmoud Arif, who was recently arrested in Constantinople,
                        stating that Mahmond Bey has been acquitted. H.I.M. the Saltan issued orders
                        that the Bey’s wife in Cairo should be informed of her husband's release.
                        Arif Bey was taken into custody, states "Al Moayad” because a copy of “A1
                        Mokattam" was found in Constantinople among his belongings. The "seditious"
                        paper, it is thought, had been surreptitiously placed in Mahmoud Bey's bag,
                        before his departure, by a relative of his who is on bad terms with him
                        owing to some domestic difference. </p>

                    <p> Mehemot Ali. </p>
                    <p> Mehemet Ali did not learn to read until he was forty five years of age, but
                        long before that (says the "Westminster Gaiette") his rigour of mind had
                        established his dynasty upon the throne of Egypt, Macedonian by birth, his
                        history is that of an extraordinary rise from poverty and obscurity. He
                        began life as a tobacconist, and then, turning to the army, displayed an
                        uncommon aptitude for leadership. In Egypt he faced with distinction the
                        armies of Napoleon, and established himself in such favour that in 1806 he
                        was made Viceroy by universal acclaim and had his appointment confirmed by
                        the Sultan. The black stain upon a memory which is in the main one of a man
                        extraordinarily in advance of the thought of those about him is the
                        trechorous murders of the Mamelukes who refused to recognise his secession
                        to power. Soon after this dread deed he was master of Egypt, and defied his
                        Sultan in Syria, although the nominal monarch was able to recover his
                        country when backed by the might of European Powers. Egypt under his
                        enlightened administration broke the sleep of centuries, only to fall back
                        again in the bauds of weaker rulers. </p>

                    <p> Summer Amusements. </p>
                    <p> There are many people who seek a means of occupying their leisure time in
                        the summer. The Berlitz Schools of Cairo (1, rue Sharia Kamel) and
                        Alexandria (12, rue Rosette) procure for persons of all ages and conditions,
                        a most useful and agreeable diversion. The lessons given there are
                        interesting and varied, and are really an intellectual relaxation. A free
                        trial lesson will permit everyone to assure himself of this fact. [ADVT].

                    <p> To the Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette." Sir, —I noticed in yesterday’s
                        issne of the a ;n "Gazette" a paragraph on the subject of the purchase of
                        the Cafe San Giovanni by the Al Hayst Hotel Company. I should like to take
                        the opportunity of bringing to the notice of the Public Works Department the
                        neglect of the Nile road by the Janzim Service. We have a steam roller at
                        work on the roads in the town, although there is no apparent need, while the
                        urgent necessity for improving the only route from Helouan to the Nile is
                        absolutely overlooked. The road is in a most disgraceful state, and it is
                        impossible for carriages to pass down the road. It is the only excursion
                        route in Helouan and the main road to Bedreschin. I cannot understand why
                        the authorities have persistently neglected this most essential part of the
                        communications of Helouan,and it is sincerely to be hoped that immediate
                        efforts will be taken to put it in order before the coming season. I am,

                    <p>DISCUSSION IN PARLIMENT. DENISHWAI AGAIN. ATTACK ON MR.FINDLAY. SIR E. GREY'S
                        SPEECH. Egypt has again come before the attention of the House of Commons
                        and on the very eve of the session when on Saturday week the Prime Minister
                        moved the adjournment of the House, MR. J. M. Robertson, the member for
                        Tyneside and the friend of Mustspns Pasha Kamel, procedded to discuss the
                        Denishwai affray, stating that the authenticity of the letter sent to Lord
                        Cromer on the subject of Moslem designs was doubted by men of all opinions,
                        including Mr.Edward Dicey. All the principal officials and officers in Egypt
                        were now absent on leave, and there was not the slightest sign that a
                        fanatical outbreak was feared. In his view, the House need no longer be
                        bound by the appeal of the Foreign Secretary to refrain from discussing the
                        Denishwai in- cident. He did not charge the officers con- cerned with
                        anything more than indiscretion, but he certainly thought the charge of pre-
                        meditation brought against the natives was not only false but absurd. If a
                        number of aliens had come into an English village and had shot at pigeobs
                        and poultry, probably coming into contact with gamekeepers, there would have
                        been a most violent affray. In this case he thought no murder took place,
                        and there had been a gross attempt by an official in the report to put a
                        false aspect on the case. </p>
                    <p> Mr. Findlay Criticised. Mr.Findlay had said that that a British jury would
                        have found six of the men guilty of murder. That was a nonsensical
                        proposition. The officier died not on account of his wounds. but because he
                        ran five miles under an Egyp- tian sun to bring assistance. If this was
                        really Mr.Findlay's opinion he was not fit to hold office as representing
                        the British Government. and if it was not his opinion he was equally unfit.
                        It was this same official who had been allowed to deliver a presumptuous
                        judgement upon the House of Commons for raising a word of deprecation. </p>
                    <p> The Execution at Denishwai was nothing else than an act of revenge for a
                        display of want of due respect towards a body of British officers. He urged
                        the aboli- tion of the special tribunal in Egypt. Court martial action ought
                        not to be permitted in times of peace. The great deeds of Lord Cromer should
                        not be allowed to hold him guiltless in permitting a lawless revenge on
                        these natives. Mr. Molteno did not think the "man on the spot" should be
                        allowed to be the judge of the policy and principle of the British govern-
                        ment. He objected to special tribunals of the kind appointed in Egypt to
                        deal with the case of native insubordination. </p>
                    <p>Sir E. Grey's Speech. Sir E. Grey said Mr. Molteno had corrected an omission.
                        In referring to the appeal which he (Sir E. Grey) made to the House on a
                        previous occasion not to discuss this question, Mr.Molteno quite rightly
                        pointed out that he (sir E. Grey) had asked the House not to discuss this
                        until it had the information before it. (Hear, hear.) That was really the
                        particular point of his appeal. This tribnnal in Egypt was composed of the
                        highest judges. It had come to a decision after taking evi- dence for three
                        days in a very serious case, and if the House of Commons had rushed to an
                        assumption and been unwilling to wait for further information the effect
                        must have been most prejudicial, and must have conveyed an impression abroad
                        that the moment anything occurred which the House of Commons did not quite
                        understand it would at once as- sume thatthe officials on the spot were to
                        blamer(Cheers) He had to thank the House for having responded as it did to
                        the appeal whichh he made.</p>
                    <p> Restlessness In Egypt. The first information which he got. he would not say
                        of the fanaticism. but of the restlessness in Egypt. was in the early days
                        when this country was in occupation of certain islands belonging to the
                        Sultan. because of the dith- cnlties which had arisen with Turkey on the
                        Macedonian question. That began to have its effect on Egypt. When they had a
                        conflict of that kind they might be quite sure that it was bound to have a
                        certain effect on the .\foln-medan races under British rule or in the
                        countries under British occupation. There was the further difficulty about
                        the frontier question. Undoubtedly he thought that anybody who read the Blue
                        Book on the frontier incident would see it was natural and inevitable that
                        there should bore tless-‘ ness and unsettled feeling in BN9! about_ these
                        occurrences. He thought that in time, that would pass. it had been necessary
                        to increase the garrison. and that was done sime time ago. Undoubtedly if
                        that feeling was to spread they would have totske further measures to
                        increase the garrison still more. It was that step which he wished to avoid
                        by deprocating dircussion in that House.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Findlay Defended The nature of Mr. Robertson's speech made it necessary
                        for him to say some words about the personal matter of Mr. Findlay. He
                        regrlttnd much ofthe largoage used by Mr. Robertson. (Ministerial cheers.)
                        Surely if their officials had done wrong they could criticise them without
                        calling them cowardly officials. (Hear, hear.) Mr.Robertson: I did not apply
                        that term to Mr.Findlay Sir E. Grey: No, the hon. member applied it
                        generally. Mr. Robertson: I only spoke about Mr. Findlay because in a letter
                        he made an attack upon this House. Sir B Gray said that there were other
                        expres- sions which were equally unfortunate. If they were to assume.
                        directly they thought that a mistake had been made, that their oﬂicials in
                        general were likely to be either guilty of moral or intellectual
                        deficiencies, and if they were to assume that they had been in the wrong.
                        and adopted that tone. they would make it impos- slblu to conduct
                        successfully negotiations, and certainly would make it quite impossible to
                        conduct the business of the British Empire. (Cheers).</p>

                    <p>Mr. Findlay defended Coming to the question of Mr. Findlay. he thought that
                        Mr. Robertson had mistaken the nature of this particular telegram with which
                        he found so much fault. and which, he could only think. was, in part.
                        responsible for the tone of much of his speech. He thought if Mr. Robertson
                        had not regarded it as a provocative telegram. perhaps his own language
                        would have been softer than it was. (Hear. hear.) He did not think the
                        telegram was intended to be provocative by Mr. Findlay. He did not take it
                        as a criticism at all of the House of Com- mons. He took it as a statement
                        of fact, which Mr. Findlay said it was his duty to If he (Sir B. Gray) made
                        a statement or used lan- guageiu that House which had a prejudicial effect
                        abroad. he would expect the officials in the diplomatic Jervice to inform
                        him what that effect had been, and he would consider it was their duty to do
                        so. Mr. Findlay was per- forming quits rightly his duty in saying what the
                        effect of certain proceedings in the House of Commons, as a matter of fact.
                        would be on the spot. Mr. Findlay was bound to say that.</p>
                    <p> Danger of Criticism. One of the difficulties of governing the British Empire
                        was that criticism of what was done in various parts of the Empire was
                        always liable to have a disturbing eﬂbnt upon the spot.That was not always
                        the paramount cousi- dsration. but the oﬂiciala on the spot ought to let
                        them know what it was. because it was one of the elements which they must
                        take into account in forming a judgment. He might feel it his duty to use
                        language in tbellousa which he might know would have an unfortunate affect
                        in a particular country abroad.but which for gravar eousideratiousbstbouglit
                        it neces- my to use. He would expect that the officials would let him know
                        what was the effect of the speech. but he would reserve to himself the
                        decision as to whether that should belbbe paramount consideration or
                        not.</p>
                    <p> The Telegram He thought that Mr. Findlay was bound to state what was the
                        particular effect on Egypt of discussions in that House, and to leave it for
                        the House to decide whether the effect he pointed out would be regaurded as
                        the par- amount consideration. Mr. Findlay's whole career made them feel
                        that he was a man of character and ability. and that he would rise in the
                        Diplomatic Service. and would do good public service abroad. That did not
                        dispose of the telegram. Mr. Robertson raised the point whether he (Sir B.
                        Gray) ought to have pub- lislied it. He knew the telegram was not sent for
                        publication. but be had promised the fullest information. and he wished to
                        subcdit it as little as possible. (Ministerial cheers.) He thought it right
                        to publish that telegram in order to give tba_House the whole truth of the
                        matter. and. having published it, to leave it to them to consider whsh
                        weight it. ought to have. He would ask 1 House to take this telegram as a
                        statamsnt of fact, and not as a criticism cf the House. (Hear, hear.)</p>
                    <p>The Denishwal Trial. As to the case itself. Mr. Molteuo asked about the

                    <p>The Sentence. Then Mr. Robertson raised the question of the nature of the
                        punishment this Court might inflict. The decree relating to these matters
                        was passed. eleven years ago, and this was the first serious occasion upon

                        the decree should be disclosed. They should be remedied. and Lord Cromer.
                        after review'ng the whole proceeding. had dealt with them. and had suggested
                        that it might be well to have certain modifiratious carried out in the
                        decree. The e modiﬁcations would certainly receive the strong support of his
                        Msjrsty's Government (Cheers) He agreed entirely with Lord Crmner's
                        interesting ms- mnra-zdum reviewing the whole case. ' 0 question of
                        responsibility in Egypt was a very difﬁcult one to decido.The government of
                        Egypt was complicated, but Lord Crcnier interfered as little as possible in
                        matters of administra- tion. As regaurded certian thing he was ab- solutely
                        powerful, especially in regaurd to European intrests. In the second place,
                        all questions of Mahomedaniam were outside his control altogether, and all
                        criminal matters were dealt with by judges who were removable and were
                        independent.</p>
                    <p>Egypt a crown Colony ! He believed that anyone studying the machinery of
                        Egyptian Government on paper would come to the conclusion that it was a moat
                        unworkable system. Lord Cromer had. however. made ii. work. but still the
                        machinery of administration was complicated. If it was desired to amplify
                        it. Egypt might be turned into a Crown Colony; but he put such a change as
                        that one side as not being practical politics. The other alternative would
                        be to leave it to native rule, which would soon be Turkish rule.</p>
