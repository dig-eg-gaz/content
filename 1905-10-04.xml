                                on the metrical and artistic merits of his work ; enough that be
                                looked on life and history as a pageant, end was swift to seize

                    <p>A serions infringement of the pharmacy regulations, which have now been in
                        operation for a little over a year is reported from <placeName
                            ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q85">Cairo</placeName> . A Greek,
                        named Pistis, applied last year for authorisation to open the Pharmacie
                        Hellenique, and forwarded at the same time to the Sanitary Administration
                        what purported to be the diploma of the chemist who was to be in charge. The
                        diploma proving to be authentic, the necessary permission was granted in
                        January, but in May, on receipt of an anonymous communcation, enquiries were
                        set on foot by the police authorities, with the result that it was
                        discovered that the diploma in question to belonged to another man of the
                        same nationality who had been dead since November, 1896. It is alleged that
                        Pistis had purchased the deceased man's diploma from a local pharmacy where
                        he hid been serving at the time of his death. The Parquet is now making
                        fuller investigation before bringing the delinquent before the Native
                        Tribunal for trial, hot in the meanwhile the accused has asked for an
                        adjournment of the case for two months to enable him to prove his foreign
                        nationality.</p>

                    <p>A serions collision occured yesterday near Kassassin station between the
                        passenger train which left Ismailia at 6.20 a.m. for Benha and another
                        coming from the opposite direction. An official telegram recieved at the
                        Ministry of the Interior stated that a third class carriage and several
                        goods waggons were completely smashed, and that 23 persons had been more or
                        less injured, one very seriously. On the news reaching Zagazig a special
                        train was at once despatched to the scene of the accident, conveying the
                        commandant of police, the substitute of the Parquet, and a medical officer.
                        Most of the injured passengers were taken to the hospital at Ismailia.</p>

                    <p>The Sanitary Administration has decided to extend the drains for rain water
                        which were commenced about three years ago, and is at present engaged upon
                        studying the possibility of adopting some method whereby these drains can be
                        made available when the time comes for a proper system of sewers for
                        draining the houses to be undertaken. As the streets of the Capital that are
                        not yet supplied with drains become impassable, sometimes for days, whenever
                        there is a heavy rainfall, it is to be hoped that the work now in
                        contemplation will be taken in hand without any farther delay. That the city
                        was well drained one or two centuries ago was fully proved by the
                        discoveries that were made at the time the first drains for rain water were
                        being constructed, and which greatly simplified the task of the engineers
                        and contractors entrusted with the work.</p>

                        intended to prolong the Nubarieh Canal, for the irrigation of some of the

                        of the 31st May last, to the effect that it has no intention of prolonging
                        this canal in the near future. This decision was originally taken some
                        months ago, when Sir William Garstin recommended that the sale of Government
                        waste lands should be suspended until the question of a farther supply of
                        water for irrigation purposes has been finally settled.</p>

                        <p>I notice several intereating bat absolutely ridiculous articles in local
                            and other journals on the subject of the probability of there stillbeing
                            quantities of explosives, lying loose as it were, at the bottom of the
                            canal. After the explosion you will remember that certain rough
                            roundings were taken which revealed little beyond the foot that the
                            middle of the canal had been partially filled up, and that a large hole
                            had been blown in the east bank. Careful and complete lines of soundings
                            were made on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and since that date divers
                            have lean engaged walking about the canal bed round kilometre 18,
                            finding the pieces of ship which are scattered about. The thorough
                            examinations made have shown that not a single trace of the forward part
                            of the vessel is now to be found anywhere near the spot where the vessel
                            originally lay ; the desert for a mile round the scene of the explosion
                            is smothered in pieces of steel torn out of the ship, and coke and pig
                            iron, of which the major part of the Chatham’s cargo was composed, cover
                            the canal banks in all directions. Bearing these foots in mind, is it
                            likely or even probable that even a portion of a case remains anywhere
                            near the spot to testify to the explosion </p>
                        <p>The divers who have been sent from France are now engaged breaking op the
                            largest pieces of plate and frame which have been found; explosives are
                            being used, and I hear that it is hoped that the worst part of the work
                            will be all over by Thursday. The dredgers, of which there are six on
                            the spot, are working behind the six divers and their accompanying
                            derricks and shear legs, removing upwards of 5,000 cubic metres of sand
                            per day. The largest piece of metal which has been so far lifted from
                            the canal bed measures the astonishing length of over 80 feet and weighs
                            something over 80 tons. Again, is it possible that any cases of
                            explosives remain anywhere near where this unfortunate ship lay before
                            she was blown up. The idea is ridiculous and absurd in the extreme.</p>

                            to raise her, but that they were stultified owing to the collapse of ore
                            of the double lighters. These are now all ready, and much improved,
                            being internally strengthened, but the remains of the Chatham claim all

                        Foyle, of <placeName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q84"
                            >London</placeName>, in the Red Sea, on June 13. The vessel struck on
                        the Mushejera Beef, 6 1/6 miles out of the intended course, and the master
                        believed that she must have been set to the westward by a current. He was,
                        he said, familiar with the Admiralty sailing directions, which said “Strong
                        currents occasionally set across the Red Sea, so a good berth should be
                        given to outlying reefs and shoals. That is the more necessary because the
                        strength of those currents increases rapidly as the shoals are neared, and
                        they form one of the chief obstacles to the safe navigation of the Red Sea,
                        and to them are to be attributed the losses of several steamers daring
                        recent years. A knowledge of their existence should impress mariners with
                        the necessity of constant vigilance.” The Court found that the courses set
                        and steered were safe and proper. The vessel was not navigated at too great
                        a rate of speed. The most probable cause of the causalty was an unusually
                        strong current setting the vessel to the westward alter she had passed
                        Mokhah light, causing her to strand on Mushajera Island, whereby she
                        sustained serious damage. The vessel was navigated with proper and
                        seamanlike care, and the Court found that the master (Captain Alfred Thomas
                        Page) and the officers were not in fault</p>

                    <p>The numismatic department contains 70,000 coins of all kinds. The curator of
                        the museum is Hamdi Boy, a very energetic and enlightened Turkish gentleman,
                        thanks to whom a Dumber of valuable relics, which would otherwise have been
                        neglected, have been preserved. As excavator he discovered the Sidon
                        sarcophagi, and as a writer on archaeological subjects he is well known to
                        most archæologists visiting <placeName
                            ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q43">Turkey</placeName>, and in him
                        they have a friend whose enthusiasm in the cause of research is a real help
                        to their labours.</p>
                    <p>The collection in the new building is divided into sarcophagi and bas
                        reliefs, which,coming from very different places and belonging to as varied
                        epochs, form a complete series of ancient necrology. The sarcophagi are in
                        an unbroken series ranging from the Ionian primitive period to that of the
                        Byzantine era. The archaic period is represented by three sarcophagi of
                        baked, colonred earthenware from Clozomeræ (now a plague lazaretto on the
                        Golf of Smyrna) which, together with the two in the Louvre at <placeName
                            ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q90">Paris</placeName> are the only
                        complete specimens of the style.</p>
                    <p>The sarcophagi of Sidon belong to the fifth and sixth centuries of Greek art
                        To this same period, and to the third century also, belongs another
                        interesting series of anthropoid sarcophagi.</p>
                    <p>There are two sarcophagi which have scenes borrowed from the legend of
                        Phsedrus and are good specimens of Graeco-Roman art Amongst other Byzantine
                        relica, mast be mentioned a fragment which very probably belonged to the
                        sarcophagus of Constantine I. and his mother Helen.</p>
                    <p>But that which gives to the museum its especial character is the unique
                        series of Phœnician sarcophagi from Sidon.</p>
                    <p>Here two hypogœi side by side, hewn out of a bed of sandstone, the Ramleh of
                        the Arabs, were laid bare and explored. One contained a diorite tomb of
                        Tabnith, son of Eshmuuazar, King of Sidon. The other, divided into seven
                        sepulchres, contained seventeen sarcophagi, one of which is that beautiful
                        masterpiece, the tomb of Alexander. This sarcophagus, unique for its perfect
                        preservation, is in an elongated form of a Greek temple. It is of Pentelic
                        marble and is 3.18 metres long, 2.18 metres from base to roof, and 1.67
                        metres broad The base, on whioh it stands, juts out 14 centimeters; this
                        base consists of a border surmounted by a moulding (torus) adorned with
                        tresses, then a lintel, a scotia, a row of heart shapes, and a row of
                        pearls. The cornice, projecting 065 metres from the body, consists of a
                        double meander surmounting a row of ovals and pearls. This ornamentation in
                        which plain surfaces alternate with the richest mouldings has been
                        sculptured with a delicacy which gives the profile of the tomb an
                        incomparable beauty of style. Between the pedestal and the cornice is the
                        body of the sarcophagus properly speaking. It is 58 centimeters high, and is
                        adorned with beautiful reliefs emblematical of the life and character of the
                        great warrior to whose memory the tomb is evidently dedicated, one of these
                        representing a cavalry engagement (probably that of Issus or Arbela). This
                        beautiful shrine is in one hall of the building, and forms the centre of
                        attraction to all corner. In the hall on the other side there is a
                        sarcophagus, also from the royal necropolis of Saida, which rot so
                        gloriously beautiful, may, nevertheless, for perfect work and life-like
                        expression take the next place It is that of the Weepers. Unfortunately par
                        of the roofing, the side, and a head, have been broken off. Like that of
                        Alexander it is in the form of a Greek temple, and instead of the frieze
                        sculptured on its ride has Iconic columns, five on the large sides, and two
                        on the small. In between these columns, are figures, in relief, of women in
                        every expression and posture of grief. The ornamentation is not at all so
                        profuse as in that of Alexander, but it is the perfectly natural expression
                        and pose of the figures, wonderfully done, which contitutes the beauty of
                        the tomb. The set includes an Egyptian sarcophagus in black marble of a very
                        fine grain, — the tomb of a woman, belonging to the fifth century. It is
                        polished and was originally covered with hieroglyphics, which have since
                        been obliterated. Although similar to the Egyptian style in the matter of
                        shape, it differs as to the material, which is in this instance marble,
                        whereas the Egyptian tomb was usally of wood.</p>
                    <p>One of the most noteworthy features of these monumnets is the variety of the
                        style, which is peculiar to such different epochs and countries. For in
                        these contiguous hypoœi were found Egyptian and Phoenician tombs; others
                        snob as that of Alexander, and three other email sarcophagi which probably
                        came from Attica ; another is undoubtedly, from Lycia ; the tomb of the
                        Satrap came from an Ionian school of sculpture; while the ‘Weepers’’ is the
                        work of an Athenian. Moreover, as regards date, the “Satrap” tomb belongs to
                        the early part of the 5th century; the Lycian to the end of that century,
                        while the “Weepers” and the tomb of Alexander belong respectively to the
                        beginning and end of the 4th century. Thus this collection of monuments,
                        containing as it does relics of such a diversity as regards data and origin,
                        is valuable inasmuch as it provides information concerning the funeral
                        customs of the Phœnicians, who, as is known, had no art of their own. They
                        often appropriated tombs made in other lands, as in tin case of King
                        Tabnith, who bought in Egypt for his own use, a sarcophagus which had been
                        need by an Egyptian general.</p>
                    <p>On this tomb is the following inscription in Phoenician "It is I, Tabnith,
                        Priest of Astarte, King of the Sidonians, who lie in this tomb. O man I
                        whoever thou art that shall discover this tomb, do not open my sepulchral
                        chamber; nor trouble me For there is neither silver, gold, nor treasure <cb
                            n="6"/>beside me. I alone lie in this tomb. Open not this sepulcrhal
                        chamber, as such an act is an abomination in the eyes of Astarte. If thou
                        shouldst open my sepulcrhal chamber and shouldst come to trouble me, mayest
                        thou never have posterity amongst the living under the son, nor bed among
                        the dead.” The King has been removed from his "sepulchral” chamber, and is
                        exposed under a glass case not far from the empty sarcophagus, and despite
                        the course and abomination unto Astarte, no harm teems to have befallen
                        Hamdi Bey for the desecration.</p>
                    <p>A study of these monuments, taken alone, is of great aid in treeing the
                        development of Greek style. Firstly, what has been a veritable revelation
                        for science is the existence, at the brilliant epoch of Greek art, the fifth
                        and fourth centuries B. C. of sarcophagi, in the form of temples decorated
                        with bas reliefs. The most ancient sarcophagi of this style, which are
                        known, are those of the Amazons, at present in the Vienna Museum (a moulding
                        of which is in the Stamboul institution), and belong to the third century ;
                        all the others are of Graeco-Roman style. Moreover the Sidon tombs may be
                        considered the most perfect of funeral sculpture of the fifth and fourth
                        centuries B.C. Finally each marks a date in the history of Greek sculpture.
                        The sarcophagus of the Satrap is the most perfect specimen of an art which
                        must have flourished on the coasts of Ionia from the middle of the fourth
                        century until the time of the Median Wars and of which the explorations at
                        Eoheaus and Mitylene give one but faint impressions.</p>
                    <p>The sarcophagus of "the Weepers” is the most beautiful example of the funeral
                        art which inspired the sculptors of the fourth and third centuries.</p>
                    <p>Finally although tbs sarcophagus of Alexander has only definitely decided the
                        question as to the polychrome of Greek sculpture and shown us to what
                        perfection the masters of the end of the fourth centery, the contemporaries
                        of Lysippus and Bryaxs had brought the art of decorative composition ; it,
                        must be said that this sarcophagus is the greatest achievement of the art of
                        the century for explaining the history of ancient sculpture.</p>
                    <p>The series of antrhopic sarcophagi, embracing more than four centuries,
                        worthily completes this collection of Phœnician monuments and deserves
                        profound study. In this series one traces the growth of the art from the
                        time when the sculptor sought to imitate the mummy coffin with a more hardy
                        substance than wood, that is to ray, in stone and marble ; then his attempts
                        to give his work the form of a statue and portrait and then even to give it
                        a human form reproducing the members and even adding an expression of
                        natural detail ; finally, the Egyptian art and realistic work are abandoned
                        for the pare conventional Greek type, in the formation of which the
                        influence of Polycletian sculpture is noticeable.</p>
                    <p>As the last representative of Phoenician funeral art attention must be drawn
                        to the lead sarcophagi of which the museum has a large number; they have
                        nearly all been brought from Lebanon and Homs, a town in southern Syria, and
                        belong to Phoenicia.</p>
                    <p>They were cast in moulds of sandstone, so that the ornamentation on their
                        faces is in relief and elegant; and, varied as it is, shows a mixture of
                        Phœnician and Graeco Roman art All belong to either the first years of the
                        Christian era or to the last of the B.C. period.</p>
                    <p>Mention must be made of a funeral stela coming from Symi (Sporades),
                        belonging to the series of funeral stelae of the primitive art of the fourth
                        and fifth centuries of the Archipelago and Attica of which tbs warrior of
                        Marathon is the most famous representative.</p>
                    <p>There is also a very full series of bas-reliefs representing fanerai banquets
                        and family scenes; the former represent funeral banquets held on the tomb of
                        the divine dead, ana the latter represent, for instances, a family divided
                        by death and reunited in the next life, but all of these are of very rough
                        workmanship sod very hastily sculptured.</p>

                        and has addressed himself to administrative problems with as fresh an energy

                        examination for the Indian Civil Servie. The man who was dragged in chains
                        by the Mahdi's horse, a symbol and victim of the False Prophet's fleeting
                        triumph, has at his finger’s ends all the latest statistics as to the
                        revenue of the reconquered provinces. He describes, with the concentrated
                        interest of a practical philanthropist, the elaborate measures which have
                        been taken or are being prepared for the improvement of railway and motor
                        communication between the interior and the coast and for the irrigation of a

                        subalterns in the great work of civilisations to which the least favorable
                        critics of Great Britain yield unstinted praise; but no member of that
                        memorable band has rendered better service or given shrewder counsel to his

                        from imminent jeopardy of a living death back again to a career of
                        beneficent activity. For the details of the industrial development which

                        that we weald direct especial attention, because this illustrates the signal
                        success which, in every part of the world, attends British colonisers in
                        their dealings with races of inferior or retarded development. Take, for
                        instance, the missionary question. How do the Anglo-Egyptian authorities
                        face that always thorny problem <persName
                            ref="http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/39736">Slatin</persName>
                        Pasha explains, in a few sentences, the principle on which they proceed.
                        Roughly, the Sudan is divided into two political regions. The northern part
                        is inhabited mainly, if not entirely, by Moslems, and on their fanatical
                        faith and stereotyped stage of culture it has hitherto been found impossible
                        for the evangelists of Christianity to make any sensible impression. As to
                        the future, it would be inexcusable to hazard a general prophecy, but, at
                        the present time, and in the Northern Sudan, it would endanger the permanent
                        interests of civilisation if the Government were to sanction proselytising
                        efforts which would surely be interpreted as an insidious and especially
                        hateful form of political aggression. We must work more patiently, and be
                        content with intermediate revolts. There are missionary schools established
                        at Kharatoum for the children of Christian residents, and we are glad to
                        learn that these are attended by young Moslems. But it is well
                        understood—and the compact is faithfully observed—that these institutions
                        are maintained for the purposes of general education, and not with a view to
                        undermine the ancient religion of the people. In the southern districts of
                        the Sudan the conditions are different, and another rule is observed. The
                        people are pagans of a rather low type, and, knowing the Moslems chiefly as
                        slave raiders, bear no affection for the faith of their persecutors. There
                        the field is comparatively open to missionary enterprise, and has already
                        yielded a certain spiritual harvest But the more prudent pioneers, of that
                        light which the Western races are giving back to the Oriental source from
                        which it was borrowed are content to move slowly, step by step. They make no
                        raid on the polygamous custom which is the base of a primitive morality. To
                        insist on the dismissal of all but s single — probably the most elderly —
                        wife would not merely be a sacrifice that would appal the hesitating
                        convert. It would also shake the social system of the tribe, deprive
                        innocent women of their reoognieed status, and brand innumerable children
                        with an unintelligible illegitimacy.</p>
                    <p>Similar caution had at first to be observed in the treatment of another
                        "domestic institution.” The barbarities of the slave trade have been
                        summarily suppressed throughout the Sudan. "There is no raiding on a big
                        scale,” says <persName ref="http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/39736"
                            >Slatin</persName> Pasha. Isolated revivals are attempted in remote
                        spots and kidnapping is sometimes reported. But the delinquents are sharply
                        punched, and the dangers that attend the sport—for that is the light in
                        which it presents itself to Arab adventurers — are generally understood.
                        “The traffic in human flesh," we are told, "has practically ceased." We
                        would not aver that it is nowhere possible to purchase a slave-girl, but the
                        business has become clandestine and is rapidly dying away. Nevertheless, the
                        absolute abolition of slavery, which was decreed after Lord Kitchener’s
                        re-conquest of the Sudan, was not without its drawbacks. As in our West
                        Indies and in the United States, a race which had hitherto worked only under
                        compulsion did not easily take to voluntary labour. By degrees, however, the
                        lazy, easy-going but not unintelligent negroes have agreement and assistance
                        of the Arab population, we are gradually changing the status of slavery into
                        one of paid labour.' This, ha adds, "will be liked by both master and
                        servant” For that revolution of sentiment we must be content to wait a
                        generation. It is not in human nature either for employers to relish paying
                        money for work that they used to get for nothing, or for employes to have
                        their reward proportioned to the amount of energy that they put into their
                        task. We have our wages problems and labour troubles even in this
                        enlightened land. Other discontent in the Sudan there seems to be none—none,
                        at least, of a dangerous kind. There are trilab feuds which the Government
                        has to check with a cold, impartial hand. And not long ago crack-brained
                        pretender tried to set up a new religion and proclaimed himself to be the
                        "Prophet Jesus.” We have witnessed similar phenomena nearer home. It is
                        interesting to note that the Sudanese impostor only suceeded in winning
                        eleven disciples. <persName

                        Pasha does not describe the methods of reconversion adopted by the
                        Government We infer, however, that the action taken was short, sharp, and
                        decisive.</p>
                    <p>Not the least interesting passage in Sir Rudolph’s account of his personal
                        experiences relates to an interview that he held with a number of sheikhs
                        representative of the nomad Arab tribes. They object to paying tribute—
                        contributing to the expenses of public administration—but the reason which
                        they put forward may seem paradoxical to the western mind. They understand
                        and acknowledge the authority of superior strength. It is the principle by
                        which they have justified their secular exploitation of weaker or less
                        intelligent races. In the British they have met with a greater power than
                        their own, and they are content to submit to what they regard as the logical
                        oonsequences. "I am willing," said a consistent upholder of the ancien
                        regime, to pay yon tribute because you are the stronger. The lion has a
                        right to take toll of the herd because he is king of the forest. But I am
                        not willing to pay tribute tor being protected." Ha could protect himself!
                        What, of course, he meant was that he objected to being protected under a
                        system which protected others against himself. That, in fact was what ho
                        practically confessed. The Arabs, he declared, are a fighting race, and the
                        Pax Britannica had "taken all the spice out of their life." Nor are these
                        unabashed champions of the "good old role, the simple plan,” quite ignorant
                        of contemporary events in the civilised world. The echoes of oru quarrels
                        reverberate to the inner Sudan. <persName
                            ref="http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/39736">Slatin</persName>
                        Pasha was hard put to it to find a convincing answer when his Arab
                        interrogator asked him whether we do not sometimes have wars in Europe. All
                        he could plead in reply was the vague formula about "reasons of State."
                        "It’s all the same,” was the almost pathetic rejoinder; "you have the sport
                        and fun of fighting." There was no more to be said. The point of view was
                        too hopelessly different Protesting his loyally, the aggrieved sheikh went
                        his way, not without regretting that he "had been made like a woman.”
                        Undoubtedly, the problem which his valdediction presents will not be solved
                        within a few years. The Arabs, who stand for the higher, though abruptly
                        arrested, type of social evolution in Africa, are not without certain
                        aptitudes for civilised life. They are versed in all the arts of barter and
                        exchange. As merchants and distributors of native products the better class
                        may accommodate themselves to modern conditions, and the lower grade,
                        especially when they have been crossed with negro blood, are not specially
                        faithless or inefficient in domestic service. But for steady industrial toil
                        they have been unfitted by centuries of idleness in the open air. Fighting
                        is the one serious profession which appeals to their genius, and evokes
                        their best, as well as their worst, qualities. The process of adaptation to
                        peaceful and monotonous usefulness has hardly commenced, and it will not be
                        completed within the lifetime of any living person. The best hope of
                        eventual civilisation lies in their readiness to assimilate some elements of
                        European culture. The schools and colleges which have been set at work at
                        various centres in the Sudan may, in course of time, revive the dormant
                        intellectual gifts of a race which at one time preserved the learning that
                        had almost expired in the dark ages of European history Author Avrrhous may
                        arise from the city which less than ten years ago was the unapproachable
                        stronghold of tyranny and brutish ignorance.</p>
                    <p>British Chamber of Commerce.—We would draw the attention of manufacturers and
                        merchants to the work of the British Chamber of Commerce of <placeName
                            ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q79">Egypt</placeName>, which was
                        formed in 1896 with the sole object of assisting British trade in this
                        country. The services of the Chamber are always at the disposal of any
                        member desiring information on trade matters generally, including the
                        question of appointing suitable agents. As no fee is charged for such
                        advice, it is obviously in the interests of all British traders here to
                        become members, especially when it is remembered that the annual
                        subscription is merely the nominal one of £1. The latter payment also
                        includes a copy of the monthly Journal issued by the Chamber. Home enquirers

                    <p>The story told of Lord <persName
                            ref="http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32680">Curzon</persName>,
                        when leaving Eton, promising to make a schoolfellow Chancellor of the
                        Exchequer when himself Prime Minister, will be borne in mind, with a view to
                        seeing if fulfilment attend the pledge, and when Lord <persName
                            ref="http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32680">Curzon</persName>
                        realises his own boyish ambition. Lord <persName
                            ref="http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35612">Rosebery</persName> as
                        a boy declared for the Premiership and the Derby, and has enjoyed the honors
                        of both and is not yet old. Lord <persName
                            ref="http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32680">Curzon</persName>'s
                        horoscope, cast by a learned Hindu, includes the Premiership; hence his
                        old-time friend may hope on. Boys' promises are easily made, and still more
                        easily forgotten; still, some of them are redeemed. Said Disraeli to
                        Chochare-Baillie, his school chum, "When I am Prime Minister of England,
                        Cocky, I'll make you a peer.” And he did, and the present baron is the
                        second holder of the title promised by a boy and given by a statesman.</p>

                    <p>Great progress is being made in the opening up of the French Niger country.
                        The railway has been carried as far as Koulikoro, on the Niger, and a
                        steamer service has for the first time been established between this point
                        and Timbuctoo, the river journey occupying three days. From <placeName
                            ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q90">Paris</placeName>, Timbuctoo can
                        now be reached in 15 days. It is one of the dreams of French expansion that
                        steady improvement of the means of access may render the Niger as much a
                        winter resort as the Nile now is.</p>
