                        <head>THE NATIONAL BANK.</head>
                        <p>The death of <persName>Sir Elwin Palmer</persName> has naturally set all
                            Egypt speculating as to who will be his successor. The appointment in
                            question is the highest salaried post in the country, and even if we
                            include official appointments it is one of the most important billets in
                            Egypt. It is therefore incumbent upon us to give utterance <cb n="6"/>
                            to the general opinion upon this great appoiot ment with no uncertain
                            voice, for we know well that our opinions on the matter are entire- ly
                            in accord with those of the pubic. The National Bank of Egypt, be it
                            remembered, is a national institution, controlled and conduct- ed by
                            British subjects. We Britishers are therefore morally responsible for
                            the way in which it is earned on, and also for the integ- rity of its
                            governing staff. The responsibility of the selection of a successor to
                                <persName>Sir Elwin Palmer</persName> rests in the main upon the
                            totelary Power, which, in setting up a State Bank, should have provided
                            proper safeguards and taken efficient precautions to ensure the choice
                            falling upon one whose character, career, con- nections, and social
                            position are a guarantee of his probity. In any event it cannot be too
                            strongly insisted upon that the Governor of the National Bank of Egypt
                            should be a personage not merely enjoying the fullest con- fidence of
                            the commercial and financial world, but one whose activities should be
                            restricted to the National Bank alone. We therefore consider that it is
                            the duty of <persName>Lord Cromer</persName> and <persName>Sir Ernest
                                Cassel</persName> to take the necessary safeguards that the new
                            Governor should devote his service exclusively to the National Bank and
                            give companies and com pony-promoting a wide berth. The bank's business,
                            one would think, is sufficiently exten- sive to take up all one man's
                            time, and the salary is sufficiently remunerative to enable him to
                            withstand, the temptation of dabbling in other financial enterprises.
                            Fancy the Governor of the Bank of England mixing himself up with a host
                            of petty industrial limited liability companies. The idea sounds
                            preposterous. Yet the National Bank of Egypt holds a position in this
                            country analogous with, if not identical to, that of the Bank of England
                            at home. Even though it be not stipulated in the terms of his
                            appointment, it ought to be part of the unwritten law that the Governor
                            of the National Bank shall not engage in any business unconnected with
                            that of the beak itself. We have always wondered that the Egyptian
                            Government did not lay down some such stipulation when the bank was
                            founded. At any rate, now is the time to enforce this most salutary
                            rule, and it will be certainly to the interest of the bank itself, no
                            less than to that of Egypt's financial prestige, if the Governor elect
                            should take that strict view of his high position and
                            responsibility.</p>

                        <p>The great trunk railway through Africa from south to north, projected by
                            the genius of <persName>Mr. Rhodes</persName>, has made astonishingly
                            quick progress since it crowed the Zambesi at Vic- toria Falls. When
                                <persName>Sir Charles Metcalfe</persName> lately visited rail-head,
                            it was 260 miles beyond the great river, and had been advancing at the
                            rate of a mile per diem. Apparently, no engineer- ing difficulties had
                            been encountered up to that data, the country being level and very
                            little broken by watercourses. But a few miles far- ther on the Kafue
                            River presented itself, neces- sitating the construction of a bridge
                            1,600 feet long. In European countries that would be regarded as a tough
                            and prolonged labour, but the Briton in Africa accepts even more
                            formidale obstacles as all in the day's work. While the bridge is being
                            made and got into position necessary earth work is being raH1/ carried
                            out on the farther ride, leaving nothing else to be done for nearly a
                            hundred miles than laying sleepers and rails. Should all go well, it is
                            calculated that by next Midsummer there will be unbroken railway
                            communication between Cape Town and the Broken Hill zinc and lead mines,
                            nearly 400 miles beyond the Zambesi. But something even more important
                            than the provision of quicker and cheaper transport facilities is being
                            accomplished. <persName>Sir Charles Metcalfe</persName>, who extended
                            his explora- tions far away from the line, reports that the natives
                            highly appreciate the greater security for life and property which has
                            accompanied the establishment of white administration. By nature, the
                            inhabitants of Northern Rhodesia are as a rule peaceful folks, well
                            content so long as they are permitted to reap the fruits industry, and
                            they have to thank the coming of the white man for rescue from the
                            savage tyranny of their fiercer neighbours.</p>

                        <p>Yesterday a young Greek was walking on the banks of the Mahmoudieh Canal,
                            when he was met by his rival in the affections of a girl. The latter
                            drew his knife, which he plunged into the other Greek's stomach, and
                            leaving him for dead, tossed the knife into the canal and made off. The
                            victim did not succumb, but he lies in a precarious condition in
                            hospital.</p>

                                Frederick Fison</persName> in the course of his speech related a
                            very amusing story told to him by <persName>Lord Balfour</persName> of
                            Burleigh with regard to the awkward conditions of rail- way working in
                            the Sudan desert. A telegram was received at the head office, "Station-
                            master dead ; what shall we do !" The reply sent was, "Bury him ; but be
                            sure he is quite dead." Then followed the return message, "Stationmaster
                            dead. Buried. Hit him on the head with a fishplate !"</p>

                        <p>A Hint for Advertisers.</p>
                        <p>A unique and brilliant advertising scheme was conceived the other day by
                            a Brooklyn business man, which might he carried into effect in
                                <persName>Cherif Pacha-Street</persName> or some of the Cairo
                            thoroughfares. He had his advertising sign affixed in raised letters to
                            the tyre of an automobile so that when the letters were by an
                            arrangement, coated over with white paint the machine painted his
                            advertisement on the asphalt wherever it was driven. The Brooklyn
                            street-cleaning commissioner, being an unresponsive soul who did not
                            appreciate a stroke of genius like this on the pavement threatened him
                            with the police, and promptly squelched the whole scheme.</p>
                        <p>Two Old Egyptian Books.</p>
                        <p><persName>Dr. Wallis Budge</persName> of the British Museum, has made a
                            translation of, and written a commentary on, the curious Egyptian books
                            known as The Book of what is in Hades' and 'The Book of the Gates'
                            respectively. These two works give pictures of the life after death
                            which differ in many respects from that which can be drawn from the more
                            generally known 'Book of the Dead,' and they are a good deal later in
                            date, not having been, apparently, reduced to writing until the
                            eighteenth or nineteenth dynasty. Dr. Budge's translation will be
                            published early next month by Messrs. Kegan Paul &amp; Co., and will
                            form the first English version of these books which has yet appears.</p>

                    <p>The announcement, which <persName>Lord Cromer</persName> made on Saturday at
                        Port Sudan as to'his determination to remain in Egypt as long as he possibly
                        can, has caused a very favourable impression in the City and also in the
                        Press. In an article on the inauguration and the speech the "Standard"
                        states that the most secure guarantee for the development and prosperity of
                        the Sudan is <persName>Lord Cromer's</persName> de- cision to remain in
                        Egypt. Eulogistic notices pervade the Press, and the "Daily Telegraph"
                        declares that the "proconsular sceptre of Great Britain" was never wielded
                        by a stronger man than <persName>Lord Cromer</persName>.</p>

                        Trust and Investment, Limited was elected a director of the Alexandria and
                        Ramleh Railway Company at the annual meeting held yesterday at the company's
                        offices, and we understand that arrangements have been made whereby
                            <persName>Baron de Easel Bey</persName>, general manager of the Egyptian
                        Trust and Investment Ltd., will join the board of the Alexandria Tramway
                        Company. These appointments would seem to indicate and confirm the rumours
                        which have been current here for some time past to the effect that the
                        Egyptian Trust and Investment, Ltd. is largely interested in the Alexandria
                        Tram way Company. The development of the town and surround- ing suburbs is
                        increasing rapidly to such an extent that it is evident additional tram
                        lines and branches will be necessary, consequently this means larger and
                        increased revenues for the company. The Egyptian Trust and Investment, who
                        are proprietors of a large extension of land at Ramleh and in the suburbs,
                        have evidently gauged the situation clearly and taken time by the forelock
                        in securing a large interest in such a prosperous local undertaking as the
                        Alexandria Tramways.</p>

                    <p>We understand that this company intends making a bid next season for the
                        supply of the London market with dates from their cases, where the date
                        trees are to he frond in large numbers and the fruit is of the finest
                        quality, quite equal in every respect to that of other countries which now
                        ship to the English markets, vis., Tunis, Algiers, snd the Persian Gulf. The
                        latter place exports some 150,000 cases annually to London and a great deal
                        more to America. The cases of Khargeh also produce oranges of a very
                        superior description, and judging by them as a sample of what the oases can
                        grow it is a fair promise of the future agricultural prosperity of the
                        regions owned by the Corporation, the lands of which should considerably
                        increase in value on the completion of the new railway now being laid to
                        Khargeh from Farchont, where it joins the State railway line to Upper Egypt.
                        The opening of these cases should prove a valuable addition to agricultural
                        Egypt and explains the statement made by Lord Cromer in his 1904 report,
                        where, referring to the limitations of Egypt from the development point of
                        view, be says : "Possibly something may eventually be done ..... in the
                        cases of the Lybian desert." Certainly, judging by the boring of wells,
                        building of railways, export of fruit, and some other projects contemplated,
                        this looks very much like something being done, and <persName>Lord
                            Cromer's</persName> prophecies are already being gradually
                        fulfilled.</p>

                    <p>Following my last notes on the state of affairs of this company, I have
                        gathered the following, and would especially call the atten- tion of those
                        Ministers who are responsible for its proper administration to remove the
                        bur- den of inconvenience and annoyance the inha- bitants of Fayoum province
                        are groaning under. It appears the company have all at once disco- vered
                        they are using more than double the amount of coal they were 18 months ago,
                        and without considering any reason why, decided each engine should have the
                        same as previous- ly (about 100% less than last month). This order has been
                        in force about a week, and every day one or two of those on the longer runs
                        have finished their fuel when only half- way back home and there the
                        passengers have had to remain until and employe walked to the nearest
                        telephone "for a special" with coal to be sent. In each case these trains
                        have been two or three hours late. On Sunday the train left Tamia at 6 a.m.,
                        arriving at Fayoum at 3.50 p.m. The distance, be it noted, is 25 kilo-
                        meters. "Magnificent," and proves what can be done when one tries. On Monday
                        I had occasion to call at the company's offices at 10.30 a.m. but- it is a
                        positive fact- in the whole block of offices there was not a single living
                        being, not even a bowab awake or asleep at the door. I was therefore unable
                        to transact my business. Truly when the cat is away the mice will play. All
                        these things prevent traffic among passengers, and will account for the
                        continual decrease of receipts. How long will it last?</p>

                    <head>A SUCCESSFUL EXPERIMENT.</head>
                    <p>The report published by the Board of Land Records and Agriculture states that
                        the grow- ing of Egyptian and other varieties of cotton is being carried on
                        steadily in Upper Shand, India. "Yannovitch," the finest of the Egyptian
                        varieties, but regarded as the most delicate of those experimented with, has
                        suffered the smallest amount of deterioration in staple (12 1/2 per cent.)
                        from the quality of the Egyptian- grown product, while "Mitaffifi," which is
                        con- sidered most robust, has shown the greatest amount of deterioration.
                        The general results must, however, but considered as satisfactory in yield
                        as compared even with the Egyptian crop, and by the figures the best
                        Egyptian variety should prove 250 per cent. more profitable to the
                        cultivator than the indigenous Sindhi variety. In all, about 1,500 acres of
                        Egyptian cotton were sown in the past season.</p>

                    <p><persName>Christian IX</persName>, King of Denmark, fourth son of the late
                            <persName>Duke William</persName> of Schleswig-Holstein-
                        Sonderburg-Glücksburg, was born on April 8, 1818. Before his succession to
                        the Crown he was Inspector-General and Commander in Chief of the Danish
                        Calvary. The succession was vested in him by the protocol of London, May 8,
                        1862, and he ascended the throne on the death of <persName>Frederic
                            VII</persName>., Nov. 15, 1868. On his acces- sion, the position of
                        affairs with respect to Schleswig-Holstein was completely changed. The son
                        of the Duke of Augustenburg im- mediately laid claim to the sovereignty of
                        the duchies, although his father had for a com- pensation resigned all his
                        rights in 1852. The independence of Holstein more especially, and of a
                        portion of Schleswig, was warmly espoused by the German Diet, which
                        forthwith ordered the advance of a Federal army to occupy the debstable
                        territory, for the purpose of enforcing its enfranchisement from Danish
                        rule. Before matters had proceeded far, Austria and Prussia determined to
                        interfere, and by a combined armed occupation of the disputed territory to
                        bring the question to an issue independently of the Diet, and in opposition
                        to the wishes of that body. They accordingly invaded the duchies, which,
                        after a hotly contested cam- paign, they succeeded in wresting from Den-
                        mark, also taking temporary possession of Jutland Christian IX, disappointed
                        in not obtaining assistance from some European Power, after the failure of
                        the conference con- vened in London in 1884, which failure was in some
                        measure attributable to the obstinacy of the Danish Government entered into
                        negotiations for peace with Prussia and Austria, and a treaty was signed at
                        Vienna, Oct 30, 1864. The King of Denmark renounced all his rights to
                        Schleswig-Holstein and Lauenburg, and in 1866 the two German Powers
                        quarrelled over the spoil. Since then his Majesty had sought to develop the
                        interior sources and popular institutions of his country. A new constitution
                        was inaugurated in Nov., 1866, when the late King opened the first Rigsdag,
                        the members of which were elect- ed in accordance with the new electoral
                        law. The army and navy have also been thoroughly reorganised agriculture and
                        commerce have received a great stimulus, and several railways have been
                        constructed. Christian IX. and <persName>Queen Louise</persName> visited the
                        Queen (then Prin- cess of Wales) at Marlborough House, in March, 1867. The
                        marriage of the Crown Prince of Denmark with the <persName>Princesa
                            Louisa</persName>, daughter of the King of Sweden, at Stockholm, on July
                        28, 1869, was hailed as a pledge of union between the two countries. His
                        Majesty granted a new constitution to Iceland which came into operation in
                        August, 1874, that being the thousandth year of Iceland's existence as a
                        nation. He went to Reikiajvik on the occasion of the anniversary being
                        celebrated, and on his return paid a flying visit to Leith and Edinburgh,
                        Aug. 18,1874. He visited the <persName>Emperor Wil- liam II</persName>. at
                        Berlin in August, 1888, and in the autumn of 1889 was visited by the Emperor
                        of Russia and his family. In 1842 he married a daughter of the Landgrave
                        William of Hesse-Cassel by whom he has had six children, and among them the
                        King of Grewe, our own <persName>Queen Alexandra</persName>, and the
                            <persName>Princess Dagmar</persName>, married to the late Tsar of
                        Russia. On May 26, 1892, the King and Queen of Denmark celebrated their
                        golden wedding amid many demonstrations of loyalty and popular rejoicing.
                        The latest event in his family was the selection of his grandson as King of
                        Norway.</p>

                        which the gale abated. Several native lighters suffered considerably, but no
                        life was lost. Navigation in the Canal was rendered most difficult, and many
                        ships had to tie up for a short time, till the storm was over.</p>

                        the title has been held by members of the Tufton, Southwell, and Russell

                            <p>At the Reichstag banquet, the President said that the famous landing
                                of the Emperor at Tangier had diverted the question of Morocco into
                                a course favourable to Germany, but to ensure peace they must be
                                able to knock on the head anybody attempting to disturb it. The
                                Reichstag must therefore support the Emperor's policy and vote the

                    <head>PROGRESS OF THE RAILWAY.</head>
                    <head>RECORD CONSTRUCTION.</head>
                    <p>Reuter's representative has had an interview with <persName>Sir Charles
                            Metcalfe</persName>, who has just return- ed to England on the
                        conclusion of an inter esting journey from the Zambesi to the Congo Free
                        State border. Discussing the progress of the Cape to Cairo railway,
                            <persName>Sir Charles Metcalfe</persName> said: "A fortnight ago the
                        rails reached the Kafue River, 260 miles beyond the Victoria Falls, and at
                        this point a bridge 1,600ft long is being constructed to cross the stream.
                        Beyond the Kafue the earthworks are nearly finished for a further distance
                        of seventy miles, so that we hope that the line will reach the Broken Hill
                        zinc and lead mines by June. There will thus be con tinuous communication
                        from Cape Town to a point 374 miles north of the Zumbesi. The line is
                        progressing at the rate of one mile a day. On one occasion, however, we
                        managed to lay 5 3/4 miles in ten hours. A French engineer who had been
                        constructing railways in French West Africa and was visiting Rhodesia would
                        not at first believe that construction could go on at a greater rate than
                        half a mile a day, and in order to show him what we could do and our method
                        of working, we laid a quarter of a mile in twenty minutes. "My recent
                        journey to the Congo border had partly for its object a preliminary survey
                        of the regions beyond Broken Hill. While nothing has yet been definitely
                        decided as to the farther extension, it is probable that the next section of
                        the line will go from Broken Hill due north to Bwone Macubwa, a point on the
                        Congo border, and the centre of a rich copper area in north west Rhodesia,
                        where there are a fes whites developing the copper mines. The region is
                        fine, open, and hilly. "In times past there has been taken out of the hill
                        side copper ore in two parallel cuts, one about 12ft wide, and tin other 5ft
                        wide, and both run close together for a distance of 3,000ft. Under the hill
                        are caves of green malachite, which is very rich in copper. The country all
                        round was well watered, and having an altitude of 4,500ft, was qute cool at
                        night. The whole of the region is peaceful and secure, presenting a great
                        contrast to the con dition of affairs a few years ago. The natives are now
                        free from the raids from which they suffered, and enjoy security of
                        property. They recognise the benefits of a chartered company's control."</p>

                    <dateline>Helouan, Saturday.</dateline>
                    <p>Visitors at Helouan spent a delightful evening on Wednesday last, when an
                        entertain ment was given at the Tewfik Palace Hotel in aid of the Uganda
                        Mission. With the aid of the management a most picturesque stage had been
                        created at one end of the spacious hall and the other part was crowded with
                        over one hundred and fifty visitors. The chief attraction consisted of a
                        series of tableaux of nursery rhymes with modernized versions in which the
                        following took part : <persName>Miss Beutley</persName>, <persName>Miss K.
                            Bentley</persName>, <persName>Miss Hint</persName>, <persName>Miss
                            Phillips</persName>, <persName>Miss Woodle</persName>, <persName>Mr. A.
                            Bentley</persName>, <persName>Mr. W. Bentley</persName>, <persName>Lt.
                            G. Cory</persName>, <persName>Mr. Mills</persName>, and "Jepp," who, as
                        Mother Hubbard's dog, was inimitable. Between the tableaux there were songs
                        and recitations, among which a whistling solo with auto-harp accompaniment
                        by <persName>Miss Tottenham</persName> and a most apropos recitation about
                        the "Cairo and Elwan Express," by <persName>Mr. Hans Sawyer</persName>,
                        deserve special mention. <persName>Miss Breeze</persName> and <persName>Mrs.
                            Phillips</persName> also sang, and the <persName>Rev. C. H
                            Banning</persName> gave a reading. At the close a hearty vote of thanks
                        was passed to <persName>Mrs. Freeman</persName> for organiz- ing the
                        entertainment, to <persName>Mrs. Mills</persName> for arranging the tableaux
                        and <persName>Mr. Sawyer</persName> for superintending the erection of the
                        stage. A special word of praise is due to the manage ment of the hotel on
                        account of the excellent arrangements made for the occasion. The creditable
                        sum of over L.E 16 has been for warded to the Mission. Over thirty people
                        have booked accommoda- tion at the Tewfik Palace Hotel for Beyram, and this
                        hotel promises to be the rendez-vous of a large and select party during the
                        feast Besides picnics and other outdoor amuse- ments, the stabling, which is
                        unique, offers an opportunity for those who go in for riding for which the
                        surrounding desert is to justly celebrated. Visitors at the hotel can
                        witness every morning the training of over forty race horses on the course
                        immediately adjoining the hotel. The second race meeting will take place on
                        Friday next at 2 p.m. and those desirous of reserving tables for luncheon
                        are advised to give notice beforehand to the management as the dining room
                        is generally more than fall on these occasions. During luncheon a string
                        band, will perform a selection of classical music. Combined Tewfik race
                        tickets, including railway fare, luncheon, tea, and entrance to members'
                        enclosure stand and paddock, are obtainable at Stephenson and Co., chemist,

                    <p>This match was played on the school ground on Saturday week and resulted in a
                        win for the College by 3 goals to 1. The Eastern Telegraph Co. had not their

                    <p>FOOTBALL CUP TIE</p>
                    <p>"Onlooker" (Cairo) writes:- Will you allow me through the columns of your
                        most valuable paper to make a few remarks on the game on Saturday between
                        the two famous Fusilier Regiments? I should like to know who was responsible
                        for the arrangement of such an important game. Did they think there were no
                        linesmen required and that as long as there was a referee there it was
                        sufficient? And why did the referee start the game before he was certain
                        that he had these important men which in all cases should be neutral and not
                        two men of the one corps, namely the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, also
                        there men should be competent men and not men to argue with players. The
                        game from start to finish was well contested, the first half opened well in
                        favour of the Dubs and with the sun in their faces kept their opponents very
                        busy in defending their goal, but the better training of the Cairo men soon
                        gave them the advantage and they soon gave Rice plenty to do. The goal
                        scored by the outside right was a splendid piece of work and right before
                        half time a fumble between goalkeeper and back gave Lusy a chance to
                        equalize, which he did in fine style. The second half opened well for the
                        Cairo men, who rushed away, and Rice was called on to throw away close to
                        goal. The outside left got the ball and passed to the inside right, who
                        scored; this man was offside but the referee failed to see it and allowed
                        the goal. Another regrettable thing happened shortly afterwards; a linesman
                        raised his flag the referee did not see it and the Skills scored again. the
                        was allowed amid the joy of their supporters until the Dubs appealed, and
                        the mistake was rectified. Handling amongst the Dubs was very prevalent but
                        the referee could not see it and again the ball was more than once behind
                        the goal line and was still allowed to be played. On the whole the
                        refereeing left very much to be desired. The defense of the Dubs was far in
                        advance of their opponents, but the Cairo team had the beet set of forwards.
                        The goal keeping by Rice could not be better and he well merited the
                        applause he received from all present. The game was more like a friendly
                        than a Cup tie, both sets of players acted like gentlemen, on no occasion
                        was the referee called on to sound his whistle for anything in the ships of
                        fouls except offside and hands. A draw would have been right. I hope better
                        arrangements will be made when the final takes place and that the necessary
                        linesmen will be obtained before the game starts. </p>

                    <byline>(From a Correspondent).</byline>
                    <dateline>Assouan, Thursday. </dateline>
                    <p>Yesterday was the first Gymkhana we have held here this season. The
                        beautifully laid out lawns and flower gardens of the Savoy not being
                        available for the noble Egyptian donkey to be galloped on, the various
                        events "came off" in the immense eastern gravelled courtyard of the Cataract
                        Hotel. As the French say, it is "vieux cliche," but the day was spotless,
                        and though the sun was very warm (about 112 F.) yet a cool and gentle breeze
                        tempered the air. All the hotels sent nearly all their guests, and to the
                        ordinary person suddenly transplanted here from Europe on an Aladdin's
                        carpet or a lightning-speed Cook's ticket, the scene would have been
                        unbelievable, given the date. The ladies' dresses were many of them very
                        beautiful and the flushed and excited appearance of the many young people
                        lent a degree of merriment and spirit to the operations uncommon in these
                        local fetes. The spectators occupied seats on the great terrace of the
                        hotel, while long rows of elegantly-dressed people were to the right and
                        left Royalty, beauty, and good humour made everything perfect, while the
                        proceedings, under the guidance of one of our frequent and well-known
                        visitors (<persName>Mr. Pembroke</persName>) passed off without a hitch. The

                    <head>AN ARABIC VOCABULARY FOR THE ANGLO-EGYPTIAN SUDAN.</head>
                    <p>Captain H. F. S. Amery has compiled an English-Arabic vocabulary primarily
                        for the use of British officers and officials serving in the Anglo Egyptian
                        Sudan. But it is hoped that it may also prove of some use to visitors to the
                        Sudan, or to those interested in the various dialects of the Arabic
                        language. The work consists of two distinct elements :—(1) The technical
                        terms in use in the Egyptian Army and in the various departments of the
                        Sudan Government; (2) some 3 500 words of the most common daily usage
                        translated into the Arabic equivalents employed for those in conversation
                        among the Arabs of the Anglo Egyptian Sudan. The British official, on
                        arrival in the Sudan, has immediately to direct his attention to the
                        acquisition of an extremely difficult language. His difficulties have
                        hitherto been enormously increased by the lack of proficient teachers and
                        the practical absence of any printed assistance. Each new comer has to pick
                        up a large number of most accessary words as best he can, with the result
                        that he is often content with learning just sufficient to enable him to make
                        his meaning intelligible, or to pass the various Government examinations,
                        and even this minimum he acquires more slowly than necessary. At present no
                        English Arabic vocabulary or dictionary (of reasonable dimensions) exists,
                        which contains even a fraction of the technical terms in daily use in the
                        Army or in the various branches of the Civil Government, nor are any of the
                        many vocabularies of colloquial Arabic of use in the Sudan, except perhaps
                        in Khartoum and a few other towns where the population has come much into
                        contact with Egyptians and Syrians. The object, therefore, of this
                        vocabulary is to enable an official on entering the Sudan to find the
                        particular technical terms which are in use in the Egyptian Army, or the
                        department to which be is attached, and also the Arabic for such words as he
                        is likely to require to carry on a simple conversation. It it stated in the
                        preface that "there is some danger that the Sudan Arabs, in ignorance of the
                        eloquence and purity of their language, may adopt some of the colloquialism
                        of Egypt, as they come into contact with the Egyptian and Syrian officials.
                        But the spread of education, the study of the Koran and of the classical
                        Arabic should do much to counteract this influence." *English Arabic

                    <head>RETRIBUTION.</head>
                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette. Sir, —Though I am well aware that a
                        controversy regarding home politics would be out of place in your columns,
                        yet bearing in mind the engrossing interest which Englishmen of all shades
                        of opinion most necessarily take at the present juncture in the nations
                        affairs, I would crave leave for a little of your valuable space to reply to
                        your leader under the above heading. The writer assumes with that air of
                        assurance habitual to his class and calling that the British electorate have
                        changed their public servants because of the disunion which existed within
                        their ranks, and likewise from a good humoured sort of feeling that it was
                        time to give the other side a turn. My knowledge of our people leads me to
                        diverge from this view. From what I saw and heard when last in England a few
                        months ago, everyone, even the Unionists themselves outside official
                        circles, were tired of <persName>Mr. Balfour</persName>'s Government, which,
                        if it had possessed a shadow of a shade of decency and self-respect, would
                        have resigned two years previously. That regime, from the time that the next
                        prominent and trusted politicians dissociated themselves from their
                        colleagues and the Cabinet was re-constituted of untried and, therefore
                        unqualified, functionaries, forfeited in toto the confidence of the people.
                        In their eyes, thenceforth, Mr. Balfour's Administration stood for privilege
                        and patronage, the upholder of snobbery and jobbery, which drew within its
                        folds those whose only claims to preferment were pride of birth and wealthy
                        connections. The British people may be conservative in many things but they
                        are democrats in their abhorrence of "flunkey-ism" in all its phases. Still
                        the Government held on, aye, held on by mean and contemptible devices, by
                        resorting to shams, to shifts, and subterfuges which outraged every sense of
                        public rectitude and political propriety. Mr. Balfout and his satellites had
                        long ceased to represent the sentiments or conform to the wishes of the
                        nation. They were no longer the faithful and obedient servants of the public
                        but had become its domineering, arrogant, and tyrannical masters. With their
                        exaggerated and exasperating Imperialism they constituted themselves the
                        prototype not of bluff John Bull but of blustering John Bully. And so at the
                        very first opportunity given to the people to express an Opinion upon their
                        shameful dereliction of public duty and degradation of political life Mr.
                        Balfour's Administration has been dismissed by a crushing defeat at the
                        polls, in spite of all the red herrings that were employed to obscure the
                        real issue. That the people should have thus spoken, and with no uncertain
                        voice, affords once again convincing and unmistakable proof of their
                        unconquerable common-sense, their manly independence, and their unfaltering
                        love of equality and justice. </p>

                    <head>MERCHANT SEAMEN'S HOME.</head>
                    <p>On Thursday evening, the 25 h inst. the annual tea and entertainment given by
                        the ladies of Ramleh took place at the Home under the organization of Mr R J
                        Moss. Many willing helpers were busily engaged during the afternoon in
                        preparing the table for the sailors, who arrived at 6 30, numbering fully
                        200, and sat down to enjoy the ample repast provided. Daring the supper,
                        each man was presented with a packet of tobacco and New Year's card (the
                        gift of Mrs Moss) and a "buttonhole." After all had partaken heartily, the
                        tables were cleared and the musical portion commenced, the Rev. Canon Ward
                        kindly toting as chairman. All the Kings, recitations and instrumental items
                        were received with appreciative applause. Many "encores" were called for and
                        readily given. The concluding number was the comical sketch entitled "Black
                        Justice," given by the nigger troupe of the Moss S.S. Seti, the humorously
                        illegal decisions of Justice Grabball and the eccentric behaviour of both
                        policeman and prisoners causing much merriment. On the proposal of the
                        chairman, three hearty cheers were given for the King and Royal Family,
                        which were followed by three more for the ladies of Ramleh and a very
                        pleasant evening terminated at 10 o'clock with another three cheers for the
                        chairman and the singing of the National Anthem. It was a pleasing incident
                        to notice amongst the audience nine boys of the Blind Industrial School who
                        came under the charge of Mr. Wood, the manager of the school. They fully
                        enjoyed the entertainment and have testified their appreciation by sending a
                        touching letter of thanks, in which Mr. Wood says:- "To-night, after fes,
                        they elected their chairman and he told all the other boys to whom they were
                        indebted for the good fare and then called for three cheers for the ladies
                        of Ramleh to which they all responded in a very hearty manner. Special
                        thanks are due to the captains of the S.S. Seti, Menes, Moeris and Fabian,
                        for lending flags for decoration. The following was the programme:-song,
                        "The Motor Car," Mr. H. E. C. Moss ; songs, "Quick Work" and "I burst out
