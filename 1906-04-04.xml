                    <head> THE ROYAL VISIT. </head>
                    <p>The “unbroken series of happy and most instructive experiences,’’ as the
                        Prince of Wales called his tour in India in his farewell speech, is, we have
                        every reason to believe, now being repeated daring his visit to Egypt, and
                        we are sure that the significance of the Royal visit to Cairo will long live
                        in the memory of the people. Egyptians have been much impressed by the
                        cordial manner in which the Khedive has been received by King Edward on his
                        visits to England, and the present visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales
                        testifies in an unmistakable manner to the esteem and respect in, which his
                        Highness is held by England’s Sovereign and Heir Apparent. The gratifying
                        marks of loyalty which the Royal victors have received throughout their tour
                        has entailed upon them the arduous labour of incessant ceremonial and one
                        can well imagine that their Royal Highnesses are anxious to return home as
                        speedily as possible, espe-¬cially the Princess of Wales, whose sepa- ration
                        for five months from her young family has, we feel sure, been a severe
                        trial. Their stay in Cairo has therefore a peculiar significance. In view of
                        the relations between England and Egypt, the existence of friendly <cb n="6"
                        />relations between the Royal family and the Ruler of this country is a
                        political desideratum, fiat the visit wears a more personal aspect when
                        regarded in the light of the above considerations, and bearing in mind also
                        the duration of their stay as the guests of the Khedive, which far
                        transcends the limit of time usual in a merely ceremonial visit Looked at
                        from this point of view the Royal visit ought to afford exceptional
                        gratification to the Egyptian people, as it indomitably mast to their
                        hospitable and enlightened Viceroy. No pains or expenses have been spared to
                        make T.R.H.’s experiences of Egypt as delightful as possible, and they will
                        no doubt carry away with them the most pleasant recollections of their stay
                        in Cairo.</p>
                    <p>Everything that tends to draw more closely the ties of friendship between
                        England and Egypt is to be cordially welcomed, An excel- lent impression was
                        created last year by the visit of the Duke end Duchess of Connaught to the
                        Khedive, and the betrothal of their daughter to the son of the Crown Prince
                        of Sweden, occurring as it did while they were the guests of his Highness,
                        excited much pleasur-¬able feeling, which was increased by the invita¬tion
                        given by King Edward to the Khedive to be present at the wedding of the
                        Royal pair, his stay at Buckingham Palace, and the bestowal on his Highness
                        of the insignia of the Victorian Order. The Oriental mind always associates
                        personality with government, end the idea of representa¬tive institutions
                        has not yet made much ad¬vance in the East This consideration should always
                        be borne in mind, for it emphasises the greet necessity for a good
                        understanding to be manifest between the rulers of nations. Thus the visit
                        of the future King and Queen of Eng¬land to the Khedive is an event that
                        should . bear good fruit, and be very helpful in strength- ening, the
                        “entente cordiale" that happily exists between the two countries. </p>
                    <p> There can be no question that the admirable example, set by King Edward
                        when, some¬what to the surprise of many people, he com¬menced paying a round
                        of visits to European capitals, has had excellent results. It is a well-
                        known fact that personal acquaintance is the very best means of bringing
                        together people who would, in the absence of snob, be disposed to be
                        indifferent, if not hostile, to each other. Monarchs, if exalted in
                        position, are human, and therefore equally subject to the emotions that so
                        greatly influence ordinary human notion. There is nothing like personal
                        inter¬course to rob off rough edges and —in the case of rulers—help to oil
                        the wheels of the State machine so that it may work easily and free from
                        friction. But a state visit, with its elabo¬rate ceremonials and necessary
                        restrictions, is not everything ; nor does it afford that oppor¬tunity of
                        studying a country and its natives that is 'so desirable for one destined to
                        fill a position in which such experience is, if not absolutely necessary,
                        highly desirable. We hope, therefore, that it may be possible for the Prince
                        and Princess of Wales before long to bring their children and winter in
                        Egypt. A visit incog., if not conferring upon persons of their exalted rank
                        complete freedom of notion, would at any rate be free from many of the
                        restrictions imposed by a State visit, and we hope that it may be possible
                        for his Highness the Khedive to secure from their Royal Highnesses a pro-
                        mise to pay such a visit under these conditions. </p>
                    <p> Another point strikes us as worthy of mention in connection with this Royal
                        tour. It is with somewhat of a feeling of regret that we recognise the
                        impossibility of ex-tending -it to South Africa. Many people fear that it
                        may not be very long before there will be established there a South African
                        Republic. Nothing in our opinion would tend more to the establishment if a
                        South African Federation of States under the British Crown and loyal to the
                        British Govern- ment than such a visit as that which comes to an end this
                        week. If the visit of the Duke of Connaught, just terminated, could be
                        followed, as in the case of Egypt, by-one from the Prince and Princess of
                        Wales, there is no reasonable doubt that it would greatly tend to reconcile
                        the differences of opinion now, unhappily, so marked at the other end of the
                        African continent. Nothing succeeds like success, and the highly
                        satisfactory results of their Royal I Highnesses’ tour in India and visit to
                        Egypt will, we hope, bring home to the British people the conviction that it
                        will be highly desirable to extend this system to parts of the world at
                        present unvisited. We know of nothing more calculated than this to
                        strengthen the bonds of Empire, or cement the friendship with countries
                        under British influence, especially so when as is the case in Egypt, the
                        most cordial ties of amity prevail between the Khedive and King Edward VII.

                        Tribunal, under the presidency of Judge Heizbruch. the pleading in the case

                    <p>Deaconesses Hospital,</p>
                    <p>The report of the Deaconesses Hospital at Cairo shows that 967 persons have
                        been under treatment there during last year, including 695 men, 221 women,
                        and 51 children. The total comprises 376 Egyptians, 153 Greeks. 102 Germans,

                    <p>The total value of the cigarette exports last, year show a slight decline in
                        the figures for the preceding year. In 1905 Egypt exported cigarettes to the
                        value of L.E. 20,360,285 as against LE. 20,811,040 in 1904. England was
                        Egypt’s largest easterner taking cigarettes to to the value of over ten
                        million pounds. Germany, France, America, and Russia follow¬ed far behind,
                        each taking between one and two millions worth. </p>

                        will be supplied to the first and second class quarters of the town and the
                        Government buildings and gardens. The third class quarter will, owing to
                        insufficiency of funds, wait another year or two for its water supply. The
                        electric light, however, will be for all the town. Three of the four
                        ‘artesian wells are now complete and work” is proceeding on the fourth. </p>

                    <p>The examination in religions knowledge has been fixed for April 6*h. Children
                        aged 7, 8. 9, and 10 inclusive will be classed in the 1st division: children
                        aged 11. 12, 13 and 14 in the 2nd division. In the first di-vision both
                        girls and boys will be required to repeat by heart the catechism to the end
                        of the sixth answer and to answer questions upon the life of our Lord as far
                        as His first miracle. In the 2nd division the first thir¬teen answers in the
                        catechism will be re¬quired by heart; and in addition to the early part of
                        our Lord’s life is mentioned above, to study the close of his life upon
                        earth, that is from his triumphal entry into Jerusalem to his ascension.
                        Every child who makes the repetition required of him or her without a single
                        mistake will receive a small prize, while two prises will be given in each
                        division for the examination upon the life of our Lord. After the
                        examination the prizes will be given away by Lady Cromer in Church House
                        garden. </p>

                    <head> NEW MINISTERIAL BUILDINGS.</head>
                    <p>It was mooted in Cairo last year that the Government intended erecting a huge
                        block of buildings, to accommodate most if not all of the Ministries now at
                        Nasrieh on the large site now occupied by the palace and grounds of the
                        Turkish High Commissioner at Kasr-el-Nil. The Government were at the time
                        seeking to find another suitable residence tor H.E Ghazi Mukhtar Pacha and
                        his suite but the matter was allowed to remain in abeyance for some reason
                        or another. </p>
                    <p>The rumour is now revived that the question of building the new Ministries is
                        about to be brought forward again. In the meanwhile there is another rumour
                        afloat that the splendid site alluded to may eventually be chosen for the
                        new Khedivial Opera House. If so, we know of no better position for such a
                        building and we feel sure that such a choice would meet with general
                        approval, far more so than erect¬ing the new Opera House of the Esbekieh
                        Gardens, as was announced by a Cairo paper a few days ago. </p>

                    <p>The following statement has bean received by us from the Board of Uema of
                        Alexandria : </p>
                    <p>A large number of good and generous people throughout Egypt are day by day
                        for¬warding presents to the Ulema Board of Alex-andria, to prove that they
                        are pleased with and interested in the publication in the newspapers of Dews
                        regarding the Board’s schemes and progress. Their presents and gifts to the
                        1'alaba are greatly appreciated. The mosque students are much encouraged
                        thereby, and they become more diligent in learning. The Uema Board will
                        always act so as to come up to their expectations. The Board is therefore
                        indebted to these generous and distinguished people who support it and
                        encourage it to push forward its schemes. It wishes to thank Mohamed Eff.

                        Ulema Board with a sum of £100 which represents the rent for five months of
                        his property tenanted by the Ulema Board for the residence of the Talaba, at

                    <p>Our Fayoum Correspondent writes that in the course of an interview with one
                        of the most experienced agricultural experts in the J Fayoum, he WAS
                        informed that the advent of the cotton worm was due to the killing off of
                        the white plumed bird known as “Aton Kirdan.” This bird picks up the larva;
                        of the worm and also eats the worm itself. But a de¬mand for its skin has
                        arisen in Europe and so it is being killed off to satisfy this demand and in
                        its absence the worm increases and multiplies. </p>

                    <head>THE ROYAL VISIT.</head>
                    <p>BEDOUIN BERGASS AT GHEZIREH-</p>
                    <p>A MEMORABLE SPECTACLE.</p>
                    <p>We doubt if the grounds of the Khedivial Sporting Club were ever one-half as
                        crowded as they were yesterday afternoon. The stream of motors, private
                        carriages and arabiehs began to flow at 2 p.m. By 2.45 p.m. men whom
                        Carmelite journalism would describe as wide-eyed were bailing carriages in
                        vain and panting Berberins were informing their scowling masters that
                        “Mafeesh arabieh abadan.” The Roulac trams were crowded and the Ghezireh
                        ferry launch repeatedly crossed the Nile with what the naval correspondent
                        describes as a “pronounced list.” However, no one, to the base of our
                        knowledge, was drowned, nor are any set-ions motor accidents reported from
                        the Kasr el Nil Bridge. </p>
                    <p>The scene in the enclosure can only be described as portentous. Three rows of
                        chain as the railings, all occupied, were backed by yet more chairs, stools,
                        and tables. On the roof of the Pari Mutuel sheds rows of sight¬seers braved
                        destruction, the grand stand was crammed, the shilling enclosure fall to
                        burst-ing point, the more or less unwashed swarmed on the outskirts of the
                        K.S.C. grounds and up to the edge of the track, and the ease with which some
                        members of the crowd climbed the lebbek trees in the avenue made one a
                        convert to the theory that our ancestors led a purely arboreal life. </p>
                    <p>As for those present, their names and offices and the rest, the curious must
                        consult the Garrison Directory passim. They were all there and so were a
                        great number of persons whom the directories—Garrison and Rizzo's— knows not
                        -and we hope will never know. One of these individuals is said to have
                        knocked down four English and French ladies in trying to get out. His
                        English betrayed the Dayo. The carriage arrangements were marked by a
                        certain want of system, and though we acknowledge that Cairo most, suffer
                        from possessing only one bridge, still we should hardly have thought that it
                        was necessary to spend more than an hour in driving to or from the fantasia. </p>
                    <p>Another criticism which we should like to make, refers to the sale of tickets
                        at the entrance. In our opinion the chief hotels should have been given
                        tickets to sell some three days before the event; the two or three clerks at
                        the entrance did their best bat they could not cope with the crowds of
                        buyers and a considerable block was the inevitable conse-quence. The police
                        sent their tempers and did their best, but they did not p-event a carriage
                        driving across the course while some of the Bedouins were galloping past,
                        with the result that one of the tribesmen and his horse came a nasty
                        cropper. On another occasion we hope to see rather more attention devoted to
                        the organisation of snob meetings for without organisation it is impossible
                        to cope with the enormous crowds that gather on such occa¬sions. </p>
                    <p>The races ware ridden with the utmost vigour and dash by the Bedouins and the
                        land- owners who competed, and those who saw them were enthusiastic. The
                        writer, who arrived a little late was informed by one of the specta-¬tors
                        that, he bad to for seen a camel’s head and a Bedouin’s koffieh flying past
                        but did not despair of seeing more sooner or later. In the packed condition
                        of the enclosure the hope seemed unduly optimistic. The camel race—4
                        miles—and the “Be gass.” or trick riding of the Bedouins, were the best of
                        the events. </p>
                    <p>The "hagins” were a revelation to those who only know the Pyramid camel and
                        his brother who carries loads over the Kasr el Nil bridge, provoke*
                        profanity among arbagis, and in spring when "the vernal impulsion makes
                        lyrical all that hath language” grants and sometimes tries to bite. It was
                        won by the Moteye Bedouins from above Assiont, whose winning “hagin” arrived
                        at Cairo on Sunday night after doing 300 miles over the desert in four days.
                        All good sportsmen will be delighted that his owner, Selim Tawil, had the
                        satisfaction of winning and winning from capital competitors, after so
                        remarkable a feat. To accomplish a fine long distance performance between
                        Wednesday and Sunday night and to win the - 4 miles race by half a length or
                        a neck and half a hump —does credit to owner, rider, and camel alike. </p>
                    <p>The “Bergass” after the races was well worth seeing, and about a fifth of
                        those present saw it. The ride’s and their horses were worthy of the
                        occasion and the music played by the lutes and arghools and drums give one a
                        better opinion of the Bedouin than the Egypt-ian ear. The horses—in splendid
                        trappings— and whose riders knew their work thoroughly, swayed and
                        curvetted, dropped on their knees, wheel-turned before the Royal box where
                        T.R.H the Prince and Princess of Wales and H H. the Khedive watched the
                        riders with undisguised interest. At the end came a pro¬cession of horsemen
                        and cameleers closed by two camels bearing huge red covered letters on their
                        backs. </p>
                    <p>At about 5.45 p.m the Royal guests left with their escort of the Body Guard
                        and were followed by H.H. the Khedive. Loud cheers greeted them on their
                        departure as on their arrival, and the Bedouins let off their long guns with
                        cheerful abandon. Then the multitude made tracks tor the bridge or
                        despatched shouting boys in search of undiscoverable arabiebs. </p>
                    <p>(FROM OUR LADY CORRESPONDENT.)</p>
                    <p>For those who were able to see them the afternoon’s proceedings most have
                        been full of wild excitement, but as two-fifths of the onlook <cb n="4"/>
                        ers never got a chance of viewing anything beyond the dense crowd of people
                        standing on tea tables the zest of the afternoon was not altogether general.
                        At times the wild thud o' horse’s hoofs told of a violent scurry, at others
                        the bobbing heads of Bedouin riders seen even above the heads of the
                        onlookers betokened that a camel race was in progress, but otherwise the
                        afternoon was without violent interest to the above mentioned fraction of
                        that mighty crowd that blocked up every inch of available space, that packed
                        the grandstand, that perched upon the railings, tint swarmed upon the roofs,
                        and that even clambered up into the trees and hung like huge insects from
                        the branches. </p>
                    <p>Things were easier when a stream of people were allowed to cross the course
                        and take up their position along the rails, though even then the motley
                        members of the crowd did their best to spoil the view for anyone hot
                        themsel¬ves. We English are a fairly law-abiding people, and it is annoying
                        on such occasions to find that our natural instincts to keep within our
                        borders result in oar being shoved violently in the rear by a badly-mannered
                        crowd. The police did their best, it is true, but somehow fair best was not
                        much to the point, and we be surprised if we do not hear more complaints
                        against the - arrangements, which were entirely inadequate to the occasion. </p>
                    <p>When one did get an opportunity of seeing anything that was in progress on
                        the course one understood why this "bergass’’ attracted such enormous
                        crowds. The magnificent horses were worth going miles to see, and
                        caparisoned as they were, and with their Bedouin riders on their backs. they
                        carried one away to wild tales of daring do in the desert. While not engaged
                        in races or fantasias before the Royal box they were curvetting about the
                        tents of encamp- ments, and there also triumphant camels were showing off
                        their paces before an admiring crowd. The fantasias already mentioned were
                        thoroughly barbaric and unexpected. The native music made weird noises, the
                        horse* pranced and stamped and flung themselves to and fro, while their
                        riders swung naked scimi- tars and lances round their heads and grew more
                        and more daring with the applause that greeted their achievements. </p>
                    <p>It was all a very wonderful sight and had we better opportunities of
                        witnessing the rest of the proceedings we could be in a better position to
                        describe the operations. No better fantasia could have been devised for the
                        enter¬tainment of our rural visitors. They, at any rate, had a good view of
                        everything, and it is to be hoped that they did not suffer from the
                        incon-venience that dogged the steps of the less mighty. No pen can write of
                        individual in that huge assemblage, everybody who is any¬body and all the m
                        bodies as well were present, and every arabeh in all the length and breadth
                        of Cairo was waiting outside the gates. </p>
                    <p>Yesterday morning the Prince of Wales went out of El Avat for quail. His
                        Royal Highness who was accompanied by Mr Allan Joseph and Mr. Fischer,
                        enjoyed very fair sport daring the limited time at his disposal, ret- urning

                    <p>Their Royal Highnesses launched at the French Diplomatic Agency at 1.30 p.m.

                    <p>PETITION TO PRINCE OF WALES.</p>
                    <p>WANTED A CONSTITUTION.</p>
                    <p>A significant petition has been presented to the Prince of Wales by Sheikh
                        Tewfik el Bakri, who holds the position of Nakibiel- Ashraf or the official
                        head of the native aristocracy. It runs as follows :— </p>
                    <p>The Egyptians are exceeding glad at the visit of the Crown Prince of the most
                        power¬ful kingdom in the world, a kingdom firmly established on a
                        constitutional basis, on the liberty of the subject, and the rights of the
                        people. This Power has held our land tor twenty-three years in order to
                        advance it by all possible means in the way of progress and afterwards to
                        hand back Egypt to her own people to be governed by them. </p>
                    <p>The Egyptians were greatly pleased when your Royal Highness deigned to grant
                        an audience to the members of the Legislative Council, whom you graciously
                        called the re-presentatives of the nation. The people of Egypt are
                        delighted, and hope that that inter¬view will hereafter be remembered when
                        the day comes for the members of that Council to be the real representatives
                        of the nation. The Egyptians, Sire, are most grateful. and both in private
                        and in public acknowledge the great and substantial progress that has been
                        made by the help of the clever English engineers and some of the officials
                        of the Occupation. But before the days of the Occupation the nation had a
                        fundamental system of government. A constitution and a Legislative Council
                        were formed when Egypt was occupied with a view to transforming it into a
                        parliamentary council in accordance with the promises of Lord Dufferin. The
                        Egyptians still bear in mind their old privi¬leges and always remember the
                        words of Lord Dufferin, and hope and trust that one day those words will
                        come true. You. Sire, have called the notables of the Council
                        "represen¬tatives of the nation.” The need of a Con¬stitution is recalled to
                        our minds by this term, and the Egyptians hope that your visit will, in the
                        near future, result in bringing about the making of a Constitution for
                        Egypt. Two years ago the General Assembly addressed such it demand to the
                        Khedivial Government, and the members of the Legis¬lative Council are also
                        members of the As-¬sembly We shall also remember the speech which your
                        illustrious father made not long ago on the constitution. In King Edward’s
                        speech to the Parliament he declared. "Those countries that have been
                        granted constitutions by the British Government have all become prosperous
                        and contented. This policy has led to friendly tips between these lands and
                        Great Britain.” Therefore we beg of your , Royal Highness that the outcome
                        of your visit will be to remind the British Govern-ment to fulfill the
                        promise that was once made to us. Therefore your visit will never be
                        forgotten by the people of the land of Egypt. </p>

                    <head>EGYPT AND TURKEY.</head>
                    <p>THE FRONTIER QUESTION.</p>
                    <p>On Tuesday last in the House of Commons, Sir W. Lawson (L. Cockermouth) asked
                        the Secretary for Foreign Affairs whether there WHS any truth in the report
                        published on Monday morning that, failing an agreement between the British
                        and Turkish Governments with regard to the occupation of Tabah, on the
                        Egyptian frontier, the position would be bom¬barded by British warships, and
                        whether the 1 Egyptian Government had ever exercised authority over Tabah.
                        (Hear, hear.) </p>
                    <p>Sir E. Grey—I should like to take the oppor- tunity of my honourable friend’s
                        question to dispel some of the approbation which has been aroused by
                        mis-statements in some quar¬ters. No ultimatum has been sent to the Turkish
                        Government, and no question has been raised as to Akaba. which is in Turkish
                        territory. Tabah, on the contrary, is in the Sinai Penin¬sula, which for
                        several generations has been recognised as being under the administration of
                        Egypt; Tabah and one or two other posts in the Sinai Peninsula have quite
                        recently been occupied by Turkish troops ; it is obvious that this
                        aggression upon Egyptian administra- tion cannot be allowed to continue, but
                        the question is now the subject of negotiation. </p>
                    <p>(Hear, hear.)</p>
                    <p>TYPHOID AT AKABA.</p>
                    <p>According to a report published by the Mokastam, the Turkish troops at Akaba
                        are suffering severely from typhoid, which is said to have greatly reduced
                        their effective strength.</p>
                    <p>THE ARABIAN VILAYETS.</p>
                    <p>There has recently taken , place in the Mabein of Yildiz a change which is of
                        moment in view of the present frontier imbroglio, in that it will introduce
                        a new element—the Turkish — into the administration of the Arabian
                        provinces. Up till now Izzet Pacha, Second Secretary of the Sultan, who is
                        an Arabian, has filled all the best posts on the peninsula with his
                        proteges. We now learn that the Government party that is, the Sublime Porte,
                        headed by Ferid Pasha, is in the ascendant, so that Izzet Pacha will no
                        longer be able to dispose of the Sultan’s dominions as he' listeth. With an
                        Albanian Vizier at the head of affairs, a martial im-petus must be expected
                        in the near future to Turkey’s Arabian policy via the Hedjaz Railway. </p>
                    <p>Five battalions have, we hear, reached Akaba and a huge barracks is being
                        built for their accommodation. </p>

                    <p>THE KAISER AS A WITNESS.</p>

                    <p>A sensational libel case arising out of alleged illegal arrest in Egypt is
                        expected to shortly come before the German Courts, and according to a report
                        which is attracting much attention in Berlin, the Kaiser is expected to
                        appear as a witness. </p>

                        Schleswig-Holstein, is suing Prince Ernest Gunther of Schleswig-Holstein,
                        and the Court Chamberlain, for damages for illegal arrest in this country. </p>
                    <p>A charge of theft was brought against her, but could not be substantiated.
                        Herr Blumen-thal, the Chamberlain, requested the Egyptian Government to
                        effect the arrest, stating that the Kaiser himself desired this to be done. </p>
                    <p>Should the report prove correct, the follow¬ing remarkable list of witnesses
                        will give evidence :—The Kaiser, the Kaiserin, Princess Frederick Leopold of
                        Prussia, the Prince and Princess of Schleswig-Holstein, and many other
                        notabilities. </p>

                    <head>AN EXTRAORDINARY SCENE.</head>
                    <p>Since yesterday afternoon up to about 12 o’clock noon to-day the body of an
                        unknown native has been dashed about by a merciless sea in the eastern
                        harbour of Alexandria, without, to our knowledge, any effort being made to
                        rescue it How the man was drowned is as yet a mystery, but crowds of
                        spectators have stood on the sea-wall yesterday and this morning watching
                        the body being tossed about by the waves, even against the seawall itself.
                        None of the spectators evi-dently dared to make any effort at rescue owing
                        to the high sea that was running, but surely some steps should have been
                        taken by the auth-rities to put an end to such a disgraceful scene. The
                        official excuse vouchsafed to our reporter at the Gonvernorat this morning
                        for the body remaining in the water so long was that the rough sea precluded
                        any attempts at rescue, but that it was hoped the body would be ultimately
                        washed ashore by the waves ! ! Comment is needless. </p>
                    <p>Just as we are going to press we are glad to learn that the body of the
                        drowned man has been rescued by a Coast Guard boat. We are assured that
                        owing to the rough state of the sea it was impossible to effect this before.

                    <p>Sir Nicholas O’Conor, our Ambassador at Constantinople, who is having some
                        trouble with the Sultan at present over the occupa¬tion of Tabah, in
                        Egyptian territory by Turkish troops, has had eight years of service now in
                        that most difficult of Embassies. He succeeded Lord Currie just after the
                        recrudescence of the Armenian massacres that sent a fresh shudder A through
                        civilised Europe, and when the indig¬nation which these Turkish outrages
                        evoked had made the Sultan even more difficult to get on with than usual. </p>
                    <p>But Sir Nicholas is a clever Irishman, with nearly forty years of diplomatic
                        experience behind him, who has represented England in half a dozen great
                        countries and one or two little dues, and during his stay at Constantino-ple
                        he has contrived to maintain on the whole notably smooth relations with
                        Abdul Hamid II. Lord Salisbury sent Sir Nicholas to St. Petersburg to attend
                        the Coronation of the present Czar, while before that he was British
                        Minister at Pekin, which he left just in time to avoid the Boxer
                        disturbances which afterwards broke out there, and the massacre of Europeans

                    <p>HOUSE OF COMMONS. - On the motion of Mr. MacDonald, Labourite, drawing
                        attention to the danger in which native subjects of the Crown may be
                        involved owing to the adminis-tration of martial law in Natal, Mr. Churchill
                        declared that the Imperial Government’s whole course had been correct,
                        consistent, and una¬voidable. The precipitate resignation of the Natal
                        Ministry was not altogether consistent with their passionate appeals for the
                        support of British troops. Mr. Churchill arouesed the opposition of
                        endeavouring to poison the minds of the colonists. If this course were
                        pursued in, they would easily produce effects shaking ( the whole system of

                    <p>To THB EDITOR OF THE “EGYPTIAN GAZETTE” </p>
                    <p>Sir,—Referring to your review of Mr. New¬berry’s recent work on scarabs," yon
                        mention that the author says false or modern imitations of scarabs are very
                        rare ; this seems snob an extraordinary statement that I fait sure Mr.
                        Newberry could not have made it and I have looked carefully through his work
                        and can find nothing in relation to forgeries. From my own experience I can
                        assure your readers that there ire a great number of forgeries on the market
                        md the greatest care should be used in making a purchase - -Faithfully
                        yours, </p>

                            very rough.</p>

                    <p>THE WADI RAYAN CLAIM.</p>
                    <p>The “Brooklyn Eagle” remarks : —</p>
                    <p>Every admirer of American energy and grit will rejoice at the news that came
                        from Washington yesterday to the effect that the Department of State has at
                        last secured a reconsideration by the Egyptian Government of the claim of P.
                        Cope Whitehouse, an Ame¬rican, who ten years ago discovered the dry site of
                        Lake Moeris in a great depression in the Lybian desert to the southwest of
                        the Fayoum. The Fayoum is the most fertile spot in Egypt south of the Delta,
                        and is about four hours ride from Cairo, by rail to a station, whence the
                        rest of the day’s trip is made on camel or mule back. </p>
                    <p>There is little doubt that Lord Milner was the stumbling block in the way of
                        White- house’s getting his rights. He located the site of this ancient
                        reservoir and obtained a concession from the Khedivial Government to form a
                        company and to open a canal to the Nile banks which, when the river ran
                        aflood, would fill the depression, 225 square miles in extent, and thus form
                        an oasis of vast area. Upon the shores of this artificial lake, White- house
                        expected to plant sugar cane, to erect mills for crushing the cane, vats for
                        boiling the syrup and refineries for making sugar. If he had secured his
                        concession before the Assouan dam was built he would have became a very rich
                        man. Now, I fear. the people who tend the sluice gates of the red granite
                        dam at the First Cataract will not allow enough water to flow through to
                        lift the river’s surface to a height sufficient to fill Mr. Whitehouse’s
                        lake. The Nile flood does not extend beyond Assouan any more. </p>
                    <p>When I was in Egypt I remember that Lord Milner said: “Mr. Whitehouse is an
                        enthusiast, not to say a fanatic, for his Wadi-Rayan scheme. Still, it is
                        impossible not to feel admiration for a man who devotes his whole life and
                        his remarkable abilities to the advocacy of a great work of public utility.
                        The reservoir that Mr. Whitehouse recom- mends may not be the best
                        reservoir, but there are strong prima-facie arguments in its favour. His
                        opinions deserve the most careful consideration.” This was said of
                        Whitehouse by the man who is really responsible for the Assouan dam (which,
                        by the Way, I travelled 600 miles to see, and over which Chief Engineer John
                        Blue conducted me). </p>
                    <p>Now that this $10,000,000 experiment at Assouan has proved an utter failure,
                        so far as increasing the extent of agricultural land, the Egyptian
                        Government will take up Mr. Whitehouse’s practical suggestion and prob¬ably
                        confirm his concessions which have been “held up’’ in true brigand fashion.
                        The English contractors, who, under Lord Cromer, British consul-general,
                        built the utterly useless Assouan dam and saddled the expense upon the poor
                        fell heen of the Nile Valley are apt to permit Mr. Whitehouse and his

                    <head>HAREM LIFE.</head>
                    <p>Pierre Loti has resolved to put to shame the idleness of M. Paul Bourget and
                        the rest, and gives us the first part of his ”Les De en-chantes,” which
                        deals (so far) with the life of a Turkish harem. He warns us in his preface
                        that we are not to see in his characters any real or living people, else we
                        might possibly consider it is Captain Viand who is shown to us under the
                        name of Andre Lhery, the famous novelist, who receives in his Breton home a
                        letter in four pages from a Turkish lady on the eve of her marriage to a
                        husband whom, according to etiquette, she has never seen. The next chapter
                        transports us to a Stamboul harem, where there are neither odalisques nor
                        intrigues, but where three Circassian maidens, speaking French, German,
                        Dalian, and English with equal ease, dressed in Parisian “creations" and
                        reading Verlaine, Baudelaire, Byron, and Shakespeare, a charming mixture
                        this—sob themselves to sleep the night before the bridal of the writer of
                        the letter with a handsome young Bey. Pierre Lori tells us that this is the
                        way with all Constantinople gyucuea at the present day, and that the inmates
                        of these gilded cages, having tasted of the fruit of Western knowledge,
                        regret most bitterly the being handed over like cattle to husbands whom they
                        have not chosen. How the story will develop, one cannot say; but as the only
                        other female characters in it are a negro maid servant and a stern
                        grandmother, it is difficult at present to say who is going to be
                        disen-chanted as the result of the marriage. As to the knowledge that the
                        novelist displays of what goes on in Eastern dimes behind the purdah, one
                        cannot help repeating the comment of William III. when told that the
                        fighting Bishop of Derry had been killed at the fording of the Boyne: “What
                        did he there ?” </p>

                    <head>THE NELSON MEMORANDUM.</head>
                    <p>A LUCKY BUS DRIVER.</p>
                    <p>In all the accounts which have appeared in these columns upon the Nelson
                        Memorandum, from its discovery to its sale at Christie’s for £3,600 on March
                        14, it has been stated that the owner did not desire his name to be
                        disclosed but preferred “to be left in peace.” But his joy has been too
                        great. His friends know. And his friends—brave fellows—are ‘bus conductors,
                        for the lucky man is a 'bus driver. The other day says the “Daily
                        Telegraph,” a well-known medical man in the suburbs happened to be in a
                        local ‘bus. The conductor thereof had the eloquence of his class, and from
                        summary ob¬servations on the weather leapt straight to the remark, “Some men
                        are lucky.” Forthwith he reeled off his illustration. “A fine thing
                        happen¬ed the other day for one of our drivers, good old Will—You must know
                        him, sir. He’s the man what owned that memorandum all the papers has been
                        writing about. Now he’s got a matter of £3,000 odd in his kick for a
                        blooming old piece of a paper. It seems as how Will was driving one day, and
                        a gent, on the front seat, affable-like, asks Will if he’d ever been to
                        Merton Abbey, where Nelson used to live. ‘Nelson,’ says Will. ‘I know
                        something about him,’‘What?’ says the gent. ’Well it’s like this,’ says
                        Will. My father was an old sailor, and when he gave up the sea was an
                        admiral’s man. The old admiral liked him, and gave him an old desk with some
                        letters in it, and one I know bears on Trafalgar.’ Presently the gent says,
                        ‘If you show me that and I like it. I’ll give yon £10 and a suit of clothes
                        for it.’ Will said he’d see, but he asked another gent, next day about it,
                        and he said, ‘send it to Christie, Manson and Woods ’ And Will has got a
                        nice little pile now.” “Is he not going to retire ?”. inquired the medical
                        man. “No fear. He’s still driving his ’bus. What he's made is his nest- egg" </p>
                    <p>The 'bus-man told the story while guiding his horses along his usual route. </p>
                    <p>“My friends,” he said, “are making far too much fuss about this business. I
                        want to be left in peace, and I have reasons for not wishing my name to be
                        mentioned. Of course, I’m glad that the paper fetched so much, and I only
                        wish my poor father were alive to share the money. Ha was for many years
                        butler to Sir George Mundy who was a friend of Nelson. Sir George was
                        paralysed on one side, and when he gave my father the old desk, containing
                        the papers, he made him promise to stay with him as long as he lived. Sir
                        George's home was at the end of Grosvenor place, and when a child I remember
                        seeing from his drawing room win-dow Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort
                        come riding out from Buckingham Palace. </p>
                    <p>"Before he died, in 1884 my father hand¬ed me the desk, saying that the
                        papers might be valuable to me some time. Among them was an autograph letter
                        of Nelson’s, but I’m “Sorry to say I parted with that. I do not believe
                        anyone besides my father, my daughter, and myself had seen the Memo-randum
                        for thirty years before I took it to Messrs, Christie. No one but myself had
                        anything to do with the transaction - even my family didn’t, know of it
                        until a few days ago. I </p>
                    <p>“No, I haven’t yet got the money. It is all a right in Messrs. Christie's
                        hands. By and by I shall look round for some good investments. I have had
                        enough worry in my time. Some years ago I had a coaching business on the
                        South Coast, but with electric trams and motor-cars there is not much
                        coaching to be done nowadays. At sixty one doesn’t care to take fresh risks. </p>
                    <p>"So I think I shall stick to my ’bus. I have been driving for several years,
                        and never felt better in my life. My children are all grown up and doing
                        well. I once thought of joining my son who is in New Zealand but there is no
                        need to think of that now. I like my work, and I can have a day or two off
                        when I want to. Yes, with this money behind me I shall be able to enjoy
                        myself very well. But I’m not worrying about it, and I only a want to be
                        left in peace.” </p>

                    <p>The cotton from Egyptian sped in Mozambi¬que is doing well. Messrs.
                        Wolsteholme and Holland, the brokers of the British Cotton- Growing
                        Association, have just sold at Liverpool 144 bales of cotton grown by the

                        Chiloane at the very satisfactory price of 9d. per lb. Messrs. Wolsten-holme

                        Africa, and there is a great - future before it, if proper care is taken

                        be grounds for hoping that he territory of the Mozambique Company may become
                        a valuable auxiliary in freeing the cotton-spinners of Lancashire from their

                    <p>Ethel Pain Memorial</p>
                    <p>The construction of the Ethel Pain Me-morial Hospital at Cairo is
                        progressing. The foundation stone was laid by Sir Algernon Coote a year ago.
                        Originally the plans extend-ed only to the building of a ground floor at an
                        estimated cost of £2,300. Shortly afterwards, before the foundation-stone
                        was laid, as further subscriptions amounting to over £1,000 had been
                        unexpectedly received, the addition of a "first floor" was decided, thus
                        bringing the estimated cost to £3,200. All through last year donations were
                        sent from many parts of that amount subscribed has now reached £3,293,
                        including about £100 spe-cially given for equipment. It has been found that
                        the estimate has been exceeded by about £300, the total cost of the
                        building, exclusive of equipment, being about £3,500. It was not possible at
                        the outset to estimate exactly, so much depended upon the nature of the soil
                        and the consequent depth necessary for foundations. Not less than £1,000 has
                        been spent upon the foundation, and no small addition to the estimate was
                        occasioned by the necessity for the removal of some exceedingly tough Roman
                        masonry which was found extending right across the site, about eight feet
                        down. Disappointing as it is to find that the cost of the building has
                        con-siderably exceeded the amount subscribed, it is consoling to realize
                        that the excess has not been due to errors needing rectifying, and that the
                        building which has cost £3,500 could not now be rebuilt for less than
                        £5,000, so extraordi-nary has been the rise in price of labour and material
                        during the year owing to the unprece-dented number of speculative
                        enterprises that have sprung up of late. In fact, there can be small doubt
                        that the price at which the con-tract was accepted has left but little
                        margin for the the contractor who has had to face the rapidly rising prices. </p>

                    <p>Mrs. Henrietta A. S. Marsh, 769 W, 16th St., Los Angeles, Cal., President
                        Woman’s Benevolent Ass’n, writes: </p>
                    <p>“I suffered with lit grippe for seven weeks, and nothing I could do or take
                        helped me until I tried Peruna. </p>
                    <p>“ I felt at once that I had at last secured the right medicine and I kept
                        steadily improving. Within three weeks I was fully restored, and I am glad
                        that 1 gave that truly great remedy a trial. </p>
                    <p>I will never be without it again.”</p>
                    <p>In a letter dated August 31,1904, Mrs. Marsh says: “I have never yet heard
                        the efficacy of Peruna questioned. We still use it. I traveled through
                        Ken¬tucky and Tennessee three years ago, where I found Peruna doing its good
                        work. Much of it is being used here also.”—Henrietta A. S. Marsh. </p>

                    <head>What is Whisky ?</head>
                    <p>What is all malt whisky and what is grain whisky? A 1 malt whisky is made
                        entirely of malted barley distilled in the old fashioned pot still. Grain
                        whisky is made from a mixture of 15 to 35 per cent malted barley and the
                        remainder unmalted oats, rye, maize, and bar¬ley distilled in a patent
                        coffey still. To enable the reader to understand the exact position, and
                        find out what suits his constitution best, we give an extract from an
                        editorial in the “Edin¬burgh Medical Journal,” December, 1903, page 482
                        “Most pure malt whiskies contain too large a proportion of volatile ethers
                        to be easily digested and assimilated, while mixed with a small proportion
                        of very old grain spirit, they are rendered not only more palatable, but
                        also more suitable for a weak stomach Accordingly, though on theory the
                        physician would be right in saying that a spirit which contains a large
                        number of volatile ethers would be the best as a cardiac or lung stimu¬lant,
                        yet he would have to remember that such a stimulant in its pure state is not
                        easily borne except by the strongest of stomachs, and re¬quires a proportion
                        of old grain spirit, which chemically is much purer owing to the high
                        distillation which it undergoes. Finally let it be repeated that the primary
                        requisites of all whiskies are age and absence of adulteration.” Such a
                        whisky is exactly represented by Mackie’s White Horse. 10 Years Old. [Advt.]
