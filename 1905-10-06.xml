                        <head>Hall's Sanitary Washable Distemper</head>
                        <p>Made in 70 Colors</p>
                        <p>An artistic wall covering.</p>
                        <p>This celebrated water paint is made in two qualities for Inside and
                            Outside work</p>
                        <p>HALL’S SANITARY WASHABLE DISTEMPER is rapidly superseding wall papers in
                            all tastefully furnished homes. It is made in 70 artistic tints, and
                            only requires the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is
                            quickly and easily applied with a whitewash brush, with half the labour
                            and at one third the cost of paint. HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures
                            cleanliness, and is pleasing to the eye. It appeals alike to artistic
                            and practical house decoration.</p>
                        <p>HALL’S DISTEMPER is of special value in hot climates. Owing to its cool,
                            pleasing colours, great weather-resisting and germ-destroying
                            properties, it lends itself to every kind of wall, wood, brick or stone
                            coating, possessing all the advantages of paint, colour- wash, and
                            disinfectant at one third the cost of oil paint. It never blisters in
                            the hottest sun, and the fact that it can be washed adds greatly to its
                            sanitary advantages.</p>

                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir,</p>

                    <p>The following criticisms passed on the Boulogne-<placeName
                            ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q87">Alexandria</placeName> route may
                        interest your readers. The railway carriages from Boulogne to <placeName
                            ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q90">Paris</placeName> are of the old
                        conventional type. There are no corridor carriages. The second class
                        carriages are provided with lavatories, but not the first! Of course there
                        is no communication between such carriages. The European edition the “New
                        York Herald” can be bought at the station in <placeName
                            ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579613">Marseilles</placeName> at 11
                        p.m. on day of publication, but not the same edition of the "Daily Mail,”
                        which cannot be had there till about 10 a.m. the following day. In the
                        Messageries steamers, passengers have no opportunity of seeing a barometer,
                        thermometer, or compass. These steamers have only one gangway (aft) for
                        embarkation and disembarkation ; the result is utter confusion and noise on
                        leaving and arriving. There ought to be two gangways, one forward and one
                        aft, to relievo the congestion.</p>
                    <p>To an Englishman it seems strange that the P. and O. Company can run
                        "through” trains from Calais to <placeName
                            ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579613">Marseilles</placeName>,
                        whilst the Messageries Company,—a French concern—cannot, or does not do so
                        through its own country for its own steamers. There is another matter which
                        is worthy of note, namely in regard to baggage. Would it not be possible to
                        send the baggage of passengers for places beyond France under bond in sealed
                        waggons (small size for conveyance on deck of Channel steamers) from say
                        Charing Cross to <placeName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579613"
                            >Marseilles</placeName>, and vice versa. If this were done it seems to
                        me that there would be a great saving in time, trouble and expense, the last
                        in the pay of Customs House officials. The searching of such baggage is
                        after all a very perfunctory affair.</p>

                            the sole object of assisting British trade in this country. The services
                            of the Chamber are always at the disposal of any member desiring
                            information on trade matters generally, including the question of
                            appointing suitable agents. As no fee is charged for such advice, it is
                            obviously in the interests of all British traders here to become
                            members, especially when it is remembered that the annual subscription
                            is merely the nominal one of £1. The latter payment also includes a copy

                        <p>A man of Oneibis (near Tahta, Ghirgeh Mudireh) had a great affection for
                            a young woman whom he made his wife. Shortly after their marriage,
                            however, he paid his addresses to another, and having asked her if she
                            would marry him, she only consented on the condition that he would send
                            his first wife away. In order to get rid of his wife the miscreant
                            butchered her, cut her body into pieces, and cast them into the Nile.
                            After this barbarous act he informed the police authority that his wife
                            was away, and he knew nothing of her whereabouts. At the same time, the
                            omdeh of the village advised the markez of Tahta of the woman's fate,
                            and the authorities in their cross-examination suspected the murderer in
                            the person of the husband. The man is now in prison awaiting his trial,

                            appeared and these two became engaged and were married. The thwarted

                            the quarantine camp there, the number of pilgrims was some 18,000, it
                            increased to nearly 40,000 last season. In this number is included only
                            the pilgrims coming from the north, and not those from <placeName

                        <p>Mr. David G. Longworth, the former proprietor and editor of the "Sphinx,"
                            the weekly paper published in <placeName

                            and thence proceeds to British East Africa with the view of starting at
                            Nairobi, the capital of the Protectorate, a weekly periodical entitled
                            the "Globe Trotter.” Mr. Longworth, daring the many years that he has
                            resided in <placeName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q85"
                                >Cairo</placeName> , contributed in a great measure in bringing to
                            the notice of the American public, through the columns of his paper, the
                            climatic and other advantages of our metropolis as a health resort, and
                            succeded in a marked degree, as those who have noted the very large

                        <p>Mr. Longworth is of the same conviction as Mr. McMillan, that there is a
                            great future in store for the comparatively new British colony to which
                            he is now turning his attention and energies, and we wish him every
                            success in the new venture upon which he has now embarked.</p>

                        <p>We mentioned in our issue of the 9th ultimo that the condition of the
                            Nile flood during August had distinctly, improved and though it could
                            not be regarded as a high Nile, the readings of the various gauges at
                            that time did not compare unfavorably with those of last year. We note,
                            however, that a sadden and ominous fall which took place on the 27th
                            September at Rosaries has since continued unininterruptedly and
                            yesterday's gauge registered 8.47 comparing very unfavorably with that
                            of last year’s at the same time, which was as high as 4.56. This
                            portends a bad water supply for next year's summer crops. The fall we
                            mention will not be apparent at Khartoum for quite another ten days or
                            so, as its effect is felt there about three weeks after it occurs at
                            Rosaires.</p>

                            distant from the Hedjaz, and gives as its opinion that they will find it

                            at Zagazig, has proved that the entire responsibility for this accident
                            rests on the driver of goods train No. 331. It appears that on nearing
                            Kassassin he took no notice of the signals, which were against him, and
                            ran through the station. The station master and the pointsman called and
                            signalled vigorously but vainly to him, and between Kassassin and
                            Nefishe the goods train collided with train No. S.S. with disastrous
                            consqeuences. According to one of our <placeName

                            an interview with Prince Von Buelow, who emphatically denies that
                            Germany has any designs to get France to take part with her in any
                            action against Britain. He could not but describe the prevalent idea
                            that war against England was inevitable, as stupid in the extreme.
                            Germany will not attempt any experiments. The Governments at <placeName

                            effect that it is not so much a history as a catalogue of monuments, is
                            here more justified than ever, a period of more than a thousand years -
                            neither the least eventful nor the worst documented in Egypts
                            history-being jammed into a small volume of 400 pages. The delay in its
                            appearance is, we are told in the text, almost entirely due to the groat
                            quantity of monuments remaining to us from the reign of Rameses II.,
                            which apparently made it necessary for Prof. Petrie to go carefully
                            through the list and to throw out such as he considered either
                            appropriations of the works of earlier kings, or for some other reason
                            unworthy of note. In this, as in some other matters, he apparently
                            thinks that bis ipse dixit must be taken as settling the question.</p>
                        <p>The same feature is noticeable in his preface, where he tells us that</p>
                        <q>
                            <p>"as some persons still continue to quote Dr. Brcgsch's chronology, I
                                ought, perhaps, to point out that it entirely rests on two certainly
                                false assumptions, and [that] it is only rendered possible by freely
                                making any number of arbitrary omissions. In short it is no system
                                and has no reason” ;</p>
                            <p>while, after discussing the two assumptions in question, he concludes
                                that “no one who uses it can be supposed to know of the facts of the
                                history which are stated in this volume.” There have been nearly as
                                many systems of chronology in Egyptian history as historians, and
                                Brugsch's system" is, like all the others, in great measure a system
                                of inferences from rather slender foundations. But Brugsch was a man
                                of deep and wide learning, as well as an Egyptologist who had spent
                                has life in the study of his subject; and as the founder of demotic
                                studies he possessed a knowledge of the language of the monuments
                                for greater than any of which Prof. Petrie can boast We think,
                                therefore, that his theories should be treated with respect and that
                                it will require something more than Prof. Petrie’s pronouncements ex
                                cathedra to dispossess a system which still has much to reccommend
                                it This apart, Prof. Petrie is, in other respects, unusually
                                tolerant of the opinions of other in this volume, and it is good to
                                find him actually referring with courtesy and even with approbation
                                to the works of those whom he is pleased to consider his rivals.
                                Thus he not only speaks with approval of certain work of Mr. H. R.
                                Hall, but also says, with regard to the supposed route of the
                                Exodus, that “the result of Naville's discussion of it is reasonable
                                and generally accepted.” We think, however, that he might have
                                devoted a little more space to Dr. Breasted's very clear and careful
                                account of the battle of Kadesh.</p>
                            <p>From its extremely condensed form it is impossible to review the book
                                in detail, bat it may be said that the evidence quoted is fairly up
                                to date, although Prof. Petrie does not seem to have examined M.
                                Legrain's discoveries at Karnak. Had he done so, we fancy he would
                                have found it necessary to make a considerable change in his
                                genealogy of the Sheshonkide kings. Yet, on the whole, he seems to
                                have chosen the facts recorded with care, and we are glad to see
                                that he will have nothing to do with Prof. Winkler’s Masri theory.
                                He takes, perhaps, too professional a view of ethics when he tells
                                us that Seti I.’s character was one of the best in history, because,
                                apparently, he left monuments in honor of bis predecessors and
                                usurped no monuments without recording the name of the king under
                                whom they were originally inscribed. Later, he characteristically
                                uses the reputation with which Seti is thus generously presented in
                                favor of his own arguments, saying that “the general character of
                                this king is so honorable in his works, that we are bound to credit
                                his statements if we cannot show them to be wrong.” We do not think
                                that Prof. Petrie’s identification of place and other names shows
                                much acquaintance with the Semitic, or, for that matter, with the
                                Aryan languages, and we have noticed some mistakes, such as
                                “cieling” for ceiling, "Revillont” for Revillout and a Greek pi for
                                an eta. His English is still slipshod The lists of the monuments of
                                every king, with provenance and abiding place, that he gives, will
                                be extremely useful to students ; and for the care and pains that he
                                has bestowed on their compilation all Egyptologists should be
                                grateful.</p>

                            Swimming Club will be held tomorrow in the New Graving Dock, Gabbarl,
                            commencing at 8 p.m. An excellent programme of events has been arranged
                            and should afford some exciting races ; the handicaps seem to have been
                            most carefully and well and a glance at the list of competitors assures
                            the spectators of several dots contests.</p>
                        <p>The first event, for which there are 19 competitors, will be the 60 yards
                            club run in four heats, and the winner will secure H. E. Sir Reginald
                            Wingate Pasha's Sirdar Medal”, presented as a perpetual trophy, upon
                            which the winner's name of each year will be engraved; the club also
                            offers three prizes for this event, the first of which is a miniature in
                            silver in the Sirdar’s prize.</p>
                        <p>Event II. will be the 60 yards juniors' handicap, for which there are six
                            entries and three prizes presented by the club, and then will come a 60
                            yards handicap for members of 35 years of age or more, for which then
                            are nine entries and three prizes, and this will be followed by the
                            final race for the "Sirdar Medal."</p>
                        <p>The junior’s diving championship comes next, in which we will see nine
                            boys vying with each other in graceful dives from three, five, and eight
                            feet Take note, youthful competition, that while the "swallow" is
                            permitted, the “book” must be avoided on penalty of disqualification.
                            For this event a silver cup has been presented by the Hon. Secretary and
                            three club prizes will also bo given.</p>
                        <p>For the plunging championship, which whill follow 17 members will compete
                            for a cup and three prises, presented by the <placeName
                                ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q87">Alexandria</placeName> and
                            Ramleh Railway Co., Ltd., and there will then be a polo match between
                            the Eastern Tele graph and the <placeName
                                ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q87">Alexandria</placeName>
                            Swimming Club; each member of the winning team will secure a prize, for
                            which they will be indebted to the dub. This event will conclude the
                            first part of the programme.</p>
                        <p>The second part of the programme will commence with a blindfold race for
                            three prizes presented by the dub, and will be followed by an open
                            diving competition; the rules of this competition are the same as for
                            the junior competition, with the exception of the heights which will 3,
                            8, and 15 feet, and there are three prizes presented by the club.</p>
                        <p>Event X takes the form of an obstacle race for which there are 15
                            entries, and the for this race are presented by the staff of the Eastern
                            Telegraph Co., Ltd. Than comes a military polo match, with a prise for
                            each member of the winning team, and the junior members will then “walk
                            the pole”, after whisk the seniors will follow their example; for each
                            of these two races only one prise will be given.</p>
                        <p>A military tug of war and than a military team race follow, and each
                            member of the winning teams will secure a prise, and the programme will
                            then be concluded with a cock fight for which the dab ‘offer one
                            prise.</p>
                        <p>It only remains to add that Lady has kindly consented to present the
                            victorious competitors with their trophies of success. and that Mr. D.
                            Dampergola's orchestra will play selections daring the afternoon. The
                            sports promise to follow the general tendency of the year by eclipsing
                            all previous aquatic and the attendance also promisee to break all
