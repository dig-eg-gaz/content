                    <head>THE INSURRECTION IN ARABIA.</head>
                    <p>The rising against Turkish authority in South-Western Arabia has hardly
                        attracted so much attention as it appears to be entitled to, alike from its
                        intrinsic interest and from its potential importance. For a period of now
                        something like four years intermittent hostilities have been in progress
                        between the local tribesmen and the Turkish garrisons, but for a long time
                        these amounted to nothing more than a series of desultory and indecisive
                        skirmishes. Quite recently, however, the aspect of affairs has undergone a
                        serious change. The troops of the Sultan are no longer able to hold their
                        own, and the City of Sana, the official and strategical capital of the
                        vilayet of Yemen, has fallen into the hands of the insurgents. This was not
                        the result of any sudden raid or unexpected attack, but was the direct
                        consequence of the defeat suffered by Marshal Riza Pasha and the six
                        thousand troops under his command in April last, when his Chief of the Staff
                        was killed and seven guns, together with a considerable quantity of rifles,
                        ammunition, and other stores, were captured by the victorious rebels.
                        Nothing effective has been done to remedy this reverse. Reports from
                        Constantinople speak, indeed, of two expeditionary columns for the recovery
                        of the town working round, one by way of Tais and the other from Menakha,
                        but there appears to be every reason for thinking that, just as in the
                        earlier part of the year when out of the eight battalions of the Janina
                        Brigade only two were found to be available, while the attempt to mobilise
                        the Albanian Redifs resulted in practical failure, so also at the present
                        moment there exists a substantial difficulty in bringing the ostensible
                        strengh of the Imperial forces to bear upon the hard facts of the situation.
                        The danger increases day by day. Only a few days ago it was announced that
                        the rebels were marching on Mecca, and there was nothing inherently
                        improbable in this, for having in effect secured the control of the more
                        populous of the two vilayets—the Yemen—it was only natural that they would
                        proceed to overflow into the Hedjaz. Mecca is, it is understood, not in a
                        condition to offer any real resistance, and its fall would be an event
                        fraught with the very gravest consequences, such as, indeed, no friend of
                        the Turkish Empire would contemplate with equanimity. Before the fall of
                        Sana the Vali of Uskub, General Shikir Pasha, was appointed president of a
                        commission to inquire into the Yemen situation with a view to the
                        introduction of administrative reforms, but the rebels declined to treat,
                        and the fact that the Imam Yahya Hamid-el-Din has struck a gold coinage and
                        assumed the title of Khalif is highly ominous. The Arabs of all Arabia may
                        have found the leader who has failed them for centuries, and should Arabia
                        break loose from the Ottoman Empire and Mecca be torn from the grasp of the
                        Sultan, the new situation will demand the utmost care and forethought on the
                        part of British diplomacy.</p>

                        The Fayoum province, which had hitherto remained free from the pest, has
                        been lightly attacked.</p>
                    <p>The Ministry further favors us with the following reports from the provinces

                    <p>Gharbieh :—3,086 feddans, belonging to 316 proprietors, have been attacked
                        and 2,119 have been cleared by 5,364 children.</p>

                        informed the committee that they placed at their disposal a plot of some
                        6,000 square metres which would be let to the club on a lease of 25 years at
                        the nominal rent of P.T. 1 per square metre, and that the Public Works
                        Department would undertake, free of cost, to level and enclose and otherwise
                        prepare the ground. The Government besides offered £400 as compensation in
                        view of the expense to be incurred in removing. The committee gladly
                        accepted these sums, as the ground offered in exchange is in a very suitable
                        position, being the corner plot on the Boulac-road, on the opposite side of
                        the bridge. As the preparatory work to be performed by the P.W.D. will take
                        quite a year to complete there seems every probability that the club will
                        remain where it is for that further period, if not longer. The cost of the
                        present premises, with tennis ground, &amp;c., was over £2,000, which was
                        raised by the issue of 2,500 shares of L.E. 1, of which P.T. 75 was paid up,
                        leaving P.T. 25 to be called up later.</p>
                    <p>We should not omit to mention that a similar notice to quit was sent at the
                        same time to the other three club, viz., the German, Swiss, and Thewfikieh
                        Tennis Club, who have been also offered other sites on the same terms and in
                        the same locality as those of the British Recreation Club, but no monetary
                        compensation, as the former dabs have been in existence for a much longer
                        period and are therefore considered to have been fully recompensed for any
                        expense incurred by the length of time granted them, which in one case is,
                        we are told, over 20 years, whilst the B. R. C. was only opened a little
                        over twelve months ago.</p>
                    <p>The British Recreation Club now numbers over 300 members, the chairman of the
                        committee being Dr. Madden and the honorary secretary Mr. J. Holme. The
                        annual subscription is P.T. 120, payable half-yearly in advance on the lst
                        April and 1st October.</p>

                        Khartoum and Uganda is far from being unheeded. The "C. M. Gleaner’’ for
                        July says : “Many have corresponded and made inquiries about it, and a fair
                        number have definitely offered. We are not yet, however, in a position to
                        announce who will have the honor of composing the first band, and we are
                        glad to record that one has been definitely appointed, and that he is a
                        member of the Society’s home staff. The Rev. F.B. Hadow, who came to the C.

                    <head>EGYPT INVESTMENTS: A WARNING.</head>
                    <p>The multiplication of land and other companies in Egypt during the past few
                        months (says the "African World”) may be a very excellent thing for the
                        promoters. Whether it is equally excellent for investors and for Egypt
                        remains to be seen. That the Nile land, with the vast irrigation schemes of
                        Sir William Garstin and his colleagues in process of gradual development,
                        offers a splendid field for the employment of capital, is undeniable, and
                        that much more capital than has yet been provided will be needed is
                        perfectly true. But these very facts, by reason of their obviousness and the
                        inducement they afford to the unsophisticated public to put up money for
                        anything Egyptian, are the main assets of the wild-cat company promoter, and
                        against him we wish to utter a warning. It would be a thousand pities if,
                        for lack of caution now on the part of prospective investors, Egypt,
                        notwithstanding its splendid prospects, got the bad name that clings so
                        tenaciously and so disastrously once it is obtained.</p>

                        Bedouins. The total number of lighters that were laden with rice was four,

                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                        <p>Dear Sir,—In your paragraph of Monday, 3rd July, re “Esbekieh Gardens,”
                            the large attendances, and entire absence of police supervision, you
                            observe :—</p>
                        <p>“We should have thought it hardly necessary for the Press to have to
                            point out to the police authorities that wherever a crowd of some
                            thousands congregate there should be a number of policemen to maintain
                            order............................. ’’</p>
                        <p>It does seem comioally absurd that the newspaper Press should be called
                            upon to "point out” to the so-called police force of Cairo its manifest
                            and patent duty. It is unfortunate that the capital city of Africa
                            should be without police. I mean, of course, the city guards, who ought
                            to be available at all times, to exercise those functions which are the
                            A.B.C. of policemen’s duty, in all cities of the world, except
                            Cairo.</p>
                        <p>Cannot the pavements of the principal and most frequented thoroughfares,
                            including the Opera-square and the main streets radiating therefrom, be
                            kept free of troops of sheep and goats which perambulate there from
                            morning till night, forcing thousands of ladies from the sidewalks into
                            the roadways to save dainty draperies from the droppings of the animals
                            ? Could not the hours when sheep and goats go through the city be
                            regulated as in Europe É</p>
                        <p>Is it impossible, or quite possible, to devise means to prevent the
                            keepers and owners of restaurants and bars from monopolising not only
                            the pavements, but in many instances the roadways, and by filling them
                            with tables and chairs for their hundreds of customers’ convenience,
                            prevent thousands of pedestrians from using the footpaths, which the law
                            almost forces them to use ?</p>
                        <p>Not only these bar monopolists but the native camel men are equally
                            blameable in this respect. I saw a troop of loaded camels marching on
                            the pavement on the Esbekieh- gardens side at 6 o’clock in the evening
                            last week and frightened ladies jumping off it in front of the trams and
                            vehicles. The policeman on (presumedly) point duty, was deeply engaged
                            in astronomical studies at the time, and did not see the camels, but it
                            struck me that a constable who was not an amateur astronomer was
                            essential in this busiest of thoroughfares.</p>
                        <p>Is it quite impossible to regulate the movements, and above all insist
                            upon the quieter conduct, of the thousands of native watchmen in the
                            better class residential streets, who, having slept all day, bring their
                            benches to the pavements at night, and congregating in groups from
                            neighbouring houses, howl and scream all night, in argumentative strife
                            over subjects of no earthly interest, even to themselves ? Their one
                            success is in keeping tired people awake and indignant. Could not these
                            be prevented from using the streets for their nightly meeting and be
                            restricted to their owners’ gardens ?</p>
                        <p>Is it not practicable to formulate and give effect to regulations
                            providing for the use of footpaths for pedestrians and roads for wheeled
                            and analogous traffic ? At present the roadways are used, in common with
                            vehicles, by chiefly the native population, and no attempts are made to
                            keep them for vehicles. The result is that a cabdrive is a painful and
                            headaching experience, as the drivers are incessantly engaged in
                            shouting warnings to foot passengers, to other cab drivers, who will not
                            keep their proper side, and particularly to native drivers of heavy
                            carts, who sprawl all over the road heedless of everyone. If London
                            traffic can be efficiently regulated with its population of six
                            millions, why not Cairo with six hundred thousand ?</p>
                        <p>The remedy in the hands of the authorities is a simple one. Import a
                            London City Inspector of Police. Arm him with wide but carefully
                            regulated powers, and Cairo will become the well-ordered city it at
                            present it not. The police, as they are, seem to be a fairly civil and
                            reasonably plastic body, but they want some teaching, and this is,
                            apparently, entirely absent.</p>

                        <p>Sir,—Two days ago a fine horse was run over at Ibrahimieh. The
                            unfortunate animal had the oft hind leg all but severed at the thickest
                            part, but instead of being left near the scene of the accident until the
                            police could send and shoot it, I saw it being urged along on three legs
                            by a nondetscript crowd headed by a policeman, over the hill at
                            Ibrahimieh to Hadra police station. On being remonstrated with, the
                            policeman said he could not get a cart to convey it. This treatment, one
                            would think, was cruel enough, but I hear since, on reaching Hadra this
                            victim of civilisation was denied its right to a merciful bullet,
                            because forsooth ! — the exigencies of "red tape” required that it
                            should be taken on to Rosetta Gate. By the time it had been dragged as
                            far as Hadra I am told that the bone had come right through the skin,
                            and one can imagine the agony needlessly inflicted during the long tramp
                            through the mid-day heat.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that on such an occasion the police might be allowed on
                            their own responsibility to take a more humane course. Alexandria is
                            reputed an enlightened town and even has its S.P.C.A.--I am, etc.,</p>

                    <head type="sub">Propositions concernant un nouveau plan d’organisation de
                        l’enseignement secondaire</head>
                    <p>( Suite et fin)</p>
                    <p>— « Plan d’études des 3me et 4me années secondaires (Voir Annexe A). ”</p>
                    <p>Les études de la 3me et de la 4me année secondaire ayant principalement pour
                        objet de préparer des sujets qualifiés pour le recrute ment des écoles
                        supérieures, il a été jugé nécessaire d’y spécialiser renseignement et de
                        subdiviser chacune de ces classes en deux sections 1° Section littéraire
                        plus spécialement destinée à la préparation des candidats à l’École
                        Khédiviale de Droit ;</p>
                    <p>2° Section scientifique préparant à l’admission aux Écoles de Médecine et
                        Polytechnique Quant à l’École Normale de Darb el Gamamiz elle pourra se
                        recruter simultanément dans le deux sections, son objet étant de prépare
                        pour l’enseignement dans les écoles primaires, non seulement des professeurs
                        de lettres mais aussi des professeurs de mathématiques.</p>
                    <p>Cette spécialisation des études secondaire permettra de renforcer dans les
                        sections scientifiques l’enseignement des mathématiques des sciences et le
                        dessin ; et dans les section littéraires, de donner à l’enseignement de
                        l'histoire et de la géographie un développement plus considérable, et en
                        même temps d’y introduire l’étude d’une deuxième langue européenne, dite
                        langue accessoire, dont la connaissance élémentaire est considérée comme
                        indispensable pour les étudiants de l’École de Droit.</p>
                    <p>En ce qui concerne l’enseignement de 1a langue arabe, de la langue européenne
                        principale et de la traduction, il est prévu dans le nouveau plan d'études
                        que ces matières core porteront dans les sections scientifiques et
                        littéraires de la 3me et de la 4me année, le même nombre de leçons
                        hebdomadaires que dans les classes de 1re et de 2me année ; d telle sorte
                        que tous les élèves qui se présenteront à l’examen du Certificat d’Études
                        Secondaires, auront acquis une connaissance beaucoup plus étendue de ces
                        matières essentielles, puisqu’ils les auront étudiées pendant un année de
                        plus.</p>
                    <p>Il convient, en outre, de remarquer que quelques leçons seront affectées dans
                        les sections littéraires de la 3me et de la 4me année à la continuation de
                        l’étude des mathématiques c des sciences. Il a paru an Comité Technique qu
                        ces matières sont trop importantes, au point d vue du développement de
                        l’esprit, pour qu leur enseignement puisse être abandonné après la 2ème
                        année secondaire.</p>

                    <p>L’examen du Certificat d’Etudes Secondaires sera conduit conformément aux
                        prescriptions du Règlement ci-joint (Annexe C).</p>
                    <p>Ce Règlement ne diffère de celui qui a été jusqu’ici en vigueur pour l’examen
                        du Certificat d’Études Secondaires que sur trois points principaux :</p>
                    <p>1° L’examen comportera deux séries d’épreuves, (a) Série littéraire, (b)
                        Série scient tique. Les épreuves de chaque série porteront, respectivement,
                        sur les matières qui sou enseignées dans les sections littéraires et dans
                        les sections scientifiques des classes de 3me et de 4me année, mais seront
                        basées, pour chaque matière, sur le programme entier des quatre années
                        secondaires ; quant aux épreuves d langue arabe, de langue européenne
                        principal et de traduction, elles seront communes aux candidats des deux
                        sections.</p>
                    <p>2" Pour être admis à subir l’examen oral, les candidats deront avoir obtenu à
                        l’examen écrit un nombre de points au moins égal à 50 % du total maximum des
                        notes attribuées à l’ensemble des épreuves, avec un minimum spécial pour la
                        langue arabe égal à 50 % de la note maxima attribuée à cette matière.</p>
                    <p>3° A partir de 1910, tous les candidats au Certificat d’Etudes Secondaires
                        devront avoir subi avec succès, dans une année antérieure l'examen du
                        Certificat d’Aptitude, c’est-à-dire l’examen qui porte sur le programme des
                        deux premières années du cours secondaire</p>
                    <p>Il est mentionné en outre dans ce Règlement que les candidats qui auront
                        obtenu le Certificat d’Etudes Secondaires conformément au nouvelles
                        prescriptions, seront aptes à remplir des emplois du cadre rétribués à
                        raison de L.E. comme traitement de débat, ce qui est raisonnable, étant
                        donné que ces candidats auront acquis une supériorité incontestable sur ceux
                        qui ont obtenu le Certificat d’Etudes Secondaires dans les conditions du
                        Règlement de ce examen jusqu’ici en vigueur.</p>
                    <p>Comme mesures transitoires, l’examen d Certificat d’Etudes Secondaires, en
                        1906, ne portera que sur le programme des trois premières années du cours
                        secondaire.</p>
                    <p>Le Certificat d’Etudes Secondaires qui sera délivré en 1906, sera assimilé au
                        Certificat d’Etudes Secondaires actuel, et la possession de ce Certificat
                        conferera au porteur tous le avantages et privilèges qui sont attachés à la
                        possession du Certificat d’Etudes Secondaires obtenu conformément au
                        Règlement qui a été jusqu’ici en vigueur.</p>
                    <p>Les candidats appartenant aux écoles du Gouvernement qui échoueront à
                        l’examen en 1906, seront versés dans les classes de 4me année secondaire,
                        section littéraire ou section scientifique, selon leurs aptitudes, et
                        devront subir l’examen du Certificat d’Etudes Secondaires, en 1907, sur la
                        programme complet des quatre années d’études.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>Les mesures transitoires prévues ci-dessus, ne seront applicables qu’à
                        l’année 1906. Dès l’année 1907, tous les candidats, aussi bien ceux des
                        écoles du Gouvernement que ceux qui n’appartiendront pas à ces écoles,
                        seront tenus dé passer l’examen du Certificat d’Etudes Secondaires sur le
                        programme complet des quatre années du cours d'études secondaires, et
                        conformément à toutes les prescriptions du nouveau Règlement de cet examen,
                        sans aucune restriction.</p>

                    <p>Les programmes, adaptés à la nouvelle organisation des écoles secondaires,
                        ont été dressés par des commissions composées d’inspecteurs du Ministère,
                        ainsi que de Directeurs et de Professeurs des écoles secondaires et
                        supérieures, c’est-à-dire de ceux qui ont la responsabilité de l’application
                        de ces programmes.</p>
                    <p>Pour répondre au double but que poursuit le Ministère par la nouvelle
                        organisation de l’enseignement secondaire, soit, (a) de former, après deux
                        années d’études, des jeunes gens ; aptes à remplir d’une manière
                        satisfaisante les emplois du Gouvernement ; (b) de préparer en quatre
                        années, pour le recrutement des écoles supérieures, des candidats ayant reçu
                        une instruction secondaire plus complète et mieux adaptée, les nouveaux
                        programmes présentent un double caractère : 1. pour les deux premières
                        années, ils comportent l’étude des notions essentielles de toutes les
                        matières constituant la base d’une culture générale ; 2. à partir de la
                        troisième année, ils admettent une certaine spécialisation ; de telle sorte
                        qu’il sera possible de traiter les sujets prescrits d’une manière plus
                        méthodique et plus complète et par suite de faire une plus large part au
                        raisonnement, d’initier les élèves à de bonnes méthodes de travail et de
                        mieux former leur esprit.</p>
                    <p>Resume des Propositions.</p>
                    <p>En résumé, la réorganisation de l’enseignement secondaire, proposée par le
                        Comité Technique, consiste dans ses grandes lignes :</p>
                    <p>1e A porter de 3 à 4 années la durée des études secondaires.</p>
                    <p>2 A subdiviser l'enseignement dans les classes de 3me et de 4me année en deux
                        sections, l'une littéraire et l’autre scientifique : la section littéraire
                        destinée plus spécialement à la préparation à l’Ecole Khédiviale de Droit,
                        et la section scientifique, à la préparation aux Ecoles de Médecine et
                        Polytechnique.</p>
                    <p>3° A instituer un examen portant sur le programme des deux premières années
                        secondaires, à la suite duquel sera délivré un certificat, dit “Certificat
                        d’Aptitude aux emplois inférieurs du cadre du personnel civil”</p>
                    <p> destiné à remplacer 1e Certificat d’Etudes Primaires comme titre à
                        l’admission aux emplois de l’Etat, les porteurs de ce certificat ayant le
                        droit, soit de continuer leurs études secondaires, soit de postuler pour des
                        emplois dans les administrations. Cet examen aura lieu pour la première fois
                        en 1907 ; et, à partir de janvier 1910, le Certificat d’Etudes Primaires
                        cessera de donner accès aux emplois du Gouvernement</p>
                    <p>4° A faire porter l’examen da Certificat d'Etudes Secondaires sur un
                        programme de quatre années d’études, et à subdiviser cet examen en deux
                        séries d’épreuves : l’une littéraire et l’autre scientifique. La possession
                        de ce Certificat donnera accès aux écoles supérieures, et permettra aussi de
                        postuler pour des emplois dans les administrations du Gouvernement. A partir
                        de 1910, le Certificat d’Aptitude sera exigé des candidats aux examens du
                        Certificat d’Etudes Secondaires. </p>
                    <p>5° A reconnaître aux candidats qui seront nommés à des emplois dans les
                        administration; de l’Etat, le droit à un traitement initial de LE. 6 pour
                        ceux qui seront munis du Certificat d’Aptitude, et de LE. 8 pour ceux qui
                        seront porteurs du Certificat d’Etudes Secondaires, soit partie littéraire,
                        soit partie scientifique, ce qui implique que les porteurs de diplômes des
                        écoles supérieures devront débuter avec un traitement de L.E. 12 au moins ;
                        ce dernier chiffre est d’ailleurs accepté, en principe tout au moins, par
                        les Ministères de la Justice et des Travaux Publics. L’adoption de cette
                        échelle des traitements de début attribués aux porteurs des certificats et
                        diplômes est la condition nécessaire, du succès de tout le plan de
                        réorganisation exposé dans cette note.</p>
                    <p>6. A adapter les programmes d’études secondaires à la nouvelle organisation
                        et aux buts que l’on s’est proposé d’atteindre par cette réforme.</p>
                    <p>7. A prendre des mesures transitoires pour que la mise en application de
                        cette nouvelle organisation ne cause aucune perturbation sensible dans le
                        fonctionnement des ecoles secondaires et des écoles supérieures, et
                        n’apporte aucune entrave au recrutement des employés des services
                        publics.</p>
                    <p>Conclusion</p>
                    <p>La mise en vigueur de ce plan de réorganisation do l’enseignement secondaire
                        aura certainement pour conséquence une augmentation très considérable et
                        très rapide da nombre des élèves dans les écoles secondaires, j Déjà, avec
                        l’organisation actuelle, le seul fait d’avoir fixé, dans le Règlement
                        concernant l’admission aux emplois du Gouvernement du 24 juin 1901, à L E.
                        10 le maximum du traitement auquel peuvent atteindre les employés munis
                        seulement du Certificat d’Etudes Primaires, a décidé un grand nombre de
                        jeunes Egyptiens à entrer dans les écoles secondaires, et a permis de
                        doubler, en quatre années, le nombre des élèves de ces écoles ; on est donc
                        fondé à oroire que le remplacement, dans un délai fixé du Certificat
                        d’Etudes Primaires, par le Certificat d’Aptitude délivré après deux années
                        d’études secondaires, comme titre à l’admission aux emplois du Gouvernement,
                        déterminera un grand nombre de jeunes gens qui auraient borné leurs études
                        au coursprimaire, à continuer <cb n="3"/>ces études dans les écoles
                        secondaires, pendant lés deux premières années du coure tout au moins. Il
                        faut en conséquence, s'attendre à une telle augmentation de la population
                        scolaire des écoles secondaires que le nombre de ces écoles devra être plus
                        que doublé dans une période de quatre années. Les trois écoles secondaires
                        actuelles sont déjà complètement insuffisantes ; et, à la rentrée prochaine,
                        il ne sera possible de recevoir les nouveaux élèves qu’en serésignant à
                        accepter provisoirement dans ces écoles un nombre d’élèves, non seulement
                        hors de proportion avec les locaux, mais aussi beaucoup trop élevé pour que
                        l'action de la direction paisse s’exercer avec une complète efficacité. Il
                        est vrai qu’une quatrième école secondaire est en voie de construction à
                        Guizeh ; mais celle-ci sera elle-même insuffisante, dès 1907, pour recevoir
                        le trop plein d'élèves, et il y a urgente à prévoir la création de trois
                        autres nouvelles écoles avant l’année 1909.</p>
                    <p>Le Ministère croit devoir insister sur la nécessité absolue de créer
                        immédiatement ces nouvelles écoles secondaires ; tout retard sur ce point
                        aurait pour conséquence fatale l’échec de tout le plan de réorganisation, et
                        c’est ici le cas de dire que quand on veut la fin, il faut vouloir les
                        moyens.</p>
                    <p>La mise à exécution du plan de réorganisation de l’enseignement secondaire
                        entraînera donc nécessairement de nouvelles charges pour le budget de
                        l’État, puisqu’elle nécessitera la créations de nouvelles écoles et
                        l’augmentation du personnel enseignant ; mais les avantages qui résulteront
                        pour le pays de la formation d’un corps d’employés beaucoup plus capables
                        que celui qu’il est possible de recruter actuellement, et le relèvement da
                        niveau des études scientifiques et littéraires dans l’élite de la population
                        du pays, sont si importants, que ces dépenses peuvent être considérées comme
                        les plus productives de celles qu’un pays doit s’imposer.</p>
                    <p>Le plan de réorganisation de l’enseignement secondaire exposé dans cette
                        note, ainsi que le plan d’études, les Règlements des examens et les
                        programmes adaptés à la nouvelle organisation, ont été approuvés par le
                        Conseil Supérieur, dans sa séance du 28 mai dernier.</p>
                    <p>En conséquence, le Ministère de l’Instruction Publique a l'honneur de prier
                        le Conseil des Ministres de vouloir bien leur accorder sa haute sanction,
                        pour qu’ils puissent être appliqués à partir de la prochaine année scolaire
                        1905-1906.</p>
                    <p>Le Ministre de l'Instruction publique, Signé : H. Fakhry.</p>

                    <p>Some men, in the daily routine of employment, over exert themselves bodily;
                        others have to face a constant mental strain beyond their natural strength.
                        In either case the system finally fails to respond, and health gives way. As
                        an eloquent example of the fortifying powers of Dr.</p>
                    <p>Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People in such cases, the words of Mr. A.
                        Gillespie, head master of ;he Malton Wesleyan School, appeal to all wage
                        earners.</p>
                    <p>“As the result of studying hard after school duties were over,” he stated to
                        a reporter of the “Yorkshire Herald,” “I felt my health completely giving
                        way. I owe it entirely to Dr. Williams Pink Pills that I am now in good
                        health again.</p>
                    <p>“In November last,” he continued, when interviewed at his residence, 74,
                        Castlegate, Malton, “I felt thoroughly run down. I was weary and worn all
                        the day through. On going to my school in the morning I had no spirit and
                        energy to perform my duties, though I am devoted to the work. It was
                        extremely difficult for me to keep awake.</p>
                    <p>"At first I thought some ordinary tonic would set me right. I tried one, then
                        another, but it was useless. These attempts to shake off the weariness and
                        build up my strength were failures. I confess I grew alarmed at this
                        debilitated state. I really feared I should have to give up work and rest ;
                        then I determined to try Dr.Williams’ Pink Pills.</p>
                    <p>“After one box I felt a distinct improvement and ability to tackle work, and
                        so I grew better. By the end of December I was completely restored in
                        strength and health through Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills ”</p>
                    <p>For general breakdown of the nervous system Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are
                        invaluable, for they feed the nerves while purifying and adding to the blood

                    <p>"Al Moayad” says:-We recently described Morocco as the corn ground between
                        the two stones of the handmill. The great European nations aim at its
                        annexation under one pretext or another, and France and Germany are at
                        daggers drawn over the spoil. France's claim runs thus—“We are the
                        neighbours of Morocco, our frontiers march with the Moroccan border, and we
                        have therefore an absolute right to interfere in Moorish commercial

                        any other European nation : we have signed no agreements respecting Morocco
                        and therefore do not propose to leave it to France. If France wishes to
                        fight for our exclusion, let her go to war with us ; if on the other hand
                        she prefers peace and an open door we are glad of it.”</p>
                    <p>The Moors are delighted by the quarrel and acclaim the German view that the
                        Sultan is an independent monarch and that Moroccan affairs can only be
                        settled by a general conference of the Powers. They imagine that Germany is
                        a disinterested seeker of their own welfare, but do not realise that Germany
                        really aims at using the Moors to embarrass France. If Germany succeeds she
                        will govern Morocco, or she may bargain with France for another eastern
                        possession and leave the Moors to their fate. The Moorish demand for a
                        conferernce was inspired by Germany, but alas ! the Moors do not realise
                        that the conference when it meets will resemble those that met for the
                        benefit of Turkey and were the cause of the loss of much of the Ottoman
                        Empire and of great ill to all Moslems. The notables called by Saltan Abdul
                        Aziz who have agreed to a conference do not understand what a conference
                        means. They are probably like the Councils of Ismail Pasha who, when he
                        wished for any thing, wrote to the Councils of the notables of Egypt who
                        sanctioned everything. But if these notables are responsible men and have
                        real influence with the Sultan, then their action may prove to be a great
                        benefit to Morocco and may safeguard its liberty.</p>

                    <head>AN “EGYPTIAN” CELEBRITY.</head>
                    <head>SIR ERNEST CASSEL, K.C.M.G., K.C.V.O.</head>
                    <p>(From the “Daily Report”).</p>
                    <p>Sir Ernest Cassel, who has had the distinction of entertaining the Khedive
                        for the Ascot meeting this week, is now prominent among la haute finance,
                        although it is less than eight years since the name of Cassel first became
                        publicly associated with the commercial regeneration of Egypt. It was in the
                        spring of 1898, as the “Tatler” reminds us, that, under his financial
                        auspices, Sir John Aird and Sons started the famous Nile irrigation works.
                        The extent of this undertaking may be gauged by the fact that at one time
                        11,500 men were employed on the barrage at Assiout and 8.500 at Assouan. In
                        1898 Mr. Cassel, as he then was,</p>
                    <p>FOUNDED THE NATIONAL BANK of Egypt, which in its turn four years afterwards
                        fathered the Agricultural Bank of Egypt, empowered by the Khédivial decree
                        to raise five millions sterling on 3 1/2 per cent. bonds under the guarantee
                        of the Egyptian Government, and to put a spoke in the wheel of the local
                        usurers by lending the proceeds to the fellaheen at rates ranging up to 9
                        per cent, secured by first mortgages on land, the value of which must be at
                        least double the amount of the advance.</p>
                    <p>DISTINCTIONS.</p>
                    <p>Sir Ernest Cassel received his K.C.M.G. from Queen Victoria in 1899. Three
                        years later he was made a Knight Commander of the Victorian Order and a
                        Privy Councillor. Perhaps one day he may be raised to the peerage. That his
                        bump of benevolence is largely developed is evidenced inter alia by his
                        £200,000 gift for the consumption cure sanatorium. Certainly there is no
                        individual financier in Europe with a wider influence or a more remarkable
                        record than that of Sir Ernest Cassel. Apart from other achievements in all
                        parts of the world, Sir Ernest was a prominent member of the syndicate which
                        took up the first thirty millions of the British Consol issue during the
                        Boer war. He arranged the big Chinese loan after the war with Japan, while
                        among the undertakings which owe their existence to his initiative is the
                        Central London Railway. The amalgamation of the Maxim Nordenfeldt and the
                        Naval Construction companies into the existing company of Vickers, Sons, and
                        Maxim is another of his achievements.</p>

                    <head>BANKING IN JERUSALEM.</head>
                    <p>Mr. Consul Dickson reports that the total value of Palestine’s exports in
                        1904 was £295,300, compared with £322,300 during the previous year, showing
                        a falling off of about 8 per cent This was mainly noticeable in the
                        exportation of soap, sesame, water-melons, colocynth and olive oil, the crop
                        of olives having been small in 1904. On the other hand, there was an
                        increase as regards the more important articles of export, such as oranges,
                        wines and spirits, wool and skins. Prices of oranges in the United Kingdom,
                        however, were low, and shippers lost considerably.</p>
                    <p>The value of the trade with the United Kingdom was £135,000, or an increase
                        of over 5. per cent, in 1904, compared with the previous year. The exports
                        to the United Kingdom exceeded those to any other country, their value
                        having been £92,000 ; the next country on the list was Egypt, which took
                        £75,000 worth of exports, then Germany with £32,000 and France followed with
                        £24,000, the value of the exports to other countries being comparatively
                        small. The total value of the imports from the United Kingdom was £43,000,
                        as against £38,000 in 1905, or an increase of over 13 per cent. Turkey sent
                        to Palestine the largest amount of the imports (£170,000) in 1904, then
                        Austria-Hungary (£60,000), and thirdly the United Kingdom (£43,000).</p>
                    <p>The following figures will show the share taken by the United Kingdom in the
                        export and import trade of Palestine, compared with that of the principal
                        competing countries :—</p>
                    <p> Export trade United Kingdom, 31 per cent, ; Egypt, 25 percent. ; Germany, 10
                        per cent. ; France, 8 per cent.</p>
                    <p>Import trade Turkey, 35 per cent. ; United Kingdom, 9 per cent. ; Russia, 7
                        per cent. ; British Colonies, 6 per cent. ; France, 6. per cent. ; Germany,
                        4 per cent.</p>
                    <p>The value of the exports to the British Colonies was £6,000 in 1904, as
                        against £5,000 in 1903, and of the imports from the British Colonies
                        £32,000, compared with £30,000 in 1903.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the British steamship companies engaged in the trade of
                        Palestine, large ocean “liners" visit the port of Jaffa, being especially
                        chartered for the conveyance of tourists, who are now accustomed to come to
                        Jerusalem in such numbers that the city, during the early spring and autumn,
                        is becoming a second Cairo in this respect. The result is that money flows
                        into the country, and as the native population grows richer, building
                        material and other necessaries, as well as luxuries, of European manufacture
                        are in demand, and trade with the United Kingdom and the Continent generally
                        is stimulated.</p>
                    <p>The Jewish Colonies are entirely agricultural, and were founded with the sole
                        object of inducing the Jews who had been compelled to emigrate from certain
                        countries in Europe to become farmers in the land hallowed to them by
                        religious sentiment and national aspirations. The facility, however, with
                        which grapes are grown throughout Palestine induced a large number of
                        colonists to engage in the manufacture of wine, which, it may be said, has
                        become the most important industry of the country.</p>
                    <p>With regard to cotton-growing in Palestine, the experiments made daring 1904
                        may be considered, as far as they went, satisfactory, but they were not
                        conducted on a proper system, and the results, therefore, were not as
                        favorable as they might have been. Should the cultivation of cotton
                        eventually prove a success in Palestine, it will, together with the large
                        trade at present carried on in the export of oranges, produce a considerable
                        development in the commercial prosperity of the country.</p>
                    <p>As regards minerals Palestine may be said to be quite undeveloped, but the
                        Dead Sea is known to contain large quantities of asphalt, and the region
                        around it extensive beds of salt, as well as phosphates, sulphur and even
                        mineral oil. Nothing, however, has been done so far in this direction.</p>
                    <p>As trade and commerce have been developed of late, and the number of
                        travellers has increased in a very marked degree—which is attested by some
                        of the large Atlantic liners being now frequently chartered for the
                        conveyance of tourists to Palestine—two or three well-known banking
                        companies have found it advantageous to open branch offices in Jerusalem,
                        with sub-agencies at Jaffa. Last year two such banking companies established
                        offices in this city, and at present there are British, French, German and
                        Ottoman banks in Jerusalem, as well as several private banks.</p>
                    <p>The opening, besides, in Jerusalem, within the last six years, of three
                        foreign post offices, in addition to one already existing and to the Turkish
                        post office, has facilitated correspondence with all parts of the world, and
                        there is now almost a daily arrival and departure of mails from and to
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>On the subject of public work there is little to add to what has been said in
                        last year’s report. The construction of a new Customhouse at Jaffa—referred
                        to in the report of the Acting British Vice-Consul at that place as being in
                        contemplation—has now been decided upon, and will greatly aid shipping
                        operations. The erection of a disinfecting station to the south west of
                        Jaffa, also mentioned in the same report, will enable passengers to undergo
                        disinfection without being obliged to proceed to Beyrout for that
                        purpose.</p>

                    <head>A HOLIDAY IN CYPRUS. </head>
                    <p>This year we decided to try Cyprus for a holiday resort. I decided therefore
                        to make first for the capital of the island—Nicosia—a pretty little town of
                        about 15,000 inhabitants, the seat of the government of the island by a
                        British High Commissioner, for nine months in the year. From June 15 to
                        September the officials all retire into the mountains of Troodos in the
                        southern half of the island (Nicosia being in the east centre) and encamp in
                        the pine forest there in tents. The military who are quartered at
                        Limassol—the only harbour in the island at present worthy of the name, and
                        south of the mountains of Troodos —do likewise, so that the encampment
                        becomes quite a fashionable resort later on.</p>
                    <p>I want to try to make known this island, which to many- I dare say—up till
                        now has only been connected with Paul and Barnabas, Elymas the sorcerer, and
                        Sergius Paulas. And I recommend any who wish to get a few breezy glimpses of
                        what Cyprus is like to-day, to read part of Rider Haggard’s “A Winter
                        Pilgrimage to Palestine and Cyprus.” (Longman and Co). Had we come in winter
                        or spring we should undoubtedly have seen the island to greater
                        advantage.</p>
                    <p>It is unfortunate that no comprehensive guide book has yet been written about
                        Cyprus, and that little is found in English about the varied and historic
                        interest of its abbeys, monasteries, and churches. The wonderful mediæval
                        history of the island and its connection with the Crusades, the Venetians,
                        the Lusignans, and the Turks is almost a forgotten story. And not until one
                        discovers the part that the monks and architects of this island had to play
                        in the Renaissance of art, does the charm of it all begin to take hold of
                        one. Strange, too, that of the thousands every year who come to Egypt and
                        Palestine hardly any turn aside hither as well.</p>
                    <p>The reason is two fold. First. Cyprus is still a poor island. Its climate has
                        not yet recovered from the blight of Turkish rule. The vast forests of its
                        central plain are swept away. The northern mountains are only just beginning
                        once again to grow untaxed trees, and in the south-east of the island the
                        heights are still quite barren. The former rains are just beginning to
                        return, but it will be long before the water supply is sufficient to make
                        the island throughout “a garden of the Lord.” The beautiful mountain breezes
                        blow night and day, almost without an interval at times. The nights are cool
                        in the plain, and quite cold on the mountains even in the height of summer,
                        while in the winter the equable temperature makes it (they say) a lovely
                        winter resort, and English residents find it delightfully healthy.</p>
                    <p>And then Cyprus is a handicapped island. Its revenue varies from £150,000 to
                        £215,000 a year, but owing to an arrangement made with the wily Turk in
                        1878, the revenue was assessed too high, and in consequence the surplus was
                        rated at over £90,000 whereas it is seldom over £60,000. Every penny
                        therefore of surplus is taken by the British Government to meet the annual
                        subsidy averaging £30,000 which has to be paid to the diplomatic ruler of
                        the Faithful. During Mr. Chamberlain's “golden age" at the Colonial Office
                        he seems to have voted £80,000 one year towards some irrigation works, in a
                        generous mood, when it was pointed out to him, by those who knew, that none
                        of the £60,000 or 30,000 ever really went to the Sultan’s Treasury at all
                        (!) but was held by bondholders before it reached Constantinople, in return
                        for interests on loans that Turkey never pays. And so beautiful Cyprus
                        remains poor, until she can attract more capital and square the Turk.</p>
                    <p>The next reason for our general ignorance is due to the indifferent service
                        of steamers here, which might be and will be soon remedied, I hear. If only
                        the island could have paid the P. &amp; O. “Isis” and “Osiris” a larger sum
                        for carrying the mails, they could have come on here from Port Said on
                        Wednesdays in 10 to 12 hours. As it is, they lie idle at Port Said until
                        Sunday or Monday every week. But I hear that the Khedivial Line is now
                        taking the place of the Bell Line of steamers, and next summer
                        Anglo-Egyptians will probably come here in numbers.</p>
                    <p>The island of Cyprus is about the size of Norfolk and Suffolk put together.
                        It has two mountain ranges running from East to West in the north and south
                        part of the island. The southern ranges of Troodos I hope to write about
                        later on when I have explored some of its valleys and heights. Mt Troodos
                        itself is 6,400 ft. and two other peaks are over 5,000 ft. The northern
                        ranges do not rise above 2,050 ft and have only one pass at present crossed
                        by a carriage road, which takes one from Nicosia, the capital, which lies in
                        the middle of the plain between the two ranges, and Kyrenia, a pretty little
                        port on the northern shore. There are several other bridle paths over the
                        mountains which can be ridden by mules. The Cyprus mules are in great
                        request, many of them being exported to Egypt every year, and numbers were
                        sent to South Africa daring the war. In consequence, a good mule now fetches
                        £20 to £25 in the market. The whole of the population in these mountains
                        speak Greek and are Christians, the proportion of Christians to <cb n="3"/>
                        Moslems in the whole island being four to one. Since the British entered the
                        country Moslems have only increased very little and now number 50,000. There
                        are nearly 200,000 Christians altogether. But the population must have been
                        very much greater once, for during the Roman occupation there were enough
                        people to enable the Jews, who settled in Cyprus, to put 240,000 to the
                        sword in a single revolt, if history can be relied upon.</p>
                    <p>The only ports of call for passengers today are Limassol, from which you
                        climb up to the Troodos range, and Larnaca, which is an uninteresting place,
                        affording a simple roadstead for liners and small craft. From Larnaca you
                        drive the 26 miles to Nicosia the capital, and until the old port of
                        Famagusta on the east of the island is dredged and the light railway from
                        Famagusta to Nicosia (30 to 40 miles in length) is finished, communication
                        from end to end of the island will be a tedious process. But the contractors
                        have promised to finish this railway this year and it will probably soon be
                        carried up the plain westwards as far as Morphon. The finishing and
                        deepening of Famagusta harbour will give a really fine approach to the
                        island, within five miles of the ancient Salamis. And once again the Arsinoé
                        of Ptolemy Philadelphus,—so famous as Famagusta in mediæval times daring the
                        crusades, when kings of Cyprus in the 14th century were crowned kings of
                        Jerusalem, so brave to resist the siege of Sultan Selim in 1570, till hunger
                        forced the 500 Italian soldiers and Cypriotes to surrender under Mark
                        Antonio Poragadino to the Turks—will be visited by pilgrims from the West in
                        numbers, not, as formerly, Venetians, Franks, Crusaders, but all lovers of
                        Bible lands.</p>
                    <p>My second letter will contain an account of the chief features of interest in
                        the eastern half of the island, with some description of Nicosia, Famagusta
                        and Salamis, and the historic scenes and sites upon the slopes of the
                        northern range of hills.</p>

                    <head>JERUSALEM AND THE EAST MISSION.</head>
                    <p>The annual meeting of the Jerusalem and the East Mission was held on Friday
                        week in the Hoare Memorial-hall, Church House, Westminster. The Bishop of
                        Salisbury, president of the council, occupied the chair, and there was a
                        large attendance. The secretary, the Rev. W. Sadler, reported that the
                        income this year would be about the same in amount as last year, but this
                        was owing to the receipt of a legacy of £630, to several generous gifts, and
                        to the contributions from the Colonies, which supported the mission with
                        great liberality. There was still a debt of £1,500 on the mission, bnt two
                        members of the council had that day promised to give £100 each if the
                        remainder could be raised by an early period. The Bishop in Jerusalem (Dr.
                        G. F. Popham Blyth) said he had not been in England for five years, and
                        during that period a good deal of hard work had been done, with excellent
                        results. The work of the bishopric was of a two fold kind—that connected
                        with the unity of the Churches, and the work of the missions, both medical
                        and educational ; and he was glad to be able to say that in each department
                        progress had been made as far as the funds available would allow. But
                        further assistance was urgently required in order to meet the opportunities
                        of development presented to them, especially in Jerusalem. Funds were much
                        wanted to provide a playground there for the schools. The introduction of
                        manly sports in the schools had proved an admirable means of farthering
                        their work, for in the playground there was no difference of sect or race.
                        He sincerely hoped that the Church at home would largely increase its
                        support of the mission during the next year, tor it was a most sacred cause.
                        Bishop Morley (Archdeacon of Egypt) referred to the astonishing development
                        that was taking place at Khartoum and in the Sudan. Archdeacon Potter, of
                        Cyprus, gave an account of the progress made by the mission in that island,
                        after which Mrs. Salmon, who has charge of the mission nursing hospital at
                        Jerusalem, set forth the special claims of that work to support, and said
                        that one of their greatest and most immediate wants was a lady doctor.</p>

                    <head>ON THE HEDJAZ RAILWAY. </head>
                    <byline>BY P.P.G.</byline>
                    <p>VI.</p>
                    <p>We reached Katranéh station at about 7 a.m., and forty minutes being allowed
                        us, all the passengers trooped out to get water, wash, or cook. There was
                        nothing in the least remarkable about Kafranéh, which consists of a few
                        buildings and tents with a water tower dumped down in the midst of an
                        "illimitable veldt."</p>
                    <p>A dry wadi ran past the station fall of stones and the yellow flowers of a
                        wild sage that grows commonly in the Mariout country : the water tower was
                        solidly built and Turkish and French inscriptions in honor of the Sultan
                        decorated its iron tank. The people visible were all soldiers employed on
                        the line and I saw no signs of any village.</p>
                    <p>We got good water at Katranéh, and I breakfasted with the khaki-clad Turkish
                        officer, who was able to talk French—of a sort—and seemed a good hearted
                        fellow. He certainly gave three of the privates, who were, of course,
                        without anything but bread, a good share of his breakfast, and the grateful
                        soldiers having finished their meal, cleaned up our plates and brought us
                        plenty of water. Washing on the line was a cold and melancholy business, and
                        I was not sorry when the train started for Qala'at el Hasa. The next three
                        hours of the journey were not marked by any particular incident. The country
                        gradually became barer; great patches of sand and gravel alternated with the
                        grass, which was far more stunted here than near Amman, and the sun grew
                        unpleasantly hot. At last, about forty minutes south of Qala'at el Hasa, we
                        reached a great defile down which we wound steadily, the grass and scrub
                        disappearing completely, while the temperature rose inordinately to my great
                        disgust. At the foot of the incline were masses of rocks and steep ravines
                        looking uncommonly like the gullies of the Mokattam hills. Rounded heights
                        rose on each side of the line, utterly bare and curiously blackened. The
                        stone appeared to have darkened through weathering and the prevalence of
                        black in the landscape gave the desert a very uncanny look.</p>
                    <p>Beyond the incline lay the station of Jurf-el- Derwish. A water tower was
                        being completed here near a deep wadi, which was crossed by a very solid and
                        well-built bridge. We stopped by the station hut and the doctor and I found
                        a Frenchman sitting there who promptly gave us brandy and coffee and
                        bemoaned the monotony of the life he led. I was inclined to sympathise with
                        him, for however much a man may appreciate solitude and the desert air, six
                        months’ exile among rocks and thorn bushes in a region where the days are
                        hot and the nights bitterly cold and there are no people, books or comforts
                        is enough to take the heart out of any man but a confirmed anchorite. In a
                        month or two release would come and the Frenchman would be stationed at
                        Deraa, of which he spoke as one would speak of Paris or Vienna. Every thing,
                        I suppose, is relative.</p>
                    <p>The bugle blew and we left the station, where a pet goat alternately nuzzled
                        and batted the exile and some ducks swam in a tub, and fled to the morning
                        train. The doctor barked his shins in trying to get on board and called the
                        “chef du train” a—but perhaps I had better not give the Turkish word which
                        has the same meaning as the epithet employed in Egypt. Then we rolled and
                        bumped for a long way through a region where all the stones in the world
                        seemed to have been flung. The hills east of the line soon died down and
                        gave place to a black plain that stretched for miles beside the railway and
                        gave a marvellous impression of desolation and spaciousness. It was
                        absolutely flat and barren, but for a few tufts of camel thorn ; only the
                        horizon was caught up by the mirage into shimmering black waves that rose
                        and vanished. Far away a grey peak towered up, as it seemed, from the other
                        side of the sky line, the only thing that did not move in the blurred and
                        wavering background. I felt that this was the end of our world, the
                        beginning of No man’s land.</p>
                    <p>Seeing me staring at the plain the doctor told me that it extended for three
                        days’ march, and was called Ard-es-Sawan and that the high mountain was
                        called Ras el Tobeit. The maps all place Ras-el-Tobeit further south, but
                        perhaps the name is given to a chain of which I could only see one peak. He
                        told me that beyond this mountain were Bedouins called Sherart, who wandered
                        north for pasture to the steppes during part of the year. He had no more to
                        say of them but that they were thieves and sons of unmentionable
                        persons.</p>
                    <p>Then a soldier said, “Here is Aneiza” and we pulled up at a station beside a
                        great cistern where the Romans or the Nabataeans had stored their water. It
                        was dry now, and the western wall had fallen on to the floor in several
                        places. Once again we started and the men began to take up their packs and
                        baskets and goulebs and to talk of Ma’ân. We crossed more ravines, white
                        streaks in the black desert, on the stone bridges that Meissner had designed
                        so well, up a long bare incline, and then down into an open plain dotted
                        with white tents, that were only seen for seconds and then vanished in
                        whirls of dust <cb n="5"/>and sand. The wind was terrific, the dust devils
                        hid even the station building and the trains upon the siding, and an evil
                        smell was blown about with the dust, but all sorts of quaint-looking, grubby
                        personages dressed in ragged uniforms ran out of the tents and buildings,
                        shouting, laughing, and waving their hands to us as we slowed down. The safe
                        arrival of a train was evidently a great event at Ma’ân.</p>

                    <head>INFALLIBLE “BOZ”.</head>
                    <p>The forthcoming sale of Dickens’ MSS. is an event of note for those who
                        treasure this class of relics. What most of us would appreciate even more,
                        however, would be to hear the voice of the dead master reading his own
                        works. Unfortunately, he never spoke into a phonograph or a gramophone.
                        Browning did, and his tones may be heard to-day ; and contemporary
                        notabilities are coming to view the practice with favor. The day will come
                        when possibly every eminent man will leave a record of his voice, as
                        carefully as he now leaves his will. It would have been interesting to hear
                        the two styles of Dickens. For a long time, when he came to one of Sam
                        Weller’s speeches, he seemed overcome with diffidence. A friend pointed out
                        to him that these passages should be enunciated with more dash and spirit.
                        Dickens said nothing, but the friend, hearing him later, noted with pleasure
                        that the hint had been accepted, and the sallies produced with the spirit in
                        which they were written ; and in congratulating him remarked that he had
                        always understood that he (Dickens) would never accept advice. “On the
                        contrary,” said Dickens, calmly, “I am always glad to be told if I am wrong,
                        but up to the present I never have been wrong.”</p>

                    <p>( Communication Officielle )</p>
                    <p>La Délégation Municipale s’est réunie le 4 juillet 1905 à 5 h. p.m. sous la
                        présidence de M. Amb. A. Ralli.</p>
                    <p>Présents : M.M. Ahmed Bey Eyoub, P. Fenderl, Mansour Bey Youssef, Dr. G.
                        Valensin, G. Zervudachi, Dr. Chiess Bey, membres ; W.P. Chataway,
                        administrateur ; I. Sidky Bey secrétaire.</p>
                    <p>La Délégation autorise certaines dépenses supplémentaires nécessaires pour la
                        mise en fonctionnement du Collecteur Est, sauf à régulariser ultérieurement
                        les crédits y relatifs.</p>
                    <p>Sur le rapport du Comité d’examen, la Délégation nomme M. G. Zachariadis au
                        poste de chef dessinateur avec le traitement de LE. 16 par mois.</p>
                    <p>La Délégation prend connaissance d’une lettre de S.E. le Ministre de
                        l’intérieur consentant à la cession du fort Nahas, sous certaines
                        conditions.</p>
                    <p>Elle regrette de ne pouvoir donner suite à une demande tendant à la création
                        d’un lien de réunion à Silsiley, cette demande étant encore prématurée.</p>
                    <p>Communication est donnée d’une lettre du 29 juin de S. E. le Ministre de
                        l’Intérieur faisant de légères modications au règlement d’application de la
                        taxe sur les voitures et bestiaux.</p>
                    <p>La Délégation adopte et décide de soumettre cette lettre à la Commission.</p>
                    <p>Comme suite à une lettre du 29 juin 1905 de la Compagnie des Eaux informant
                        que les travaux de construction du nouveau système de filtres sont terminés,
                        la Délégation délègue M.M. Dietrich Bey et Dr. Gotschlich pour opérer la
                        réception de ces travaux.</p>
                    <p>La Délégation prend note d’une lettre du 80 juin de la Compagnie de Ramleh
                        informant que conformément à la demande de la Municipalité, elle installera
                        un chalet de nécessité à la station Bacos.</p>
                    <p>Sur la demande de Mr. Hopkinson Bey, la Délégation proposera à la Commission
                        l’achat d’une échelle de sauvetage d’un nouveau système pour le service des
                        pompiers.</p>
                    <p>Elle soumettra également à la Commission diverses demandes pour majorations
                        ou ouvertures de crédit, parmi lesquelles an crédit de L.E. 300 pour
                        fouilles du Musée au Gabbari.</p>
                    <p>Les recettes se sont élevées du 1er janvier au 30 juin 1905 pour le budget
                        ordinaire à L.E. 110847 et pour le budget extraordinaire à L.E. 49149 ; les
                        dépenses pour la même période sont de L.E. 65834 pour le budget ordinaire et

                    <head>Un curieux proces </head>
                    <p>Dernièrement un habitant d’Assiout se trouvant à la grande gare du Caire et
                        voulant pénétrer sur la plate-forme dut payer cinq millièmes, comme tout le
                        monde.</p>
                    <p>De retour chez lui, il intenta un procès àl’administration des Chemins de fer
                        l’accusant d’avoir outrepassé ses droits en prélevant une taxe de cinq
                        millièmes.</p>
                    <p>Comme il s'agit d’une administration d’Etat, cette taxe doit légalement
                        prendre le nom d’impôt, et pour établir un nouvel impôt, le gouvernement
                        doit le faire au moyen d’un décret. Or, en l’espèce, aucun décret n’ayant
                        été rendu, il s’agit donc d’un impôt abusif dont on ne saurait frapper un
                        Egyptien. Et le demandeur, justifiant de sa qualité d’Egyptien, réclama la
                        restitution des cinq millièmes, plus une indemnité.</p>
                    <p>Le tribunal d’Assiout admettant la thèse du demandeur et faisant droit à sa
                        réclamation, a bel et bien condamné l’administration des Chemins de fer à
                        restituer les cinq millièmes indûment perdus et à payer quatre cents
                        piastres d’indemnité.</p>

                    <head>Une banque de “ reports ” </head>
                    <p>Dans l'“Officiel” du 3 a paru le décret de constitution d’une société anonyme
                        sous le nom de "Comptoir Financier et Commercial d’Egypte” composée de MM.
                        Khalil Pacha Khayat, A. Adda, G. Nungovioh, B. Rees, G. J. A. Campos et J.
                        Aghion. Les statuts de la Société sont dûs k la plume habile d’un membre
                        distingué da barreau d’Alexandrie.</p>
                    <p>La Société a pour objet toutes opérations financières ou commerciales aussi
                        bien sur les marchés d’Egypte que sur les marchés étrangers.</p>
                    <p>Parmi ces opérations figure en premier lieu le “Report” qui mérite d’attirer
                        l’attention. En effet, dans une place aussi importante que celle d’Egypte,
                        tant par sa nature que par le nombre des transactions, une banque de reports
                        est indispensable, et le besoin s’en est fait sentir à tel point ces
                        derniers temps que c’est à son absence que l’on attribue la plupart des
                        crises périodiques de notre marché.</p>
                    <p>Est-ce à dire que le report n’ait jamais été pratiqué sur notre place ? Non.
                        Mais ce genre d’opérations, tel qu'il est compris ici, ne mérite pas le nom
                        de report ; c’est une exploitation méthodique et sans merci des malheureux
                        qui y ont recours.</p>
                    <p>Que les affaires de report traitées sur une vaste échelle n'aient pu
                        jusqu’ici tenter aucun de nos établissements financiers, cela se conçoit
                        jusqu’à un certain point, vu l’extrême complexité des affaires que les
                        Banques ont déjà à traiter en Egypte. Aussi un établissement qui
                        consacrerait son activité à cette branche jasqu’ici inexploitée, quoique
                        très lucrative, est-il assuré du plus brillant succès. Peut-être même les
                        maisons rivales s’empresseront-elles de suivre son exemple et une
                        concurrence salutaire s'établira pour le plus grand profit du public.</p>

                    <p>Cotons.—L’avant-bourse de Liverpool est venae consolider les idées de hausse
                        de la place et la clôture s’est faite aux cours les plus élevés pratiqués
                        dans la matinée. Aujour- d’ui l’Amérique étant fermée, il n’y aura rien
                        d’extraordinaire à attendre du dehors, mais suivant les dépêches de
                        New-York, il y aura une continuation de la hausse, et même Price parle de 12
                        à 14 cents sous peu. Tout est possible, mais un peu de prudence est à
                        conseiller.</p>

                    <p>Parisians are extremely loth to leave their city. There was a time when,
                        after the Grand Prix, the season was at an end. But year after year the date
                        of going to the country or the seaside is being put off, and this year the
                        reluctance of fashionable people to make a move is more marked than ever.
                        Naturally, the Bois de Boulogne and the little island of Puteaux are more
                        patronised than the boulevards or the Rue de la Paix during the afternoon,
                        but when evening comes the city restaurants and those theatres which remain
                        open are still well filled. A favourite amusement with the wealthy is to go
                        by motor car to Versailles or Saint Germain for breakfast, return to Paris
                        in time for the five o’clock tea, and then wind up the evening at the fête
                        of Neuilly, or in one of the well-known establishments at Montmartre.</p>
                    <p>Nominally the Paris theatres are closed. Here and there, however, a few of
                        the lesser houses keep open their doors. Holiday fare is quite special to
                        itself. Suddenly the Vaudeville awoke from its summer sleep the other day,
                        and presented a play with the title “Le Rois Américains.” It was the very
                        drollest conception of American life. What the writer did not know of
                        American life would fill the Bibliothèque Nationale. It is the more amusing
                        as the play is intended for New York ! Elsewhere, at the Grand Guignol, the
                        summer play which one would expect to be light and airy is, on the contrary,
                        a sort of theatrical bouille-abaisse. There is plenty of garlic in the
                        latest piece, “La Masquerade Interrompue,” founded on a story of Edgar Allan
                        Poe. A ball is in progress and, suddenly, among the guests surges the red
                        figure of the plague. The host touches him upon the shoulder. He turns and
                        reveals a face most hideous, marked with the dreadful disease. The plague in
                        the ball-room is a fit accompaniment to murder in the night nursery—the
                        dénouement of one of the other plays on the bill.</p>
                    <p>Most of the Paris papers deal with the strained state of affairs between
                        France and Germany in a tone of commendable moderation and restraint, “La
                        Patrie” being one of the few which adopts a Chauvinistic attitude. But its
                        efforts seem chiefly devoted to making bad blood between England and France,
                        for what purpose except to injure the Government it is difficult to imagine.
                        With regard to the great number of Germans resident in Paris, there was a
                        report a few days ago that the Reservists had been recalled to Germany ; and
                        this was looked upon as an infallible sign of coming war. But the “Patrie”
                        has been inquiring at the great steamship offices, and learns that the
                        Norddeutacher-Lloyd and other companies are doing just as much business as
                        ever, and are evidently under no apprehensions. A representative of the
                        company told a reporter that Germany had too much to lose by going to war,
                        and that no one believed in war, as it would mean the ruin of the great
                        German Trans-atlantic companies for the sole benefit of England. The other
                        companies interviewed made similar replies, and the “Patrie, no doubt, sees
                        in this some sort of justification for its absurd theory that England is
                        poshing France into war with Germany. At any rate, one thing is certain, and
                        that is that the French people do not desire war, though they suspect very
                        strongly that the Kaiser is determined to humiliate France once again.</p>
                    <p>The “Bess's o’ th’ Barn” have played their way straight into the heart of
                        France. Their visit is the “Entente Cordiale” set to music, the crochets and
                        quavers of a good understanding. There have been a number of delightful
                        incidents connected with this descent of Lancashire upon the friendly shores
                        of the Seine. At the Tuileries yesterday, the band’s arrival was timed to a
                        nicety. A review of the military societies was going on under the eye of the
                        President of the Republic. The band played the “Marseillaise,'' and M.
                        Loubet responded by asking for the British National Anthem. Whilst it was
                        being given the soldiers presented arms—a pretty and unrehearsed compliment
                        to the land of the musicians.</p>
                    <p>Enthusiasm reached fever-heat when the “Bess's” sounded out the Russian Hymn,
                        which was heaping compliment upon compliment. The President expressed his
                        great gratification at the performance of the band, and shook hands with the
                        organiser of the visit Mr. J. H Iles and Mr. MacNiell. The evening scene in
                        the same gardens, when the band gave a popular concert, was as remarkable as
                        any in the history of Franco-English amity. The crowd seemed as if they
                        would carry these musical Lancashire lads bodily away.</p>
                    <p>The band in its blue and gold, which has so impressed the Parisian,
                        penetrated to the Bois this afternoon, and lunched in the Café Chinois.
                        Amongst the representative assembly was Sir Henry Austin Lee, of the
                        Embassy. In the coffee state of digestion, a representative of the Minister
                        of Public Instruction uprose, and pinned upon the lapel of Mr. Alexander
                        Owen, the leader of the band, the violet riband of the Officer of Public
                        Instruction. It was an affecting moment when the typical French official
                        embraced the newly decorated on both cheeks. The band cheered to the echo in
                        true Lancashire style ; sang “ For he's a jolly good fellow’ until the
                        rafters trembled, and the waiters were moved to wonderment and admiration,
                        and called loudly for a speech. The hero of the hour delivered himself of a
                        short oration, in which, pointing to the “palme, " he said they <cb n="2"/>
                        decorated Lancashire as well as himself. It was a great day for the County
                        Palatine.</p>
                    <p>One by one the picturesque features of the army disappear. The old Empire
                        uniforms are no more save in the special regiments of the Republican Guard,
                        and the “Vivandière,” the heroine of so many songs, has been improved away.
                        Now the drums are threatened—nay, inexorably condemned. Their solemn yet
                        exhilarating rolling will no longer be heard beating to arms. They have been
                        denounced as useless by the highest military authority. The theory was that
                        afar off you might distinguishthe roll of one regiment’s drums from another
                        but perhaps the military ear is deficient in musicianly distinctions, for
                        the fact remains that the majority of officers could never tell one note
                        from the next. And so the drums are to go. But there is a subtler reason for
                        their going. It takes a long time to complete the perfect drummer. Three
                        years is all too short ; two years an impossible time. And so because the
                        “tapin’’ cannot tap scientifically and militarily is reason why he should
                        not tap at all.</p>
                    <p>A French scientist, Dr. Carnot, has been experimenting with different poisons
                        upon guinea-pigs. Contrary to popular belief, he finds that certain poisons
                        are fattening. Arsenic, phosphorus, and alcohol are decidedly stimulating. A
                        guinea-pig weighing 1lb. 1oz., which was given a milligramme of arsenic a
                        day, doubled its weight in four months. Phosphorus administered in small
                        doses produced a most gratifying effect, rendering the animal fat and sleek
                        in a short space of time. Even lead, morphine, and strychnine—dangerous
                        agents when taken in excess—gave gratifying results when taken in small
                        doses daily. It appears that mankind also thrives on poisons. The best
                        medicines are full of them, and sick people leave their beds well and strong
                        alter being dosed with strong prescriptions of poison.</p>
                    <p>An extraordinary find has been made by a party of workmen belonging to the
                        administration of the postal and telegraphic service. They were engaged in
                        digging up a part of the Boulevard Ney, which runs alongside the Northern
                        Railway line, in order to lay down telephonic communication. Suddenly one of
                        the workmen, who had excavated to a depth of about six inches, laid bare a
                        parcel covered with grey paper, and carefully tied up with twine. It is well
                        that the point of his pick did not strike the parcel, because when his
                        companions opened it, it was found to contain over four pounds of dynamite
                        cartridges. The local commissary of police was at once informed, and the
                        contents of the parcel taken to the Municipal laboratory. The detective
                        service is now on the look-out for the person or persons who hid so
                        dangerousa parcel in so suspicious a place.</p>
                    <p>With a view to testing the time required by a postcard to go the round of the
                        world, and to ascertain also the route which the card should take to
                        accomplish its journey in the least possible number of hours, an interesting
                        experiment in the form of a competition is being made in Paris. At three
                        o’clock this afternoon, at the Central Post Office, and in the presence of a
                        number of witnesses, 470 postcards, sent by an equal number of competitors
                        who had beforehand secured the services of correspondents in America and the
                        Fast East, were handed in after examination by and on the certificateof a
                        sheriff’s officer. Some will go by the Havre route, others by Marseilles, by
                        Cherbourg, by Southampton. After a few brief resting-places, necessitated by
                        the time taken by the correspondents in the United States or in Asia to
                        re-post them, the postcards will return to Paris, when the sender of the one
                        that arrives first will receive a prize of money.</p>
                    <p>M. Adrien Veber, deputy of the Seine, is responsible for the statement that
                        Paris does not possess a municipal debt which cannot in process of time, and
                        in the natural course of events, be wiped off. A third of the budget,
                        amounting to £4,000,000, is annually given over to the payment and
                        settlement of her debt of £200,000,000, which, although an enormous
                        liability, is much inferior to the value of the city’s present possessions.
                        These, naturally, will greatly increase in value during the near future,
                        while the debt itself is being gradually diminished. There will be no other
                        municipal loans, except such as the city guarantees, the Metropolitan
                        Railway extension and the gas works, for instance, which are excellent
                        securities both for the shareholders and the budget. This excellent
                        condition of affairs, says M. Veber, is entirely due to the traditions of
                        independent prudence and foresight with which universal suffrage has endowed
                        the civic council.</p>
                    <p>The Shah of Persia, now at Contrexeville had a trifling misadventure on
                        arriving in France. His Majesty expressed a wish to test the telephone, and,
                        opening the address book at random, rang up a wealthy lacemaker at
                        Mirecourt, some miles from Contrexeville. The conversation was as follows :
                        “Are you there ? What sort of weather are you having in Mire- court ? “What
                        the dickens is that to you ?Is that all you rang me up for ? ” “My dear sir,
                        don't suppose I desire to disturb you. But the fact is, I am the Shah of
                        Persia. ” “Oh, are you indeed ! Tell that to another, and do me the favor of
                        leaving me to my business, and go caterwauling elsewhere.” Whereupon the
                        connection was cut off. Unluckily, his Majesty is acquainted with French
                        enough to know that “chat” means cat, and is pronounced exactly like
                        Shah.</p>
                    <p>The French make use of their subterranean sewers to grow mushrooms, and one
                        may walk <cb n="3"/>under miles of the main streets and boulevards of Paris
                        surrounded by growing fungi. A curious experience was that of two working
                        men at Joinville, who entered one of those underground mushroom beds, and
                        could not get out again for fifteen hours. A mass of manure had been tipped
                        at the opening by which they got in, and, in consequence, they had to walk
                        for hours through the galleries. It was only when they struck upon an
                        electric conduit that they were able to approach the surface and be rescued
                        from their dangerous position by two men who observed their efforts to raise
                        the cover of the manhole which shut them in.</p>
                    <p>A £50 necklace has just been the cause of considerable excitement in a
                        theatre at Montmartre. It had been stolen by a young butcher from a woman
                        who was his customer, and later it was recognised by the loser on the neck
                        of a girl who sat near her at the performance. Accused of wearing things
                        that did not belong to her, the girl stated before the Commissary of Police
                        that the necklace was a present from her friend, the Baron de Monte-
                        gallina. The nobleman in question was at once sent for, and turned out to be
                        the butcher, whose thieving proclivities had got the better of his honesty.
                        The Commissary, after a rigor- rous cross-examination, learned from the
                        butcher’s lips that he had stolen the necklace and assumed the title of
                        Baron in order to win the affection of a young lady who, other wise, would
                        have had nothing to do with him. He is now in the lock-up, awaiting his
                        trial.</p>
                    <p>Aroused to anger by the long and growing series of crimes that take place in
                        their midst, the peaceful population of Paris are up in arms against
                        malefactors of every description. A person whose offence was more an
                        individual than a social one, had this brought home to him yesterday
                        afternoon. In the crowded thoroughfare of the Faubourg Montmartre shortly
                        after the hour of the midday meal, the cry was heard : “Catch the thief !” A
                        man, hotly pursued by several policemen, was seen to make his way in and out
                        of the line of cabs, omnibuses, cycles, and automobiles, with which the
                        Faubourg was blocked. The cry being repeated by his pursuers, a number of
                        citizens —more than 200—joined in the chase. The human quarry was at length
                        caught in a house in which, driven to bay, he had taken refuge, and but for
                        the police he would have suffered at the hands of his captors. His offence,
                        it transpired, was that he had eaten a hearty meal in a restaurant, and
                        taken to his heels when the time came for paying.</p>
                    <p>To leave prison and re enter it on the same day, in the meantime to twice
                        attempt to drown herself, is the record achieved by an old Paris vagabond.
                        Mother “Perraud,” as she is called, is a beggar by profession, and a
                        drunkard by habit. After working out her twenty-third condemnation for
                        drunkenness and disorderly conduct, she said “Au revoir” to St. Lazare
                        prison yesterday morning, and made with haste for her favorite tavern. There
                        she found her nine-year-old daughter, whom she takes with her on begging
                        expeditions, when she appeals to the charity of the wealthy as “a poor
                        mother of a large family without work.” This time the child refused to go
                        with her. Wounded in her tenderest affections. Mother “Per- raud” went off
                        and threw herself into the Seine, out of which she was fished with
                        difficulty. Finding she could not drown in water, she returned to the tavern
                        and to a more familiar liquid, of which she drank a large number of litres.

                    <head>SERVIAN SECRET HISTORY. </head>
                    <p>M. Vladan Georgevitch, for three years Servian Premier, is about to publish a
                        work entitled “Last Days of a Dynasty,” which throws many new and sometimes
                        lurid lights not only on recent chapters in Servian history, but on Central
                        European policy, notably disposing authoritatively of the long-accepted myth
                        of an Austro-Russian pact concerning the Balkans. </p>
                    <p>On October 25, 1898, M. Georgevitch interviewed Count Goluchowski, the
                        Austrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, unofficially, and reported as follows
                        to King Alexander :—</p>
                    <p>‘Sir,—I had the honor to be received in a most friendly manner by Count
                        Goluchowski. He said, ‘As long as Servia remains what it now is, an element
                        of peace and order in the Balkan Peninsula, you will never be attacked by
                        any Great Power.’ ”</p>
                    <p>A STUPID INVENTION.</p>
                    <p>After saying that it was a matter of the first importance that King Alexander
                        should marry and found a dynasty, Count Goluchowski made the following
                        remarkable statement “Servia has only one enemy, and that is neither Austria
                        nor Russia. Everything that has been said or written about Austria’s having
                        come to an agreement with Russia regarding their spheres of influence in the
                        Balkans is a stupid invention. The longer the frontiers are between two
                        States the greater is the friction between them. The frontier between us and
                        Russia is already too long for us to want to stretch it longer. As for
                        defining our respective spheres of interest, however well we two might be
                        pleased to do so, it is impossible without the consent of other parties
                        likewise interested in the matter. Our policy consists in seeing that the
                        Balkan States remain truly independent and well-governed States, with which
                        we can live on good neighbourly terms. We in Austria-Hungary claim no
                        influence over Servia, but neither can we suffer any other great Power to
                        interfere in her internal affairs. Consequently Servia has nothing to fear
                        either from Russia or Austria.”</p>
                    <p>RUSSIA'S HANDS TIED BY CRETE.</p>
                    <p>When M. Georgevitch touched on the subject of the Albanian excesses and
                        inquired if Servia could reckon on the support of the Great Powers to back
                        up her complaints at Constantinople, Goluchowski interrupted him with
                        “Anything but that.” At no price. Russia took on herself to force Prince
                        George on Crete as Governor. To carry this through successfully she is
                        compelled to lend a hand to the Porte in other directions. If Servia now
                        calls on the Great Powers to interfere in this question it is an absolute
                        certainty that Russia will be the first to declare that it is not worth
                        while to create a Macedonian question merely on account of a few ordinary
                        acts of pillage by Albanians.”</p>
                    <p>It is especially curious to read these opinions of Count Goluchowski in 1894
                        by the light of later history.</p>
                    <p>Other chapters of the book dealing with the inner life of the Belgrade Court
                        and with King Alexander’s marriage will be read with special interest.</p>
                    <p>KING MILAN AND QUEEN DRAGA.</p>
                    <p>On learning of the proposed union King Milan wrote to his son as follows :
                        “Dear son, with the best of goodwill I cannot give my consent to the
                        impossible marriage yon contemplate. You must be aware that by what you are
                        doing you are ruining Servia. Our dynasty has gone through many dangers, and
                        survived all, but this is such a terrible blow that you can never recover
                        from it. If, however, your resolve is as you say unalterable, nothing
                        remains for me but to pray to God for my country. I shall be the first to
                        congratulate the Government which hunts you out of Servia after such a mad
                        act.—Your father Milan.”</p>
                    <p>Later on there is a story that King Milan and Alexander being invited to
                        dinner at the German Legation, and Milan learning that Mlle. Draga Maschin
                        was likely to be present, left his carriage in the middle of the street, and
                        only consented to accompany his son on condition of a promise made before
                        the servants that it should be the last time he should ever be made to sit
                        in the same room with her.</p>
                    <p>Immediately after rising from the table, Milan withdrew to the smoking-room
                        and refused to speak to anybody.</p>
                    <p>From this day forth Milan believed that Alexander, seeing an insuperable
                        obstacle to his marriage in his father, planned his death, and the attempt
                        on his life at Belgrade he attributed to his son.</p>
                    <p>When on his deathbed in Vienna, Milan was asked by M. Georgevitch what should
                        be done with all his private and State papers, he answered briefly that he
                        had burned them all a few days previously.</p>
                    <p>On the Minister crying out, “How could your Majesty burn the most important
                        documents for Servian history ?” the dying monarch replied : “For whom,
                        then, should that history be written ? For a people that freely accepted
                        Draga Maschin as Queen ? They are not worthy of it."</p>
