                        <head>THE UPPER NILE SETTLEMENT.</head>
                        <p>Something in the nature of a historical retrospect is necessary in order
                            to appreciate the significance of the settlement which has been arrived
                            at between Great Britain and the Congo Free State with respect to
                            certain disputed territory on the Upper Nile. To understand the causes
                            which have led to the friction between the two Powers it is necessary to
                            go back to 1885, when the Egyptian Government evacuated the Sudan. The
                            precise status of the territory south of Wady Haifa during the period of
                            Muhdist list dominion gave rise to international questions of
                            considerable nicety. Was the suzerainty if the Sultan of Turkey over the
                            Upper Nile basin to be regarded as continuing in spite of the
                            interruption of effective occupation ? Or was the abandoned territory to
                            revert to the condition of “no man’s land” where finding and conquering
                            was keeping 1 The a swers given to these questions were at once
                            inconclusive and conflicting, says the "Morning Post”.</p>
                        <p>In the early Nineties the following was roughly the situation. By the
                            Anglo-German Agreement of 1890 Great Britain acquired as her sphere of
                            influence territories which, in addition to certain districts bordering
                            upon Victoria Nyanza and Lake Albert, virtually included the old
                            Egyptian Equatorial Province. At that time, however, the effective
                            occupation of this territory was out of the question, and the area under
                            direct British control was practically limited to Uganda. Meanwhile
                            other Powers were displaying an unmistakable interest in the valley of
                            the Upper Nile. The forces of the Congo Free State had penetrated to the
                            banks of the river, although the expedition had been forced to retire
                            without securing a permanent footing. It was also becoming increasingly
                            evident that France entertained designs in the same direction. Having
                            declined to recognise the Anglo-German Agreement of 1890, she apparently
                            regarded herself as being at liberty to take possession of any part of
                            the territories concerned which had not been actually occupied. Under
                            these circumstances the position of the Liberal Government was extremely
                            difficult. While reluctant to abandon England’s claim to the control of
                            the Upper Nile, they had to reckon with the fact that the temper of the
                            party would be resolutely <cb n="4"/> opposed to any expenditure of
                            blood or money for the purpose of adding to British territory and
                            British responsibilities. Placed in this dilemma the Cabinet had
                            recourse to a device which at least possessed the merit of ingenuity
                            Their solution of the difficulty lay in the employment of the Congo
                            State as a means of counteracting the ambitions of France. Accordingly
                            under the Anglo-Congolese Agreement of May, 1894, Great Britain leased
                            to King Leopold, a considerable tract of country bounded on the east by
                            the Nile from Lake Albert to Fashoda, on the north by the 10th parallel
                            of North latitude, and on the west by the 25th meridian of East
                            longitude, and on the south by the Congo Nile watershed. A glanoe at the
                            map shows that the area thus described includes the whole of the
                            district known as the Bahr-el-Ghazil. The terms of lease were as follows
                            : The portion of the leas ed territory lying to the W. of the 80th
                            meridian of E. longitude was to be held so long as tie Congo State
                            should remain, as an independent State or a Belgian Colony, under King
                            Leopold and his successors. On the other hand, the lease of the portion
                            lying to the east of the same meridian was to expire on King Leopold’s
                            death. The other provisions of the agreement, which were subsequently
                            cancelled, need not here be noticed. The effect of this arrangement was
                            obvious. In the first place Great Britain secured from the Congo State
                            the recognition of her sphere of influence as determined by the
                            Anglo-German Agreement of 1890; secondly, and most important, she
                            interposed an apparenetly insuperable obstacle between the French sphere
                            and the Nile, inasmuch as the country to the north of the 10th parallel
                            was effectively barred by the Mahdists.</p>
                        <p>France, as might be expected, was not disposed to take this reverse lying
                            down. Moreover, an effective means of asserting hen elf was opportunely
                            to hand. She was at the moment engaged in negotiations with King Leopold
                            with reference to the frontier between the French and Belgian
                            possessions in the Congo Basin. In order, therefore, to obtain a
                            satisfactory settlement of the boundary question the King of the
                            Belgians was compelled in August, 1894, to enter into an agreement with
                            France by which he renounced all right of occupation or influence in
                            that part of the leased territory which lay west and north 5 deg. 30
                            min. North latitude and the 30th parallel of E. longitude. In other
                            words, he practically assigned to France the lease of all the territory
                            comprised in the Anglo Congolese Agreement with the exception of the
                            Lado enclave.</p>
                        <p>The next chapter in the story deals with those relations between France
                            and Great Britain which are centred in the Fashoda affair. In regard to
                            these events, which are still fresh in the minds of most people, it is
                            only necessary to point oat that the claims put forward by France on the
                            strength of her agreement with the Congo Fres State were finally
                            renounced in virtue of the Anglo-French Agreement of March, 1899, by
                            which she recognised inter alia the paramount tights in the Upper Nile
                            Valley acquired by the victors at Omdurman. France having thus retired,
                            the relations between the Congo Free State on the one baud and Great
                            Britain and the Sudan on the other still remained to be cleared up.</p>
                        <p>If the rights in the territories (outside the Lado enclave), which hid
                            been leased to King Leopold under the Anglo-Congolese Agreement of May,
                            1894, had been assigned to France in August of the same year, it might
                            fairly be argued that under the Anglo-French Agreement of 1899 the same
                            rights had been reassigned to Great Britain. In that case the title of
                            the latter as leaseholder would have been merged in her position as
                            freeholder. If that contention has not been put forward by the British
                            Government, it may be that they considered themselves to be estopped by
                            a passage in a despatch written in August, 1898, by the late Lord
                            Salisbury to the British Ambassador in Paris, in which, referring to the
                            Franco-Congolese Agreement of August, 1891, he remarks that “that
                            concession on his [t e, King Leopold’s] part did not diminish the
                            significance of the act as an assertion of her rights by England.” In
                            view of his sentence it may no doubt have been held that the British
                            Government was bound to regard the original lease as still continuing in
                            fall force.</p>
                        <p>Be that as it may, it is highly satisfactory to learn that* the new
                            arrangement between Great Britain and the Congo State has given effect
                            to a settlement which in logic, if not in right. Great Britain had every
                            reason to demand. The point of the agreement, signed, last week by Sir
                            Edward Grey and Baron van Eetvelde, consists, it would seem, in the
                            cancellation of the 1894 lease, not merely in respect of that part of
                            the Bahr-el-Ghszal situated to the west of the 30th meridian of East
                            longitude, but of the whole of the leased area outside the Lado enclave.
                            The last-named district will presumably continue to be held on lease by
                            King Leopold until his death, after which it will automatically to Great
                            Britain.</p>

                        <p>Yesterday we announced that a Greek boy, thirteen years of age, had

                            curious one, He was a pupil at the Averoff School at Alexandria and fell
                            in love with a little Greek girl in the same school, twelve years of
                            age. One day he wrote a love letter to her and entrusted the missive to
                            a girl school friend of his sweetheart, who very properly at once gave
                            it to her teacher. The result was that he was brought up and punished
                            and his father communicated with. The parent in his turn reprimanded the
                            youthful Romeo, who was so filled with remorse that he straightway put

                    <p>The news of the capsizing of a torpedo-boat of the Mediterranean Fleet is,
                        unhappily, confirmed. The information which is at present available is as
                        follows : Torpedo-boats Nos. 63, 46, 83, 47 and the Noby with No. 56, left
                        Port Said lest night, in the wake of H.M.S. Arrogant, Amethyst, and Thetis,
                        bound in the direction of Malta. There was a heavy sea on at the time, and
                        while the flotilla was off Damietta at about 3 o’clock this morning
                        torpedo-boat No. 56, which was being towed by H.M.S. Arrogant, fouled the
                        tow rope in the storm, and capsized in thirty fathoms of water. Of the crew
                        of fifteen, seven were drowned, three of the others being severely injured.
                        The torpedo boat was in command of Lieut. Addison, who is among the
                        rescued.</p>

                    <p>The “Spectator” thinks that, in view of recent developments in our position
                        in Egypt, it is ridiculous that the Sultan should maintain a Turkish High
                        Commissioner in Cairo. While the Imperial Commissioner, Mukhtar Pasha,
                        confined himself to the dignified indolence of a great Turkish official,
                        little harm was done, and we rightly tolerated him as a picturesque
                        anachronism. As long as such anachronisms are not harmful, Englishmen of all
                        kinds obey a very proper instinct in not only leaving them alone, but
                        actually admiring them. When, however, anachronisms become dangerous they
                        mast be removed, and it appears to us that the Turkish High Commissioner has
                        now entered upon this stage,</p>

                        robbing his firm of £2,200, which he had gambled away on the Bourse, has
                        appealed against the sentence and has been sentenced to only six months’
                        imprisonment. The Court considered that his age and hitherto exemplary
                        character justified a reduction of the sentence by half.</p>

                    <dateline>Port Said, Thursday.</dateline>
                    <p>Last Saturday the Titania reached Port Said in a damaged condition, having
                        been run into by the S.S. Cromwell in the Canal at kilometre 127. The latter
                        ship was able, in spite of the severe damage to her hull, to proceed to Suez
                        New plates are being placed in tho Titania, and she will probably be able to
                        proceed to Hull early next week.</p>

                        <p>On Sunday Port Said assumed a lively aspect, crowds being in all the main
                            thoroughfares listening to the different bands. Although few, if any,
                            ever contemplated any other answer to the Ultimatum, yet one could not
                            help noting an under current of excitement. Though probably everyone
                            remarked “just what I told you,” there was no doubt a feeling that the
                            attitude.of Turkey was one which might have caused great unrest among
                            the native populace, more especially in the interior. With three
                            warships in the harbour and others within a day or two’s sail, there was
                            no cause for anxiety here. It was noticed, however, that double guards
                            were placed at the gates to the wharves, and that the police were in
                            greater evidence than usual.</p>

                            Monarch had on board nearly 3,500 troops—this overcrowding her
                            resulting, it was said, in the men having to lie down in batches.</p>

                    <head>HEALTH IN THE SUDAN.</head>
                    <head>A FAVOURABLE REPORT.</head>
                    <p>Dr. Christophen, head of the Civil Medical Department, Sudan Government, in
                        his annual report, say : —</p>
                    <p>The Sudan is not the fever stricken, smallpox ravaged country, into which the
                        Egyptian diseases (Ophthalmie, Bilharzia, and Anchylostoma) are rapidly
                        being introduced, while sleeping sickness is advancing, cholera and plague
                        threatening Port Sudan, and leprosy creeping in from the west What are the
                        facts! There, are five provinces at least which are practically free from
                        the malaria infection— fever cannot originate there—namely, Haifa, Dongola,
                        Berber, Khartoum, and Suakin; and, with the introduction of suitable
                        dwellings and energetic mosquito brigades, other provinces will be freed
                        from malaria. Small-pox shows itself occasionally, bat if the country can be
                        vaccinated throughout, small-pox will disappear. Great advances have been
                        made towards this end daring the last year or two. The carrier of
                        sleeping-sickness has been caught in Sudan territory it is true, but so far
                        not a single case of sleeping-sickness has been imported. Quarantine
                        regulations have been instituted for Port Sudan and for the Sudan generally
                        ; and the arrangements at Haifa have been so far successfal that plague and
                        cholera have been kept out. Egyptian Ophthalmia is decidedly uncommon, and
                        Bilharzia and Anchylostoma, the two principal Egyptian diseases, have not
                        taken hold of the natives to any extent Lastly, the natives are amenable to
                        medical treatment, so that there is little difficulty in carrying out
                        measures for the security of the country against epidemics, so far as active
                        opposition from the people is concerned. The Bahr el Ghazal must be excepted
                        from this general statement,on account of our present want of knowledge of
                        the character of its peoples, and that of the people of the Eastern Sudan,
                        who are also still timid and suspicious. It is satisfactory to know that the
                        natives of the country are gradually, gaining confidence in the hospitals. A
                        native correspondent recently wrote to the “Sudan Times” in the following
                        terms : —</p>
                    <p>"A few years back, the arrival of a medical officer in a village meant a
                        general alarm ; everybody sought a hiding-place. Now, things have changed in
                        such a manner that native patients flock to the hospital to be treated”</p>

                    <head>WHO IS A BEDOUIN?</head>
                    <p>The Government want a satisfactory definition of a Bedouin for the following
                        reason. Ever since the days of Mehemet Ali, the Bedouins have been exempted
                        from the obligation of military service. For many reasons it would be
                        extremely undesirable to take away From them their privilege in this
                        respect, which they prize very highly. A practical difficulty, however, has
                        arisen in deciding who is and who is not a Bedouin. A census of the
                        Bedouinss was made more than half a century ago, but it was originally very
                        imperfect, and is now of little use, because large numbers of Bedouins and
                        their families have come into Egypt since it was made. Moreover, some of the
                        records of this census appear to have been destroyed. Under these
                        circumstances, it was decided, after some lengthy discussions, to accept the
                        certificates of the Omdehs and Sheikhs on the subject of Bedouin origin.
                        There is, however, now reason to suppose that some of these Omdehs and
                        Sheikhs are Riving certificates to persons who have no right to receive
                        them, and, in fact, are making a somewhat lucrative trade by the delivery of
                        certificates. The natter, wbich is one of some difficulty, is now under
                        consideration.</p>

                    <head>DUKE OF CONNAUGHTS VIEWS ON TEMPERANCE.</head>
                    <p>The Duke of Connaught, presiding at the annual meeting of the Army Temperance
                        Association at the Royal United Service Institution last week, said that the
                        War Office recognised the value of the association in improving the work and
                        the morals of the British soldier, and in fitting him for civilian life on
                        leaving the Army. There could be no question as to the superiority of the
                        temperate over the intemperate man. During his tours of inspection he always
                        inquired about ,the temperance of the Army, and was gratified to hear very
                        often the remark, "We don’t drink much here ; we re all right” (hear, hear).
                        This was not good for the canteen, but, then, the canteen did not exist for
                        drinking only, but to enable the men to mess well and cheaply. There were
                        now 49,000 total abstainers in the Army, and when they thought of the small
                        beginnings of the Army Temperance Association they would see that great
                        progress had been made (cheers).</p>
                    <p>Lord Methuen, who supported the Duke, said that he thought the total
                        abstainers were inclined to put their case a little too strongly. If they
                        did that, instead of encouraging temperance they ran the risk of driving the
                        soldier from the canteen to bad company and bad beer outside. He had tried
                        total abstinence for three months, and found it good for the eyes.</p>

                    <head>SERIOUS CASE CURED EVER SINCE JULY, 1903.</head>
                    <p>Mr. J. T. Britten lives at 50, Pleasant Row, Lynn Road, Wisbech, England. He
                        says : —</p>
                    <p>“I’m a bargeman, and get about all over the country on canal barges, but it’s
                        very hard and trying work, especially when the weather is damp and rough.
                        I’ve got a pretty good constitution, but it was too much for me, and brought
                        on an illness from which I never expected to recover.</p>
                    <p>"Some years ago, while working on a canal barge, I was stooping over to
                        fasten up the barge, when my back went ‘crick !’ and a pain for all the
                        world like a stab, darted through me, and for the life of me I could not get
                        upright. I shill never forget it. That was the beginning of it all, and
                        every now and then afterwards I would get these awful pains. They took all
                        the ‘go' out of me. Soon I began to get rheumatic pains, and gradually they
                        increased I in severity until at last I couldn’t move, and bad to be taken
                        to the hospital on the ambulance van. My joints were fairly twisted with the
                        rheumatism, and the urinary system was disordered ; once the water had to be
                        drawn from me with an instrument. I felt so bad in the hospital that I
                        feared I should never see my home again. I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t eat,
                        and in whatever position I lay, I could not rest my poor back.</p>
                    <p>“I’d heard a good deal about Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills,” continues Mr.
                        Britten, and at last I made up my mind that I would try them. They proved to
                        be just the very thing, and I was soon better than I’d ever been since the
                        day I was taken ill. Before long I was able to go to work again, with a
                        strong back and a willing arm. Never since then have I suffered like I used
                        to, although it was right back in July of 1903 that I was cured. Now and
                        then, it’s true, when I’ve had the misfortune to get wet through, I’ve had a
                        slight cold in the kidneys, but a timely dose of Doan’s Backache Kidney
                        Pills has never failed to safeguard me and I wouldn’t like to be without the
                        medicine. I only wish every man and woman who knows what kidney trouble
                        means, knew too, how reliable Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are, and I’m
                        willing to do what I can towards making the pills known far and wide. I have
                        a friend in Doan’s Pills, and Doan’s Pills have a friend in me.”</p>

                        held on April 2nd. Professor Lortet told the story of his researches in
                        greater detail. Some months ago the authorities of the Louvre museums became
                        the possessors of four canopic vases said, to contain the viscera of Ramses.
                        The vases, which are of blue enamel, have on their tides beautifully worked
                        cartouches representing the names and attributes of the famous king. On
                        examining the contents, with the help of Professors Hugounernq, Renaud, and
                        Rigaud, M. Lortet found that three of the vases were filled with fine strips
                        of linen closely stuck together with natron and aromatic resinous
                        substances, reddish in colour, in which probably the stomach, intestine, and
                        liver were wrapped These viscera, however, were represented only by some
                        granular material of indeterminable structure, mixed with a large quantity
                        of natron. The fourth vase, the lid of which was surmounted by a jackal’s
                        head, contained the heart.The organ was transformed into an oval shaped
                        plate, about 8 centimetres in length by 4 in breath. The substance of the
                        heart had become of horny hardness, and in dividing it the saw had to be
                        used ; then, with a razor, sections were made of sufficient fineness to
                        allow of examination with the microscope. In this way it was found that the
                        horny substance was composed of muscular fibres which were perfectly
                        recognizable and word interlaced in bundles, as is the case in the cardiac
                        muscle As this arrangement is not seen in any other part of the body but the
                        tongue, and the latter organ is visible in the mummy of Ramses preserved at
                        Cairo, it was concluded that the material found in the canopic vase was the
                        heart, flattened and transformed into a horny substance owing to its having
                        been embedded in natron for three thousand one hundred and sixty-four years.
                        Notwithstanding this, the observers state that the anatomical structure of
                        the organ, is still excellently well preserved. It is only, we suppose,
                        remarks the “British Medical Journal," to a frivolous mind that any doubts
                        as to the genuineness of the venerable relic could occur. Archaeologists are
                        of course never the dupes of the wily. Oriental, who, with intent to
                        deceive, manufactures all manner of antiquities, from coins to tiaras. We
                        confess, however, that to us it matter little whether the flat horny
                        substance found in an ancient vase by W. Lortet is the heart if one Pharaoh
                        or another. We are therefore not greatly perturbed to learn that, as was
                        inevitable, a German Egyptologist, Professor Blumenthal, believes that the
                        heart is not that of Ramses II,but that of his youngest son by Queen
                        Isinofrit, Khâmiosith. Of that prince nothing seems to be known beyond the
                        fact that he is said to have stolen sacred books from the mummy of an
                        enchanter, for which offence he was haunted by a ghoul. Professor
                        Blumenthal’s argument is that the heart in dispute presents signs of
                        disease. On the other band, Rameses died a centenarian, and an examination
                        of the black granite head of him which is in the Turin Museum, and of his
                        mummy mask, will show that he was of robust health. This seems to be curious
                        reasoning, even fit an archaeologist. Granting that the heart found in the
                        canopic vase shows signs of disease—though no mention of this is made by
                        Professor Lortet—it is surely somewhat what rash to conclude that it cannot
                        have belonged to Rameses II. because his image cut in granite does nop
                        present the facies of cardiac disease. Corvisart is said to have diagnosed
                        heart affection from a portrait, but metaphysical aid would be needed to
                        trace the physiognomical expression pf any disease in a mummy mask. It may
                        be admitted that, a priori, disease of the heart would seem to be more
                        probably in a. young man haunted by a ghoul than m a powerful ruler who
                        lived to be a hundred ; but till proof to the contrary is forthcoming we
                        prefer to believe that the heart is indeed that of Sesostris. To whomsoever
                        it may have belonged, a human heart which beat for the last time more than
                        three thousand years ago, and which is still anatomically recognizable, is
                        an object of great interest. To those who are afflicted with the sceptical
                        spirit we offer the following story by way of comfort. Some time ago the
                        authorities of the Comodie Française had presented to them what purported to
                        be a bone of Molière. After the first outburst of enthusiasm had subsided,
                        some began to hint doubts as to the genuineness of the relic. The situation
                        was becoming unpleasant, when M. Jules Clarétle came to the rescue with the
                        luminous suggestion that the bone should be kept as it might have belonged
                        to Regnard—as who should say, If it is not Shakespeare’s it may be Ben
                        Jenson’s.</p>

                    <head>ON THE UPPER NILE.</head>
                    <head>LONDON PRESS OPINION.</head>
                    <p>While it is satisfactory to learn that a dearer, and, in some respects, an
                        improved working agreement has been arranged on the Upper Nile between
                        England and the Congo State, that stumbling-block, the lease of the Lado
                        Enclave to King Leopold, remains unaltered. Its endurance was covenanted to
                        last daring his reign, and so there is no present way of undoing the
                        mischief wrought by indulgence in spurious sentimentality. But it is a
                        distinct gain, on the o'her hand, that the lease of the remainder of the
                        Bahr el-Ghazal is, if the Brussels correspondent of the “Times” be correctly
                        informed, cancelled by the new arrangement. While it existed/ there was
                        always a likelihood of trespassing, with or without the authorisation of the
                        Congo Government, and on more than one occasion military collisions were
                        only prevented at the last moment. Bat this concession is to be bought at a
                        price, and a pretty stiff one it is, being an undertaking by the Cairo
                        Government to guarantee interest on the cost of constructing a railway from
                        Lado to the Congo State frontier. It is possible that this wilderness-line
                        may eventually create paying traffic, as African railways are wont to do,
                        but there is next to no trade at present, and so far as Egyptian financial
                        interests are concerned, the work certainly presents the character of a very
                        costly white elephant. To guard against future misunderstandings, it should
                        be laid down with all possible clearness and emphasis that England and Egypt
                        are jointly resolved to retain exclusive control of the Nile, both
                        political, military, and commercial, from source to month. There must be no
                        reference of questions raising any matter of that sort to the Hague
                        Tribunal, as is provided in the case of frontier delimitation disputes. (

                        be composed pf influenzal Turks, who will negotiate the creation of a
                        Turkish Embassy at Tokio and a Japanese Embassy at Constantinople. The
                        Turkish mission will include Sir A. B. Thompson, formerly president of a
                        number of Christian societies, who embraced Islamism about five years ago
                        and bps taken the name of Abdorrshman. He has rendered great service to bis
                        new religion as a convert and missionary in India. Abdurrahman is already in
                        Japan in connection with the congress. He has moat minute’y gone into the
                        theological questions regarding japan, and found in favour of Islamism,
                        which he considers far superior to Christianity. He has translated a very
                        important work on the Islamic religion, edited by the Mufti of Java, Seid
                        Osman Olivi, This translation is to be placed before the congress. The
                        Sheik-ul Islam declares that Islamism responds to the religious sentiments
                        of the Japanese and that it is the only religion that will be agreeable to
                        them, because in adoring idols they have a very obscure idea of God, and no
                        belief in the Trinity. Numerous Roman Catholic and Protestant
                        representatives from all countries have signified their intention of

                            rains, thunderstorms (13th, 14th and 18th), freshness (11th and 16th),
                            and heat, (13th and 17th), it has at last settled into Summer Conditions
                            and it may be safely assumed that our long Winter’s “reign” is over.

                            delicate and presently scourged Albizzia Lebbek) is an indubitable sign

                        <head>ARMY OF OCCUPATION v. CAIRO.</head>
                        <p>Played on the K.S.C. ground, Ghezireh, yesterday. Cairo won the toss, but
                            began badly, two wickets falling for 11 runs. Goschen and Campbell added
                            19, when the former fell to a. good lefthanded catch in the slips.
                            Something like a collapse followed, Campbell being the only batsman to
                            meet the bowling with any confidence. He drove and cut well and had
                            rather hard look in getting out through putting a ball that was well up
                            on the oft side into his wickets. Paton and Miller, however, hit freely,
                            and aided by some luck stayed in till lunch, when the score was 93 for
                            seven. After lunch 33 were added, but the last three wickets fell at the
                            same total Yates howled steadily and well and Major Oxley came oat with
                            an excellent analysis The army team did not open too well, losing Rome,
                            whose dismissal was a little doubtful, and Oxley for twenty. Yates and
                            Bostock then got together and began to hit out freely. The former’s off
                            driving was most brilliant and the power and certainty with which he hit
                            everything the least hit over pitched made his innings well worth
                            watching. Bostock also played very good cricket and both batsment
                            speedily demoralised the bowling. With the hundred np both batsmen began
                            to take risks but runs came freely and it was not till the Cairo total
                            had been passed that Bostock was bowled for an excellent fifty six.
                            Yates went on bitting with great vigour and was fifth out, being caught
                            at third man, for exactly a hundred. He was beaten once or twice early
                            in his innings and towards, its dose made some risky strokes in the
                            slips but his innings was none the less very attractive to all but the
                            bowlers. He hit twelve 4’s and nine 3’s, getting most of his runs on the
                            off side. Bircham, Woodcock, and Saunders all hit freely and when stumps
                            were drawn the score was 218 for 6 wickets.</p>
                        <p>The score was 218 for 6 wickets. The Military team fielded very keenly ;
                            the Cairo fielding was fair, with the exception of one player, who did
                            not "apparently realise that nothing demoralises the bowlers and
                            fielders of an out side more than a fieldsman who makes no attempt to
                            stop averagely hard forward strokes and drives. Scores :-</p>

                            other well-known members successfully endeavoured to make the visit an
