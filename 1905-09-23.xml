                    <head>THE BALKAN QUESTION.</head>
                    <p>It was once remarked that the population of the Balkan countries was made up
                        of men with rifles and without ideas, and men with ideas And without rifles,
                        and that the troubles of these unfortunate regions were mainly due to this
                        unequal division of gifts. But now that the idealists have got their rifles
                        too (and excellent rifles they are) the last state—of Macedonia at
                        least—appears to be worse than the first The variety of hostile elements of
                        which the population of any district is com-posed makes common action
                        difficult at the best of times, and impossible as a rule. Propaganda—Greek
                        and Bulgarian, in the first line, Servian and Roumanian in the second-make
                        life a burden to the harmless folk who want to make money and live at peace
                        with their neighbours, while the Albanians and the Moslem element appear
                        from time to time to make a solitude, and announce that quiet has been
                        restored, etc., etc. Meantime British and Continental public opinion, once
                        sympathetic with the Christian elements, is being rapidly estranged, and the
                        opinion somewhat brutally expressed by German papers that the Macedonians
                        should be left to stew in their own juice is gaining ground to an extent
                        that appears amazing to those who remember the horror with which the
                        Armenian massacres and the first attacks on the Bulgarian villages of
                        Northern Macedonia were regarded in Europe. </p>
                    <p>In England the Bulgarian and the Turk unquestionably command more support
                        than any other of the combatants. A strong minority, which holds that the
                        preservation of good relations with the Caliph means everything to England,
                        is pro-Turkish, the majority frankly pro-Bulgarian. The Servians must remain
                        unpopular for yean to come, and Greece, till ten years ago the most popular
                        of the smaller kingdoms in England, has sunk in British esteem. Her failure
                        to any effective resistance to the invading Turk, and still more, her
                        failure to bang any of the persons responsible for the debacle so annoyed
                        the average Briton of intelligence, that he was ready to transfer his
                        sympathies to a more stalwart race which had come with credit out of its
                        wars, and which, if it had no history, did not at all events live on its
                        reputation. "The man in he street” was of course unfair, for, whatever may
                        be said of the Greeks, ingratitude has not been one of their failings, and
                        he would have done well to assure himself that the Bulgarians deserved all
                        the sympathy he lavished on them, and that the Greeks, whose attitude daring
                        the Transvaal war was most friendly throughout, merited, this sadden
                        withdrawal of sympathy. But popularity is almost as shortlived in England as
                        in France—shorter lived perhaps. Next year the “Kutzo-Vlachs” may enjoy the
                        sympathy of the British newspaper reader, and in five years’ time John Ball
                        may have once more turned phil-Hellene. </p>

                    <head>SULTAN OF MOROCCO S EGYPTIAN TROUPE.</head>
                    <p>On this subject "A1 Moayad” writes as follows. </p>
                    <p>Early in April 1904, in the very week of the Anglo French agreement
                        concerning Morocco and Egypt, Moulai Abd-el-Aziz engaged a troupe of singers
                        and dancing women under the charge of Moursi Barakat. At the time we
                        remarked that the political and financial situation of Morocco, and above
                        all the internal condition of the country, made us inclined to doubt the
                        news. But we saw the first-class tickets of the troupe, which, by the way,
                        was not the best that Cairo could produce, and we could only express our
                        hope that its harmonies might aid the Sultan to forget his troubles, and
                        bring about friendly relations between Morocco and Egypt Our hopes, however,
                        were vain, and this cure for political anxiety has evidently not been
                        lasting, for once again Moulai Abd el Aziz has engaged the same troupe, this
                        time to calm the agitation aroused by the Emperor William’s visit to
                        Tangiers, and the arrival of one diplomatic mission after another. </p>
                    <p>The troupe numbers eight persons, as on last year's visit (For the benefit of
                        oar readers we give their names and rôles :—Moursi Barakat, impresario,
                        Badia, prima donna and chief danseuse, Zobeida, eccentric danseuse and
                        comedienne , Zeinab singer and danseuse, Hassan Badri, tenor, Saleh Mohamed,
                        musician, Hassan Ali player of the "oud” and Fangari, chief of the claque.)
                        Even if we can understand the rôle of the first seven members of the troupe
                        it is a little difficult to account for Fangari’s presence, unless the
                        claqueur is summoned to shoot down the protests of M. St Réné Taillandier,
                        or to keep Count von Tattenbach in order. </p>

                    <head>NOTES FROM PORT SAID.</head>
                    <head>CHATHAM TO BE BLOWN UP.</head>
                    <p>(From our Correspondent.) </p>
                    <p>Port Said, Friday. The M.M. Salazie arrived at dawn to-day, having on board
                        M. Tillier, the Chef du Transit, who comes specially to take the chair and
                        direct matters in connection with the unfortunate Chatham incident. Soon
                        after his disem-barcation, a consultation was held at which the heads of
                        Canal Co’s departments assisted. Mr. Harris the special representative of
                        Nobell’s factory was also present, and I understand a decision was arrived
                        at which will become public property very shortly. </p>
                    <p>On Wednesday after the party had returned from the Chatham, a lengthy meeting
                        was held in the Chief Engineer’s office, but no final decision leaked out,
                        nor has any done so, so far, to-day. </p>
                    <p>The position of the vessel is the same practically as it was when last I sent
                        notes on the subject except that she is settling down more or less. All
                        sorts of preparations have been made, and from the appearance of things I
                        would not be surprised to bear of something important very soon, when I will
                        communicate with yon. </p>
                    <p>Later. </p>
                    <p>From what I learn from various sources I believe it is finally decided to
                        blow the vessel up some time next week, and looking at things from a general
                        point of view, although the actual date is not known, my opinion is it will
                        not occur until after the passage of the Brindisi mail boat </p>
                    <p>(By Telegraph) </p>
                    <p>Saturday, 9.30 a.m. Yesterday’s meeting of the commission of experts in
                        consultation with the heads of the various departments of the Canal Company,
                        finally decided that it would be necessary to blow up the Chatham. I
                        understand that the explosion will not take place till Thursday, in order to
                        let the Caledonia pass safely through with the mails, for India and
                        Australia . A deviation in the fresh water canal is now being constructed as
                        rapidly as possible with a view to minimise the danger to Port Said’s water
                        supply. The explosion will be effected by means of electricity and troops
                        have been ordered up from Cairo. </p>
                    <p>The blowing up of the Chatham with a cargo of probably more than 100 tons of
                        dynamite, will constitute a world’s record in the history of dynamite
                        explosions. The last record was created at Aboukir, near Alexandria, on the
                        1st June of the present year, when sixteen and a half tons of dynamite were
                        exploded by Mr. Harris under the orders of the Municipality. No one oau have
                        any conception as to what the force of such an explosion can be ; its
                        consequences may be grave, and it is impossible to say where they will end. </p>
                    <p>The S.S. Chatham lies about nine miles from Port Said and though perhaps no
                        serious damage will result to the town itself, it is safe to prophecy that a
                        severe shock will be felt, and that windows will be broken, whilst we should
                        imagine that it is quite possible that some of the flimsily built native
                        houses may be damaged. The railway line is in close proximity to the sunken
                        vessel, the rails will probably be loosened, and traffic temporarily
                        suspended. Beyond the damage which will be done to the canal itself, the
                        moat important question to be considered is the danger to the fresh water
                        canal from which Port Said draws the whole of its water supply. The Canal
                        Company is indeed making every effort to avert, or at any rate minimise,
                        this danger by cutting a deviation, but it is almost too much to hope that
                        the fresh water canal will escape destruction at this point, though the work
                        of repair will be much more quickly accomplished than in the case of the
                        maritime canal, and it is to hoped that should Port Said be deprived of
                        fresh water it will only be for a short time. </p>
                    <p>As regards the effect of the explosion on the ship canal, it is impossible to
                        estimate the extent of the damage. The banks will be blown to pieces for a
                        considerable distance and the canal will, we imagine, be entirely blocked
                        for some three weeks at the least, This will involve the accumulation of 150
                        vessels or more at either end of the canal, and the loss to trade can well
                        be imagined, for not only will the shipping firms suffer, but those who are
                        awaiting the arrival of cargoes. The mails most, of course, be delayed for
                        as short a time as possible and we suppose that arrangements will be made,
                        whereby they will be conveyed from Port Said to Suez, and vice-versa, by
                        rail, and there re-shipped by other vessels at either end. </p>

                        subscriptions having amounted to a very considerable sum, not only from the
                        sale of tickets, but by money-gifts from various residents. The entire

                    <p>Constantinople, September 18. H. H. the Khedive while at Vienna paid a visit
                        to the celebrated choral society of Vienna. The president and committee
                        thanked the Khedive most heartily for the honor he had done them, and his
                        Highness replied with a brief extempore speech in which he praised the
                        artistic abilities of the choral society, and particularly mentioned the
                        excellent impression they had left in Egypt- The Khedive then visited the
                        society's museum, which contains a cup presented by the King of Hanover,
                        medals given by Napoleon III., the looks of Mozart's hair, and autograph
                        letters of Weber, Wagner, Meyerbeer, Johann Strauss, and many other famous
                        musicians. On leaving he promised to visit the choral society whenever be
                        passed through Vienna. </p>

                        Greek builders, MM. Stamatiades, Righinos, and Brontisi. The new line will

                        displacing 2,500 tons, to the company's fleet. Meantime M. Giovannidis’ new

                        <head>TEA AND TRAVEL</head>
                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette. </p>
                        <p>Sir, — Having considerable experience of ocean travel in different parts
                            of the world, a recent journey home has served to put life into an old
                            grievance, on which I take the liberty of addressing yon. </p>
                        <p>One hears from time to time of the waning popularity of this or that line
                            of passenger steamers, and confident that the directors of such lines
                            have the interests of their shareholders at heart, I make the following
                            suggestions which if carried out, will, I think, tend to their
                            reinstatement in the public favour. </p>
                        <p>In brief, Sir, I recommend that a speciality be made of the tea served to
                            passengers. </p>
                        <p>After one’s morning tub and in the afternoons could one depend upon a cup
                            of good tea daintily served what a boon, it would be ! </p>
                        <p>How popular such a line would become with the fair sex. The harsh memory
                            of many a rough passage would be softened by the reflection "But they
                            did give us delicious tea !” </p>
                        <p>A cow or cows should be carried or, failing that, the best brands of

                    <head>THE ARMY AND ITS UNIFORM.</head>
                    <p>Mr. J.H.M. Abbott, writing in the “Spectator” on “How it Strikes an
                        Australian,” says that the English Army on a peace footing seems to be
                        maintained almost wholly with an idea of teaching the people of England that
                        there really is such a thing as the “pomp and circumstance of war.” War is a
                        mean business, to be got over as soon as may be —-despite the old barbaric
                        fascination of taking part in itaud it is all business. The modern soldier
                        must have two essential attributes : he must shoot straight, and he must
                        endure. His courage, of course, is taken for granted ; and indeed it is a
                        pleasant thing to believe that there are not many real cowards in the ranks
                        of humanity. But he must be able to take punishment, and he must be
                        tolerably sure of killing his man at least five hundred yards away. </p>
                    <p>The aspect of the English Army in peace conveys no suggestion of either of
                        these absolutely necessary qualifications in the soldier. It rather gives
                        the possible recruit an impression that his first duty lies towards his
                        clothing. The system goes to unnecessary expense in making him into a
                        theatrical person most useful for ceremonial occasions, whilst it stints his
                        pay, pares down his pension, and is niggardly with the practice ammunition
                        which he needs in order to qualify as a good shot. But it makes him the
                        glory of the housemaid, and the soldier of the nurse-girl’s ideals. And that
                        seems to be the reason why it hopes he will enlist </p>
                    <p>It is hard to believe that the two metal-clad mounted man with the foolish
                        uniforms who dwell in the little stone boxes in Whitehall, or the top-heavy
                        redcoats who mount guard outside Buckingham Palace, can appear other than
                        absurd and anomalous to any one except children. But it is unfortunately the
                        case, one cannot help realising, that to the vast majority of Londoners, at
                        any rate, they typify all that is soldierly, and all that is necessary for
                        the security of the Empire. </p>
                    <p>And it is this idea, infinitely more than the conservatism of the War Office,
                        that retards the reformation of the British Army, and has caused it to
                        become what from the quality of its material it should never be—a jest and a
                        byword. </p>

                    <head>ROMAN VILLAGE DISCOVERED.</head>
                    <p>Recent excavations at the Little Wellington Wood, near Watch field, Berks,
                        have revealed traces of an old Roman village. A well, fifteen feet in depth,
                        containing many interesting pieces of pottery and valuable coins, has been
                        cleared of the earth which has for many centuries hidden all trace of what
                        was, at the end of the third century, a source of water supply to many
                        habitations. </p>
                    <p>The coins, 24 of which have been found, are mostly of the time of the Emperor
                        Alectus. He had been a general of the Emperor Carau-gius, and on the
                        strength of his position in Britain, then a very important province, had
                        made good his claim to a share in the Empire. Allectus murdered Caransius,
                        A. D. 293, and assumed the title of Emperor of Rome. </p>
                    <p>After a struggle of three years against the General Constantins Chlorus, whom
                        Domitian had sent over from Rome, Allectus fell in battle A. D. 296.
                        Constantins himself became Emperor eventually, and was succeeded by his son,
                        Constantine the Great, who accompanied him in this important British
                        campaign. </p>

                    <head>THE LADY AND THE TELEPHONE.</head>
                    <p>The lady and the telephone have been so Intimately connected in recent
                        history that one hears with something of a pang of the threatened severance
                        of the association in America, where the State of Pennsylvania is
                        experimenting with “girlless telephone ex changes.” Yet the regret is
                        probably more sentimental than founded on reason. The girlful telephone
                        exchange has not, on the whole, been a complete success. The girl, as a
                        vehicle of business, is subject to certain defects of temper and utterance
                        which, in post-offices and tea-shops, are partly compensated for by her more
                        decorative appear ance—an asset which counts for nothing in the mysterious
                        recesses of Gerrard and Central. The voice, after all, is not the most
                        potent of feminine charms, and the exigencies of the telephone girl’s
                        calling naturally induce a shrillness which few persons since Shakespeare
                        have thought an excellent thing in woman. Man, for his part, is at the
                        disadvantage that it is not easy to be chivalrous to a lady whom yon cannot
                        see, whose age and condition you do not know, and of whose character you can
                        only guess, from varied experience, that she possesses a sense of humour
                        much beyond the feminine average. The telephone operator, therefore, has
                        none of the emollient, educative, brightening influence which it is the

                    <p>There has just been discovered at Whitby, his birthplace, a relic of one of
                        Captain Cook’s voyages, in the shape of a hog’s tusk, mounted with a piece
                        of bell metal. Round the ferrule is engraved the following inscription: A
                        boar’s tusk, brought from the Sandwich Islands, 1773, by one of Captain
                        Cook’s men.” On the top of the ferrule are the words, “Bell metal from York
                        Minister, burnt May 20, 1840.” </p>

                    <p>A GREAT DETECTIVE.</p>
                    <p>One of the Paris papers states that Vidocq was a myth, or, rather, that he
                        had never been chief of the Sûreté, Géneralé. This statement on the eve of
                        the production of a Vidocq play, by Emile Bergerat, in Paris, aroused a
                        storm of protest, and as, after all, it is less than a century since Vidocq
                        lived, proof of his official position has not been diffi cult to find. He
                        was chief of the Brigade de la Sûreté for fifteen years, from 1812 to 1827,
                        and then retired, mainly, no doubt, because of the jealousy of Coco Lacour,
                        his pupil who, coveting Vidocq’8 position, ousted him from it and became his
                        successor. Vidocq was a detective of the Gaborian school A huge man, of
                        enormous strength, he had as many wild adven tures as the hero of a penny
                        dreadful and looked, with his bright blue eyes and head of long curly hair,
                        like one of Byron’s heroes. In repose his face was stern, but he was a
                        master of expression, and could compel his features to assume a look of
                        bonhomie which was frequently useful to him in his chats with criminals. And
                        he knew almost every criminal in France. He had lived their life, and knew
                        their ways. </p>
                    <p>He had been in his time a mountebank, a lawyer’s clerk, a plumber, and a
                        soldier ; he had been a wandering pedlar and a smuggler ; and though it was
                        afterwards said, and legally proved, that he had been sentenced for a crime
                        which he had not committed, Vidocq had known life at the galleys and the
                        inside of many prison cells. He died in poverty at the age of 82. Modern
                        chiefs of the Sûreté Générale have very different methods. Vidocq relied
                        largely upon personal activity and cleverness in disguise, while M. Hamard
                        and his immediate predecessors catch, when they do catch, their law-breakers
                        by system. The detective of to-day is a man of science. In his work so
                        little is left to chance that there would remain no undiscovered crime were
                        there not one small hitch. The modern criminal has become scientific too.

                    <head>EGYPTIAN MINES.</head>
                    <p>Highly encouraging developments are taking place in the Semna nine of the
                        Fatira Company—an offshoot of the Egyptian Mines Exploration Company. In the
                        No. 1 shaft, driving east at the 75 ft. level, some extremely good values
                        have been obtained, the reef over the last 23 ft. of driving assaying 2ozs.
                        2 dwts. for a width of 6 ft. Developments in No. 2 shaft are equally
                        promising, the vein at 23fr. giving assays of 5 ozs. 10 dwts. over 3 ft.,
                        and at 43 ft. 3 ozs. 16 dwts. over 43 ins. In view of these important
                        results, No. 3 shaft is being sank with all speed. As far as the Semna mine
                        is concerned, therefore, says Financier, the theory that the generally of
                        Egyptian lodes are too narrow to prove payable would seem to be exploded.
                        This mine, by the way, is only one iron the parent company has in the fire,
                        its interest in the producing Um Rus being considerable. No small wonder
                        bayers are being attracted by the present low price of the shares. </p>

                    <p>There has been a fair demand for Egyptian Cotton this week, but owing to the

                    <p>American Futures: The Market this weak has again been fairly active, bat
                        prices have continued to decline, the near positions being especially
                        pressed for sale ; at one moment the fall amounted to 8 @ 14 points, but
                        there has since been some recovery, and to-day’s closing rates are only 4 @
                        5 points below those of last Thursday. The decline is chiefly due to an
                        increase of pessimistic sentiment, to continued favorable crop condition,
                        and free offerings from the south ; and the recovery was simply a reaction
                        from the recent depression. We are under the impression that in the
                        immediate future the market is likely to fluctuate round about present

                    <p>Until kidney disease has reached a serious stage, it seldom gives any more
                        serious a warning than a pain or dull ache in the back, urinary disorders,
                        rheumatic pains, imparity of the blood, dropsical swellings, dizzy spells,
                        or irregular heart This is the reason it is so generally fatal for often the
                        sufferer does not know these warnings are signs of kidney disorder. </p>
                    <p>Recognising the great need of a medicine that would act on the kidneys alone,
                        without weakening the system by affecting the bowels, James Doan devoted
                        many years of his life to the study of this subject, and the perfection of
                        his Doan's Backache Kidney Pills. This medicine is made from pure vegetable
                        roots and herbs which act on the kidneys only. Doan’s Pills are special
                        kidney help. When a cold, misuse of beer, spirits and tea, or any other
                        cause, pats extra work on the kidneys, Doan’s Pills give the additional help
                        needed ; when the delicate kidney tissue is weakened or clogged, Doan’ Pills
                        strengthen and cleanse it; when the. bladder-walls and urinary passages are
                        inflamed and coated with imparities, Doan’s Pills allay the irritation and
                        remove the cause, by driving out the clogging poisons. The genuine Doan’s
                        Backache Kidney Pills cure not only the disorder, but the cause; they give
                        tone to the kidneys themselves, by taking them just the constituent parts
                        necessary to rebuild them back to their natural strength. </p>
                    <p>Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are for sale by all chemists and druggists at

                        tastefully furnished homes. It is made in 70 artistic tints, and only
                        requires the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is quickly and
                        easily applied with a whitewash brush, with half the labour and at one third
                        the cost of paint. HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures cleanliness, and is pleasing to
                        the eye. It appeals alike to artistic and practical house decoration. HALL’S
                        DISTEMPER is of special value in hot climates. Owing to its cool, pleasing
                        colours, great weather-resisting and germ-destroying properties, it lends
                        itself to every kind of wall, wood, brick or stone coating, possessing all
                        the advantages of paint, colour- wash, and disinfectant at one third the
                        cost of oil paint. It never blisters in the hottest sun, and the fact that
                        it can be washed adds greatly to its sanitary advantages.</p>

                    <head>JAPANESE PEACE DISTURBANCES.</head>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">“Times.”</hi></p>
                    <p>The first outburst of excited indignation, that greeted the peace terms (in
                        Japan) is giving place to a businesslike consideration of the future.
                        Denunciation of the treaty and, even overt demonstrations have not ceased,
                        but the bulk of the nation seems to have turned its back upon disorder, as
                        we were confident from the first it would. The amount of strong feeling
                        which still exists shows the strains that the Japanese have just gone,
                        through, and does all the more honor to the, self-control and farsightedness
                        which have enabled the majority to triumph over the first pangs of
                        disappointment The remaining discontent may be expected to subside as soon
                        as the people turn their hands to the work which is waiting for them </p>
                    <p>The first section of the Japanese nation to grasp the vast opportunities
                        which peace has brought within range is, naturally enough, the business
                        community. A piece of intelligence is reported to day which is in the
                        highest degree significant of the future. A great trade combination,
                        representing eighty-one firms, and headed by the Japanese capitalist Mr.
                        Iwade, has been formed for the promotion of Japan’s industries and the
                        expansion of her foreign trade. Here, then, we have the first big movement
                        to take advantage of the opportunities afforded by the peace. </p>

                    <p>Even during the war the industries of Japan have hardly been prejudicially
                        affected, and the output of the mills has not diminished. Commercial
                        enterprise, of course, in that country is still in its infancy, but the rate
                        of progress has been most remarkable, and if the required capital is
                        forthcoming—as it readily will be now that the Japanese Government are
                        relaxing the stringent precautions designed to prevent the dominance of
                        foreign money—the exports of Japan are likely to show some astonishing
                        increases in the next five years. That Japan will be a formidable competitor
                        is being realised by many of the American newspapers, which are beginning to
                        give economic interpretations to the phrase “Yellow Peril,” and also by the
                        British manufacturers trading with the Far East But, doubtless, Japan will
                        have her own industrial difficulties, like every other country has—checks
                        which had already begun to manifest themselves when the war came to absorb
                        the nation’s full attention. These may somewhat retard the development of
                        which Count Katsura spoke, but the prognostics are that it will still be as
                        rapid as was her rise to political greatness. </p>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">"Evening Standard.”</hi></p>
                    <p>Japan is not given to letting the grass grow under its feet Hardly has the
                        war been ended when it begins the reaping of the consequences —a reaping
                        which (to lapse into an Irishism) means the sowing of commercial
                        possibilities. Count Kataura, the Premier, has been impressing on the
                        provincial governors the importance of directing the national energy so as
                        to effect an economic expansion and development commensurate with the
                        nation’s victories. Judging from a “Times” report, the business community is
                        carrying out the advice before it is well given. A trade combination,
                        representing eighty-one firms and headed by the Japanese capitalist Mr.
                        Iwade, has been formed for the promotion of Japan’s industries and the
                        expansion of her foreign trade. The opportunities before such a combination
                        are immense, but the feature which strikes us most is the promptitude with
                        which the scheme has sprung into being. It must have been formulated before
                        the war was over, and no doubt will be in full working order ere the armies
                        have been withdrawn. Time is precious to the Japanese. England shows an
                        Oriental lassitude by comparison </p>

                    <p>Some of the finest markets in the world lie close to the threshold of
                        enterprising Nippon that of China itself offer, amount of profitable
                        business to a manufact-ring nation almost conterminous in geographical
                        position. Here, then, and also on a smaller scale in Korea, Japan can, as
                        soon as her resources are fully developed by the powerful financial

                        the Western nations with almost every advantage in her favor. That is the
                        direction to which Count Kataura points as the sure road to a victory, not
                        less desirable, in its way, than that accomplished during the last twenty
                        months by armed force. Happily, the provin-cial governors may be safely
                        depended on to bring to a quick ending the underground schemes of party
                        politicians. </p>

                    <head>THE SCANDINAVIAN CRISIS.</head>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">“Daily News”.</hi></p>
                    <p>It is often urged that the aspirations of the small nations threaten the
                        peace of Europe. To a dialectician like Mr. Balfour, “the balance of
                        criminality” rests, not with the Turkish op-pressor, but with the Macedonian
                        revolutionary The time is, however, fast coming when this strange contention
                        will have to be not only revised, but reversed. At present, statesmen are
                        deliberately contending against a natural law which they ought to recognise
                        and obey. The result is trouble, anxiety, and a danger of bloodshed. But we
                        may take it as certain that an autonomous Europe, governed in accordance
                        with natural law, would be a peaceful Europe and a Europe ready for
                        disarmament. We say this because autonomy is the first step towards
                        confederation. If only Sweden would drop her notions of pre-eminence and
                        would frankly concede absolute independence to Norway, we should be within
                        measurable distance of a close Scandinavian alliance. But each an alliance
                        or confederation can never come about while one party to it is suspected of
                        desiring to claim some especial prerogative over the other. </p>
                    <p><hi rend="bold"> "Standard.”</hi></p>
                    <p>Whatever be the value to one party, or the danger to the other, of
                        Frederikstein, we cannot believe that a single fortress, however old, or
                        however new, can be worth the risk of a rupture. Not since Hamlet the Dane
                        moralised over the proceedings of Fortinbras the Norwegian has there seemed
                        a more inadequate cause for plunging two nations into war. Are men to be
                        asked to "go to their graves like beds,” and shed the blood of their
                        brothers for this fragment of earth and stone ? The idea is insulting to the
                        intelligence and humanity of the Scandinavian peoples, and frankly we must
                        say that they will disgrace themselves in the eyes of the world if they are
                        going to 'find quarrel in a straw” in this fashion. </p>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">Chronicle.</hi></p>
                    <p>Sweden says "Pull down your fortresses because they are aimed at us.” Norway
                        replies, we suppose, "Not so; they stand in self-defence.” To which Sweden’s
                        rejoinder should be, it seems, “Very well, then; to prove our good faith, we
                        shall readily agree to a treaty of universal and compulsory arbitration.” If
                        this rejoinder be made, Norway would have some difficulty, we think, in
                        resisting the demand for the demolition of the new fortresses. </p>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">“Westminster Gazette.”</hi></p>
                    <p>The relations between Sweden and Norway are still in a critical state, and no
                        way out of the frontier fort difficulty seems to have been discovered as yet
                        As we rather thought might be the case, it happens that the question turns
                        on the new part of the old forts. Norway is willing to demolish forts which
                        are wholly new; Sweden does not ask for the demolition of those which are
                        entirely old. But what of the forts (such as Fredricksten and Kongavinger)
                        which are partly new and partly old? A Norwegian correspondent writes to us
                        this morning as to these two forts </p>
                    <p>They were modernised in 1895, when certain other smaller works were built,
                        all of which are within the neutral, rone proposed by Sweden. The whole of
                        the work, it should be remembered, was sanctioned by the Union King, and,
                        obviously, could not then have been regarded by him and his Swedish advisers
                        as a threat from one of his kingdoms towards the other. They are all, as an
                        indisputable fact, of a purely defensive character, and were intended as
                        links in a concerted scheme for the defence, by the two nations, of the
                        Scandinavian peninsula. The Swedes now affect to believe that they
                        constitute a direct threat towards themselves. As defences the forts can be
                        no threat to Sweden now any more than they were in 1895 ; as bases for a
                        Norwegian attack on Sweden they are worse than useless, even assuming the
                        possibility of such an attack by the weaker country, which, however, no
                        thinking man in Norway or Sweden for a moment admits. </p>
                    <p>It is satisfactory to find that both sides still agree that the question
                        ought to be capable of amicable adjustment, but none the less very grave
                        danger would attend any considerable prolongation of the present situation. </p>

                    <p>The “Dagblad” in an article headed “Foreign Mediation,” says it appears as if
                        Sweden will refuse both arbitration and mediation. As regards Norway,
                        nothing in her attitude, saythe journal, can be interpreted as indicating a
                        refusal on her part to consider arbitration or mediation. Nobel’s ideal of
                        peace has animated Norway to such an extent that they would confidently
                        accept either. </p>

                    <head>KISHENEFF.</head>
                    <p>Kisheneff is the capital of Bessarabia, a Russian province bordering upon
                        Hungary. We reached it by a branch railway line tram a small station on the
                        direct route between Odessa and Kieff. From the train windows we could see
                        that the physical attractions of Bessarabia were far greater than those of
                        the Odessa district Here the ground, no longer steppe, broke into gentle
                        undulations, which were enlivened from time to time by gurgling streams
                        crossed by rustic bridges, and country lanes that reminded one of beautiful
                        Surrey. The cottages, thatched neatly with straw, and standing in pretty
                        gardens surrounded by hedges, had a decided look of prosperity and comfort;
                        their walls were whitewashed, and their window-frames and doors painted
                        bright red, or blue, or green, according to the taste of the owners, and
                        sometimes all three colours were combined. In the distance we could see blue
                        hills, thè fore runners of the Carpathian mountains. The air was mild and
                        balmy, a delight after, the rawness of Odessa. </p>
                    <p>The town of Kisheneff is by no means be-witching. One is struck first of all
                        by the enormous space it covers, and by the width of its dirty streets, and
                        then by the shabby and dejected look of its low, seldom more than
                        two-storied, houses. There are a few streets with five houses and some large
                        public buildings, but these are only to be seen in the centre of the town.
                        The houses are of stone,and look, for the most part, like rows of shabby
                        bungalows. The shops, with one or two exceptions, are quite second-rate, and
                        were one and all in the hands of low-class Bessarabian Jews until 1903,when,
                        for the first time, a first-class Russian business house was opened there. </p>
                    <p>It was as much our interest in the children of Israel as any other motive,
                        that led us to Kisheneff, and we were anxious to see and talk with some of
                        them. English people are apt to forget that there are as many classes of
                        society among the Jews of Russia as there are among ourselves in Great
                        Britain, and they also forget that even in Russia the Jews, though-all of
                        one race, are of many different nationalities. Even at Kisheneff, where
                        these people have suffered so much, many of the most respected citizens are
                        Jews, who are loyal to Russia as the country of their birth, and, the same
                        time, loyal to their own race. Some of the most distinguished lawyers,
                        doctors, and merchants of Bessarabia are Jews. These men know well that it
                        was as untrue that the atrocities which horrified the world were sanctioned
                        by the Russians as a people, as it is untrue that the American people
                        lynches its negroes and burns them at the stake. </p>
                    <p>We stayed at a hotel kept by a Jew. Many of the window-panes had been smashed
                        at the time of the attack on the Jews, and had not been replaced by new
                        ones, so for once we slept in a well-ventilated room. The next day we took a
                        drive through the lowest part of the town, which is known by the name of
                        "the old bazaar,” and were surprised to find Jews, Russians, dogs, and pigs
                        all mixed up together in amicable muddiness. I had expected to find the Jews
                        in a sort of ghetto apart. As a matter of fact Kishen-eff is mainly a Jewish
                        town, with a few Russian officials, and a few public buildings in its
                        centre, just as Warsaw is a Polish town, with Russian policemen keeping
                        order in the streets. The mud in the bazaar must be like pea soup in wet
                        weather, but it was dry on the day of our visit, and we found loaves of
                        bread, vegetables, and other articles of food exposed for sale on bits of
                        dirty matting. On all sides of ns were Jewish faces. The young girls were so
                        handsome that I could hardly take my eyes off them ; they had crisply
                        furling brown hair, good, well-defined features, clear complexions,
                        expressive dark eyes, and long black eyelashes. The boys had the same pretty
                        curling hair as the girls, only that it was short and bushy. Many Jewish
                        houses are built round one court, with a single entrance; this style of
                        architecture is adopted for the sake of the security it affords. Students of
                        Old London tell us that houses there were always built in that way during
                        the Middle Ages, as it was not safe to live in houses built otherwise. </p>
                    <p>Later in the day I entered a shop opposite our hotel to buy some picture
                        postcards. The young woman behind the counter was a Jewess. She saw that I
                        was a foreigner, and was very anxious to know my nationality, and the reason
                        of my visit to Kish- eneff. ’The poor creature was afflicted with a terrible
                        squint, and so was her father, who came in presently. They conversed
                        together in a gibberish of low German, which I understood perfectly. When
                        she heard I was English the girl asked :-- </p>
                    <p>“Do they kill the Jews in England ?” </p>
                    <p>"Kill them !” 1 answered ; "I should think not, indeed!” </p>
                    <p>"Do they beat the Jews in " England !” she asked, fiercely. </p>
                    <p>“Of course not,” I replied. “Some of the best men in our country are Jews. I
                        should like to see them being beaten!” </p>
                    <p>"Well, they beat them-and kill them here,” she cried, or, rather, hissed, and
                        her dark eyes flashed. </p>
                    <p>"Surely none but a very low class of people would do such a wicked thing was
                        my tentative rejoinder. </p>
                    <p>"No, indeed. All classes join in ill-treating the Jews ;'doctors join the
                        mob, students— everybody." </p>
                    <p>"Were you here when they did it ?" I asked. </p>
                    <p>"Yes ; they went first to one shop, and to another.” - </p>
                    <p>"It is very terrible," I replied; and as I looked at the girl I felt how much
                        she must have suffered, and wondered whether she, too, would end by joining
                        the Nihilists, like so many of her sisters. Twenty years ago it was an
                        acknowledged foot that there were ten times as many Jews among the ranks of
                        Nihilism as there were Russians, Poles, or-Germans. "The Jewish women in
                        particular,” wrote Tissot, in 1882, "bring a concentrated energy, a cold
                        determination, to bear on their acts of revolution that recall the Judith of
                        the Apocrypha.” The same writer was of the opinion that the majority of
                        these Judiths came from Little and New Russia, where the cornfields wave
                        like the sea, where the blood is warm.” Yes, I felt that the young woman bad
                        reason to be' indignant, and I did not think it was for me—a foreigner -—to
                        remind her that there are two sides to every question, and that the fearful
                        massacres, which no Russian worthy of the name had ever wished to justify,
                        were the outcome of evils that been growing for more than one decade. I did
                        not speak to her of the class of Jews who had settled, like vampires, year
                        after year, upon the poor, lazy, ignorant peasant, who, having got hold of
                        the capital, had enticed them into their liquor hells (till the Government
                        stopped it), lent them money, and ruined them by the thousand. </p>
                    <p>Presently the girl said, "Do you know any Hebrew ? It is Hebrew, the language
                        of our race, that my father and I have just been talking.” </p>
                    <p>"Really,” I replied, trying to look dubious; "it is remarkably like German.” </p>
                    <p>"You are right,” she replied : and yon would find Hebrew very easy if you
                        knew German. There are so many words common to both languages.” </p>
                    <p>I told her that I did not think that was the case with the pure Hebrew of the
                        Scriptures, at which she simply shrugged her shoulders. While we were
                        talking it had interested me to see her brother, who was also afflicted with
                        the family squint, enter quietly, and listen with quivering interest to
                        every word that passed. I left that shop with a feeling of greater sympathy
                        with the Hebrew race than ever. Russia must not drive her Jews away, nor
                        must she hinder their advance, or turn them into Nihilists. They are a
                        necessary element to her own prosperity. They are like a sharp tool,
                        indispensable to the skilled workman, but ready to out like a razor if not
                        handled properly. Take away the Jews from Kisheneff, and the town will cease
                        to exist Help them to prosper and the town and its government will become
                        one of the most flourishing spots in the empire. </p>
                    <p>Kisheneff is the fortunate possessor of some fine sulphur springs, and steps
                        have already been taken towards the erection, in their neighbourhood, of a
                        handsome sanatorium. A new museum of archeology, built in the Moorish style,
                        was opened in the autumn of 1904, and other public buildings are in course
                        of erection. The climate alone is attracting more Russian residents every
                        year, and if only the Jews are treated properly, the good fortune of
                        Kisheneff will certainly be assured. </p>

                    <p>London, September 15. Captain M. J. Hamilton, Lancashire Fusi-lier, has been
                        seconded for service with the Khedive's Army. He has worn the bushy for a
                        little over six years, and commanded a company for almost the past two years </p>
                    <p>Lieutenant J.B. -Jenkinson, 2nd Battalion Rifle Brigade, who recently was
                        appointed adjutant of the Mounted Infantry in Egypt, is a smart young
                        officer of five years’ service. He had considerable experience of mounted
                        infantry work at Aldershot -He has been seconded whilst so employed. </p>
                    <p>The Army Council has derided, that if a Regimental major specially selected
                        for appointment as second in command, has not, at the time of such
                        appointment, completed two years service as a substantive major, he shall
                        nevertheless be entitled, from the 27th July, 1905, or from his appointment
                        if subsequent to that date, to pay at the higher rates allowed by-
                        regulation to substantive majors of Cavalry and Infantry after two years
                        service in that rank. </p>
                    <p>It has been decided to issue the new short service rifle to Royal Horae
                        Artillery and Royal Field Artillery batteries in the proportion; of five
                        rifles to each brigade headquarters, 48 rifles to each battery,and one rifle
                        per gunner in each ammunition column and park. </p>
                    <p>Advices from the. Mediterranean Fleet state that H.M.S. Bulwark, flagship of
                        Lord Charles Beresford, made excellent practice during the recent gunlayers’
                        competition off Valetta with the 12 inch guns The fore turret gun made eight
                        hits out of thirteen rounds, and the after turret gun nine hits out of ten
                        rounds a total of seventeen hits out of twenty-three rounds. The flagship
                        also did well in the 6-inch gun competition, scoring 78 hits out of 103
                        rounds. This is the best record of the fleet. Our foreoast that Lord Charles
                        would pull up the gunnery of the squadron, or know the reason why, was
                        perfectly correct. </p>
                    <p>The storeship Wye was paid out of commission this week at Sheerness, and
                        placed on the sale list. The Wye was purchased during the Ashanti War, and
                        was since employed in running to the West Coast and Ascension Island. As she
                        is of no fighting value she will be sold all standing-without mutilation of
                        her machinery. * </p>
                    <p>It has been calculated that the Wye steamed half a million of miles in the
                        past thirty years. During the Ashanti War she carried stores to the West
                        Coast and she discharged a duty during the Egyptian War of 1882. </p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Coton</hi>. La matinée do samedi n’a rien eu
                        d’extraordinaire : commencée calme, elle s’est raffenn:e par la suite, pour
                        finir en légèro réaction sur les cours de la veille, mais les fluctuations
                        enregistrées potfrraient aussi, à la rigueur, être considéré “s comme simple
                        conséquence de la lutte engagée entre les deux partis en présence et se
                        terminant, pour co jour-là, par une offre dépassant la demande. </p>
                    <p>Mais ce qui a été un véritable sujet de surprise, c’est la tenue, piteuse au
                        possible, du marché pendant les deux ou trois séanoes qui ont suivi et qui,
                        pour un moment, ont foit reculer le Novembre jusqu’à 14 3/8, en offrant de
                        la sorte un contraste, vraiment frappant, avec la brillante allure de la
                        semaine précé: dente. Il est vrai que mercredi à la dernière minute, il y a
                        eu un peu de soutien et depuis une reprise de près d'un huitième du plus bas
                        niveau atteint, mais, tout compte tait, la huitaine se trouve avoir perdu
                        3/16 sur 1? Novembre et 5/32 sur les autres mois, tandis que, de son ooté,
                        l’Amérique a gagné rondement une vingtaine de points. </p>
                    <p>De motifs sérieux pour provoquer un changement aussi radical que oelui que
                        nous avons eu, il n’y en a pas, mais comme nous étions montés en dépit de
                        l’étranger, nous sommes descendus de même, et pour cela il a suffi que les
                        quelques haussiers, qui semblaient dominer la situation, suspendissent leurs
                        achats. Il peut se faire comme d’auouns prétendent, qu’ils se réservent pour
                        une nouvelle manœuvre à un moment qui leur paraîtra opportun, mais après
                        l’épreuve de ces jours-ci, on est fixé désormais aur le maximum de ce que
                        l’on peut craindre -de leur part et de l’effet prodigieux que produirait sur
                        eux, sans retard, un développement tant soit peu marqué des arrivages de
                        l’intérieur. </p>
                    <p>Comme chiffre d’affaires, le marché a été suffisamment actif, mais encore une
                        fois le oommeroe d’exportation n'a pas pris la moindre participation dans
                        les opérations oomme acheteur, les dispositions de la filature quant aux
                        livraisons éloignées n’ayant nullement varié depuis notre dernière revue. </p>
                    <p>Môme pour le prompt, il n’y a pas d’empressement et la preuve en est que les
                        provenances Haute-Egypte sont de nouveau en baisse de 1/8, tandis que le Mit
                        Afifi, quoique enoore rare, maintient à peine sa valeur. E» pour ceux qui
                        douteraient de œt état du marché, nous offrirons oomme exemple à leurs
                        méditations l’enchère des Domaines qui a eu liea hier et pour laquelle tout
                        entrain a manqué de la part des acheteurs ; on a peut-être payé le plein
                        prix de la marchandise vendue, mfîa pas l’ombre de la prime
                        qu’habituellement on donnait à cette administration pour ses beaux lots, et
                        surtout poar ses première* parties. . Et pouvtant la vente en qaestion
                        consistait entièrement en qualités irréprochables. </p>
                    <p>Le mouvement de la récolte est enoore lent, mais, malgré tout, il y a eu
                        jusqu'ici assez de coton pour alimenter la demande existante, et dont la
                        petitesse est amplement démontrée par le calme du marché et le peu
                        d’importance des exportations s’élevant à peine à Balles 5000, aveo
                        perspective d’une autre semaine à peu près dans les mêmes conditions. </p>
                    <p>Comme qualité, on se montre satisfait du nouveau produit, mais le rendoment à
                        l'égrenage continue, semble-t-il, à donner des déboires. S’agirait-il d’an
                        oaprice de la nature ou d’une oiroonatanoe climatérique quelconque? Il faat
                        le supposer, car il est de fait que rien, ni dans le coton ni dans la
                        graine, n’indique que la plante ait souffert en quoi que 08 soit. </p>
                    <p>Liverpool n’a pas l’air d’être bien ohaud pour les ootons égyptiens ; 1©3
                        ventes sont cette semaine un peu plus importantes que la semaine d’avant,
                        mais sous le rapport des prix, à trois ou quatre points près, nous restons
                        au môme niveau pour les future, tandis que les cours du disponible sont,
                        pour ainsi dire, immuables. </p>
                    <p>Quant à l’Amérique, elle ne nous a servi cette semaine, en fait de nouvelles
                        sensa tionellea, que le rapport de Miss Giles donnant le chiffre de 67 1/10
                        oomme représentant l’état de la plante au 18 septembre. Avec une température
                        que l’on dit idéale depuis quatre semaines, nue pareille chute est pour le
                        moins étonnante ! </p>
                    <p>On câble aussi que le "Dallas News’’ estime la récolte du Texas, de l’Indian
                        Territory et de l’Üklahoma à Balles 2.810.000, contre Balle? 8.806.000
                        l’année dernière, soit 25 % de déficit dans les diitriots qui ont été
                        presque les seul« à souffrir de la sécheresse. Mais, à ce oompte-là, oeux
                        qui préconisent une récolte totale de 11.000.000 au moins seraient donc dans
                        le ▼rai ! </p>

                        maisons sérieuses qae l’industrie en Amérique s’abstient d’acheter pour le
                        moment. </p>
                    <p>Manohester, pour sa part, continue à ôtre affectée par les mauvaises
                        perspectives aux Indes pour le commeroe des manufactures. </p>

                        complément du bouquet, et naturellement toutes oos circonstances réanies ne
                        sont pas de nature à relever le marohé pour le moment. Bref, la spéculation
                        chez nous est toujours sur la réserve et il nous faudra un revirement
                        radical du dehors pour l’amener à s’intéresser à l’article, soit sous la
                        forme d’une forte baisse ultérieure, soit d’une demande de la part de la

                        2/6 pour l’Ootobre et les 3 mois et poar quantités insignifiantes. </p>
                    <p>La vieille marchandise ne trouve amateur qu’eutre £5 6/3 et £5 7/6, suivant
                        position, mais c3 grand écart sur la nouvelle récolte s’explique par le
                        désir de Hall de profiter des grosses quantités à la vente en magasin ohez
                        elle et en route, quantités qu’on évalue à 15,000 tonnes. </p>
                    <p>Le disponible ohdz nous est tenu à P.T. 57 par les achats des ^huileries de
                        notre plaœ, qui paient indifféremment le môme prix pour les provenances
                        Haute-Egypte et pour les Mit Afifi. </p>
                    <p>Les exportations ont été iufimes, mais cela à cause du manque de steamers

                    <p>Le travail des usines recommencera dans quelques semaines.</p>
                    <p>Les administrateurs provisoire? doivent s’y prendre dès à présent pour
                        étudier les moyens ’avoir une campagne aussi fructueuse que possible. </p>
                    <p>La situation précaire de la Société et le gâchis qui y règne actuellement
                        reudent,il faut l’avouer, leur tâche assez ardue. De plus l’année prochaine
                        ne se présente pas oomme une année prospère pour l’industrie suorière en
                        général, le prix aotuel du suore à 25 fr. les 100 kilos n’étant guère
                        rémunérateur. </p>
                    <p>On pourrait cependant, môme à ce cours, travailler en Egypte aveo nn certain
                        bénéfice, à la condition d'entrer résolument dans la voie de réformes
                        radicale? :— </p>
                    <p>1° En éliminant les parasites pour ne conserver dans les usines que le
                        personnel strictement nécessaire. </p>
                    <p>2° En réalisant de sérieuses économies. </p>
                    <p>3° En renonçant a? système rnineux des expériences pour s’en tenir à âge
                        fabrication rationnelle et pen coûteuse. </p>
                    <p>4° Enfin,en fermant les usines qui ne penvent rapporter. </p>
                    <p>Ce sont là des mesures tout à fait élémentaires, comme on le voit, mais que
                        l'anoienoon seil d’Administration ne se souoiait guère d’appliquer. </p>
                    <p>Tout oe que Cronier et ses collaborateurs demandaient aux usines c’était de
                        maroher; que oe soit à perte ou à bénéfico, peu leur importait. </p>
                    <p>Les urines devaient avant tout servir de réolama Ainsi l’on disait de l’usine
                        de Nag Hamadi que o’était la pins bellç et la mieux outillée du monde ! Sans
                        tenir oompte qae son exploitation était ruineuse. </p>
                    <p>Il parait, en effet, que le prix de revient du sucre est dans cette usine de
                        fr. 30 et 82 les 100 kilos, alors que dans certaines autres usioes, Abou
                        Ghorghas, par exemple, il n’est que de 22 à 24 fr. </p>
                    <p>On vendait dono fr. 25 oe qni coûtait fr. 32 ! </p>
                    <p>Cela n’empêchait pas le Conseil d'Administration de dire aux actionnaires
                        dans ses rap ports annuels que les bénéfices s’élevaient à fr. 12, 14 et 17
                        par sao! </p>
                    <p>Tout le monde, y compris M. Naus, admettra pourtant,q'i’nne sucrerie n’est en
                        Egypte oomme à Java belie et bonne qa’autant qu’elle fournit un produit de
                        bonne qualité à an prix rémunérateur. </p>
                    <p>M. Naus comprendra également pourquoi, malgré ses qualités, son sucre n’est
                        pas du goût des actionnaires qui le trouvent fort amer depuis un certain
                        temps. il est dono certain qu’un travail considérable incombe aax

                    <p>Lord Guernsey, who goes out with the new Viceroy as A D.C., is young for the

                        the Crown, and James II. deprived him of his office. William III. did
                        nothing tor him, though he favored the Orangeman’s cause. But in
                        consideration of his great merits and abilities,” the daughter of King
                        James, when she had become the fountain of honor, made him a peer, and one
                        of the early acts of George I. was to raise him to the Earldom of Aylesford,
                        in Kent. He bad acquired the Aylesford estates through his wife, a City
                        heiress, daughter of Sir John Banks, Bart; and these estates devolved, as
                        did the title, from father to son, till 1882, when they were put up for sale
                        under a "dis-entailing Act” Some of the two or three thousand acres were not
                        sold, but a sum of £80,000 was realised. A large purchaser was the then Earl
                        of Romney, who paid £26,200 for the Boxley Abbey property of some 900 acres,
                        valued at a thousand a year. </p>
                    <p>Coupling the Board of Trade Returns for August with the recent condition of
                        the Money Market, it can hardly be considered a legitimate speculative
                        grievance that the Bank of England has advanced its discount rate to 3 per
                        cent. This is mainly a precautionary measure, of quite usual occurrence when
                        autumn sets in. But on the present occasion, the tightening of the Bank’s
                        control has exceptional justification in the feverish tendency brought into
                        activity in some produce markets by the restoration of peace between Japan
                        and Russia. Already, there has been a considerable measure of forestalling
                        an anticipated "leaps and bounds” demand for British manufacturers, and as
                        that liveliness, if allowed to go on unchecked, would be sun to be followed
                        by severe reaction, the Bank Parlour has done quite right to pot on the
                        brake. It is highly satisfactorily, nevertheless from a purely economic
                        standpoint, that the foreign commerce of the kingdom continues is a most
                        prosperous condition. Both sides of last month’s trading account show
                        remarkable increases of business, and although part of this expansion may be
                        attributable to belief in the early advent of peace, the broad result is not
                        less acceptable. The most unpleasant feature occurs in imports of food,
                        proof being again afforded of our increased dependence on foreign countries
                        for adequate supplies. Meat, butter, cheese, eggs, lard, and bread stuffs
                        came in from abroad in much larger quantities Argentina figuring still more
                        prominently than previously among foreign purveyors of British needs. But it
                        is highly satisfactorily to see that Canada continues to hold her own, and
                        something more, in the competition for the Motherland’s custom, the value of
                        food import from that colony having more than doubled last month, despite a
                        serious shrinkage in wheat, meal, and flour. </p>
                    <p>By now General Swayne will be back at his old headquarters at Berbera,
                        resuming his delicate duties as British Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief
                        of the Somali Protectorate. His work has been aptly carried along by Captain
                        Spiller Cord eaux, who will perhaps now be able to take a well-earned
                        holiday. Though less than thirty-five, this officer has been “Vice” at
                        Berbera since ’98, and has latterly—since the setting up of the new regime
                        in 1902—held the offices of Sub-Commissioner and Consul. His father was the
                        late Edward Cordeaux, of the Indian Civil Service, whose son first joined
                        the Indian Staff Corps (1896), but soon found it more congenial to go into
                        the Bombay Political Service. That was early in 1898, and before the
                        Christmas of the same year he was in Berbera, specially selected to help
                        General Swayne. </p>
                    <p>The King’s presence at Doncaster races drew a large and fashionable crowd.
                        The weather was in delightful contrast to Goodwood. Every one was pleased to
                        see Lady Alington about again. There were some wonderful toilettes. Lady
                        Savilo had a black hat with a beautiful dress of white crepe much inserted
                        with lace, and her blue sash matched her turquoise ornaments. The Countess
                        of Crewe was in blue and white check silk, the Duchess of Roxburghe had a
                        black hat and boa with a pretty pink gown. Lady Sybil Grant was in neat
                        mouse-brown cloth faced with biscuits, and her hat was in shades of purple.
                        The Duchess of Newcastle was in white and green, and the Countess of
                        Annealey was in opaline silk, and carried a bright green sunshade. </p>
                    <p>Rufford Abbey, where the King paid latterly his third visit since his
                        Coronation, came to the first Baron Savile from his father, the eighth Earl
                        of Scarborough, and considerable landed estate—some 18,000 acres in
                        Notts,and some 16,000 acres in the West Riding, the whole good for £52,000 a
                        year—came with it. When Sir John Savile-Lumley, afterwards Savile, G.C.B.,
                        sometime Ambassador at Rome, was made a peer in 1888, it was Rufford that
                        gave the grantee of the Barony of 8avile his title. The title went by
                        special remainder to his nephew, the present peer, whose father was the
                        Rector of Bilathorpe. Rufford went first to the Rector’s elder brother,
                        Henry, then of the “First Life,” and later to the more familiar youngest
                        brother, Augustas William, Assis-tant-Master of the Ceremonies, a proficient
                        without whom no cotillon was complete. The present Lord Savile, bom in 1854,
                        succeeded his uncle some eight years ago. </p>
                    <p>A paragraph of two lines announces that Dr. G. E. Morrison, the " Times”
                        correspondent at Peking, has arrived in London from America. He has a knack
                        of turning up unexpectedly in various parts of the world. He spent his
                        vacations in Australia years ago by tramping across the continent from north
                        to south, or canoeing for thousands of miles on its rivers. His next great
                        feat was to rail up the Yangtze River, and, dressed as a Chinaman, to cross
                        quietly over Western China and the Chinese Shan States, to the frontier of
                        Burma. One smart official mistook him for a missionary, and charged him a
                        fare of five dollars instead of seven ; but another to whom he gave this
                        explanation curtly exclaimed, “No dam fear !” and insisted on the full
                        amount Dr. Morrison was one of those for whom the nation prematurely mourned
                        when the Peking Legations were "massacred,” and his story of those stirring
                        days is among the best of his achievements as a writer, He thought to be
                        quietly resting in Peking when the recent Peace Conference was assembling,
                        but when M. Witte and Baron Komura arrived at Portsmouth ho was there ready
                        to receive them. Just as quietly he has dropped down in London, as though
                        from the magic carpet of the “Arabian Nights." </p>
                    <p>There is mystery as well as romance in "the extraordinary story of the ship
                        that stranded and afterwards blew up at Kalfakoer in the Baltic. The crew
                        are reported to have kept customs officials at bay at the point of the
                        pistol, some of them afterwards escaping into the interior on horseback, and
                        there is the further statement that many rifles, which are believed to have
                        come from the blown-up steamer, were picked up. The identity of the vessel
                        has not been established. Part of the name was painted over, but from the
                        letters which were seen it is suggested that it was the John Grafton of
                        London. The steamer John Grafton of London changed hands in July last The
                        negotiations were conducted, as often happens, through brokers, and the old
                        owners declared that they were unaware as to who had got possession of the
                        vessel. Soon after the transfer she left the Thames for the Tyne. On the
                        way, according to Lloyd’s records, she | was in collision, but sustained
                        very little damage. Since then her movements have not been officially noted.
                        At Lloyd's the present owner of the John Grafton is given as Mr. R. R.
                        Dickinson, to whom, according to the information supplied for the purposes
                        of register, the vessel was transferred. Bat Mr. Dickinson, when interviewed
                        the other day refused to make any statement whatever. "I don’t want,” he
                        replied, in answer to an offer to furnish him with the particulars as
                        received from Helsingfors, ''to hear anything about it, I have no
                        explanation to give and no information to supply.” To questions whether the
                        John Grafton was still owned by him and whether it was likely to be in the
                        vicinity of Kalfskoer, he was equally obdurate. So the mystery as to the
                        identity of the vessel and the extraordinary conductor her crew still
                        remains unsolved. </p>
                    <p>The temperance regulation instituted by the Ministry of Justice in the German
                        Law Courts, forbidding officials to consume alco-holic beverages within the
                        precincts of the courts, reminds us that in former days judicial personages
                        in this country were not all models of sobriety. Lord Campbell describes a
                        Chief Justice opposing the Pretender, but when intoxicated (which he nightly
                        was), drinking to his prosperity. Jeffreys and Scroggs were, as everyone
                        knows, addicted both on and off the bench to gross intemperance.
                        Intoxication was not unknown among English statesmen of the eighteenth
                        century. Lord Oxford is said to have come not infrequently drunk into the
                        presence of Queen Anne. When Walpole was a young man bis father was
                        accustomed to pour into his glass a doable portion of wine, saying, “Come,
                        Robert, you shall drink twice while I drink once, for I will not permit the
                        son in his sober senses to be witness of the intoxication of his father.”
                        This education produced its natural fruits. Boling broke, Carteret,
                        Pulteney, and even Addison, the foremost moralist of his time, were not free
                        from this vice. </p>
                    <p>It is barely half a century since the revival of harvest festivals began, and
                        now there is hardly a parish in England where they have not become an
                        institution. They are a revival, of course, for there was a period when they
                        were as universal in one form or another as they are now. In the days before
                        the Reformation country people used to blend thanksgiving to Heaven with
                        their rejoicings, but along with much that was of doubtful value, we lost
                        some undoubtedly good thing when we purged our Prayer Book. Even to day we
                        have not any means of expressing our gratitude for the harvest except by
                        resorting to unauthorised service. Some day we may hope that we shall have a
                        service of thanksgiving set forth by lawful authority. And perhaps, we shall
                        then get rid of some portions of the ordinary harvest festival which are
                        more honored in the breach than in the observance. It certainly does not add
                        to the quietude of a parish to turn a church into a horticultural show, and
                        we may notice ¡ with satisfaction that this is not often done nowadays. We
                        have heard of a pig’s head | displayed upon the altar as a suitable
                        decoration for the harvest festival, but then this was in the earlier days
                        of these services. Our people have been educated of late years, but there is
                        room for improvement still. If we do not ran into extremes in the way of
                        decoration, there are clergymen, and laymen as well, who Are apt to think
                        there cannot be too much and too elaborate music. There can hardly be a
                        greater mistake. </p>
                    <p>Three sisters living at Reigate have lived an aggregate of 285 years. The
                        Misses Alexander comprise Miss Mary, who celebrated her 102nd birthday
                        yesterday ; Miss Elizabeth, 97 years of age ; and Miss Sarah Ann, who is 86
                        years old. They are members of an old and respected Quaker family, and are
                        sister of the late Mr George William Alexander, who lived to a great age.
                        His centenarian sister celebrated her birthday by being wheeled in a bath
                        chair in the morning on Reigate Heath, when she visited several old family
                        pensioners and servants. In the afternoon a number of friends called and
                        paid there respects to the senior sister of the trio. Miss Mary Alexander
                        has al her faculties, and can see to read, write, and sew without
                        spectacles. Her hearing is remarkably good, but at times her memory fails
                        her. </p>
                    <p>The predicament of the Bishop of Lland ff in having to preach without his
                        episcopal vestments recalls the plight of Dean Stanley who one day ascended
                        the pulpit at West minster Abbey, not minus vestments, but with something
                        else added. In the hat which be had worn bad been his gloves and one of the
                        latter had remained upon his head. He did- not notice it: the Dean was
                        notoriously absent-minded. "I feel cold,” he said to a friend as, in an open
                        trap, they drove along the road from Monreale to Palermo. ''Well, you had
                        better put on something extra,” replied his friend, and went on reading.
                        Just as they entered Palermo he glanced at Stanley, and found him robed in
                        white. He had put on his night-shirt over his clothes. </p>
                    <p>One of our enterprising news agencies supplies a remarkable instance of

                    <head>THE FUTURE WAR OFFICE.</head>

                    <p>Certain remnants of scaffolding still cling to the corners of the new War
                        Office in Whitehall, and canvas screens hide spots upon which the sculptors
                        are at work adding to the number of those groups of figures, poised high on
                        the building, which are already beginning to excite the ready and biting wit
                        of the London street critic. The main portion of the building, however, is
                        exposed to view and it is possible to form an opinion of how this new
                        structure will fit into its surroundings and give dignity or the reverse to
                        Whitehall. For five years London has watched the slow process of growth, and
                        has only wondered rather less at the time taken to add stone to stone,
                        because farther down Whitehall another Government building was making even
                        slower progress. The contractors, however, are well within their time, and
                        it will be June next before the present shell of the War Office becomes a
                        real building fit for the transaction of the business of the nation, when
                        presumably the whole of the officials will migrate from what has been called
                        the "rabbit warren in Pall-Mall" to the more spacious home opposite the
                        Horse Guards. </p>
                    <p>Time has not yet had opportunity to mellow the shades of the new stone.
                        Indeed, its good offices in the course of the last few years have been
                        deliberately declined by the builders, who have cleaned the front where it
                        was soiled as they have taken the scaffolding down. So the War Office stands
                        out crude and white in its Portland stone against the rich shading of the
                        banqueting hall. Yet, even as it stands it may claim to be a wonderful
                        example of scientific building. In all the five years nobody has witnessed
                        the dressing of the stones from which it has been erected. This has been
                        carried out at the quarries themselves. Every piece has been accurately
                        prepared to size, has been numbered, brought to London, and placed in
                        position without the use of hammer or chisel. The contractors claim, too,
                        that the whole of the stone is without flaw. Only in some of the later
                        decoration has the work been done on the building itself In the architecture
                        of the building there has been a quite obvious endeavour to bring the War
                        Office into harmony with the banqueting Hall without copying any of the
                        features of that fine building or entering into competition with it. The
                        style of the whole is that of the Renaissance, and presents some mixture of
                        details. The different fronts are rather flat, but probably as much has been
                        done with a very difficult site as was possible while keeping to the idea
                        that the structure was one in which business had to be done, Of the
                        difficulty of the site there can be no two questions. It is a most irregular
                        quadrilateral, and it has only been possible to partially conceal this fact
                        by placing round towers at each corner in a manner most successfully used by
                        the late Mr. Alfred Waterhouse in the adjacent National Liberal Club. Then,
                        in order to preserve space, it has been necessary to give the building flat
                        fronts, sacrificing the advantage of relief; and the manner in which this
                        little problem has been surmounted by ranges of Ionic pillars is at any rate
                        striking. </p>
                    <p>The main entrance to the new buildings is to be in Whitehall, where the
                        triple, entrance is beneath a colonnade which extends for half the length
                        of- the front There are other extrances in each of the sides of the
                        building, and these will all lead to the central court about which the
                        offices have been erected. Something of the fine effect that might otherwise
                        have been given to the building is taken away by the necessity for many
                        small windows, but a whole row of these in the Whitehall front have been
                        concealed by a narrow colonnade which surmounts the more imposing columns
                        below. </p>
                    <p>Whatever criticisms architects may venture upon the new buildings, nobody can
                        complain that they replace a feature of London. It is true that Carrington
                        House once stood here, but Carrington House was already a distant memory
                        when a windfall placed Sir Michael Hicks Beach in a position to make
                        provision for the £700,000 which the building is to cost. The site was
                        occupied chiefly by some galvanised iron buildings in which the collections
                        of the Royal United Service Institution were housed, and for the rest was
                        given over to a striking collection of weeds, when the excava-tors first
                        came to dig those foundations which in their depth, their solidity, and the
                        length of time they took to dry were a marvel to the passerby on the
                        omnibuses. </p>
