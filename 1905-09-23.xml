                    <head>THE BALKAN QUESTION.</head>
                    <p>It was once remarked that the population of the Balkan countries was made up
                        of men with rifles and without ideas, and men with ideas And without rifles,
                        and that the troubles of these unfortunate regions were mainly due to this
                        unequal division of gifts. But now that the idealists have got their rifles
                        too (and excellent rifles they are) the last state—of Macedonia at
                        least—appears to be worse than the first The variety of hostile elements of
                        which the population of any district is com-posed makes common action
                        difficult at the best of times, and impossible as a rule. Propaganda—Greek
                        and Bulgarian, in the first line, Servian and Roumanian in the second-make
                        life a burden to the harmless folk who want to make money and live at peace
                        with their neighbours, while the Albanians and the Moslem element appear
                        from time to time to make a solitude, and announce that quiet has been
                        restored, etc., etc. Meantime British and Continental public opinion, once
                        sympathetic with the Christian elements, is being rapidly estranged, and the
                        opinion somewhat brutally expressed by German papers that the Macedonians
                        should be left to stew in their own juice is gaining ground to an extent
                        that appears amazing to those who remember the horror with which the
                        Armenian massacres and the first attacks on the Bulgarian villages of
                        Northern Macedonia were regarded in Europe. </p>
                    <p>In England the Bulgarian and the Turk unquestionably command more support
                        than any other of the combatants. A strong minority, which holds that the
                        preservation of good relations with the Caliph means everything to England,
                        is pro-Turkish, the majority frankly pro-Bulgarian. The Servians must remain
                        unpopular for yean to come, and Greece, till ten years ago the most popular
                        of the smaller kingdoms in England, has sunk in British esteem. Her failure
                        to any effective resistance to the invading Turk, and still more, her
                        failure to bang any of the persons responsible for the debacle so annoyed
                        the average Briton of intelligence, that he was ready to transfer his
                        sympathies to a more stalwart race which had come with credit out of its
                        wars, and which, if it had no history, did not at all events live on its
                        reputation. "The man in he street” was of course unfair, for, whatever may
                        be said of the Greeks, ingratitude has not been one of their failings, and
                        he would have done well to assure himself that the Bulgarians deserved all
                        the sympathy he lavished on them, and that the Greeks, whose attitude daring
                        the Transvaal war was most friendly throughout, merited, this sadden
                        withdrawal of sympathy. But popularity is almost as shortlived in England as
                        in France—shorter lived perhaps. Next year the “Kutzo-Vlachs” may enjoy the
                        sympathy of the British newspaper reader, and in five years’ time John Ball
                        may have once more turned phil-Hellene. </p>

                            November. We are now asked to draw special notice to the fact that the
                            volume referred to is M. Poffandi's "Indi-cateur Egyptien” and not that

                        <p>A Scoundrel Arrested.—A foreigner was arrested yesterday on the strength

                            he recently married in America—to Alexandria with a view to dispose of
                            her for improper purposes. The miscreant who claimed to be an American
                            citizen, but was not, has been imprisoned, and will be tried before the
                            native Tribunal. </p>
                        <p>The Pyramids Theatre. — The chief attraction at the Pyramids Theatre at

                            telepathy. On such a subject much scepticism is, of course, evinced, and
                            the Professor’s claims to the power of thought-reading are received by
                            the majority perhaps of the audience with incredulity. Though Professor
                            Bellini’s efforts may fail to convince, they are certainly most
                            remarkable, and very interesting. </p>

                            tainments. Amongst the chief items we notice the Italian comic scherzo
                            Non piu sordi in Locanda, the French comedy A Qui le Neveu, and the
                            musical farce Les Deux Aveugles. We trust that the entertainment will
                            receive the support which its object deserves. </p>

                        <p>On this subject "A1 Moayad” writes as follows. </p>
                        <p>Early in April 1904, in the very week of the Anglo French agreement
                            concerning Morocco and Egypt, Moulai Abd-el-Aziz engaged a troupe of
                            singers and dancing women under the charge of Moursi Barakat. At the
                            time we remarked that the political and financial situation of Morocco,
                            and above all the internal condition of the country, made us inclined to
                            doubt the news. But we saw the first-class tickets of the troupe, which,
                            by the way, was not the best that Cairo could produce, and we could only
                            express our hope that its harmonies might aid the Sultan to forget his
                            troubles, and bring about friendly relations between Morocco and Egypt
                            Our hopes, however, were vain, and this cure for political anxiety has
                            evidently not been lasting, for once again Moulai Abd el Aziz has
                            engaged the same troupe, this time to calm the agitation aroused by the
                            Emperor William’s visit to Tangiers, and the arrival of one diplomatic
                            mission after another. </p>
                        <p>The troupe numbers eight persons, as on last year's visit (For the
                            benefit of oar readers we give their names and rôles :—Moursi Barakat,
                            impresario, Badia, prima donna and chief danseuse, Zobeida, eccentric
                            danseuse and comedienne , Zeinab singer and danseuse, Hassan Badri,
                            tenor, Saleh Mohamed, musician, Hassan Ali player of the "oud” and
                            Fangari, chief of the claque.) Even if we can understand the rôle of the
                            first seven members of the troupe it is a little difficult to account
                            for Fangari’s presence, unless the claqueur is summoned to shoot down
                            the protests of M. St Réné Taillandier, or to keep Count von Tattenbach
                            in order. </p>

                        <p>(From our Correspondent.) </p>
                        <p>Port Said, Friday. The M.M. Salazie arrived at dawn to-day, having on
                            board M. Tillier, the Chef du Transit, who comes specially to take the
                            chair and direct matters in connection with the unfortunate Chatham
                            incident. Soon after his disem-barcation, a consultation was held at
                            which the heads of Canal Co’s departments assisted. Mr. Harris the
                            special representative of Nobell’s factory was also present, and I
                            understand a decision was arrived at which will become public property
                            very shortly. </p>
                        <p>On Wednesday after the party had returned from the Chatham, a lengthy
                            meeting was held in the Chief Engineer’s office, but no final decision
                            leaked out, nor has any done so, so far, to-day. </p>
                        <p>The position of the vessel is the same practically as it was when last I
                            sent notes on the subject except that she is settling down more or less.
                            All sorts of preparations have been made, and from the appearance of
                            things I would not be surprised to bear of something important very
                            soon, when I will communicate with yon. </p>
                        <p>Later. </p>
                        <p>From what I learn from various sources I believe it is finally decided
                            to blow the vessel up some time next week, and looking at things from a
                            general point of view, although the actual date is not known, my opinion
                            is it will not occur until after the passage of the Brindisi mail boat </p>
                        <p>(By Telegraph) </p>
                        <p>Saturday, 9.30 a.m. Yesterday’s meeting of the commission of experts in
                            consultation with the heads of the various departments of the Canal
                            Company, finally decided that it would be necessary to blow up the
                            Chatham. I understand that the explosion will not take place till
                            Thursday, in order to let the Caledonia pass safely through with the
                            mails, for India and Australia . A deviation in the fresh water canal is
                            now being constructed as rapidly as possible with a view to minimise the
                            danger to Port Said’s water supply. The explosion will be effected by
                            means of electricity and troops have been ordered up from Cairo. </p>
                        <p>The blowing up of the Chatham with a cargo of probably more than 100 tons
                            of dynamite, will constitute a world’s record in the history of dynamite
                            explosions. The last record was created at Aboukir, near Alexandria, on
                            the 1st June of the present year, when sixteen and a half tons of
                            dynamite were exploded by Mr. Harris under the orders of the
                            Municipality. No one oau have any conception as to what the force of
                            such an explosion can be ; its consequences may be grave, and it is
                            impossible to say where they will end. </p>
                        <p>The S.S. Chatham lies about nine miles from Port Said and though perhaps
                            no serious damage will result to the town itself, it is safe to prophecy
                            that a severe shock will be felt, and that windows will be broken,
                            whilst we should imagine that it is quite possible that some of the
                            flimsily built native houses may be damaged. The railway line is in
                            close proximity to the sunken vessel, the rails will probably be
                            loosened, and traffic temporarily suspended. Beyond the damage which
                            will be done to the canal itself, the moat important question to be
                            considered is the danger to the fresh water canal from which Port Said
                            draws the whole of its water supply. The Canal Company is indeed making
                            every effort to avert, or at any rate minimise, this danger by cutting a
                            deviation, but it is almost too much to hope that the fresh water canal
                            will escape destruction at this point, though the work of repair will be
                            much more quickly accomplished than in the case of the maritime canal,
                            and it is to hoped that should Port Said be deprived of fresh water it
                            will only be for a short time. </p>
                        <p>As regards the effect of the explosion on the ship canal, it is
                            impossible to estimate the extent of the damage. The banks will be blown
                            to pieces for a considerable distance and the canal will, we imagine, be
                            entirely blocked for some three weeks at the least, This will involve
                            the accumulation of 150 vessels or more at either end of the canal, and
                            the loss to trade can well be imagined, for not only will the shipping
                            firms suffer, but those who are awaiting the arrival of cargoes. The
                            mails most, of course, be delayed for as short a time as possible and we
                            suppose that arrangements will be made, whereby they will be conveyed
                            from Port Said to Suez, and vice-versa, by rail, and there re-shipped by
                            other vessels at either end. </p>

                        <p>The gala performance held at the Eldorado Theatre on Wednesday, proved a
                            great success, and was largely attended. Two pieces were given by the
                            company, both being exceedingly well received ; they were in Italian.
                            The financial results of the evening were, I believe, most satisfactory,
                            subscriptions having amounted to a very considerable sum, not only from
                            the sale of tickets, but by money-gifts from various residents. The
                            entire committee were present at the performance, and a large number of

                            visit to the celebrated choral society of Vienna. The president and
                            committee thanked the Khedive most heartily for the honor he had done
                            them, and his Highness replied with a brief extempore speech in which he
                            praised the artistic abilities of the choral society, and particularly
                            mentioned the excellent impression they had left in Egypt- The Khedive
                            then visited the society's museum, which contains a cup presented by the
                            King of Hanover, medals given by Napoleon III., the looks of Mozart's

                        <p>A new steam navigation company has been founded at Athens by the
                            well-known Greek builders, MM. Stamatiades, Righinos, and Brontisi. The
                            new line will ply between the various Levantine ports, Alexandria of
                            course included. M. N. Boyiajides, who has been sent to London on a
                            mission which comprises the purchase of vessels, reports that he has
                            just added another steamer, displacing 2,500 tons, to the company's
                            fleet. Meantime M. Giovannidis’ new navigation company, which has
                            started an agency at Rhodes, is on the look oat for steamers to add to
                            its flotilla. The Melpomene is already running between Alexandria and
                            Rhodes, and I expect that other vessels will soon he employed on this
                            service. </p>

                        <head>TEA AND TRAVEL</head>
                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette. </p>
                        <p>Sir, — Having considerable experience of ocean travel in different parts
                            of the world, a recent journey home has served to put life into an old
                            grievance, on which I take the liberty of addressing yon. </p>
                        <p>One hears from time to time of the waning popularity of this or that line
                            of passenger steamers, and confident that the directors of such lines
                            have the interests of their shareholders at heart, I make the following
                            suggestions which if carried out, will, I think, tend to their
                            reinstatement in the public favour. </p>
                        <p>In brief, Sir, I recommend that a speciality be made of the tea served to
                            passengers. </p>
                        <p>After one’s morning tub and in the afternoons could one depend upon a cup
                            of good tea daintily served what a boon, it would be ! </p>
                        <p>How popular such a line would become with the fair sex. The harsh memory
                            of many a rough passage would be softened by the reflection "But they
                            did give us delicious tea !” </p>
                        <p>A cow or cows should be carried or, failing that, the best brands of
                            sterilised milk, and if macaroons were served with the afternoon tea
                            success would be assured, </p>
                        <p>You will observe, Sir, that I have refrained from mentioning any
                            particular line of steamers ! This reticence on my part is not prompted
                            by a desire to spare any one’s feelings. It arises from the knowledge
                            that they are all tarred with the same brush in respect to the fault to
                            which I take exception. </p>
                        <p>I am, Sir, etc. </p>
                        <p>G. H. Ludolf. </p>

                    <head>THE ARMY AND ITS UNIFORM.</head>
                    <p>Mr. J.H.M. Abbott, writing in the “Spectator” on “How it Strikes an
                        Australian,” says that the English Army on a peace footing seems to be
                        maintained almost wholly with an idea of teaching the people of England that
                        there really is such a thing as the “pomp and circumstance of war.” War is a
                        mean business, to be got over as soon as may be —-despite the old barbaric
                        fascination of taking part in itaud it is all business. The modern soldier
                        must have two essential attributes : he must shoot straight, and he must
                        endure. His courage, of course, is taken for granted ; and indeed it is a
                        pleasant thing to believe that there are not many real cowards in the ranks
                        of humanity. But he must be able to take punishment, and he must be
                        tolerably sure of killing his man at least five hundred yards away. </p>
                    <p>The aspect of the English Army in peace conveys no suggestion of either of
                        these absolutely necessary qualifications in the soldier. It rather gives
                        the possible recruit an impression that his first duty lies towards his
                        clothing. The system goes to unnecessary expense in making him into a
                        theatrical person most useful for ceremonial occasions, whilst it stints his
                        pay, pares down his pension, and is niggardly with the practice ammunition
                        which he needs in order to qualify as a good shot. But it makes him the
                        glory of the housemaid, and the soldier of the nurse-girl’s ideals. And that
                        seems to be the reason why it hopes he will enlist </p>
                    <p>It is hard to believe that the two metal-clad mounted man with the foolish
                        uniforms who dwell in the little stone boxes in Whitehall, or the top-heavy
                        redcoats who mount guard outside Buckingham Palace, can appear other than
                        absurd and anomalous to any one except children. But it is unfortunately the
                        case, one cannot help realising, that to the vast majority of Londoners, at
                        any rate, they typify all that is soldierly, and all that is necessary for
                        the security of the Empire. </p>
                    <p>And it is this idea, infinitely more than the conservatism of the War Office,
                        that retards the reformation of the British Army, and has caused it to
                        become what from the quality of its material it should never be—a jest and a
                        byword. </p>

                    <p>Recent excavations at the Little Wellington Wood, near Watch field, Berks,
                        have revealed traces of an old Roman village. A well, fifteen feet in depth,
                        containing many interesting pieces of pottery and valuable coins, has been
                        cleared of the earth which has for many centuries hidden all trace of what
                        was, at the end of the third century, a source of water supply to many
                        habitations. </p>
                    <p>The coins, 24 of which have been found, are mostly of the time of the Emperor
                        Alectus. He had been a general of the Emperor Carau-gius, and on the
                        strength of his position in Britain, then a very important province, had
                        made good his claim to a share in the Empire. Allectus murdered Caransius,
                        A. D. 293, and assumed the title of Emperor of Rome. </p>
                    <p>After a struggle of three years against the General Constantins Chlorus, whom
                        Domitian had sent over from Rome, Allectus fell in battle A. D. 296.
                        Constantins himself became Emperor eventually, and was succeeded by his son,
                        Constantine the Great, who accompanied him in this important British
                        campaign. </p>

                    <head>THE LADY AND THE TELEPHONE.</head>
                    <p>The lady and the telephone have been so Intimately connected in recent
                        history that one hears with something of a pang of the threatened severance
                        of the association in America, where the State of Pennsylvania is
                        experimenting with “girlless telephone ex changes.” Yet the regret is
                        probably more sentimental than founded on reason. The girlful telephone
                        exchange has not, on the whole, been a complete success. The girl, as a
                        vehicle of business, is subject to certain defects of temper and utterance
                        which, in post-offices and tea-shops, are partly compensated for by her more
                        decorative appear ance—an asset which counts for nothing in the mysterious
                        recesses of Gerrard and Central. The voice, after all, is not the most
                        potent of feminine charms, and the exigencies of the telephone girl’s
                        calling naturally induce a shrillness which few persons since Shakespeare
                        have thought an excellent thing in woman. Man, for his part, is at the
                        disadvantage that it is not easy to be chivalrous to a lady whom yon cannot
                        see, whose age and condition you do not know, and of whose character you can
                        only guess, from varied experience, that she possesses a sense of humour
                        much beyond the feminine average. The telephone operator, therefore, has
                        none of the emollient, educative, brightening influence which it is the
                        mission of the typist or of the waitress to disseminate in the unro-mantic
                        city life. On that account, as well as on some others which it might be
                        considered ungallant to specify, we shall watch her departure with dry eyes.

                    <p>There has just been discovered at Whitby, his birthplace, a relic of one of
                        Captain Cook’s voyages, in the shape of a hog’s tusk, mounted with a piece
                        of bell metal. Round the ferrule is engraved the following inscription: A
                        boar’s tusk, brought from the Sandwich Islands, 1773, by one of Captain
                        Cook’s men.” On the top of the ferrule are the words, “Bell metal from York
                        Minister, burnt May 20, 1840.” </p>

                    <p>A GREAT DETECTIVE.</p>
                    <p>One of the Paris papers states that Vidocq was a myth, or, rather, that he
                        had never been chief of the Sûreté, Géneralé. This statement on the eve of
                        the production of a Vidocq play, by Emile Bergerat, in Paris, aroused a
                        storm of protest, and as, after all, it is less than a century since Vidocq
                        lived, proof of his official position has not been diffi cult to find. He
                        was chief of the Brigade de la Sûreté for fifteen years, from 1812 to 1827,
                        and then retired, mainly, no doubt, because of the jealousy of Coco Lacour,
                        his pupil who, coveting Vidocq’8 position, ousted him from it and became his
                        successor. Vidocq was a detective of the Gaborian school A huge man, of
                        enormous strength, he had as many wild adven tures as the hero of a penny
                        dreadful and looked, with his bright blue eyes and head of long curly hair,
                        like one of Byron’s heroes. In repose his face was stern, but he was a
                        master of expression, and could compel his features to assume a look of
                        bonhomie which was frequently useful to him in his chats with criminals. And
                        he knew almost every criminal in France. He had lived their life, and knew
                        their ways. </p>
                    <p>He had been in his time a mountebank, a lawyer’s clerk, a plumber, and a
                        soldier ; he had been a wandering pedlar and a smuggler ; and though it was
                        afterwards said, and legally proved, that he had been sentenced for a crime
                        which he had not committed, Vidocq had known life at the galleys and the
                        inside of many prison cells. He died in poverty at the age of 82. Modern
                        chiefs of the Sûreté Générale have very different methods. Vidocq relied
                        largely upon personal activity and cleverness in disguise, while M. Hamard
                        and his immediate predecessors catch, when they do catch, their law-breakers
                        by system. The detective of to-day is a man of science. In his work so
                        little is left to chance that there would remain no undiscovered crime were
                        there not one small hitch. The modern criminal has become scientific too.

                    <head>EGYPTIAN MINES.</head>
                    <p>Highly encouraging developments are taking place in the Semna nine of the
                        Fatira Company—an offshoot of the Egyptian Mines Exploration Company. In the
                        No. 1 shaft, driving east at the 75 ft. level, some extremely good values
                        have been obtained, the reef over the last 23 ft. of driving assaying 2ozs.
                        2 dwts. for a width of 6 ft. Developments in No. 2 shaft are equally
                        promising, the vein at 23fr. giving assays of 5 ozs. 10 dwts. over 3 ft.,
                        and at 43 ft. 3 ozs. 16 dwts. over 43 ins. In view of these important
                        results, No. 3 shaft is being sank with all speed. As far as the Semna mine
                        is concerned, therefore, says Financier, the theory that the generally of
                        Egyptian lodes are too narrow to prove payable would seem to be exploded.
                        This mine, by the way, is only one iron the parent company has in the fire,
                        its interest in the producing Um Rus being considerable. No small wonder
                        bayers are being attracted by the present low price of the shares. </p>

                        increase of pessimistic sentiment, to continued favorable crop condition,
                        and free offerings from the south ; and the recovery was simply a reaction
                        from the recent depression. We are under the impression that in the
                        immediate future the market is likely to fluctuate round about present
                        values. </p>

                    <head>KIDNEY DISEASE.</head>
                    <head>TAKES YOU UNAWARES.</head>
                    <p>Until kidney disease has reached a serious stage, it seldom gives any more
                        serious a warning than a pain or dull ache in the back, urinary disorders,
                        rheumatic pains, imparity of the blood, dropsical swellings, dizzy spells,
                        or irregular heart This is the reason it is so generally fatal for often the
                        sufferer does not know these warnings are signs of kidney disorder. </p>
                    <p>Recognising the great need of a medicine that would act on the kidneys alone,
                        without weakening the system by affecting the bowels, James Doan devoted
                        many years of his life to the study of this subject, and the perfection of
                        his Doan's Backache Kidney Pills. This medicine is made from pure vegetable
                        roots and herbs which act on the kidneys only. Doan’s Pills are special
                        kidney help. When a cold, misuse of beer, spirits and tea, or any other
                        cause, pats extra work on the kidneys, Doan’s Pills give the additional help
                        needed ; when the delicate kidney tissue is weakened or clogged, Doan’ Pills
                        strengthen and cleanse it; when the. bladder-walls and urinary passages are
                        inflamed and coated with imparities, Doan’s Pills allay the irritation and
                        remove the cause, by driving out the clogging poisons. The genuine Doan’s
                        Backache Kidney Pills cure not only the disorder, but the cause; they give
                        tone to the kidneys themselves, by taking them just the constituent parts
                        necessary to rebuild them back to their natural strength. </p>
                    <p>Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are for sale by all chemists and druggists at
                        P.T. 13 per box, or P.T. 71 for 6 boxes ; or they may be had direct from the

                        requires the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is quickly and
                        easily applied with a whitewash brush, with half the labour and at one third
                        the cost of paint. HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures cleanliness, and is pleasing to

                        DISTEMPER is of special value in hot climates. Owing to its cool, pleasing
                        colours, great weather-resisting and germ-destroying properties, it lends
                        itself to every kind of wall, wood, brick or stone coating, possessing all

                    <p>The first outburst of excited indignation, that greeted the peace terms (in
                        Japan) is giving place to a businesslike consideration of the future.
                        Denunciation of the treaty and, even overt demonstrations have not ceased,
                        but the bulk of the nation seems to have turned its back upon disorder, as
                        we were confident from the first it would. The amount of strong feeling
                        which still exists shows the strains that the Japanese have just gone,
                        through, and does all the more honor to the, self-control and farsightedness
                        which have enabled the majority to triumph over the first pangs of
                        disappointment The remaining discontent may be expected to subside as soon
                        as the people turn their hands to the work which is waiting for them </p>
                    <p>The first section of the Japanese nation to grasp the vast opportunities
                        which peace has brought within range is, naturally enough, the business
                        community. A piece of intelligence is reported to day which is in the
                        highest degree significant of the future. A great trade combination,
                        representing eighty-one firms, and headed by the Japanese capitalist Mr.
                        Iwade, has been formed for the promotion of Japan’s industries and the
                        expansion of her foreign trade. Here, then, we have the first big movement
                        to take advantage of the opportunities afforded by the peace. </p>

                    <p>Even during the war the industries of Japan have hardly been prejudicially
                        affected, and the output of the mills has not diminished. Commercial
                        enterprise, of course, in that country is still in its infancy, but the rate
                        of progress has been most remarkable, and if the required capital is
                        forthcoming—as it readily will be now that the Japanese Government are
                        relaxing the stringent precautions designed to prevent the dominance of
                        foreign money—the exports of Japan are likely to show some astonishing
                        increases in the next five years. That Japan will be a formidable competitor
                        is being realised by many of the American newspapers, which are beginning to
                        give economic interpretations to the phrase “Yellow Peril,” and also by the
                        British manufacturers trading with the Far East But, doubtless, Japan will
                        have her own industrial difficulties, like every other country has—checks
                        which had already begun to manifest themselves when the war came to absorb
                        the nation’s full attention. These may somewhat retard the development of
                        which Count Katsura spoke, but the prognostics are that it will still be as
                        rapid as was her rise to political greatness. </p>

                    <p>Japan is not given to letting the grass grow under its feet Hardly has the
                        war been ended when it begins the reaping of the consequences —a reaping
                        which (to lapse into an Irishism) means the sowing of commercial
                        possibilities. Count Kataura, the Premier, has been impressing on the
                        provincial governors the importance of directing the national energy so as
                        to effect an economic expansion and development commensurate with the
                        nation’s victories. Judging from a “Times” report, the business community is
                        carrying out the advice before it is well given. A trade combination,
                        representing eighty-one firms and headed by the Japanese capitalist Mr.
                        Iwade, has been formed for the promotion of Japan’s industries and the
                        expansion of her foreign trade. The opportunities before such a combination
                        are immense, but the feature which strikes us most is the promptitude with
                        which the scheme has sprung into being. It must have been formulated before
                        the war was over, and no doubt will be in full working order ere the armies
                        have been withdrawn. Time is precious to the Japanese. England shows an
                        Oriental lassitude by comparison </p>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">"Globe.”</hi></p>
                    <p>Some of the finest markets in the world lie close to the threshold of
                        enterprising Nippon that of China itself offer, amount of profitable
                        business to a manufact-ring nation almost conterminous in geographical
                        position. Here, then, and also on a smaller scale in Korea, Japan can, as
                        soon as her resources are fully developed by the powerful financial
                        combination just brought into being at Tokio, enter into competition against
                        the Western nations with almost every advantage in her favor. That is the
                        direction to which Count Kataura points as the sure road to a victory, not
                        less desirable, in its way, than that accomplished during the last twenty
                        months by armed force. Happily, the provin-cial governors may be safely
                        depended on to bring to a quick ending the underground schemes of party
                        politicians. </p>

                    <head>THE SCANDINAVIAN CRISIS.</head>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">“Daily News”.</hi></p>
                    <p>It is often urged that the aspirations of the small nations threaten the
                        peace of Europe. To a dialectician like Mr. Balfour, “the balance of
                        criminality” rests, not with the Turkish op-pressor, but with the Macedonian
                        revolutionary The time is, however, fast coming when this strange contention
                        will have to be not only revised, but reversed. At present, statesmen are
                        deliberately contending against a natural law which they ought to recognise
                        and obey. The result is trouble, anxiety, and a danger of bloodshed. But we
                        may take it as certain that an autonomous Europe, governed in accordance
                        with natural law, would be a peaceful Europe and a Europe ready for
                        disarmament. We say this because autonomy is the first step towards
                        confederation. If only Sweden would drop her notions of pre-eminence and
                        would frankly concede absolute independence to Norway, we should be within
                        measurable distance of a close Scandinavian alliance. But each an alliance
                        or confederation can never come about while one party to it is suspected of
                        desiring to claim some especial prerogative over the other. </p>
                    <p><hi rend="bold"> "Standard.”</hi></p>
                    <p>Whatever be the value to one party, or the danger to the other, of
                        Frederikstein, we cannot believe that a single fortress, however old, or
                        however new, can be worth the risk of a rupture. Not since Hamlet the Dane
                        moralised over the proceedings of Fortinbras the Norwegian has there seemed
                        a more inadequate cause for plunging two nations into war. Are men to be
                        asked to "go to their graves like beds,” and shed the blood of their
                        brothers for this fragment of earth and stone ? The idea is insulting to the
                        intelligence and humanity of the Scandinavian peoples, and frankly we must
                        say that they will disgrace themselves in the eyes of the world if they are
                        going to 'find quarrel in a straw” in this fashion. </p>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">Chronicle.</hi></p>
                    <p>Sweden says "Pull down your fortresses because they are aimed at us.” Norway
                        replies, we suppose, "Not so; they stand in self-defence.” To which Sweden’s
                        rejoinder should be, it seems, “Very well, then; to prove our good faith, we
                        shall readily agree to a treaty of universal and compulsory arbitration.” If
                        this rejoinder be made, Norway would have some difficulty, we think, in
                        resisting the demand for the demolition of the new fortresses. </p>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">“Westminster Gazette.”</hi></p>
                    <p>The relations between Sweden and Norway are still in a critical state, and no
                        way out of the frontier fort difficulty seems to have been discovered as yet
                        As we rather thought might be the case, it happens that the question turns
                        on the new part of the old forts. Norway is willing to demolish forts which
                        are wholly new; Sweden does not ask for the demolition of those which are
                        entirely old. But what of the forts (such as Fredricksten and Kongavinger)
                        which are partly new and partly old? A Norwegian correspondent writes to us
                        this morning as to these two forts </p>
                    <p>They were modernised in 1895, when certain other smaller works were built,
                        all of which are within the neutral, rone proposed by Sweden. The whole of
                        the work, it should be remembered, was sanctioned by the Union King, and,
                        obviously, could not then have been regarded by him and his Swedish advisers
                        as a threat from one of his kingdoms towards the other. They are all, as an
                        indisputable fact, of a purely defensive character, and were intended as
                        links in a concerted scheme for the defence, by the two nations, of the
                        Scandinavian peninsula. The Swedes now affect to believe that they
                        constitute a direct threat towards themselves. As defences the forts can be
                        no threat to Sweden now any more than they were in 1895 ; as bases for a
                        Norwegian attack on Sweden they are worse than useless, even assuming the
                        possibility of such an attack by the weaker country, which, however, no
                        thinking man in Norway or Sweden for a moment admits. </p>
                    <p>It is satisfactory to find that both sides still agree that the question
                        ought to be capable of amicable adjustment, but none the less very grave
                        danger would attend any considerable prolongation of the present situation. </p>

                    <p>The “Dagblad” in an article headed “Foreign Mediation,” says it appears as if
                        Sweden will refuse both arbitration and mediation. As regards Norway,
                        nothing in her attitude, saythe journal, can be interpreted as indicating a
                        refusal on her part to consider arbitration or mediation. Nobel’s ideal of
                        peace has animated Norway to such an extent that they would confidently
                        accept either. </p>

                    <head>KISHENEFF.</head>
                    <p>Kisheneff is the capital of Bessarabia, a Russian province bordering upon
                        Hungary. We reached it by a branch railway line tram a small station on the
                        direct route between Odessa and Kieff. From the train windows we could see
                        that the physical attractions of Bessarabia were far greater than those of
                        the Odessa district Here the ground, no longer steppe, broke into gentle
                        undulations, which were enlivened from time to time by gurgling streams
                        crossed by rustic bridges, and country lanes that reminded one of beautiful
                        Surrey. The cottages, thatched neatly with straw, and standing in pretty
                        gardens surrounded by hedges, had a decided look of prosperity and comfort;
                        their walls were whitewashed, and their window-frames and doors painted
                        bright red, or blue, or green, according to the taste of the owners, and
                        sometimes all three colours were combined. In the distance we could see blue
                        hills, thè fore runners of the Carpathian mountains. The air was mild and
                        balmy, a delight after, the rawness of Odessa. </p>
                    <p>The town of Kisheneff is by no means be-witching. One is struck first of all
                        by the enormous space it covers, and by the width of its dirty streets, and
                        then by the shabby and dejected look of its low, seldom more than
                        two-storied, houses. There are a few streets with five houses and some large
                        public buildings, but these are only to be seen in the centre of the town.
                        The houses are of stone,and look, for the most part, like rows of shabby
                        bungalows. The shops, with one or two exceptions, are quite second-rate, and
                        were one and all in the hands of low-class Bessarabian Jews until 1903,when,
                        for the first time, a first-class Russian business house was opened there. </p>
                    <p>It was as much our interest in the children of Israel as any other motive,
                        that led us to Kisheneff, and we were anxious to see and talk with some of
                        them. English people are apt to forget that there are as many classes of
                        society among the Jews of Russia as there are among ourselves in Great
                        Britain, and they also forget that even in Russia the Jews, though-all of
                        one race, are of many different nationalities. Even at Kisheneff, where
                        these people have suffered so much, many of the most respected citizens are
                        Jews, who are loyal to Russia as the country of their birth, and, the same
                        time, loyal to their own race. Some of the most distinguished lawyers,
                        doctors, and merchants of Bessarabia are Jews. These men know well that it
                        was as untrue that the atrocities which horrified the world were sanctioned
                        by the Russians as a people, as it is untrue that the American people
                        lynches its negroes and burns them at the stake. </p>
                    <p>We stayed at a hotel kept by a Jew. Many of the window-panes had been smashed
                        at the time of the attack on the Jews, and had not been replaced by new
                        ones, so for once we slept in a well-ventilated room. The next day we took a
                        drive through the lowest part of the town, which is known by the name of
                        "the old bazaar,” and were surprised to find Jews, Russians, dogs, and pigs
                        all mixed up together in amicable muddiness. I had expected to find the Jews
                        in a sort of ghetto apart. As a matter of fact Kishen-eff is mainly a Jewish
                        town, with a few Russian officials, and a few public buildings in its
                        centre, just as Warsaw is a Polish town, with Russian policemen keeping
                        order in the streets. The mud in the bazaar must be like pea soup in wet
                        weather, but it was dry on the day of our visit, and we found loaves of
                        bread, vegetables, and other articles of food exposed for sale on bits of
                        dirty matting. On all sides of ns were Jewish faces. The young girls were so
                        handsome that I could hardly take my eyes off them ; they had crisply
                        furling brown hair, good, well-defined features, clear complexions,
                        expressive dark eyes, and long black eyelashes. The boys had the same pretty
                        curling hair as the girls, only that it was short and bushy. Many Jewish
                        houses are built round one court, with a single entrance; this style of
                        architecture is adopted for the sake of the security it affords. Students of
                        Old London tell us that houses there were always built in that way during
                        the Middle Ages, as it was not safe to live in houses built otherwise. </p>
                    <p>Later in the day I entered a shop opposite our hotel to buy some picture
                        postcards. The young woman behind the counter was a Jewess. She saw that I
                        was a foreigner, and was very anxious to know my nationality, and the reason
                        of my visit to Kish- eneff. ’The poor creature was afflicted with a terrible
                        squint, and so was her father, who came in presently. They conversed
                        together in a gibberish of low German, which I understood perfectly. When
                        she heard I was English the girl asked :-- </p>
                    <p>“Do they kill the Jews in England ?” </p>
                    <p>"Kill them !” 1 answered ; "I should think not, indeed!” </p>
                    <p>"Do they beat the Jews in " England !” she asked, fiercely. </p>
                    <p>“Of course not,” I replied. “Some of the best men in our country are Jews. I
                        should like to see them being beaten!” </p>
                    <p>"Well, they beat them-and kill them here,” she cried, or, rather, hissed, and
                        her dark eyes flashed. </p>
                    <p>"Surely none but a very low class of people would do such a wicked thing was
                        my tentative rejoinder. </p>
                    <p>"No, indeed. All classes join in ill-treating the Jews ;'doctors join the
                        mob, students— everybody." </p>
                    <p>"Were you here when they did it ?" I asked. </p>
                    <p>"Yes ; they went first to one shop, and to another.” - </p>
                    <p>"It is very terrible," I replied; and as I looked at the girl I felt how much
                        she must have suffered, and wondered whether she, too, would end by joining
                        the Nihilists, like so many of her sisters. Twenty years ago it was an
                        acknowledged foot that there were ten times as many Jews among the ranks of
                        Nihilism as there were Russians, Poles, or-Germans. "The Jewish women in
                        particular,” wrote Tissot, in 1882, "bring a concentrated energy, a cold
                        determination, to bear on their acts of revolution that recall the Judith of
                        the Apocrypha.” The same writer was of the opinion that the majority of
                        these Judiths came from Little and New Russia, where the cornfields wave
                        like the sea, where the blood is warm.” Yes, I felt that the young woman bad
                        reason to be' indignant, and I did not think it was for me—a foreigner -—to
                        remind her that there are two sides to every question, and that the fearful
                        massacres, which no Russian worthy of the name had ever wished to justify,
                        were the outcome of evils that been growing for more than one decade. I did
                        not speak to her of the class of Jews who had settled, like vampires, year
                        after year, upon the poor, lazy, ignorant peasant, who, having got hold of
                        the capital, had enticed them into their liquor hells (till the Government
                        stopped it), lent them money, and ruined them by the thousand. </p>
                    <p>Presently the girl said, "Do you know any Hebrew ? It is Hebrew, the language
                        of our race, that my father and I have just been talking.” </p>
                    <p>"Really,” I replied, trying to look dubious; "it is remarkably like German.” </p>
                    <p>"You are right,” she replied : and yon would find Hebrew very easy if you
                        knew German. There are so many words common to both languages.” </p>
                    <p>I told her that I did not think that was the case with the pure Hebrew of the
                        Scriptures, at which she simply shrugged her shoulders. While we were
                        talking it had interested me to see her brother, who was also afflicted with
                        the family squint, enter quietly, and listen with quivering interest to
                        every word that passed. I left that shop with a feeling of greater sympathy
                        with the Hebrew race than ever. Russia must not drive her Jews away, nor
                        must she hinder their advance, or turn them into Nihilists. They are a
                        necessary element to her own prosperity. They are like a sharp tool,
                        indispensable to the skilled workman, but ready to out like a razor if not
                        handled properly. Take away the Jews from Kisheneff, and the town will cease
                        to exist Help them to prosper and the town and its government will become
                        one of the most flourishing spots in the empire. </p>
                    <p>Kisheneff is the fortunate possessor of some fine sulphur springs, and steps
                        have already been taken towards the erection, in their neighbourhood, of a
                        handsome sanatorium. A new museum of archeology, built in the Moorish style,
                        was opened in the autumn of 1904, and other public buildings are in course
                        of erection. The climate alone is attracting more Russian residents every
                        year, and if only the Jews are treated properly, the good fortune of
                        Kisheneff will certainly be assured. </p>

                    <p>London, September 15. Captain M. J. Hamilton, Lancashire Fusi-lier, has been
                        seconded for service with the Khedive's Army. He has worn the bushy for a
                        little over six years, and commanded a company for almost the past two years </p>
                    <p>Lieutenant J.B. -Jenkinson, 2nd Battalion Rifle Brigade, who recently was
                        appointed adjutant of the Mounted Infantry in Egypt, is a smart young
                        officer of five years’ service. He had considerable experience of mounted
                        infantry work at Aldershot -He has been seconded whilst so employed. </p>
                    <p>The Army Council has derided, that if a Regimental major specially selected
                        for appointment as second in command, has not, at the time of such
                        appointment, completed two years service as a substantive major, he shall
                        nevertheless be entitled, from the 27th July, 1905, or from his appointment
                        if subsequent to that date, to pay at the higher rates allowed by-
                        regulation to substantive majors of Cavalry and Infantry after two years
                        service in that rank. </p>
                    <p>It has been decided to issue the new short service rifle to Royal Horae
                        Artillery and Royal Field Artillery batteries in the proportion; of five
                        rifles to each brigade headquarters, 48 rifles to each battery,and one rifle
                        per gunner in each ammunition column and park. </p>
                    <p>Advices from the. Mediterranean Fleet state that H.M.S. Bulwark, flagship of
                        Lord Charles Beresford, made excellent practice during the recent gunlayers’
                        competition off Valetta with the 12 inch guns The fore turret gun made eight
                        hits out of thirteen rounds, and the after turret gun nine hits out of ten
                        rounds a total of seventeen hits out of twenty-three rounds. The flagship
                        also did well in the 6-inch gun competition, scoring 78 hits out of 103
                        rounds. This is the best record of the fleet. Our foreoast that Lord Charles
                        would pull up the gunnery of the squadron, or know the reason why, was
                        perfectly correct. </p>
                    <p>The storeship Wye was paid out of commission this week at Sheerness, and
                        placed on the sale list. The Wye was purchased during the Ashanti War, and
                        was since employed in running to the West Coast and Ascension Island. As she
                        is of no fighting value she will be sold all standing-without mutilation of
                        her machinery. * </p>
                    <p>It has been calculated that the Wye steamed half a million of miles in the
                        past thirty years. During the Ashanti War she carried stores to the West
                        Coast and she discharged a duty during the Egyptian War of 1882. </p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Coton</hi>. La matinée do samedi n’a rien eu
                        d’extraordinaire : commencée calme, elle s’est raffenn:e par la suite, pour
                        finir en légèro réaction sur les cours de la veille, mais les fluctuations
                        enregistrées potfrraient aussi, à la rigueur, être considéré “s comme simple
                        conséquence de la lutte engagée entre les deux partis en présence et se
                        terminant, pour co jour-là, par une offre dépassant la demande. </p>
                    <p>Mais ce qui a été un véritable sujet de surprise, c’est la tenue, piteuse au
                        possible, du marché pendant les deux ou trois séanoes qui ont suivi et qui,
                        pour un moment, ont foit reculer le Novembre jusqu’à 14 3/8, en offrant de
                        la sorte un contraste, vraiment frappant, avec la brillante allure de la
                        semaine précé: dente. Il est vrai que mercredi à la dernière minute, il y a
                        eu un peu de soutien et depuis une reprise de près d'un huitième du plus bas
                        niveau atteint, mais, tout compte tait, la huitaine se trouve avoir perdu
                        3/16 sur 1? Novembre et 5/32 sur les autres mois, tandis que, de son ooté,
                        l’Amérique a gagné rondement une vingtaine de points. </p>
                    <p>De motifs sérieux pour provoquer un changement aussi radical que oelui que
                        nous avons eu, il n’y en a pas, mais comme nous étions montés en dépit de
                        l’étranger, nous sommes descendus de même, et pour cela il a suffi que les
                        quelques haussiers, qui semblaient dominer la situation, suspendissent leurs
                        achats. Il peut se faire comme d’auouns prétendent, qu’ils se réservent pour
                        une nouvelle manœuvre à un moment qui leur paraîtra opportun, mais après
                        l’épreuve de ces jours-ci, on est fixé désormais aur le maximum de ce que
                        l’on peut craindre -de leur part et de l’effet prodigieux que produirait sur
                        eux, sans retard, un développement tant soit peu marqué des arrivages de
                        l’intérieur. </p>
                    <p>Comme chiffre d’affaires, le marché a été suffisamment actif, mais encore une
                        fois le oommeroe d’exportation n'a pas pris la moindre participation dans
                        les opérations oomme acheteur, les dispositions de la filature quant aux
                        livraisons éloignées n’ayant nullement varié depuis notre dernière revue. </p>
                    <p>Môme pour le prompt, il n’y a pas d’empressement et la preuve en est que les
                        provenances Haute-Egypte sont de nouveau en baisse de 1/8, tandis que le Mit
                        Afifi, quoique enoore rare, maintient à peine sa valeur. E» pour ceux qui
                        douteraient de œt état du marché, nous offrirons oomme exemple à leurs
                        méditations l’enchère des Domaines qui a eu liea hier et pour laquelle tout
                        entrain a manqué de la part des acheteurs ; on a peut-être payé le plein
                        prix de la marchandise vendue, mfîa pas l’ombre de la prime
                        qu’habituellement on donnait à cette administration pour ses beaux lots, et
                        surtout poar ses première* parties. . Et pouvtant la vente en qaestion
                        consistait entièrement en qualités irréprochables. </p>
                    <p>Le mouvement de la récolte est enoore lent, mais, malgré tout, il y a eu
                        jusqu'ici assez de coton pour alimenter la demande existante, et dont la
                        petitesse est amplement démontrée par le calme du marché et le peu
                        d’importance des exportations s’élevant à peine à Balles 5000, aveo

                        l'égrenage continue, semble-t-il, à donner des déboires. S’agirait-il d’an
                        oaprice de la nature ou d’une oiroonatanoe climatérique quelconque? Il faat
                        le supposer, car il est de fait que rien, ni dans le coton ni dans la
                        graine, n’indique que la plante ait souffert en quoi que 08 soit. </p>

                        ventes sont cette semaine un peu plus importantes que la semaine d’avant,
                        mais sous le rapport des prix, à trois ou quatre points près, nous restons
                        au môme niveau pour les future, tandis que les cours du disponible sont,
                        pour ainsi dire, immuables. </p>
                    <p>Quant à l’Amérique, elle ne nous a servi cette semaine, en fait de nouvelles
                        sensa tionellea, que le rapport de Miss Giles donnant le chiffre de 67 1/10
                        oomme représentant l’état de la plante au 18 septembre. Avec une température
                        que l’on dit idéale depuis quatre semaines, nue pareille chute est pour le
                        moins étonnante ! </p>
                    <p>On câble aussi que le "Dallas News’’ estime la récolte du Texas, de l’Indian
                        Territory et de l’Üklahoma à Balles 2.810.000, contre Balle? 8.806.000
                        l’année dernière, soit 25 % de déficit dans les diitriots qui ont été
                        presque les seul« à souffrir de la sécheresse. Mais, à ce oompte-là, oeux
                        qui préconisent une récolte totale de 11.000.000 au moins seraient donc dans
                        le ▼rai ! </p>

                        chez nous est toujours sur la réserve et il nous faudra un revirement
                        radical du dehors pour l’amener à s’intéresser à l’article, soit sous la

                    <p>La vieille marchandise ne trouve amateur qu’eutre £5 6/3 et £5 7/6, suivant
                        position, mais c3 grand écart sur la nouvelle récolte s’explique par le
                        désir de Hall de profiter des grosses quantités à la vente en magasin ohez
                        elle et en route, quantités qu’on évalue à 15,000 tonnes. </p>

                    <p>Les exportations ont été iufimes, mais cela à cause du manque de steamers

                    <p>Le travail des usines recommencera dans quelques semaines.</p>
                    <p>Les administrateurs provisoire? doivent s’y prendre dès à présent pour
                        étudier les moyens ’avoir une campagne aussi fructueuse que possible. </p>

                        reudent,il faut l’avouer, leur tâche assez ardue. De plus l’année prochaine
                        ne se présente pas oomme une année prospère pour l’industrie suorière en
                        général, le prix aotuel du suore à 25 fr. les 100 kilos n’étant guère
                        rémunérateur. </p>

                        bénéfice, à la condition d'entrer résolument dans la voie de réformes
                        radicale? :— </p>
                    <p>1° En éliminant les parasites pour ne conserver dans les usines que le
                        personnel strictement nécessaire. </p>
                    <p>2° En réalisant de sérieuses économies. </p>
                    <p>3° En renonçant a? système rnineux des expériences pour s’en tenir à âge
                        fabrication rationnelle et pen coûteuse. </p>
                    <p>4° Enfin,en fermant les usines qui ne penvent rapporter. </p>
                    <p>Ce sont là des mesures tout à fait élémentaires, comme on le voit, mais que
                        l'anoienoon seil d’Administration ne se souoiait guère d’appliquer. </p>
                    <p>Tout oe que Cronier et ses collaborateurs demandaient aux usines c’était de
                        maroher; que oe soit à perte ou à bénéfico, peu leur importait. </p>
                    <p>Les urines devaient avant tout servir de réolama Ainsi l’on disait de l’usine

                        tenir oompte qae son exploitation était ruineuse. </p>
                    <p>Il parait, en effet, que le prix de revient du sucre est dans cette usine de
                        fr. 30 et 82 les 100 kilos, alors que dans certaines autres usioes, Abou
                        Ghorghas, par exemple, il n’est que de 22 à 24 fr. </p>
                    <p>On vendait dono fr. 25 oe qni coûtait fr. 32 ! </p>
                    <p>Cela n’empêchait pas le Conseil d'Administration de dire aux actionnaires
                        dans ses rap ports annuels que les bénéfices s’élevaient à fr. 12, 14 et 17
                        par sao! </p>
                    <p>Tout le monde, y compris M. Naus, admettra pourtant,q'i’nne sucrerie n’est en

                    <p>M. Naus comprendra également pourquoi, malgré ses qualités, son sucre n’est
                        pas du goût des actionnaires qui le trouvent fort amer depuis un oertain

                <p>(From our Correspondent).</p>
                
                <p>London, September 15.</p>
                
                <p>Lord Guernsey, who goes out with the new Viceroy as A D.C., is young for the post though he served for a while with the 7th Hussars before he joined the Irish Guards, in which latter regiment his lieutenant’s commission dates from September of last year. He came of age when the courtesy style he bears was, as a substantive title, just a couple of centuries old. The grantee was another Heneage Finch, second son of the first Earl of Nottingham, and an luner Temple barrister, who became Solicitor-General, in 1678. It took his “silver tongue” and his staying power, seven Bishops, and Great Anne to make him Baron of Guernsey, in 1703. He was counsel for the Seven Bishops against the Crown, and James II. deprived him of his office. William III. did nothing tor him, though he favored the Orangeman’s cause. But in consideration of his great merits and abilities,” the daughter of King James, when she had become the fountain of honor, made him a peer, and one of the early acts of George I. was to raise him to the Earldom of Aylesford, in Kent. He bad acquired the Aylesford estates through his wife, a City heiress, daughter of Sir John Banks, Bart; and these estates devolved, as did the title, from father to son, till 1882, when they were put up for sale under a "dis-entailing Act” Some of the two or three thousand acres were not sold, but a sum of £80,000 was realised. A large purchaser was the then Earl of Romney, who paid £26,200 for the Boxley Abbey property of some 900 acres, valued at a thousand a year.

                <p>Coupling the Board of Trade Returns for August with the recent condition of the Money Market, it can hardly be considered a legitimate speculative grievance that the Bank of England has advanced its discount rate to 3 per cent. This is mainly a precautionary measure, of quite usual occurrence when autumn sets in. But on the present occasion, the tightening of the Bank’s control has exceptional justification in the feverish tendency brought into activity in some produce markets by the restoration of peace between Japan and Russia. Already, there has been a considerable measure of forestalling an anticipated  "leaps and bounds” demand for British manufacturers, and as that liveliness, if allowed to go on unchecked, would be sun to be followed by severe reaction, the Bank Parlour has done quite right to pot on the brake. It is highly satisfactorily, nevertheless from a purely economic standpoint, that the foreign commerce of the kingdom continues is a most prosperous condition. Both sides of last month’s trading account show remarkable increases of business, and although part of this expansion may be attributable to belief in the early advent of peace, the broad result is not less acceptable. The most unpleasant feature occurs in imports of food, proof being again afforded of our increased dependence on foreign countries for adequate supplies. Meat, butter, cheese, eggs, lard, and bread stuffs came in from abroad in much larger quantities Argentina figuring still more prominently than previously among foreign purveyors of British needs. But it is highly satisfactorily to see that Canada continues to hold her own, and something more, in the competition for the Motherland’s custom, the value of food import from that colony having more than doubled last month, despite a serious shrinkage in wheat, meal, and flour.

                <p>By now General Swayne will be back at his old headquarters at Berbera, resuming his delicate duties as British Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief of the Somali Protectorate. His work has been aptly carried along by Captain Spiller Cord eaux, who will perhaps now be able to take a well-earned holiday. Though less than thirty-five, this officer has been “Vice” at Berbera since ’98, and has latterly—since the setting up of the new regime in 1902—held the offices of Sub-Commissioner and Consul. His father was the late Edward Cordeaux, of the Indian Civil Service, whose son first joined the Indian Staff Corps (1896), but soon found it more congenial to go into the Bombay Political Service. That was early in 1898, and before the Christmas of the same year he was in Berbera, specially selected to help General Swayne.

                <p>The King’s presence at Doncaster races drew a large and fashionable crowd. The weather was in delightful contrast to Goodwood. Every one was pleased to see Lady Alington about again. There were some wonderful toilettes. Lady Savilo had a black hat with a beautiful dress of white crepe much inserted with lace, and her blue sash matched her turquoise ornaments. The Countess of Crewe was in blue and white check silk, the Duchess of Roxburghe had a black hat and boa with a pretty pink gown. Lady Sybil Grant was in neat mouse-brown cloth faced with biscuits, and her hat was in shades of purple. The Duchess of Newcastle was in white and green, and the Countess of Annealey was in opaline silk, and carried a bright green sunshade.

                <p>Rufford Abbey, where the King paid latterly his third visit since his Coronation, came to the first Baron Savile from his father, the eighth Earl of Scarborough, and considerable landed estate—some 18,000 acres in Notts,and some 16,000 acres in the West Riding, the whole good for £52,000 a year—came with it. When Sir John Savile-Lumley, afterwards Savile, G.C.B., sometime Ambassador at Rome, was made a peer in 1888, it was Rufford that gave the grantee of the Barony of 8avile his title. The title went by special remainder to his nephew, the present peer, whose father was the Rector of Bilathorpe. Rufford went first to the Rector’s elder brother, Henry, then of the “First Life,” and later to the more familiar youngest brother, Augustas William, Assis-tant-Master of the Ceremonies, a proficient without whom no cotillon was complete. The present Lord Savile, bom in 1854, succeeded his uncle some eight years ago.

                <p>A paragraph of two lines announces that Dr. G. E. Morrison, the " Times” correspondent at Peking, has arrived in London from America. He has a knack of turning up unexpectedly in various parts of the world. He spent his vacations in Australia years ago by tramping across the continent from north to south, or canoeing for thousands of miles on its rivers. His next great feat was to rail up the Yangtze River, and, dressed as a Chinaman, to cross quietly over Western China and the Chinese Shan States, to the frontier of Burma. One smart official mistook him for a missionary, and charged him a fare of five dollars instead of seven ; but another to whom he gave this explanation curtly exclaimed, “No dam fear !” and insisted on the full amount Dr. Morrison was one of those for whom the nation prematurely mourned when the Peking Legations were "massacred,” and his story of those stirring days is among the best of his achievements as a writer, He thought to be quietly resting in Peking when the recent Peace Conference was assembling, but when M. Witte and Baron Komura arrived at Portsmouth ho was there ready to receive them. Just as quietly he has dropped down in London, as though from the magic carpet of the “Arabian Nights."

                <p>There is mystery as well as romance in "the extraordinary story of the ship that stranded and afterwards blew up at Kalfakoer in the Baltic. The crew are reported to have kept customs officials at bay at the point of the pistol, some of them afterwards escaping into the interior on horseback, and there is the further statement that many rifles, which are believed to have come from the blown-up steamer, were picked up. The identity of the vessel has not been established. Part of the name was painted over, but from the letters which were seen it is suggested that it was the John Grafton of London. The steamer John Grafton of London changed hands in July last The negotiations were conducted, as often happens, through brokers, and the old owners declared that they were unaware as to who had got possession of the vessel. Soon after the transfer she left the Thames for the Tyne. On the way, according to Lloyd’s records, she | was in collision, but sustained very little damage. Since then her movements have not been officially noted. At Lloyd's the present owner of the John Grafton is given as Mr. R. R. Dickinson, to whom, according to the information supplied for the purposes of register, the vessel was transferred. Bat Mr. Dickinson, when interviewed the other day refused to make any statement whatever. "I don’t want,” he replied, in answer to an offer to furnish him with the particulars as received from Helsingfors, ''to hear anything about it, I have no explanation to give and no information to supply.” To questions whether the John Grafton was still owned by him and whether it was likely to be in the vicinity of Kalfskoer, he was equally obdurate. So the mystery as to the identity of the vessel and the extraordinary conductor her crew still remains unsolved.

                <p>The temperance regulation instituted by the Ministry of Justice in the German Law Courts, forbidding officials to consume alco-holic beverages within the precincts of the courts, reminds us that in former days judicial personages in this country were not all models of sobriety. Lord Campbell describes a Chief Justice opposing the Pretender, but when intoxicated (which he nightly was), drinking to his prosperity. Jeffreys and Scroggs were, as everyone knows, addicted both on and off the bench to gross intemperance. Intoxication was not unknown among English statesmen of the eighteenth century. Lord Oxford is said to have come not infrequently drunk into the presence of Queen Anne. When Walpole was a young man bis father was accustomed to pour into his glass a doable portion of wine, saying, “Come, Robert, you shall drink twice while I drink once, for I will not permit the son in his sober senses to be witness of the intoxication of his father.” This education produced its natural fruits. Boling broke, Carteret, Pulteney, and even Addison, the foremost moralist of his time, were not free from this vice.

                <p>It is barely half a century since the revival of harvest festivals began, and now there is hardly a parish in England where they have not become an institution. They are a revival, of course, for there was a period when they were as universal in one form or another as they are now. In the days before the Reformation country people used to blend thanksgiving to Heaven with their rejoicings, but along with much that was of doubtful value, we lost some undoubtedly good thing when we purged our Prayer Book. Even to day we have not any means of expressing our gratitude for the harvest except by resorting to unauthorised service. Some day we may hope that we shall have a service of thanksgiving set forth by lawful authority. And perhaps, we shall then get rid of some portions of the ordinary harvest festival which are more honored in the breach than in the observance. It certainly does not add to the quietude of a parish to turn a church into a horticultural show, and we may notice ¡ with satisfaction that this is not often done nowadays. We have heard of a pig’s head | displayed upon the altar as a suitable decoration  for the harvest festival, but then this was in the earlier days of these services. Our people have been educated of late years, but there is room for improvement still. If we do not ran into extremes in the way of decoration, there are clergymen, and laymen as well, who Are apt to think there cannot be too much and too elaborate music. There can hardly be a greater mistake.

                <p>Three sisters living at Reigate have lived an aggregate of 285 years. The Misses Alexander comprise Miss Mary, who celebrated her 102nd birthday yesterday ; Miss Elizabeth, 97 years of age ; and Miss Sarah Ann, who is 86 years old. They are members of an old and respected Quaker family, and are sister of the late Mr George William Alexander, who lived to a great age. His centenarian sister celebrated her  birthday by being wheeled in a bath chair in the morning on Reigate Heath, when she visited several old family pensioners and servants. In the afternoon a number of friends called and paid there respects to the senior sister of the trio. Miss Mary Alexander has al her faculties, and can see to read, write, and sew without spectacles. Her hearing is remarkably good, but at times her memory fails her.

                <p>The predicament of the Bishop of Lland ff in having to preach without his episcopal vestments recalls the plight of Dean Stanley who one day ascended the pulpit at West minster Abbey, not minus vestments, but with something else added. In the hat which be had worn bad been his gloves and one of the latter had remained upon his head. He did- not notice it: the Dean was notoriously absent-minded. "I feel cold,” he said to a friend as, in an open trap, they drove along the road from Monreale to Palermo. ''Well, you had better put on something extra,” replied his friend, and went on reading. Just as they entered Palermo he glanced at Stanley, and found him robed in white. He had put on his night-shirt over his clothes.

                <div type="article" scope="international"><head>THE FUTURE WAR OFFICE.</head>
                
                <p>Certain remnants of scaffolding still cling to the corners of the new War Office in Whitehall, and canvas screens hide spots upon which the sculptors are at work adding to the number of those groups of figures, poised high on the building, which are already beginning to excite the ready and biting wit of the London street critic. The main portion of the building, however, is exposed to view and it is possible to form an opinion of how this new structure will fit into its surroundings and give dignity or the reverse to Whitehall. For five years London has watched the slow process of growth, and has only wondered rather less at the time taken to add stone to stone, because farther down Whitehall another Government building was making even slower progress. The contractors, however, are well within their time, and it will be June next before the present shell of the War Office becomes a real building fit for the transaction of the business of the nation, when presumably the whole of the officials will migrate from what has been called the "rabbit warren in Pall-Mall" to the more spacious home opposite the Horse Guards.
                </p>
                <p>Time has not yet had opportunity to mellow the shades of the new stone. Indeed, its good offices in the course of the last few years have been deliberately declined by the builders, who have cleaned the front where it was soiled as they have taken the scaffolding down. So the War Office stands out crude and white in its Portland stone against the rich shading of the banqueting hall. Yet, even as it stands it may claim to be a wonderful example of scientific building. In all the five years nobody has witnessed the dressing of the stones from which it has been erected. This has been carried out at the quarries themselves. Every piece has been accurately prepared to size, has been numbered, brought to London, and placed in position without the use of hammer or chisel. The contractors claim, too, that the whole of the stone is without flaw. Only in some of the later decoration has the work been done on the building itself In the architecture of the building there has been a quite obvious endeavour to bring the War Office into harmony with the banqueting Hall without copying any of the features of that fine building or entering into competition with it. The style of the whole is that of the Renaissance, and presents some mixture of details. The different fronts are rather flat, but probably as much has been done with a very difficult site as was possible while keeping to the idea that the structure was one in which business had to be done, Of the difficulty of the site there can be no two questions. It is a most irregular quadrilateral, and it has only been possible to partially conceal this fact by placing round towers at each corner in a manner most successfully used by the late Mr. Alfred Waterhouse in the adjacent National Liberal Club. Then, in order to preserve space, it has been necessary to give the building flat fronts, sacrificing the advantage of relief; and the manner in which this little problem has been surmounted by ranges of Ionic pillars is at any rate striking.
                </p>
                <p>The main entrance to the new buildings is to be in Whitehall, where the triple, entrance is beneath a colonnade which extends for half the length of- the front There are other extrances  in each of the sides of the building, and these will all lead to the central court about which the offices have been erected. Something of the fine effect that might otherwise have been given to the building is taken away by the necessity for many small windows, but a whole row of these in the Whitehall front have been concealed by a narrow colonnade which surmounts the more imposing columns below.
                </p>
                <p>Whatever criticisms architects may venture upon the new buildings, nobody can complain that they replace a feature of London. It is true that Carrington House once stood here, but Carrington House was already a distant memory when a windfall placed Sir Michael Hicks Beach in a position to make provision for the £700,000 which the building is to cost. The site was occupied chiefly by some galvanised iron buildings in which the collections of the Royal United Service Institution were housed, and for the rest was given over to a striking collection of weeds, when the excava-tors first came to dig those foundations which in their depth, their solidity, and the length of time they took to dry were a marvel to the passerby on the omnibuses.
