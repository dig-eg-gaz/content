                    <head>THE LORDS DEBATE</head>
                    <p>Here are some of the comments of the Press on the resolution against the
                        Lords.</p>
                    <p>"The Government plan is simple, and certainly if it errs at all," says the
                        "Daily News," does not err on the side of too drastic treatment of the
                        hereditary chamber. Any- thing less would mean the frank acceptance of the
                        subordination of the elected House; a uni-cameral system when the Tories are
                        in power; Liberalism and progress in a condition of permanent enslavement
                        and impotence." Every argument which the Opposition put for- ward in favour
                        of a Second Chamber "is an argument against the House of Lords" "It is an
                        obviously effective, though undoubtedly a rather cumbrous, plan, and a good
                        many people will be inclined to think with Mr. Shackleton that one of the
                        offers to the Lords might be lopped from it," says the 'Tribune," which also
                        declares that the scheme "represents the irreducible minimum of reform."
                        "The proposal is one of great moderation, while yet, within the limits,"
                        says the "Daily Chronicle," "of real efficacy. To attempt anything less
                        would be to acquiesce in pretensions fatal alike to the rights and liberties
                        of the Commons, and to the possibility of serious Liberal reform." In the
                        opinion of the "Morning Leader," which declares that "Democracy has come to
                        grips with privilege," the plan "is in a very high degree satisfactory."
                        "If," says the "West- minster Gazette," "the Tory Party are really sincere
                        in acknowledging that the will of the country must prevail, they have here a
                        scheme which effects the object without disturbing the constitution of the
                        House of Lords."</p>
                    <p>Feeling sure after reading his speech that Mr. Balfour must have "had his
                        tongue in his cheek," and regretting the Premier's attitude against the
                        Referendum, the "Manchester Guardian" says: —"It is not sufficient to pro-
                        nounce the Government's scheme bad; it is necessary to find a better." The
                        "Guardian" notes with approval Lord Robert Cecil's ad- mission that "the
                        existing system operates one-sidedly." The surprising feature of the debate,
                        says the "Liverpool Post," is "the absence of any substantial arguments
                        against the proposals of the Prime Minister." The Opposition, declare* the
                        'Sooth Wales Daily News," "have a miserable oase to defend, and Mr. Balfour
                        defended it miserably." "The date of the next General Election," says the
                        "Leeds Mercury," "may be accurately fore- casted when the date for the
                        introduction of the Lords' Veto Bill is known."</p>
                    <p>"Seldom, if ever," declares the 'Times," has a change of such moment been
                        urged in a speech displaying so little sense of responsi- bility, or based
                        upon such flimsy grounds" Sir Henry seems to be returning to the obsolete
                        theory that the House of Commons—meaning in practice any chance majority of
                        the House of Commons—is the true Sovereign, and not the nation. The only
                        reason which the Prime Minister could assign for his proposal was the party
                        complexion of the House of Lords, which makes it passive under a Unionist
                        Government, and active only when the Liberals are in power. Now, even if we
                        assume this contention to be true, it is worth noting, as Liberals have
                        noted, that the Government plan is a very imperfect remedy."</p>
                    <p>"The devil can quote Scripture when it suits his ends, and Sir Henry
                        Campbell- Bannerman, excellent man, will talk Consti- tutionalism when he
                        wishes to bring about Revolution," says the "Standard" "Two courses are
                        open: either to strengthen the House of Lords by restoring its character as
                        an assembly selected on grounds of spe- cial competence for the work to be
                        done or to weaken it by diminishing its powers. Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman
                        has chosen the second and as it seems to us, the less judicious and less
                        promising course," says the "Morning Post" "To the crude formula that, the
                        Commons shall prevail," says the "Daily Telegraph" "the unanswerable Union-
                        ist retort is that the country shall prevail, and that the Peers shall
                        prevail with it whenever they are shown to be, as in 1893 and now, the true
                        interpreters of national opinion."</p>

                    <p>The clone connection between Alexandria and Trieste renders the question of
                        the impro- vement of the harbour at the Austrian port of considerable
                        interest His Majesty's Embassy at Vienna has forwarded a memorandum of the
                        proposed new harbour works at Trieste, from which the following is taken :
                        The inadequate nature of the harbour works at Trieste has always formed an
                        obstacle in the way of the free development of the Austro- Hungarian export
                        trade, the steady increase in which has recently drawn special attention to
                        the insufficiencies of the principal port of the Dual Monarchy. It is
                        universally admitted in commercial circles that the requirements of an
                        ever-growing traffic towards the sonth must be met by a corresponding
                        enlargement and improvement of the port of Trieste. This question has
                        recently been taken up actively by the Government,and the Austrian Minister
                        of Commerce,Dr. Forscht, accompanied by a number of experts, has visited
                        Trieste with the ob- ject of studying the subject, and of conferring with
                        the municipal and maritime authorities as to the nature and extent of the
                        improvements to be undertaken. The discussion of the new projects is beset
                        with considerable difficultes owing to the fact of many conflicting com-
                        mercial interests being at stake, but the matter is one which will not be
                        allowed to drop, and it may be confidently anticipated that a de- finite
                        derision will be arrived at before long as to the nature and scope of the
                        improvements. In the meanwhile new harbomr works are already in course of
                        construction and are being pushed on as rapidly as possibly.</p>

                    <head>THE RADICAL ATTITUDE</head>
                    <p>We understand that when the resolution for a special grant of £50,000 to Lord
                        Cromer is proposed by the Prime Minister, the Radical group of members of
                        Parliament, who take a special interest in Egyptian affairs, will support
                        the vote, although as Radicals they are opposed in principle to all grants
                        and pensions. This attitude sounds somewhat illogical, but they feel that
                        Lord Cromer's work in Egypt, taken as a whole and apart from certain
                        shortcomings due to idiosyncrasy, is deserving of exceptional recognition
                        and that his salary was insufficient, having regard to the calls made upon
                        him, for him to have put by any money for the peerage and the younger sons.
                        These Radicals also consider that Lord Cromer is much more entitled to
                        £50,000 than Lord Roberts was to double that sum for the war that he did not
                        finish, and that the amount proposed in Lord Cromer's case is by no means
                        exorbitant. Mr. W Redmond and the Irish Parliamentary Party are going to
                        oppose the grant.</p>

                        before leaving Alexandria, to state the results. Over one thousand circulars
                        were issued by post or by hand, addressed in accordance with the latest

                    <p>We are glad to be able to report that Capt Darrell of the Coldstream Guards,
                        now sta- tioned at Cairo, has won the Diamond Skulls:</p>
                    <p>Capt. Darrell was the runner up last year, and had bad luck in not winning.
                        We offer him our sincere congratulations on his success this year. "An Old
                        Blue" writing in the "Daily Telegraph" previous to the race said:-</p>
                    <p>"Blackstaffe does not seem to me to be as fast as last year, and if I am
                        right he will need all the advantage of the station on Tuesday to get the
                        better of Clotte, who is much improved and better of boated. Darrell and
                        McCulloch should get through the first round, but if Powell appears in his
                        first heat, the Oxford man will get no further. Both McCulloch and Edye are
                        men who will do well in this race later on, but their first attempt is more
                        likely to give them valuable experience than unexpected victory. Darrell
                        should get into the final, for he knows more of the game, and is as fit and
                        resolute as ever. Powell is not likely to get tired in the Goblets, for if
                        previous form goes for anything, nothing but an accident can prevent him and
                        Johnstone winning; unluckily the weat her does not seem likely to facilitate
                        their making the record they could easily have got last year had they known
                        their time at Fawley."</p>

                    <p>"English Radicals who are inclined to take Mustapha Pasha Kamel and his
                        "Nationalist" followers at their own valuation may be inter- ested to learn
                        that, whilst British control in Egypt is sheer oppression and men like Lord
                        Cromer intolerable despots, the Congo Free State and its Sovereign are
                        objects of deserv- ing sympathy in the eyes of Egyptian patriots. The
                        "Egyptian Standard " of June 18 quotes with great complacency the
                        whitewashing report lately issued by the Congo authorities and especially
                        its glorification of King Leopold. For the report, it seems, refutes "the
                        attacks upon the Sovereign of the Congo State," which according to Mustapha
                        Pasha's organ, "have proceeded from the Imperialist Press in England, whose
                        appetite is ferocious and insa- tiable."</p>

                    <head>BRITISH SCHOOL'S EXHIBITION</head>
                    <byline>(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT)</byline>
                    <p>The annual visits to Egypt of Professor Flinders Petrie and his faithful
                        assistants of the British School of Archaeology in Egypt are invariably
                        productive of valuable results, and, thanks to their untiring labours, our
                        knowledge of anoieet Egypt civilization is being continually enlarged, and
                        with it our interest in this wonderful country and its people. The British
                        school deserve all the assistance it is possible to give them.</p>
                    <p>Last winter the work of the school was devoted to excavations at Ghizeh and
                        Ritah, and the exhibition of the antiquities found at these places, which
                        was opened at University College yesterday, is one of the meet interest- ing
                        and instructive yet seen. From these exhibits we learn that Egypt had a
                        unified civilisation more than 8,000 years before the Christian era. This
                        civilisation is found to have been exactly the same soon after the founding
                        of Memphis as it was in a given reign at Abydos, and the unification of the
                        country is shown by the absence of local differences. A very interesting
                        discovery at Ghizeh was a tomb of the first dynasty, dated to the reign of
                        King Zet. The central chambers had been cleared of their contents for the
                        Cairo Museum, but the surroundings were excavated and plans made by the
                        British School The tomb was probably that of some royal personage, for
                        around it were found over fifty small graves, about half of which contained
                        remains, which, however, had been plundered in ancient times. A number of
                        alabaster vases and bowls of metamorphic rock and slate were found in these
                        graves, which are of exactly the style of the contemporary vases from the
                        royal tombs at Abydos, and show that there was no differ- ence of style
                        between the upper and lower country. In the royal tomb the central burial
                        was in a wooden chamber, and the offerings were in four chambers, two at
                        each end of the great burial. Over this was a brick mastaba with panelled
                        sides, similar to that over Mena's grave at Nagada.</p>
                    <p>Undoubtedly the most valuable of all the discoveries were the pottery models
                        of the soul houses, found near Assiout The cemetery was of the
                        tenth-eleventh dynasties, and was excavated from under a bed of gravel. The
                        accumulation from the hills had gradually buried those pottery models of
                        houses which were placed upon the graves for the shelter of the soul. In the
                        earliest times offerings were made in the cemetery to satisfy the wandering
                        soul when it came out of the tomb at night to search for sustenance. A mat
                        was placed upon the ground, and a dish of flour set upon it.</p>
                    <p>From this series we are able to obtain a very good idea of the houses of the
                        peasantry of this period. The earliest type of house had a rooflike a Bedawy
                        tent propped up with two poles in front, which passed on into the form of a
                        portico, later the portico had a raised wall around the roof, which in turn
                        required a stairway to reach it. Then a hut was placed beneath the portico,
                        which developed into a back chamber with doorways. In some of these houses
                        we see models of artistic furniture, a couch with a head-rest upon it, a
                        chair, while a bread-maker is often shown at work.</p>
                    <p>Another striking feature of the exhibition is a splendid tomb of the twelfth
                        dynasty, in which two sons of the Prince of Shas-Hotep were buried. The tomb
                        is in perfect condition, and is one of the finest known of this period. The
                        inner case is elaborately painted, and the hieroglyphs are minutely drawn,
                        showing de- tails of the animals. The inscription is a fol- lows -. "Give an
                        offering to the King and to = Osiris lord of Daddu the great god lord of
                        Abydos, may he give a house of offerings, oxen, geese, clothing, and incense
                        for the kq of the devoted son of the prinoe Nekht-Ankh born of Khnumu-A.A.".
                        From this tomb were taken two excellent models of boats, one with the mast
                        removed, and the sail packed upon it, as if being rowed down the Nile, the
                        other with the mast up, and the crew engaged in hauling up the yard. Each
                        boat has a cabin, in front of which the captain is seated. The steering oars
                        are perfect, and finely painted with eyes of Horus, lotus flowers, and
                        rosettes on the blade. Bach has a long guiding pole attached to it, and the
                        steersman holds this with one hand so as to rotate the great oar for
                        steering, as on the boats seen on Lake Como at the present day.</p>
                    <p>There are many more points of interest, not the least striking of which are
                        the beautiful alabaster and breccia vases, curious ivory magic wands, carved
                        ivories, and the beautiful head work. The exhibition will be open until July
                        27.</p>

                    <head>NEXT SEASON's PLANS</head>
                    <p>During next season the British school hopes to commence the excavation of
                        Memphis, and an appeal to the public for funds has already been issued.
                        Professor Petrie says that the annual cost of this work, which he expects
                        will occupy 15 or 20 years, will be about £8,000, and in view of the value
                        which will attach to the discoveries at this ancient site, it is hoped that
                        the appeal for funds will be generously responded to. The site occupies
                        about one hundred acres, and it is expected operations will commence as soon
                        as the Nile is down, probably about the beginning of January next. Professor
                        Petrie will again have the assistance of Mr. Ernest Mackay, and, during a
                        part of each season, of Mr. Howard Carter, who will undertake the artistic
                        work, besides a number of student helpers. The expe- dition will leave
                        England in November.</p>

                    <head>HIS WORK AT SUAKIN.</head>
                    <p>The following statement appears in the "Standard."</p>
                    <p>An instance of neglect and hardship towards a humble builder of Empire in a
                        far outpost has come to our notice, and we gladly bring the matter before
                        our readers in the hope that some better fortune may come to the victim
                        through the publication of the particulars of his case.</p>
                    <p>Mr. J.F. Mason will be remembered by all those who visited Suakin between
                        1887 and 1900 as the "Officer Commanding Condensers." The lack of water in
                        that disagreeable outpost of Empire had to be met, as is well known, by the
                        erection of plant to condense sea water into fresh.</p>
                    <p>For some time this was done at a great expense, until Mr. Mason conceived the
                        idea of finding water in the desert outside the town. Starting on the theory
                        that where the coral reef is broken, tlie breech is due to the fact of an
                        outflow of fresh water which prevents the coral from growing. Mr. Mason set
                        to work, and found a splendid supply in a khor at Fort Charter. This in
                        itself is an achievement well worthy of reward.</p>
                    <p>For 13 years Mr. Mason worked hard at Suakin, and in the troublous times
                        during Lord Kitchener's ad ranee, Mr. Mason formed friendships with the
                        Hadendowa tribe, and alone of all the white man in the fortress went freely
                        among them.</p>
                    <p>Owing to the economies which were found necessary by the Egyptian Government,
                        Mr. Mason's appointment became superfluous, and in consequence, he left the
                        Egyptian service, without a pension, as he did not come under the terms of
                        the Khedive's pension list</p>
                    <p>We regret to say that Mr. Mason is now re- duced to want and is looking for
                        an appoint- ment as an engineer. He would admirably fill the position of an
                        engineer and carpenter to an estate, or some similar work. We have inquired
                        into his case, and feel that it is one that we ran heartily recommend. Lord
                        Kitchen- er, writing under date March 6, gives the following testimony:-</p>
                    <p>"Mr. F. Mason worked under me for many years in Egypt where he was in charge
                        of the condensers at Suakin. I know him to be a good, hard working, reliable
                        man, and I am very sorry to hear that he is now out of employment."</p>
                    <p>We hope that some employer of labour will be able to find a place for a very
                        deserving man, who has given the best part of his life to arduous labour in
                        a most insalubrious climate. Inquires will be gladly answered by the
                        Editor.</p>

                    <head>THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE AT ABBASSIA.</head>
                    <p>A second performance of "In Barcelona," by Mr. G.A. Campbell, was given at
                        Abbassia Barracks on Saturday evening last before an appreciative audience
                        of soldiers and civilians together with their families. "In Barcelona" is a
                        musical-comedy of stereotyped composition, wound round an essentially
                        meediocre plot, but, at the same time, containing many humorous local
                        references and much pithy wit. Judging the production from a friendly,
                        rather than a critical, aspect the author is to be congratulat- ed upon his
                        artistic ability and upon the many excellent theatrical touches, which he
                        has so successfully introduced into the play. From a musical point of view
                        the comedy was a marked success, the rendering of some of the songs being
                        faultless and the choruses were also most effective. It is obvious that
                        Messrs. Keppel and Lawrence, who were respon- sible for several of the best
                        additional num- bers and lyrics, have a good knowledge of their subject. Mr.
                        Campbell proved himself an indefatigable singer of the first order, an Pte.
                        A. Horrocks, as a Spanish brigand, gave a very true conception of his
                        part.</p>
                    <p>The play itself lost nothing by the acting, which was distinctly talented and
                        above the usual standard of amateur theatrical per- formances of this kind,
                        although at times their was an unfortunate tendency to lower the voice, so
                        much so indeed, that, in the case of Mr. Orred, as Mabel Brown, nothing
                        what- ever could be heard, even in the front rows. Drummer A. Hawes, as a
                        waiter, was extremely funny, but he occasionally sacrificed the humour of
                        the situation for the sake of exaggerated acrobatic contortions. The Hon.
                        Keppel, as Herr von Rodel, who performed his part very cleverly, deserves
                        special mention, if only on account of his skilful sustainment of a
                        difficult foreign accent. Sergt. Silver, as a chauffeur, was perhaps the
                        most successful actor of the company; his elocution was excep tionally sound
                        and he entered into the spirit of his part with an enthusiasm and
                        discretion, quite remarkable.</p>
                    <p>In short, the entire performance was of a high standard and justly merited
                        the storm of applause with which each item was received. The scenery was
                        excellent the costumes were artistic, and the orchestra, conducted by
                        Drum-Major Richardson, contributed in no small degree to the success of the
                        piece. In fact nothing marred the enjoyment of the evening, unless, perhaps,
                        the somewhat pro- longed interval between the acts, which delay was
                        responsible for those present missing the last tram, and one heartily
                        sympathised with the little child behind, who fretfully asked "When are they
                        going to pull up the blind?"</p>

                    <head>STATEMENT BY SIR E GREY.</head>
                    <p>Mr. Kettle having asked the Foreign Secre- tary whether he is now in a
                        position to give information as to certain casualtiesreported to have bean
                        sustained by No. 2 Company, Camel Corps, which left for Bir Natron, under
                        Bim- bashi Whittingham, in Frebruary last, Sir Edward Grey said: -The
                        garrison of Bir Natron evacuated that post on April 10 or 15, intending to
                        pro used to Abe Tbberi. where they expected to meet the convoy of supplies
                        which had left Debba on March 12. The party consist- ed of one officer, 40
                        men, eight women, one child, 38 camels, and a guide. On the fourth day of
                        their march, having failed to reach Abu Tabari, the guide confessed that he
                        had lost his way, and advised that scouts should be sent out. Two parties
                        were accordingly despatched, of which one found the convoy above referred
                        to, from which they obtained water for their party, and retraced their steps
                        On regaining their party they found only 11 men,seven women, and a boy; the
                        officer, 19 men, one woman, and two Arabs having for some reason which
                        cannot he ascertained, gone southwards with all the camels. A search party
                        was sent out to find them, but a dust storm frustrated their efforts, and
                        the remainder of party, with the help of the convoy, moved into Abu Tabari.
                        From there information as to the incident was sent to Khandak, and search
                        parties were at once sent out, with the result that the second aooating
                        party were discovered alive; but although every effort was made no trace
                        could be found of the officer's party which had started south, wife the
                        exception of one body. It is, therefore, to be feared that the officer,
                        Mulazim Awal Ali Effendi Hassan, and the 22 persons with him have lost their
                        lives. All the survivors are well and have arrived at El Bab, in Wadi el

                    <p>Writing from Liverpool under date of the 29th ult. Messrs. Codings Brothers
                        report the manipulation still continuing in the near positions both in
                        Liverpool and in New York keeps the market in a nervous state. Mean- while,
                        as far as the new crop is concerned, we have had another week of generally
                        favorable news and the coming Agricultural Bu- reau's Report on the
                        "condition" will doubtless shew a considerable improvement. At present the
                        general idea seems to be about 6 to 7 improvement on the month.</p>

                            <p>Sir E. Satow, on behalf of Great Britain, rejected the American
                                proposal with regard to the inviolability of private property at sea
                                on the ground that it tended to limit the right to blockade. What
                                Great Britain thought neces- sary was to establish respect of the
                                right of neutrals, hence her proposal regarding the abolition of
                                contraband. Germany is apparently the only Power opposing the
                                prohibition of drifting mines. (Reuter)</p>

                                case of emergency then reach San Francisco before any other fleet.
                                Three additional battleships and several cruisers will join the
                                fleet in the Pacific. (Reuter)</p>

                        enchan- ced the afternoon's enjoyment.</p>
                    <p>A dinner was given on board by the Ad- miral, at which several of the Port
                        Said residents were present. A tennis match was also played by the officers
                        against Port Said Tennis Club, resulting in a win for Port Said. The
                        following was the result:- Dr. Hayward and Mr. Ingram beat Com- manders
                        Harper and Trewby 6 to 4—6 to 3. Mr. Broatch and Mr. Howe beat Commanders
                        Harper and Trewby 6 to 1—6 to 3. Dr. Hayward and Mr. Ingram beat Mr. King
                        and Mr. H. W. Jackson, 6 to 2—6 to 1. Mr. Broatch and Mr. Howe beat Com-
                        manders Harper and Trewby, 6 to 0—6 to 3.</p>
                    <p>On Monday afternoon, the Admiral and Officers gave a very enjoyable "At Home"
                        on ship, which was open for inspection and the band played an excellent
                        selection of music. In the evening a smoking concert was given by the men at
                        Navy House. On Tuesday another cricket match, played on the club ground,
                        between officers and members of the P.S.C.C.U. lower deck, resulted in win
                        for the lower deck, the men's bowling being very good. On Wednesday, the
                        officers and lower deck and P.S.C.C. played the P. &amp; 0. S.S. "Moldavia",
                        twelve a side, the victory being with the Club. In the evening, the officers
                        entertained at dinner some of the players, and after dinner billiard and
                        bridge matches were arranged. Port Said won at billiards, but was defeated
                        at bridge. After a most enjoyable stay at Port Said, the ship left this
                        morning at 6 a.m. to join the fleet.</p>

                    <p>The Duke of Marlborough on Wednesday week entertained Sir Alfred Jones and
                        the Council of the British Cotton Growing Asso- ciation to a banquet in the
                        Constitutional Club. Mr. Winston Churchill, M.P., proposing pros- perity to
                        the Association, said one weak spot in the magnificent cotton industry of
                        this country was the danger of a corner in the raw material by improper
                        speculation in American markets. Our safeguard lay in broadening and
                        multiplying the areas of cotton supply, and Nigerian railways and other
                        developments which would effect the security of the supply, would have every
                        scrap of his influence. Sir Alfred Jones said Africa would soon send
                        £1,000,000 sterling per annum to this country.</p>

                    <p>The following letter appears in the "Stan- dard":</p>
                    <p>Sir,-I have received a letter from a young Arab who is well known to me, and
                        who is now working under the Government in Egypt. The following quoatation
                        may be of interest, especially as I can vouch for the honesty of purpose,
                        the fidelity to England and English interest, and intelligency of the writer
                        :-</p>
                    <p>"Do you hear about Egypt and the Arabic papers? Many of them speak rudely
                        against the English and the Army of Occupation. The one thing that has
                        spoiled Egypt is the freedom of the Press; they should not have been allow-
                        ed so much of it. I notice from the Egyp- tians here that they dislike the
                        English, but when they stand in the presence of an English- man they curl
                        their tails like dogs, and use the word 'sir' very frequently. But when they
                        gather together in a public place, every one speaks out, and displays his
                        impudence."</p>
                    <p>I am, Sir, your obedient servant. ONE WHO HAS LIVED AMONG ARABS FOR MANY

                    <head>MOSQUES AND CHRISTIANS.</head>
                    <p>Constantinople has at present a little episode which may be said to present
                        some analogy to the recent "Mikado" question in England. The Golden Horn
                        also suffers under an unexpected interdict, and one that causes both
                        irritation and dissapointment to thousands of tourists. Hitherto Christians
                        have been as free to roam the mosques as Moslems, whereas now the former are
                        forbidden to enter. The reason for the interdict is almost as singular as
                        that against "The Mikado" in England. There are susceptibilities in the
                        case. Some time since the Sultan sent to the Yemen a mission to try to
                        achieve by persuasion the pacification that arms have failed to secure. The
                        mission has recently returned to Stamboul accompanied by a number of Sheikhs
                        of the Yemen, all perfervid Moslems who pray in the mosques daily and who
                        have never seen a Christian in their lives. To meet one, and especially a
                        woman, in the very sanctuary of Islam, would destroy their allegiance to the
                        Commander of the Faithful. And as everything is to be done to conciliate
                        their fanaticism, no Christians must be seen in the mosques</p>

                    <p>Miss A.M. Steadman, living at 130, Cam- bridge Road, Kilburn, London, England
                        says :- "I wish I could tell you how thankful I am for the good Doan's
                        Backache Kidney Pills have done me. They have saved my life. Before I began
                        using them, the doctor said I could'nt live another three months, but that
                        was a year and a quarter ago, and I'm at well to-day as ever I was in my
                        life.</p>
                    <p>"Before using Doan's Pills I was suffering from Bright's disease and dropsy.
                        My body was so swollen that I couldn't get my clothes or boots on ; the
                        pains in my back were fear- fully agonizing, and I could hardly breathe.
                        Though I went under hospital treatment, and had the best of medical advice,
                        I kept getting worse and worse until I began with Doan's Pills. I cannot
                        speak too highly of this medi- cine, for it did me good from the first, and
                        although it was a year and a quarter ago that I was cured, I am still in
                        splendid health."</p>

                        Doan's Backache Kidney Pills ; for Doan's Pills help the kidneys to purify
                        the blood and drive out the dissolved or crystallised poisons that— when
                        kept back in the body by clogged kidneys -cause fatal kidney complaints such
