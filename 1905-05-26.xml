                    <p>London, May 25.</p>
                    <p>House of Commons.— Sir E. Grey gave notice of a vote of censure, declaring
                        that in view of the confusion created by the conflicting declarations of Mr.
                        Balfour and other Ministers, the House dooms i; necessary that the electors
                        should have an opportunity of expressing their opinions regarding
                        preferential taxation on food before the Colonial Conference is held.

                    <p>London, May 25.</p>
                    <p>House of Commons.—There was a lively passage of arms between Mr. Balfour and
                        Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman with reference to fixing a day for a vote of
                        censure. Mr. Balfour declined to fix a day owing to Sir Henry not having
                        given the undertaking that the debate should be conducted in an orderly
                        manner and because he is bound to see that there is no repetition of
                        Monday's outrage. Sir Henry refused to give the required pledge, but finally
                        added that he had no objection to other Ministers speaking before Mr.
                        Balfour. The latter then fixed the 30th-inst. (Reuter.)</p>

                    <head>OUR PIGMY VISITORS. INTERESTING LECTURE IN CAIRO.</head>
                    <p>A meeting of the Cairo Scientific Society was held yesterday afternoon at the
                        Kasr-el-Ainy School of Medicine. Dr. Craig presided. After the minutes of
                        the last meeting had been read by Dr. Wilson, secretary of the society. Dr.
                        Craig called on Dr. Elliot-Smith to read a paper on "Pigmies.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. Elliot Smith, whose name is well-known not only in Egypt, but in any part
                        of the world, by those who have studied anatomy, and especially those
                        interested in the anatomy of the brain, then gave a most interesting lecture
                        on pigmies in general, with special reference to those who have recently
                        visited Cairo, and are now on their way to London. He pointed out that the
                        six pigmies, consisting of four males and two females, who had been under
                        their care in the Kasr-el-Ainy Hospital, and who had aroused such interest
                        in the pigmy race, could not be taken as typical specimens. They are
                        considerably smaller than the average pigmy, and had evidently been selected
                        on account of their small size, and of the six, only two, i.e., one man and
                        one woman, are adult. The ages of these two are in all probability
                        approximately 35 years, and those of the other four are, as nearly as Dr.
                        Elliot-Smith could estimate, eleven, seventeen, eighteen, and twenty years
                        this last being the age of the second woman of the party.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Elliot-Smith passed a number of photographs round for examination, which
                        showed the bones of the pigmies taken by Rontgen rays, and his lecture was
                        also illustrated by excellent lantern-slides, which clearly showed up the
                        various characteristics which Dr. Smith pointed out, as for instance the
                        "pepper-corn" hair, the exceedingly broad alae or sides of the nose, and the
                        peculiarly prominent abdomen. </p>
                    <p>Questioned by Dr. Wilson as to what he thought of their intelligence, Dr.
                        Elliot-Smith said he considered that they were of a distinctly keener
                        intellect than the fellaheen of Egypt, and showed much sharpness in
                        recognising objects from drawings. </p>
                    <p>Dr. Keatinge remarked that on the afternoon on which the pigmies left Cairo
                        they expressed their great delight at starting for England, by singing and
                        dancing excitedly, and that both their music and their actions greatly
                        resembled those of the negro inhabitants of Egypt. </p>
                    <p>We are enable to give a full account of Dr. Elliot-Smith’s most excellent
                        lecture to-day, but hope to be able to reproduce the full text of his paper
                        in an early issue. </p>

                    <head>CAIRO’S WATER SUPPLY.</head>
                    <p>In the paragraph we published yesterday under the above heading, a
                        typographical error occurred. We should have stated that the increase in the
                        water pumped by the Water Company during the past 15 days was 20,000 metres
                        cube per day and not 2,000 m. The following figures will be of interest.
                        Since the 11th May, when the heat wave commenced, up to the 25th, the
                        company have pumped practically one million metres cube. In 14 days this
                        gives an average of 70,000 m. per day. For the corresponding 14 days last
                        year they pumped 700,000 m, making a difference of 300,000 m. in 14 days, or
                        rather over 20,000 m. increase per day. This will be of interest to the
                        public, as showing the great effect the temperature has on the water
                        consumption. 70,000 m. per day among, say, 60,000 people gives 116 litres
                        per head per day, which we are sure cannot be considered a bad supply. The
                        official of the Water Company whom we interviewed on the subject said : "If
                        the public would only try to assist the company during these hot times by
                        preventing waste as much as possible, they would. Besides making things
                        easier for the company, greatly benefit themselves." </p>

                    <p>The committee of the Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners, in
                        their quarterly report, say— "During the past three months the cotton
                        industry has continued in a state of prosperity which is without precedent
                        for more than 20 years. From the beginning of January to the end of April
                        the margin between the price of middling American cotton and 32’s twist yarn
                        shows an average of 3‘47d. per lb., which is more than 1/2d. per lb. higher
                        than the average for the corresponding period last year. Under these
                        favorable circumstances handsome profits are now being realised by American
                        spinners, and the accumulated adverse balances of the recent bad seasons are
                        being rapidly swept away. Our members have been fully employed during the
                        whole of the year and are gradually recovering from the effects of the
                        prolonged short time working of the past year. Unfortunately, there is as
                        yet no marked improvement in the Egyptian section of the trade.” </p>

                        afternoon. After having received Mustapha Pasha Pehmy, the Premier, and the

                    <p>The "Amphitrite" weighed anchor at a quarter past three, when a salute of 21

                        <head>EMPIRE DAY CONCERT.</head>
                        <p>An open-air concert was held at the Kasr el Nil Barracks on Wednesday
                            evening in celebration of the anniversary of Empire Day. An excellent
                            programme had been arranged by Mr. R Watson Ramsey, bandmaster of the
                            2nd Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, and a large audience was present to
                            enjoy it. The concert was commenced at 9.30 p.m. by the playing of
                            Gounod’s overture “Mirella" by the Inniskilling Fusiliers' band, and
                            this was followed by a comic song, "Shifted lower down," sung by Private
                            McCracken, who was loudly encore. Next came Mr. Lloyd-Jones, who gave us
                            an excellent rendering of Martial’s well-known song, “The River of
                            Years,” and he Was followed by Major J. P. Donegan, R.A.M.C, who scored
                            the great success of the evening. Major Donegan started with a splendid
                            parody on "The Boys of the Old Brigade” entitled "The Time Expired," and
                            this was succeeded by another parody on "Peace," the song sung by the
                            Rajah of Bhong in the "Country Girl.” Major Donegan received encore
                            after encore but was always prepared with an encore verse, none of which
                            failed to draw great applauds on account of their originality and their
                            references to the profession of the greater part of his audience. The
                            first half of the programme was concluded by a display of club-swinging
                            by Private J. McCreanor in which he showed great cleverness and
                            smartness in the handling of the clubs. </p>
                        <p>In the second-half Lieutenant G. C. Adams sang “The Muleteers" and
                            greatly pleased the audience with his rendering of it, and when as an
                            encore be gave us "A Laughing Song” we were all compelled to laugh with
                            him. Captain Tucker was in excellent voice , and the good old Irish song
                            "The Old Plaid Shawl" well suited him, and made us wish for more, but
                            want of time forbade any more encores being given. We must not omit to
                            mention Mrs. Jackson and Private A. Hendry, who added to the comic
                            element of the concert, and Sergeant Downes, R.E., who sang "Why did
                            they sell Killarney." An excellent entertainment was there brought to a
                            close at 11.30 p.m. by the playing of "God Save the King." </p>

                            the committee Mrs. Gamble (vice-president) Mrs. Gordon and the Rev. H. B
                            Norman-Lee were present. The attendance, for various reasons, was,
                            unfortunately, not as large as last year. Among those present were Mm.
                            Degiarde, Mme. Stouts, Miss Demeah, Mme. William Pegna, Mme. Mario
                            Vells, Miss Pegna, Mrs. John Ross, Mrs. Lawrence, Mr. and Mrs. Moss,
                            Mrs. Field and Col. Watson. </p>
                        <p>After reading the balance sheets of both the general and clothing ends,
                            the general and clothing funds, the host secretary (Major Ludlow)
                            thanked the members of the committee for the assistance that had given
                            the past, and especially asked for a vote of thanks to Mrs. Gamble who,
                            whilst already having by far the largest number of women to look after,
                            had also most kindly undertaken the care of those of the Anny Ordnance
                            Department, owing to there being no lady of that department in the
                            garrison. He also expressed the great regret of the committees at the
                            serious illness of Mrs. Norman Lee, and spoke of the loss her absence
                            was to them. He then offered the hearty thanks of the committee to those
                            ladies who so very kindly undertaken the work of collecting clothing and
                            money for the association and paid a special tribute to the very great
                            generosity and kindness of the foreign ladies, who not only by their
                            generous gifts of money and clothing but by their kindly interest in the
                            wives and children of soldiers of the Army of Occupation had very
                            largely associated the committee. He explained that the wives and
                            children of noncommissioned officers and men were not able to leave
                            Egypt every year, when the hot weather commenced, like ordinary
                            individuals, and that very often they had to remain out in this country
                            for four or five years without change , and naturally become liable to
                            the various ill effects which always result from a prolonged residence
                            in a hot climate. He referred to the work of the clothing branch, which
                            apart from ordinary cases enable the committee to provide with warm
                            clothing, women and children, who after several years in the country,
                            were ordered home to the much colder climate of England. In conclusion
                            he again thanked the foreign ladies on behalf of the General Officer
                            Commanding the officers, N.C officers and men of the Army of Occupation
                            for their most generous and kindly co-operation in the work of the
                            association. Special votes of thanks were passes to Mme. Degiarde, Mme.
                            Alekakis, and Miss Demech. </p>

                            demanda l'annulation de la surenchère pour cause de tardivité de
                            sa-dénonciation. L'avocat dn surenchérisseur étant absent, son manda

                            dispositions do l'art 125 du Code de Procédure •Civile^ demanda que le
                            défaut'fut rabattu et ié débat ouvert, mais en vain. Le Tribunal re fusa
                            le rabattement ot s en tint k sa première décision.^</p>
                        <p>Sur l’appel do oette affaire, la Cour viontde réformer'le jugement
                            attaqué : elle déclare la surenchère faite par Moussa Banum bonne et
                            valable et ordonne qu’il y soitdonné suite daus loi formes dé, droit,
                            sauf aux parties à aviser entre elles h tout autre règlement de leurs

                        <p>Attendu,, dit l'arrêt, qu'en décidant ainsi, les premiers juges ont
                            méconnu les dispositions de l’article 125 dn Code de' Procédure.</p>
                        <p>Qu'en effet le tribunal ayant prononoé par défaut, ce défaut pouvait être
                            rabattu dès l'in- stant que le'défaillant momentanément em pêché se

                        <p>Que l’on peut admettre, par une interpréta tion rationnellq de oet
                            article qu'une déclara- tion de surenchère est nulle de plein droit,
                            sans débat possible et sans nécessité d’une dérision proclamant cette

                            du saisissant et des dé- biteurs inscrits ; mais qu’il n’en est. plus de

                    <head>DU PRINCE HA1DAR</head>
                    <p>S. A. le prince Haidar a donné hier dans la salle du Khédivial une conférence
                        sur la poésie. Il en a retracé à grands traita l'histoire à travers les
                        âges, et on a dépeint avec an charme exquis le rôle divin qui est de mora-
                        liser l’homme. Bien que les favoris des muses aient été de tous temps eu
                        butte aux misères do la vie, jamais cependant un positivismo aussi absolu
                        qu'à 1 heure actuelle n’avait dominé lo monde et rendu plus ardue la tâche
                        du poète. Cela n’at pas empéché le dix ueuvième siècle d’en produire une
                        pléiade de toit premier ordre. </p>
                    <p>Le prince, qui est un poète do talent et qai le laisse bieu voir par la
                        chaleur et l’élévation do sud langage, a ousuite passé rapidement en revue
                        les poètes do l’antiquité et les poètes modernes. L’éloge enthousiaste qu’il
                        a con- sacré au grand génie do la Grèce, Homère, a été salué des
                        applaudissements de toute la salle. Puis d’Homère, il a passé à la pléiade
                        fronça se du dix-neuvième siècle. 11 oonvient de dire à ce propos qu’il
                        connaît à merveille l’histoire de oette dernière poésie qu’il a su émailler
                        d’anecdotes spirituelles et typiques. Il lajugsdeplus avoc une compétence et
                        une sûreté qui sont une preuve de sun goût. Parmi les poètes de oette époque
                        qu’il admire da- vantage, citons André Chénier, Victor Hugo, Lamartino, A.
                        de Musset. Il professe aussi pour Leoonts’de Liste une admiration sans
                        bornes et en oela il a grandement raison : aucun antre, eu effet, ne l’égale
                        pour la force, la ooncision et le-souffle épique de ses œuvres.</p>
                    <p>Noua ne voulons pas terminer ce trop court aperça sans adresser au prince
                        notre tribut d’admiration pour la façon vraiment magis- trale, on pourrait
                        dire inspirée, avec laquelle il déclame les fragments poétiques.</p>

                        génies militaires et politiques ; il appartiendra peut- être au prince
                        Haidar d’ajouter à oette cou- ronne de gloire le fieurou littéraire.</p>

                    <head>SECOND SUMMER MEETING.</head>
                    <p>The first day's racing of the A. S. C. Second Summer Meeting took piece in
                        fine weather yesterday. The enclosure was fairly crowded and a good deal of
                        animation prevailed. The racing presented no particular , feature of
                        interest, though the events were in every case wll contested. The most
                        popular win was Gogo's in the Alexandria Derby. In this race El Tahawi was a
                        strong favorite among backers, by whom he was largely , patronised, but in
                        the event he only managed to secure second place. To those who knew Mohsen
                        Pasha’s horse, however, his victory was never for a moment in doubt. The
                        race for the Maiden Pony, Plate provided a close finish. The changes were
                        all in favour of Suleik, but India looked all over a winner and would have
                        probably come first past the post had not Mr. Barker held back too long. The
                        May Handicap provided an easy win for Roi de l’Air. In the Mustapha Stakes,
                        Mabrouk, after winning, broke down lame. The held was in excellent
                        condition, but one's view of the horses was considerably obscured by a long
                        wooden boarding which has been- erected in the centre of the ground in
                        connection with the proposed pigeon shooting contests. It is to be hoped
                        that the structure is not a permanent one. In the unavoidable absence of Mr.
                        H. Barker, Mr. A. P. Friend efficiently discharged the duties of judge,
                        while Mr. Bassett acted as starter. The band of the R. Berkshire Regiment
                        was present and enhanced the pleasure of the meeting by a choice selection
                        of music. The following are the results of the various events :—</p>
                    <p>MUSTAPHA STAKES of P.T. 5,000, viz : P.T. 4,000 to winner, P.T. 700 to 2nd
                        horse, and P.T. 200 to 3rd horse. For Arabs and C. B’s. Weight for age and

                    <p>Mabrouk got the worst of a bad start but soon took up the lead and made all
                        the runing until the finish, when he was nearly caught by Mouftakhar. He
                        broke down just after passing the post, a length ahead of the latter. Ten
                        lengths divided second and third. Time, 2.32.</p>
                    <p>Potalisator paid P.T. 24 on winner and P.T. 36 and 28 for places.</p>

                    <p>Radium made the running, followed at close quarters by Menelik. On turning
                        into the straight Tamerlan, Menelik II., and Rachid were abreast. A splendid
                        race up the straight ended in a victory for Rachid by half a length from
                        Tamerlan, the same distance dividing the latter from Radium. Mizzaud
                        finished a good fourth, Menelik II. fifth, and Kendal sixth. Time, 1.22.</p>
                    <p>Totalisator paid P.T. 31 on winner, and P.T. 20, 28, and 152 for places.</p>

                        half, Viking losing second place from India by a bare beck. There was a good
                        race down the straight, the whole field riding; and the chances are that if
                        Barker had not stayed his mount too long the race would have been his.
                        Viking, with Matthews up, ran a good race too, and made a plucky effort to
                        get to the front, but it was of no avail. Time, 1.53. </p>

                    <head>CELEBRATION IN LONDON.</head>
                    <p>At the Holborn Restaurant last week the Pan Islam Society held its meeting in
                        honor of the anniversary of the birth of Mohamed. </p>
                    <p>The function took place in a large upper room, where jovial frescoes stared
                        from the walls at the constrained gathering of Mussulmans, who reflected in
                        London the worldwide celebration of a momentous event. There were, perhaps,
                        a hundred and fifty people assembled, and these presented as strange a
                        medley of types as any to be found west of the Levant. A splendid old Turk,
                        his hair grizzled aider his fez, sat among a group of airy babas from the
                        Inns of Court, while a young English girl and her mother came in the company
                        of a Persian youth with a delicately chiselled, sensitive lace, the colour
                        of old gold. At the back of the room there, stood a knot of swarthy, bearded
                        men, Arabs, Moors, and Egyptians, on whom the conventional frock-coats sat
                        oddly. Many wore green ties—the mark of the man who has accomplished the
                        Mecca pilgrimage.</p>
                    <p>The business of the meeting was to hear addresses on the Prophet,
                        biographical and expository. One speaker after another rose and accomplished
                        his part in careful, stilted English, while the mixed audience of brown and
                        white people listened amiably. It might have been a conference during the
                        May Meetings—the tone and atmosphere were identical. There was no hint of
                        the war- like tradition of Islam. The speakers even fell at times to a tone
                        almost apologetic, though Mr. Suhrawardy, the secretary of the society,
                        dwelt finely on the share of the desert in the shaping of Eastern ideas and
                        ideals. Sheikh Abdul Uder, on the other hand, stated that Mohamedans held
                        the Jews guilty of a great error when they failed to welcome Christ and
                        acknowledge his divine mission. “But the Christians, who received him," he
                        went on, "made the same mistake in rejecting Mohamed."</p>
                    <p>With these addresses, the meeting wore out its sober length—staid and
                        orderly. Yet the sheikh made an apt referenoe to its strangeness when he
                        recalled the celebrations he had known in India.</p>
                    <p>"There we all squatted, respectably on the floor,” he said, “and good men
                        read recitations and long poems in praise of the Prophet, which the people
                        repeated with their lips. And here, the men and women sit together with
                        carpets under their feet."</p>

                    <head>THE SWORD OF ISLAM.</head>
                    <p>We cordially welcome Mr. Arthur Wollaston's admirable book on Islam. It is,
                        in our opinion, far and away the best popular presentment of the “Prophet”
                        and his teachings that has yet appeared in English. The author treats his
                        subject as a scholar and a gentleman should ; and it is, perhaps, the first
                        time in England that a competent writer has dealt in this spirit with the
                        stock religion, if we may so term it, of the great Semitic race. Not one of
                        the creeds professed by our Eastern fellowmen has been so persistently
                        misrepresented as that of Mohamed. Mr. Wollaston’s book will help to remove
                        some of the current prejudices and prepossessions in regard to the followers
                        of Mohamed. Not that he has any leanings towards Islam, or, indeed, any
                        enthusiasm for its tenets. But he is eminently fair, and always writes of
                        that to which he is opposed with courtesy and forbearance. His work is not
                        an original study to any great extent, although few would have been better
                        qualified to have given us such a new view of Islam as the translator of the
                        Anwa’r-i-Suhaili and the compiler of our best English-Persian dictionary.
                        Mr. Wollaston has preferred to rely largely on Sir William Muir, Gibbon, and
                        Sir Richard Burton. But his sympathetic insight leads him so to dispose his
                        material as to put the subject in a clearer, better, and more appreciative
                        light than hitherto. The reader will find in the book a full and exhaustive
                        account of everything relating to Islam—its founder, its tenets and
                        traditions, its sects, and its wars. Nothing is omitted, from legends and
                        fables to such reformers as Muqanna, the veiled prophet of Khorassan, and
                        Bab, the "Gale," as he called himself, of God, who founded the Babis as
                        recently as 1820. The binding nature of the Koran is so often insisted upon
                        by English writers on Islam that we venture to quote the following, which,
                        it should not be forgotten, is the deliberate utterance of a British Indian
                        administrator who has been in contact with Moslems for over fifty years:</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding that the Quran is regarded as the fundamental part of their
                        civil law, yet the secular tribunals do not consider themselves bound to
                        observe the same in all cases, but frequently give judgment against those
                        decisions which are not consonant to equity and reason.</p>
                    <p>M. Wollaston's book is full of strange, quaint, and interesting facts, which
                        we should like to quote, but space forbids. We can only strongly recommend
                        the work to all who desire to obtain a sympathetic understanding of the
                        millions of the East nearest to us in their religions conceptions, and who
                        would know Islam and its followers as they really are.</p>

                    <head>IN SEARCH OF THE NORTH POLE.</head>
                    <p>What an object of disappointed effort the North Pole is! Expedition after
                        expedition starts out fall of hope to explore the regions round it, only in
                        due time to give up the quest and to struggle back, aided or unaided, to
                        sunnier seas. Last week there sailed quietly from the Thames for the Far
                        North the “Terra Nova,” which goes in rear oh of Mr. Fiala and some
                        thirty-five companions, who form what is known as the Ziegler Expedition.
                        Two years ago this expedition left the United States, and it has not been
                        heard of since. The American millionnaire whose name it bears has bought and
                        fitted out the "Terra Nova” as a rescue ship, and she set sail with as
                        little fuss as if bound for the Mediterranean. The Ziegler Expedition was
                        well found, and although there is naturally some anxiety as to its safety,
                        it is hoped that there may be news of those who compose it before many
                        months are over. The “Terra Nova,” at all events, is in most competent
                        hands, and the best wishes of all will follow her on her perilous
                        mission.</p>

                    <head>A GREAT POSSIBILITY.</head>
                    <p>Once more the hopes of doctors and patients alike have been roused by a case
                        of the apparent core of cancer. Dr. Harper, the President of the Chicago
                        University, was operated on for a cancerous growth. It was declared to be
                        irremovable, and he was doomed to death by the surgeons. But since then be
                        has been treated with a combination of radium and the X-rays, and the
                        results are said to be marvellous. He himself considers that he is cured. Of
                        course, there is as yet no guarantee that the cure is permanent. Even if it
                        proves to be so, many more trials and investigations will be necessary
                        before any systematic method of cure applicable to all cancer cases can be
                        formulated with any confidence. But the case is a sufficiently remarkable
                        one to provide at any rate a substructure of hope that the first real blow
                        has been struck at the disease.</p>

                    <head>RADIUM GIVING OUT</head>
                    <head>PRICE RISES TO £600,000 AN OUNCE.</head>
                    <p>The price of radium has increased so much recently, owing to the difficulty
                        of obtaining farther supplies, that research work is almost at a standstill.
                        Sir William Ramsay told a press representative that as much as £20 a
                        milligramme, or at the rate of £600,000 an ounce, was being demanded, and
                        the quantity available, even at that price, is very small indeed.</p>
                    <p>“What could be got for £2 some time ago, when radium was less known than it
                        is,” said one of the principals of Messrs. Armbrecht, Nelson, and Co., at
                        the Duke-street pharmacy, where most, of the radium that has come to England
                        has been stored, "is now being sold for £100, and the price is steadily
                        growing up. Strong radium is being manufactured by only one man that I know
                        of a German named Giesel, and the quantity available is exceedingly small. I
                        don't believe that there has been more than half an ounce of radium
                        manufactured since Mme. Curie discovered the new element. Two mines in
                        Cornwall were believed to have radio-active pitchblende, and a British
                        company was formed to exploit it, but the venture was abandoned. Other
                        efforts are being made in America to increase the supply. So far, however,
                        they have been unsuccessful."</p>
                    <p>Another attempt, we understand, is to be made to get radium from the Cornish
                        mines. This time a German is to toy the experiment. That there is
                        pitchblende in some of the mites in Cornwall is certain, but the doubtful
                        point is whether it is radio-active. The German who has decided to test the
                        question believes that radioactive pitchblende, in payable quantity can be
                        extracted. He has been interviewing one or two leading British scientists,
                        including Sir William Ramsay, on the subject.</p>
                    <p>At present the prospect with regard to the supply of radium is a poor one,
                        and unless new sources are found, or scientists are able to realise the
                        possibility suggested by Sir William Ramsay of reconstructing the elements
                        into which radium decomposes, a valuable adjunct to medical science will in
                        course of time be lost. While it has not yet been established that it cures
                        cancer, experiments have shown that it kills bacteria when brought into
                        direct contact, and its value in other diseases is being more and more
                        recognised.</p>
                    <p>It is calculated that strong radium gives out at the rate of a thousandth
                        part of a milligramme in a thousand years, so that the half-ounce at present
                        in evidence will take some time to disappear altogether.</p>

                    <head>HOPEFUL OUTLOOK.</head>
                    <p>London, May 19.</p>
                    <p>The recent heavy fall in North Niles was by no means encouraging, but in the
                        Egyptian department it is believed that the worst is over, and accordingly
                        speculators are quietly picking up parcels of various shares and putting
                        them away against a recrudescence of activity. The position with regard to
                        North Niles is not quite easy to gauges but the glorious uncertainty of gold
                        mining is a factor to be taken into account, and it is not impossible that
                        further exploration may reveal an increase in gold values. The shares remain
                        steady at about 10s., and the “shop" is understood to have acquired the bulk
                        of them again at this and somewhat higher prices. Nile Valley Block “B” have
                        attracted attention on the developments reported from tho Dongola
                        Concession, a reef having been struck assaying in the east shaft, 12dwts.
                        over 2ft. 3 in., and in the east shaft 1oz. over 1ft. Nubias are firm, with
                        no quotable alteration in price. A settlement in Egyptian Options has been
                        applied for. A circumstance which suggests that we may hear more of
                        Egyptians before long is that there are now inquiries for shares in which
                        the transactions have for months been only on a limited scale. Eridia
                        Exploring, Fatira Exploring, Central Egyptian Explorations, and many others
                        of the quiet shares appear to be coming to the front again. A new Dongola
                        Company is due the week after next.</p>
