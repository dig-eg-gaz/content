                    <head>CAIRO DISTILLERIES.</head>
                    <p>A matter of great importance in many ways, and one demanding immediate
                        attention, i dealt with in its various bearings, physical, moral, and
                        political, by the writer of "Under the Mosquito Net" in our columns to day.
                        The quotations he makes from a letter received from a correspondent in Cairo
                        are alone suffi cient proof that such places as are described actually
                        exist. How is it that up to the present time they have been allowed to
                        flourish, and exert their pernicious influence unchecked and apparently
                        unnoticed? The official answer would doubtless be to the effect that the
                        Capitulations stand in the way of anything being done to suppress not only
                        these practices, but many others that would be firmly taken in hand, if
                        action, both by British and native officials, were not paralysed by these
                        absurd and utterly out-of-date obligations. And although in view of what has
                        taken place in regard to lotteries, some might incline <cb n="6"/> to the
                        opinion that in the matter of clearing away these stills it may also be
                        found that "where there's a will there's a way," it is extremely difficult,
                        as things are now, to suggest that way. All that appears possible is to lose
                        no opportunity of showing up from time to time, and in every way possible,
                        the existing state of affairs under the Capitulations. Nothing would help so
                        greatly to secure their abolition,—or at least abrogation,-in matters on
                        which they paralyse all efforts for the moral purification of this country,
                        as the creation of a strong public opinion, determined to make a clean sweep
                        of all these dens of iniquity that make our cities a by-word of reproach. We
                        have already seen what can be effected in the various Courts of Europe by
                        the persistent action of the National Vigilance Association in England, and
                        there is no reason whatever why the British Government should not take very
                        decided action to bring about a moral cleansing of Cairo. Our contributor
                        suggests independent enquiry; we would prefer something more in the way of
                        the Royal Commissions that are from time to time appointed in England to
                        thoroughly investigate, and obtain the best and most reliable information
                        on, the subjects they hove to report upon. Such an enquiry need not be a
                        long one; these is plenty of evidence to be had for the asking, and if the
                        matter were taken up at once and with energy, we might, ere another winter
                        season brings us its visitors, have a cleaner Capital, and one offering them
                        less temptation to the indulgence in vicious</p>

                    <head>ENGLISH COMMERCIAL TRAVELLERS.</head>
                    <p>In another column we publish an interesting statement from the report of the
                        Austro-Hungarian Consul in Cairo on the subject of commercial travellers in
                        Egypt, wherein he states that both in quality and quantity the Germans are
                        far and away superior. In fact, he states that whereas 60 per cent. of
                        travellers during the 1903-04 seson represented German houses, English firms
                        were only represented by about four. How. these figures were obtained we do
                        not know. The only possible source of information could be the Passport
                        Offices at the ports. But such information could not be considered reliable,
                        as many Englishmen combine business with pleasure and style themselves
                        "tourists," although they utilise their trip to Egypt for the benefit of
                        their business. We venture to differ from the statements contained in this
                        Consular report, for all our evidence tends to show that now British
                        commercial travellers are not only on the increase in Egypt, but are fully
                        alive to the requirements of the market.</p>

                        smallpox is easily spread among the pilgrims in general, and is not fought
                        against at Yambo, where persons attacked by smallpox are dispersed
                        everywhere. The delegate says that he himself noticed a case of small pox
                        among the pilgrims with the Mahmal, and another was that of the wife of the
                        doctor who accom- panied the Egyptian caravan on behalf of the Sanitary
                        Administration.</p>
                    <p>Eight thousand pilgrims are ready to leave for Tor, five thousand of whom are
                        Egyptian. Their condition of health is satisfactory.</p>

                    <p>The child to whom the unfortunate accident happened on the railway line which
                        we re- counted in our issue of yesterday, is the five- year-old daughter of
                        M. Debbane, Brazilian Consul-General. The injuries which she sustained are
                        more serious than was at first believed, and as yet she cannot unfortunately
                        be pro- nounced out of danger. It appears that the child was not knocked out
                        of the carriage, but feel out owing to the door not being properly fastened. </p>
                    <p>Mme Debbane, who was in the carriage with her daughter, driven to despair,
                        was only pre- vented from throwing herself on the line, in a wild desire to
                        save her daughter, by a gentleman who happened to be in her company.</p>
                    <p>On the train being stopped, Prince Mohamed Ibrahim, Mohamed Bey Said, and
                        Mohamed Bey Rassehm joined the other passengers in the search for the girl
                        and gave every assistance in their power. The child had meantime been picked
                        up by a camel-driver, who brought her to Galioub station, where first aid
                        was admi- nistred.</p>
                    <p>The train was backed to Galioub and the child was then taken on and brought
                        to Alexandria, where she now lies in a dangerous condition at her father's
                        residence.</p>

                    <head>OPENING OF RACING SEASON. A. S. C. SKYE MEETING.</head>
                    <p>The racing season at Alexandria opened yesterday with the Alexandria Sporting
                        Club's April Skye Meeting. Notwithstanding the very fine weather which
                        prevailed, there was not a very large turn out of the public, especially in
                        the early part of the meeting, when the grand stand bore a somewhat bare
                        appearance. Later, however, a number of ladies graced the enclosure with
                        their pre- sence, and more animation prevailed. In the racing the only
                        feature of interest was the five successive wins brought about by Khalil
                        Pasha Khayat's stable, and the owner is to be congratulated on his signal
                        success. Jenkins rode four of the five winning mounts, acquitting himself
                        very creditably. Though there were very good fields the finishes did not
                        afford any excitement, with the exceptin of the Pony Stakes, which was the
                        closest. The prettiest race of the day was the one for the Ladies' Bracelet.
                        There were no less than 16 starters, and all were riding coming up the
                        straight. Pari Mutual yielded good returns, the favorites not coming up to
                        anticipations. The following are the results of the various events, the
                        enjoyment of which was considerably enhanced by the playing of the R. Berks.

                    <p>The horses got away to a good start, Mash- kour and Coeur de Lion leading.
                        When reaching the mile post, Coeur de Lion still maintained the premier
                        position, with Royalist in close attendance. On entering the cutting Boule
                        de Neige challenged the leader and was first into the straight, where all
                        were riding. Coeur de Lion was now done with and although Au Revoir at one
                        time looked like winning, Boule de Neige got first past the post by barely a
                        length, Au Revoir being some distance behind Shewiman. Time, 2.35.</p>
                    <p>Totalisator paid P.T. 48 on winner, and P.T. 27, 76, and 36 for places.</p>
