                        believed to be using as a base. The report of fighting off Saigon is

                        to wait upon Mr. Balfour with a view to arranging a “modus vivendi.” It is
                        understood that Mr. Chamberlain has decided for the present to confine his
                        fiscal programme to the policy advocated by Mr. Balfour. The Duke of
                        Devonshire and his supporters are regarded as irreconcilables. (Reuter.)</p>

                    <p>Execution.—The first execution at Alexan- dria in the newly-erected execution
                        chamber at Hadra Prison will take place shortly, when the murderer Basscouni

                    <p>Mariout.—In the memory of the oldest inhabitant,—and there are quite a number
                        of centenarians there,—this year's barley crop in the Mariout district has
                        never been surpassed both for quantity and quality. The crops on the
                        Khedive’s estates at Mariout are excep- tionally good.</p>
                    <p>Ancient Egyptian Skulls.—The Oxford Reader in Egyptology, Mr. Randall
                        MacIver, has been examining ancient Egyptian skulls with the result that he
                        has discovered that the Englishman has half as large a negroid element in
                        his constitution as the prehistoric Egyptian.</p>
                    <p>Egyptian Speculative Enterprise.—“Spe- culative enterprise (remarks the

                        has been on a heavy scale,and so far the local demand for securities of all
                        kinds shows no signs of slackening. It is to be hoped that the pace will be
                        pre- vented from becoming too rapid.”</p>
                    <p>Coal Imports. — From the 1st Jan. to 13th inst., 194,330 tons of coal were
                        imported into Egypt. For the corresponding period of last year the quantity
                        was 324,589 tons. This year Newcastle sent 45,082 tons, the Welsh districts
                        102,954, the Scotch districts 22,749, Yorkshire 13,901, and other places
                        6,644 tons.</p>
                    <p>Baldness a Egypt.—An inscription has been discovered showing the antiquity of
                        baldness in Egypt Teta, King of Egypt some 3,500 years b.c., has left on
                        record the formula of a compound designed to promote the luxuriance of his
                        mother-in-law's hair. At this distance of time it is hard to say whether he
                        was honestly sympathetic in his efforts, or merely the ac- complice of all
                        ages in making sport of such unhappy victims.</p>
                    <p>New Egyptian Co. —The article from the “Financier" in our issue of Wednesday
                        last on the position and prospects of the New Egyptian Company pointed out
                        that, whilst the nominal share capital was £500,000 and the debenture
                        capital £100,000, only £293,879 of the former and £55,000 of the latter had
                        been issued up to now. The debentures, however, were referred to as Four per
                        Cents. instead of Five per Cents., so that the yield is 1 per cent. better
                        than was made to appear. </p>
                    <p>Employes’ Federations.—The societies lately ,ormed will undoubtedly render
                        the greatest services to this interesting class of workers. But the employes
                        must themselves be the authors of their own prosperity, and they will most
                        assuredly attain their object if they but apply themselves to acquiring the
                        principal languages spoken in Egypt:-English, French, German, Arabic, Greek,
                        Italian, etc. The Berlitz School, thanks to its unrivalled system, will
                        enable them to thus attain their end ; a trial lesson will be sufficient to
                        assure them of it. 25781-1</p>
                    <p>The National Hotel, in Soliman Pasha- street, Cairo, which has been in course
                        of construction for some time, is gradually nearing completion,and from what
                        may be seen so far, is sure to be a great favorite with our visitors. The
                        furniture has been ordered in England, and will be completely installed
                        before the 1st November, the opening day of this new hotel. Both the
                        dining-room and saloon will be sumptuously decorated, the latter in Louis
                        XII. style, and will offer all the comfort and luxury money and modern
                        appliances can supply. Mr. Chas. Bauer, the well-known proprietor of the
                        Bristol Hotel, has agreed to take over the management of the National, and
                        thus visitors may be certain of being properly attended to. The position of
                        the new hotel, surrounded by mansions and villas, and in a quiet,
                        aristocratic neighbour- hood, will greatly enhance its valou, and the big
                        verandah, which is being constructed, is bound to be the meeting-place of
                        many resi- dents and tourists during the next season.</p>

                        March, has reached Medina. Between Yambo and Medina the escort and pilgrims
                        were attacked by a band of Bedouins, who were successfully re- pulsed in a
                        sharp skirmish. The Emir adds that details will follow by post.</p>
                    <p>Ibrahim Pasha Neghib, who has returned to Cairo from Tor, states that the

                        been killed and buried by his fellow pilgrims, resulted in the discovery
                        that the Moor had died in alf apopletic fit. His friends, fearing that they
                        might be suspected of poisoning, buried his body with- out informing the
                        authorities.</p>
                    <p>The delegate of the Quarantine Board at the Hedjaz has sent a report on the
                        pilgrimage from Yambo in which he says that the general health of the
                        pilgrims has so far been good. Dysentery continues to prevail, while
                        smallpox is easily spread among the pilgrims in general, and is not fought
                        against at Yambo, where persons attacked by smallpox are dispersed
                        everywhere. The delegate says that he himself noticed a case of small pox
                        among the pilgrims with the Mahmal, and another was that of the wife of the
                        doctor who accom- panied the Egyptian caravan on behalf of the Sanitary

                        more serious than was at first believed, and as yet she cannot unfortunately
                        be pro- nounced out of danger. It appears that the child was not knocked out
                        of the carriage, but feel out owing to the door not being properly fastened. </p>
                    <p>Mme Debbane, who was in the carriage with her daughter, driven to despair,
                        was only pre- vented from throwing herself on the line, in a wild desire to
                        save her daughter, by a gentleman who happened to be in her company.</p>
                    <p>On the train being stopped, Prince Mohamed Ibrahim, Mohamed Bey Said, and
                        Mohamed Bey Rassehm joined the other passengers in the search for the girl
                        and gave every assistance in their power. The child had meantime been picked
                        up by a camel-driver, who brought her to Galioub station, where first aid
                        was admi- nistred.</p>
                    <p>The train was backed to Galioub and the child was then taken on and brought
                        to Alex- andria, where she now lies in a dangerous condition at her father’s
                        residence.</p>

                    <head>A. S. C. SKYE MEETING.</head>
                    <p>The racing season at Alexandria opened yesterday with the Alexandria Sporting
                        Club’s April Skye Meeting. Notwithstanding the very fine weather which
                        prevailed, there was not a very large turn out of the public, especially in
                        the early part of the meeting, when the grand stand bore a somewhat bare
                        appearance. Later, however, a number of ladies graced the enclosure with
                        their pre- sence, and more animation prevailed. In the racing the only
                        feature of interest was the five successive wins brought about by Khalil
                        Pasha Khayat's stable, and the owner is to be congratulated on his signal
                        success. Jenkins rode four of the five winning mounts, acquitting himself
                        very creditably. Though there were very good fields the finishes did not
                        afford any excitement, with the exceptin of the Pony Stakes, which was the
                        closest. The prettiest race of the day was the one for the Ladies’ Bracelet.
                        There were no less than 16 starters, and all were riding coming up the
                        straight. Pari Mutual yielded good returns, the favorites not coming up to
                        anticipations. The following are the results of the various events, the
                        enjoyment of which was considerably enhanced by the playing of the R. Berks.

                        never overtaken, however, and won by a couple of lengths. Nearing the post,
                        Faineant came with a rush and almost wrested 2nd place from Temsah, who only

                    <p>The horses got away to a good start, Mash- kour and Coeur de Lion leading.
                        When reaching the mile post, Coeur de Lion still maintained the premier

                        de Neige challenged the leader and was first into the straight, where all

                        time looked like winning, Boule de Neige got first past the post by barely a
