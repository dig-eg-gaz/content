                    <head>ENGLAND AND GERMANY.</head>
                    <p>We sincerely trait that the meeting held in Berlin for the purpose of
                        promoting an Anglo-German understanding (as reported by Reuter to-day) will
                        be fruitful of good results. We only wish that the reasonable classes in
                        Germany would realise that it is their naval programme which is almost
                        entirely responsible for the feeling against that country which undoubtedly
                        exists among us to-day. There is nothing in England of that furious hatred
                        which raged through the Fatherland during the Boer War. Even to this day the
                        ordinary Englishman has not recovered from the shook of surprise with which
                        he learned how the Germans disliked and loathed us, and to what gross
                        excesses they were allowed to proceed. That loathing has no counterpart in
                        England, nor is it likely that it ever will have. We are too unimaginative a
                        people even now to understand why Germany suddenly went mad over a war which
                        was no concern of theirs, and could at the highest only affect the wildest
                        dreams of the Pan Germanic fanatics. We harbour no feelings of aggression
                        against Germany, as Coant von Bulow knows. He is well aware that oar
                        Parliamentary institutions and our free demo* eratioc Government constitute
                        an absolute barrier to the formation of offensive sohemes, and that our
                        diplomacy is characterised by only too obvious a desire to bend before the
                        passing storm. We have been driven much against our will to regard the
                        sayings and doings of our neighbours with deep suspicion. And so long as the
                        increase of the German Naval Estimates is ostentatiously directed against
                        England, there is little chance that pacificatory speeches at mass meetings
                        will allay our feelings of deep-rooted apprehension.</p>

                    <head>GAMBLING IN HAW COTTON.</head>
                    <p>The exhaustive address delivered by Mr. Balfour at the meeting of the British
                        Cotton Growing Association yesterday week should be of great service in
                        concentrating public attention on the only real preventive of gambling in
                        raw cotton. That evil accompaniment of the great Lancashire industry is
                        consequent on two causes, operating together. The one is the continuously
                        increasing demand of the world for the commodity, without corresponding
                        augmentation of the Supply ; the second governing factor is the uncertainty
                        of the amount likely to be available for the outside world out of the
                        American crop. Only the other day, the price suddenly advanced by more than
                        50 per oent solely because of the growing probability that the American
                        surplus would be considerably less than had been previously estimated. With
                        such fluctuations in market values of constant occurrence, gambling for the
                        rise or the fall is inevitable, and Mr. Balfour does well to discountenance
                        any expectations of legislative remedies. Bat there is, hapily, another way
                        of rendering the New Orleans and Chicago rings comparatively ineffective. In
                        the case of cereals, every attempt, however heavily capitalised, to maintain
                        an artificial level of prices has terminated in the financial collapse of
                        its promoters ; it was impossible, they discovered, to "corner" sou roes of
                        supply spread all over the world. And it will be equally difficult to
                        engineer forestalling operations in raw cotton when it is produced in all of
                        those portions of oar Empire where the soil and climate are congenial. That
                        gigantic work is undertaken by the British Cotton-Growing Association, and
                        the quick progress already made in West Africa and other tropical parts of
                        Greater Britain renders it almost certain that in the course of a few years
                        Lancashire will be much better secured from having her working population
                        reduced to semi-starvation by Transatlantic or home gamblers.</p>

                        the allied banks, however, has completely restored oonfidenoe. After a short

                        broke twenty points, but rallied afterwards. AU John Walsh's enter- prises

                        yesterday 1 afternoon for the benefit of the Yonng Wo- | men's Christian
                        Association should he a great suooess, judging from the largS^umbers which J
                        attended yesterday. The rooms had been moat tastefully deoorated and the
                        manner in wbioh the several stalls had been laid out was quite artistic.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, Lady Cromer wee unable to * attend, and her abaseoe was
                        greatly felt, but drs. Bollock very kindly consented to open the sale. The
                        oeremony commenced with a short prayer by the Very Rev Dean Butoher, ).D.,
                        who also made an excellent speech in * which, after expressing the general
                        regret alt at the absence of Lady Cromer and the gratitude of the committee
                        to Mrs. Bullook for filling the gap thus oaused, he gave a bort sketch of

                        few well-chosen words Mrs Bollock declared the sale open, and after a vote
                        of thanks to dra. Bullook had been moved by Crookshauk '*»ha and oarried
                        with aoolamation, the stalls c were surrounded by reedy purchasers.</p>
                    <p>The principal stalls were the English stall, consisting ohiefly of children's
                        garments, end presided over by Mrs. Alban, Mrs. Bullook. irs. Botcher, and
                        the Hon. Mrs. Davey ; the i lootoh stall, with woollen goods, presided over
                        by Lady Rogers, Lady Willoooka, Mm. Graham, and Mrs. L'Eetrange Johnstone;
                        the Irish stall, with li^en goods, presided . over by Mrs. Johnson Pasha,
                        Mrs. Milward. and Mrs. Trevithiok ; the American stall, with 1 cakes and
                        sweets, presided over by Mm Crookshank Pasha and Mrs. Btoct ; aed the
                        Continental stall, presided over by Mrs. looker and Mme. Fabrioius Pasha.
                        Besides the*e there were the Connaught House stall, eavily laden with London
                        goods, end a ohil- . drop's stall on which toys, dolls, and books abounded,
                        and the tee-room, when refresh ; rnenta were served at a moderate prioa, was
                        well-patronised.</p>
                    <p>Want of space prevents os describing the various stalls and their burdens in
                        detail, but eaoh reflected great oredit on those who were responsible for
                        their arrangement, and what is more important, each was well patronised, and
                        at the dose of the evening their bnrdens were considerably lighter. Should
                        the second day prove as sncoessfal as yesterday the organising committee
                        will be able to con- gratnlate themselves on the ample manner in which their
                        efforts have been repaid. We should imagine, however, that snoceu, such as
                        is their due, is already assured, for, although ' we have no idea of
                        yesterday's takings, they must be considerable if all those who were present
                        did their duty. </p>

                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette. Sir,—I should be glad tor inserting
                        the s following few lines in your esteemed "Egyptian c Gazette.":—</p>
                    <p>"Had not they attacked the Egyptians—the Greeks—nothing would have ooourred,"
                        aeys the much vexed for the accusation thrown on his compatriots "Egyptian
                        Patriot" Allow me, please, to oootradiot The incident between the two
                        Greeks, of the loweet-olaae, which had as a oonseqnebee the wounding of the
                        native, cannot be the sole reason of Sanday's riot for a man who has a bit
                        of common sense. Many inch aooidents have ooourred before which Lad no snob
                        disgraceful oonseqnenoes as those of Snnday'a last. Should the natives, of
                        low- class, not be injured by the lest (holy) speeobes of the sheikhs and
                        the disonssion in the street of the "Hub el Diana'' (Holy War), no men sen
                        believe thel they, who otherwise live in the harmony would raise the arms
                        against them. If the aeoident that obliged them to fight the Enzopaans, haul
                        not happened, they would find another reason (whichever might be) to attack,

                    <head>OPENING UP THE SUDAN.</head>
                    <p>In an article under the heading of 1 "Developments in the Sudan," the City
                        editor cf the "Standard" says: With the opening of the Sudan Railway shortly
                        by Lord Cromer, a most important step will have been taken in the direction
                        of developing the resonroee of the Sudanandinorsasing the
                        oommeroialimportance of Khartonm. Only a few years ago the cost and abonr of
                        oonveyanoe between Egypt and the la dan was heavy and wearisome, the Nile
                        route having to be followed, with the alter- native of the no less arduous
                        though some- what shorter journey by oamel from Suakin, vift Berber, while,
                        even in recent times, the jour ey from Cairo to Khartonm has taken something
                        like foor days, with almost daily transfers from one kind of oonveyanoe to
                        another. Now, however, the mode of transit will be comparatively rapid and
                        simple, and some id— of the shortening of the distanoe may be gathered from
                        the faot that after the open- ing of the new railway, Kh\rtonm will he
                        within eight days' journey of London. With these improved facilities there
                        will naturally be a groat redaction in the freight ohaiges, and it is felt
                        that a considerable and important impetus it about to be given to trade and
                        to business with the Sudan. The whole of the country is extremely fertile,
                        and, with that attention that the Government of the Sudan intends to devots
                        to irrigation, the prospects ahead appear te be meet promising, and al-
                        ready have had a considerable influence upon the value of land round about
                        Khartonm, prices of bnilding sit— in the city within the past six months
                        having risen anything between 100 and 500 par cent 1 n view of the recant
                        over specula- tion in Egyptian land, it may be hoped that future prospects
                        in t ha Sudan will not be too promptly disconntod by excessive speculation ;
                        bnt, at the same time, it would be unwise to leave out of sight the great
                        oommsroial possibi- lities of the country, which is shortly to be more
                        closely linked with the gnat commercial oentres byAbi opening of the new

                    <head>A SATISFACTORY TALE OF PROGRESS.</head>
                    <p>The following are some extracts from the speech of Sheikh Cherif at the
                        distribntion of grants-in-eid on Snnday last</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen,—Yon are aware that the qnes- tion of the improvement of the
                        exi-ting knttabs and the oreation of new institutions of this class has long
                        ooonpied the minds and formed the snbjeot of the discussions of Egyptians,
                        This is explained by the fact that the knttabe are the only means for the
                        propagation of elementary ednoation in Egypt, and the ne- oessary base for
                        all superior education and instruction, which are indispensable for the
                        improvement of the nation and its assured prosperity. The Government, being
                        preooon- pied with the interest of the country, is taking aotive steps for
                        the improvement of these schools. The inhabitants of the oonntry have been
                        qniok to understand the objeot of the State's endeavours, and a general
                        movement is on foot to seoond them. Egyptians realise the absolute neoeseity
                        for the propagation of instruction and ednoation in an epooh in which it has
                        beoome impossible for men to remain in ignoranoe and darkness.</p>
                    <p>The Ministry of Public Instruction, repre- Mating the Government in all that
                        oonoerns education, has considered it beat to pursue its endeavours toward
                        this end in a regular and gradoal manner to aeonre good results, and has
                        resolved so to continue them, what- ever obstacles it may enoonnter. The
                        Wakf knttabs, which are not numerous, have assnr- ed resources, and oannot
                        be abolished, are the first that have teen taken in hand. After nomerons
                        difficulties a satisfactory resalt has been arrived at in the oaee of these
                        schools, and the Ministry has tin— tamed its atten- tion to the free
                        knttabs. In spite of obstaalee it has been able to attract more than half
                        ef these institutions which have submitted to be inspected by the Ministry,
                        obtaining a money grant paid yearly to the most de- serving. </p>
                    <p>Since the application of throe measures, i.e., siuoi 1898, certain important
                        measures have been taken of which the following are the chief:— ' </p>
                    <p>1. The yearly increase of the Bndget for the knttabs. 2. The inorease of the
                        number of inspeotors and snb-inspeotors, of whom there are now 81. 3. The
                        inorease in the unmber of the hours in the normal onnionlnm of the
                        Government schools and knttabs eaoh Thursday and Friday to complete the
                        training of.the knttab teachers. 4. The foundation of normal schools for
                        male and female teachers in the knttabs. In two years three schools of this
                        sort have been founded, which now train 18 i male and 40 female students. '
                        * 5. The institution of annual examinations bo test the professional
                        capabilities of fikis and arils. 6. —The elaboration of programmes, regula-
                        tions, and roles for the organisation and discipline of the knttabs and the
                        normal sohools......... Despite the short time that has elapsed since the
                        adoption of these measures, their application under the control of the
                        Ministry has given, notably this year, remarkable results, as the
                        following facts indicate :—</p>
                    <p>(1).—The unmber, which increases very year, of knttab wakia and free knttabs
                        that plaoe themselves under the oontrol of the Ministry. The former unmber
                        109, with 194 male and 17 female teaohers, the latter 4,859, with 6,395 mala
                        teaohers and 33 school mistresses.</p>
                    <p>(2).—The development of the training of teaohers for the knttabs, whioh has
                        made speoial progress siooe the institution of teach- ing oonrses and the
                        foundation of normal sohools. To this development the excellent results of
                        the examination of fikis and arifii last August are
                        das............................ The most satisfactory feature is this, that
                        the majority of those who passed the examine- tions have obtained plaoaa as
                        teaohers. Some, having clearly understood the objeot of thair training at
                        the sohools where they were pre- pared for the examination, preferred to
                        open knttabs themselves rather than aoospt the offer them of employment in
                        existing knttabs.</p>
                    <p>(3). The knttabs under the oontrol of the Mioiatry have made real progress in
                        manage- ment,raligioaa instruction,and in instr otion in other matters, as
                        is proved by(a)the inorease of papila, especially of girls, in the— knttabs.
                        ... (b) by the yearly inowase in (be numbers ot kattafas that deserve e
                        subvention. There are at proa—t 517 first-class knttabe in receipt of grants
                        amounting to LB. 5,098.430 milL and 2,148 of the seoond olaas reoeiving
                        grants amounting to LB. 8,185.800 mill....(c) The unmber of advanoed pupils
                        increases every year in tiro— knttabs, — will be shown by statistics
                        shortly, to be published. I hast— to say here that the teaohing of the Kona
                        and of religions prinoip'oa is the objeot of porti- on]— can on the past of
                        the Ministry. The statistics of knttab pnpils learning the Koran by heart
                        give figures..which show that the arrangements of the Ministry are favorable
                        to the learning of the Koran.</p>
                    <p>With the aid of the Ministry of Finance the , Ministry of Public Instruction
                        attempted an important reform which is intimately connected with the
                        improvement of the knttabe. This reform consisted of giving elementary in-
                        dustrial training to certain pupils of the kuttabe with a view to develop
                        the test for professional occupations and to make the people understand that
                        the instruction given in the kuttabe is indispensable for the young <cb
                            n="6"/> both for the aooomplishment of their religious duties and for
                        the needs of daily life. The H experiment all but failed last year. But the
                        KB attempt has been renewed this yeir. The H Ministry has entered nto an
                        understanding pB with the head of the model workshops at IJj Boulao to the
                        effeot th»t the apprentices of these workshops ere to be chosen from H amoDg
                        the pupils of the Wakf kuttabe.</p>
                    <p>While the Ministry worked to obtain these excellent results it attempted to
                        improve theB knttabs themselves, which were in an in- desoribable state of
                        dilapidation. Bat in view of its moderate resoaroes all that could be done
                        under this head was the minimum of repair necessary to preserve the
                        buildings. The real need was their reoonstrnotion, which demanded earns
                        which the Ministry was never likely to dispose of. Thns the que-tion of im-
                        proving the sohoolhonses appeared to pres—t an inanrmoantable obstacle,
                        when, at ri»« most critical point, by a providential chanoe, the Wakfs
                        Administration, happily inspired by the goodwill of its direotor, H. E. Abd
                        el Hamil Pasha Assam, came to the aid of the Ministry by m«king an annnal
                        inorease of L B 6,000 in its budget for the improvement of these knttabs and
                        particularly of the kuttab buildings. The Ministry has set apart this year
                        the sum of LE. 5,000 lor the construction of six new knttabs, three in Oairo
                        and three in the provinces, and for the repair of 11 knttabs in Cairo. It
                        will be in a position to reconstruct gradually every knttab which requires
                        repair.... At the same time the public, which clearly realised the objeot of
                        this improvement of the kuttabe and has grasped the neoeseity of the
                        oombination of all classes in developing instruction, has set to work in
                        every part of Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Everywhere buildings suitable for kuttabs are being constructed, some by
                        individuals, some by subscription, especially since the Government has
                        decided to give free grants of land for the construction of kuttabs. Up to
                        date 758 suitable buildings have been con- structed and 187 others are in
                        course of construction. Local committees have been formed for the
                        improvement and extension of ednoation and have oolleoted considerable sums
                        for the purpose. </p>
                    <p>The best method of insuring tint these buildings shall always be nsed at
                        kattafas, Le., at soholastio establishments where teaching is given
                        exclusively in Arabic and includes the Koran, religions instruction,
                        caligraphy, ele- mentary arithmetic, etc, is to make buildings wakfs, and
                        qua wakfs, to endow them with property sufficient to ensure their main-
                        tenance continuance in perpetuity. Let us hope that the notables of the
                        country will grasp the advantages of this course and hasten to adopt it By
                        so doing they will give proofs of their foresight and of their zeal in
                        sustaining the dearest interests of the nation.</p>

                        <p>The Tsar has sanctioned a stringent penal ordinance for the prevention of
                            railway and telegraph strikes. At the same time the pay of telegraphists
                            and a section of railwaymen has been increased. The telegraph strike is
                            collapsing, except in the Baltic provinces, which remain in a state of

                        <p>Rioting has taken place here. The German Consul was struck by a stone,

                    <head>THE EMANCIPATION OF EGYPT</head>
                    <p>"Oh wad some power the giftie gie us To see ourselves as others see us."</p>
                    <p>Whatever else the modern Egyptian may have to complain about, he cannot well
                        say that the opportunity asked for in the above quotation has been denied to
                        him ; in recent times there has certainly been no lack of books written for
                        his edification. There must be something peculiar in the North African
                        climate, which makes it so difficult for a person to travel from the coast
                        to the cataracts without succumbing to the apparently irresistible
                        attraction of rushing into print.</p>
                    <p>A rather remarkable writer, not many years ago, published an essay on "The
                        decay of the gentle art of lying," and to this deoay he attributes the dull
                        monotony of most modern literature. The older books of travel in Egypt were
                        free from this reproach ; we have lately read one dated 1785 which is well
                        out of range, and many of the much earlier produo tions may be said to
                        "combine the eloquence of Demosthenes with the inaccuracy of state* ment of
                        Annanias," though they were occasionally lacking in the first element. It
                        sometimes makes ns shudder to see how some modern writers will bald up an
                        airy fabric based on the slender foundation of some old traveller, and then
                        expect us to believe that such things were so.</p>
                    <p>To those of our readers whose bookshelves may be over-full of the class of
                        literature we have just referred to, we still recommend that a place should
                        be found for the book now under review, for it is a remarkable work,
                        although its author is so modest that we only know that it is translated
                        from the Italian into exceedingly good English, by another equally unknown
                        person. He takes for his preface a well-known quotation from Lord Milner's
                        "England in Egypt," and on this text be preaches us, in his earlier pages,
                        an exceedingly good sermon. From the introductory chapter we quote</p>
                    <p>"He who would really look into the annals of Egypt during the century which
                        has just closed, and would seriously endeavour to give a clear, fair and
                        accurate idea of their meaning must keep a cool head. If he dips into the
                        mass of literature, or tries to master a tithe of the innumerable books and
                        pamphlets, in which the latter-day history of Egypt has been distorted or
                        caricatured, he will see that he must struggle hard to avoid being carried
                        off his feet by the tide of wilful or unintentional prejudice. From the very
                        outset the fair-minded observer must endeavour to place himself at the right
                        standpoint. This is evidently not any easy matter for him to do. Most of the
                        literature which is his rough material, consists in journalistic attempts to
                        blow either the French, English or native trumpet, regardless of truth or
                        falsehood. Of such books there has been enough, and more than enough. These
                        passionate partisan outpourings achieve little ; they advance the interests
                        of none, and least of all those which they profess to champion."........</p>
                    <p>"It is the peculiar task of any one investigating Egyptian affairs, that he
                        must take into consideration not only a complex native civilisation, as far
                        as that exists,but at the same time seek to understand that heterogeneous
                        concourse of strangers from every clime, which has congregated about the
                        banks of the Nile ; and moreover, he must take into account the considerable
                        interests in Egypt of Turkey, France, and England, of Germany and Italy, of
                        Austria and Belgium, and in a lesser degree of other European nations."</p>
                    <p>"The student viewing Egyptian history of the nineteenth century is confronted
                        with almost insuperable difficulties. His authorities are, as often as not,
                        in violent contradiction. But that is far from being the worst. Much more
                        misleading, much less easy of refutation, are the half-truths of which these
                        chroniclers are so fond. It needs unusual powers of insight and a rare
                        faculty for weighing testimony and balancing probabilities, to unravel the
                        tangled skein. If gifted with a capacity for separating the grain from the
                        chaff, of discriminating between fact and fiction, and endowed with a
                        penetrative instinct enabling him to discern what is certainly right, the
                        historian may be successful in forging for himself a chain of irrefutable
                        trustworthy evidence. It is thus, and thus only, that he oan thread his way
                        securely in any attempt to foreoast the future___________When we attempt, as
                        we shall attempt in the present work, to foreshadow, anticipate or suggest
                        the probable future of Egyptian affairs, or what we consider the future of
                        Egypt should be, we shall find that our balancing rod needs to be very
                        evenly, very justly poised, our feet must be planted warily, and our eyes
                        most be undeviatingly fixed upon the true necessities national as well as
                        international—of Egypt."</p>
                    <p>Our readers will see from the above, that our author has not approached his
                        task in any light spirit; he fully appreciates his difficulties, and like an
                        ancient knight, has armed himself cap a-pie ; he does not plunge suddenly
                        into the middle of things, but lays siege to them from afar, as we may judge
                        from the following lines :—</p>
                    <p>"It is but natural that We should begin with a cursory appraisement of French
                        influence in Egypt. The part played by that country extends farther back
                        than that of other European powers, and a rapid review of its importance
                        since 1798 presents no considerable difficulty," etc.</p>
                    <p>'The Egyptian civilisation of to-day is French almost to the backbone."</p>
                    <p>"The reforms introduced by Mohamed Aly and his dynasty were carried out, if
                        not exclusively , at least for the most part,by Frenchmen....... The
                        irrigation Schemes to which Egypt owes half of its present-day prosperity
                        were inaugurated by the French. The whole idea of Nile barrages and dams is
                        French; and,</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>albeit finally carried out by British enterprise, the attempts which paved
                        the way to these broader designs, and which were in themselves anything but
                        contemptible, were French in their inception."</p>
                    <p>We are not quite of this opinion and there might be a good deal to say about
                        this, for the modern system of irrigation and dame carried out by British
                        engineers have very little to do with the schemes projected and partly
                        carried out previous to 1884 ; had this not been so the present state of
                        Egypt would not have been attained. Although this is an important subject we
                        do not wish to divert our readers' attention by developing it at present, we
                        merely note it as a rather weak point in our author's armour.</p>
                    <p>He goes on to say : "The educational system is thoroughly French; and through
                        the schools, the language of France has spread until it may be said without
                        fear of contradiction that French is still the predominant European language
                        of that land of innumerable tongues. French is the tongue generally affected
                        by the upper classes, and perhaps a striking and not generally known
                        illustration of how French has sunk into the very soul of the country, is
                        that it is even used by British officials in their official reports—yet
                        another anomaly in this home of anomalies."</p>
                    <p>This is another point we do not wish to discuss at present, but Would merely
                        remark that the book we are reviewing is dated 1905 ; that for a long time
                        past we have heard of some 50 British professors or teachers at Egyptian
                        Government schools, and we are under the impression that they were not
                        brought out to this country to teach French only. It looks as though our
                        another were again a little off his guard.</p>
                    <p>"We see what the influence of France has been ;—we need not trace the
                        changeful phases of French policy in Egypt, or discuss the alternating
                        attitude adopted by successive French ministers. It is at present immaterial
                        to us whether the conduct of de Freycinet was inopportune, dilatory, or
                        precipitate, and it will be more to the point to treat French policy towards
                        Egypt together with our appreciation of British policy, to which w now
                        proceed."</p>
                    <p>"If it were possible to read the story of 'British aggression' in Egypt as it
                        has been penned by writers whose implacable hostility to England has
                        rendered them blind to their own absurdity-; if it were possible to read the
                        story without at once being provoked to uncontrollable mirth by the bread
                        humour of its incongruities; if it were possible for a brief space to become
                        oblivious of all well-established facts, to make our minds a blank, and to
                        read these writers in all seriousness ; there are probably few who would
                        rise from the perusal without a painful conviction that the iniquities of
                        the human race are beyond all hope. They would besides discover by this
                        assumption, that within the brief period of little more than a oentary, one
                        little plot of island earth should have produced a succession of ministers
                        whose diabolic schemes would have raised a blush of shame on the cheeks of a
                        Machiavelli, or perhaps have caused him a pang of envy that his principles,
                        which until then had been held to be the most unprincipled ever yet
                        advanced, should have been out-distanced by a series of not very remarkable
                        English statesman."</p>
                    <p>"Supposing the reader had thus far missed the humour of the tale, he would ba
                        set still farther wondering when he came to observe that these self-same
                        statesmen had not overstepped the customary limits of diplomatic guile in
                        their manifold dealings with the rest of the world. AU their diabolical
                        cunning had been visited upon poor Egypt. At this point, probably the most
                        credulous of readers would begin to see that he was being mystified . It is
                        our duty to point out that there is no justification whatever for the
                        statement that England has carried oat a long-meditated Machiavellian policy
                        with regard to Egypt. We shall show that England has not taken more
                        advantage of the weak position of Egypt than any other country has taken of
                        its weaker neighbours, and that whether England's interference in Egypt has
                        been beneficial to that country or not—a point on which we shall at a later
                        stage enlarge — that interference has been justifiable, and, indeed, for
                        England a matter of imperial life or death. AU that we would point out is
                        that, from that moment (i.e. when England took India)Egypt was inevitably
                        destined to figure as an important factor in British policy."</p>
                    <p>"We have not to justify the English footing in India, but once that footing
                        established; England could not contemplate with equanimity the presence of a
                        powerful enemy, or Even a potential adversary, astride the closest line of
                        communication with India...... A strong hand in Egypt which was not her own
                        she could not tolerate."</p>
                    <p>'It is the consistency of British foreign policy which has been
                        misinterpreted as Machiavellianism ; because England has often been able to
                        play a waiting game, she has often been credited with a subtlety, to which
                        in reality she has no claim."</p>
                    <p>"Neither Germany nor France can venture to despatch a couple of hundred
                        thousand men or even a far less number, over seas,. without perilously
                        impairing its internal equilibrium. The French expedition to Mexico can
                        without exaggeration be set down as-paid for at the price of Metz and
                        Sedan."</p>
                    <p>" By a series of political moves (some costing blood, some much diplomatic
                        effort) land has thus far succeeded in scaring away all her dangerous rivals
                        from settling down on the Isthmus of Suez. Was she now, after ridding
                        herself of the first Napoleon and disposing of Mohamed Ali, to allow another
                        powerful monarch to take their place ! The whole labour of seventy years
                        would have been utterly wasted."</p>
                    <p>"We need in conclusion to touch but lightly on the last question—the events
                        of</p>
                    <cb n="4"/>
                    <p>1882. England has been wildly accused of having in her own interests and for
                        her own ends fomented the revolt of Arabi Pasha.</p>
                    <p>Prima facie, the whole idea of England having fomented She Arabi affair is
                        highly improbable; and it remains for the accusers to adduce more cogent
                        evidence than has yet been forthcoming before the matter can be regarded in
                        a serious light, We must remember that Seymour's action before Alexandria
                        took place upon the direct invitation and with the explicit consent of
                        France, and that up to that date England never acted without the concurrence
                        of France. "</p>
                    <p>" It will be very evident that England his' not interpreted her role in any
                        selfish manner, and that the period of British occupation has been one of
                        continually increasing material prosperity. When England first set foot in
                        Egypt, she found the finances in a state of absolute confusion. To-day the
                        finances of Egypt are in as sound a condition as those of any European
                        state."</p>
                    <p>The author concludes his brilliant introduction by an able financial
                        statement into which we will not follow him ; the question, though very
                        interesting, is not the one which engages our attention for the moment;
                        under the present regime the finances of Egypt can be trusted to take o=care
                        of themselves.</p>

                    <p>ARCHITECTURE AND ALEXANDRIA.</p>
                    <p>HOW TO BEAUTIFY THE CITY.</p>
                    <p>BY R. WILLIAMS, F.R.I.B.A.</p>
                    <p>The new Technical and Art Schools now being established in Alexandria and
                        elsewhere will train a new race of native young men, whose energies will
                        need to be directed into useful and artistic channels. And what work could
                        be better for these young men than the turning of Egypt's wealth of material
                        into the service of man ?</p>
                    <p>Question of Style.</p>
                    <p>Now as to the question of style. Consideration of space precludes
                        disquisitions as to architectural styles generally, But briefly,
                        architectural modes or styles can be reduced to two broad definitions, and
                        these can best be described by adjectives well understood by chemists,
                        namely, organic and inorganic: and again, broadly, all architecture exhibits
                        in greater or lesser degree a combination of organic and inorganic
                        forms.</p>
                    <p>Thus the ancient architecture of Egypt is mainly inorganic, that is to say,
                        it is composed of upright posts or columns and horizontal beams. There is no
                        organic growth in the structure, it stands by weight of substance alone. The
                        wails, however, which usually surround the Egyptian columnar structures are
                        partly organic and are built up or are made to grow piece by piece, but here
                        again strength depends upon sheer weight.</p>
                    <p>But the ancient Egyptians were forced into the adoption of an organic form of
                        architecture when they constructed in brick. In the arched construction of
                        the most interesting series of granaries which were lately brought to view
                        at Thebes,, and which I inspected and took sketches and measurement of some
                        months ago, there is exhibited an interesting method of organic
                        construction, and of which I may have something to say later on.</p>
                    <p>The Greeks, following the Egyptians, perfected the inorganic form of
                        architecture. So beautiful did their master artists make the column and its
                        beam or lintel, that they no longer confined the column to the interior of
                        the building. They were too beautiful to be hidden, so they reversed the
                        Egyptian order. They built the wall inside around the cell, or naos, and
                        surrounded it with rows of columns or what has been called by a great
                        artist, perhaps irreverently, "a holy railing." This was inorganic
                        architecture in its perfection.</p>
                    <p>"Organic" Architecture.</p>
                    <p>After the Greeks the Romans. To the Romans is due a fine conception of
                        organic architecture. The Greeks even as the Egyptians before them had used
                        the arch, but the Romans perfected arched or organic construction even as
                        the Greeks perfected the columnar or inorganic construction.</p>
                    <p>The Romans were masters of organic construction, but of the ornamentation of
                        construction they were not. The Greek ornamented their inorganic
                        construction and so made it architecture. On the other hand the Romans
                        failed to ornament their construction, mark this, their construction, so
                        they conceived the Idea of using Greek inorganic architecture, incongruous
                        as it may stem, as ornamentation to their own superior organic
                        construction.</p>
                    <p>After the Romans, for a while, chaos. The world lay fallow. Bat never could
                        Egyptian, Greek and Roman influence utterly fail. A new art arose called in
                        these days, variously, Romanesque, Byzantine, Saracenic, and Gothic. In
                        these styles organic construction, in the main, prevailed. The 13th and 14th
                        centurie witnessed the perfection of the Gothic styles. Artistically
                        architecture had reached a point nearer perfection than it had hitherto. A
                        catastrophe, however, was at hand.</p>
                    <p>A Renaissance.</p>
                    <p>The renaissance of literature came in. The only book on architecture
                        discovered about the time of the sack of Constantinople was that of
                        Vitruvius, a Roman architect of the latter Roman days, and had he confined
                        his discourse to walling and mortar all would have been well. But in time
                        the schoolmen got hold of the book and began to flood, by the aid of the
                        newly invented printing press, all Europe with disquisitions on
                        architecture, albeit the falsely ornamented architecture of the Romans.
                        Nothing but Roman work came within the designation of architecture, as for
                        various reasons, known to history, Greek architecture was not renaissance
                        until three hundred years later.</p>
                    <p>Notre-Dame in Paris, Westminster Abbey in London, and the mosque of Sultan
                        Hassan in Cairo were without the pale of architecture, they were not
                        "scholarly," so the schoolmen invented the adjective Gothic as a term of
                        opprobrium to describe these and other artistic works of one of the finest
                        architectural periods the world has ever seen.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, in the fifteenth century a school of architects arose in Italy.
                        Great among these were Vignola and Palladio. The first influenced the French
                        architecture of the renaissance and the second become the re naissanoe get
                        of England. These men studied the old buildings of Rome. The Coliseum was
                        measured and drawn, books were published and the rich "patrons" of art
                        employed these artists and their followers to reproduce the false art of
                        Rome after the lapse of nearly a thou sand years.</p>
                    <p>It was not until the beginning of the nineteenth century that the Greek
                        renaissance came in and since that day there have been revivals of Gothic
                        architecture and re-revivals</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>ot Roman architecture: and in London we still have the official style of
                        "Paladin Freely Treated."</p>
                    <p>A Bad Example.</p>
                    <p>Now Palladio, great artist in a false style though he was, was yet an
                        architect in stucco. I have seen much of his crumbling stuooo works in his
                        native town of Vicenza, where his fellow-citizens of a later day have
                        erected a statue to his memory, for, in his manner, he had carried out some
                        fine works in Venice, Vicenza, and elsewhere. Unfortunately, apart, from the
                        falsity of his art, he has given the world, and especially Alexandria, a
                        warranty for works m poor materials and stucco.</p>
                    <p>But what of it ? What do you suggest as to style ? I am not going to suggest
                        a style, the artist must be his own master in matters of form and ornament.
                        Later on in a lecture I may be able to avail myself of illustrations which
                        may help us. Meanwhile a few broad principles may perhaps, be aimed at In
                        designing we should never be afraid of a blank wall. A plain wall well built
                        is better than a wall meretriciously ornamented. In their treatment of walls
                        the ancient Egyptians were great masters. They were at no pains to apply
                        ornament to their walls, but with their beautiful hieroglyphs and pictorial
                        scenes they made the wails themselves ornamental.</p>
                    <p>An opening as for a window or a doorway should have the stones of its jambs,
                        or tides, and of its arch, or lintel, lrankiy acknowledged and ornamented
                        organically, i.e., each stone should have the ornament oat in itself and it
                        should be made apparent that it is a part of the wall. The ornament should
                        not be applied or planted on, nor should this appear to be the case.</p>
                    <p>A column should never be used as mere Ornament. Even Pompey's Pillar would
                        have lto "raison d'etre" more apparent if it carried a statue. The function
                        of a column is the bearing up of a load, and this should always be in
                        evidence. The material of which a build-ding is constructed should be
                        frankly acknowledged wherever possible.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing principles were developed by the Byzantiue, Saracenic,, and
                        Gothic architects. Nevertheless bold imitation of the works ot these artists
                        is not desirable. The great mistake of imitation was made by the
                        Renais-sauoe men and later by the Gothic revivalists. The style must and
                        will be an exponent of the artistic temperament and morality, good, bad or
                        indifferent, of the people of the day.</p>
                    <p>What is wanted is bold, frank design in good material which shall he at oboe
                        serviceable to the requirements of the day and be the exponent of the
                        awakening of a new life, moulded by a robust and healthy conception of
                        art.</p>
                    <p>The New Esplanade.</p>
                    <p>There is an opportunity for art in the vacant land of the new municipal
                        esplanade. The coast line of Alexandria is low. Buildings of good height
                        will in part remedy this. A municipal hall and offices (Hotel de Vide), with
                        a fins tower, would be a welcome feature. A library worthy of the old seat
                        of learning might well find a place there. A municipal theatre might be
                        erected, and a great arcade designed as a flowery shade with fountains
                        playing in sam-mor and a pleasant promenade in winter, might be conceived.
                        Added to these there might be municipal baths and wash-houses and suitable
                        Rooses for the clubs of Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>An interesting picture can be imagined of the facades facing the sea.
                        Polished red and grey granite would flash their myriad scintilla tions in
                        the sun. These in tarn would be toned and modified by mouldings and filling
                        in of brown sandstone and pale limestone. Here and there would be spaces for
                        the statues of notables of bygone days, and these in turn would be
                        pleasantly interspersed with parterres of flowers, seats, walks, and playing
                        fountains, and if you pat into the foreground of your picture the colour and
                        the grace of the native dress and the "modes" of the Europeans, yon have a
                        picture of life hardly to be surpassed.</p>

                    <head>DEATH OF HERR BANDMANN.</head>
                    <p>A FORGOTTEN STAR.</p>
                    <p>The pathetic end of FeChter, whom he much resembled in manner and style, is
                        suggested by the death of Herr Bandmann, the Prussian actor, and father of
                        Mr. Maurice E. Bandmann, who at the age of sixty-five has just died from
                        heart failure upon his ranch at Missoula, Montana. Fechter, like Bandmann,
                        had a meteoric career in England, and it is said that the memory of his
                        successes at the Princess's and the Lyceum tortured him as the recollection
                        of Holyrood and Culloden tortured Charles Edward in his declining years.
                        Herr Bandmann was in many respects a remarkable man. He was born at Cassel,
                        Germany, and entered the dramatic profession at the age of eighteen, making
                        his debut at the Court Theatre of New Strelitz. From thence he migrated to
                        other towns in the kingdom, and subsequently pro* oeeding to the United
                        States, he created a very good impression by his performance of Shy-look, a
                        character to which he had given dill gent study in order that he might
                        render it in English. After five years' work in America Herr Bandmann played
                        an engagement at San Francisco, where his "Hamlet" enjoyed a run of a month,
                        and finally in February, 1868, he made his first appearance on the English
                        stage in a play called "Naroisae," founded on "Le Neveu de Rameau,'' of
                        Diderot, and containing almost the same story as was afterwards produced at
                        the Haymarket under the title of "The Pompadour." In the character of
                        Nar-oisse Herr Bandmann made a considerable impression, and was credited
                        with picturesque and pathetic powers, while his mastery of the English
                        tongue was far more pronounced than that of Fechter. Six months later

                        play, "The Rightful Heir." The play was not a success. With pie* ty of
                        resolution Herr Bandmann proceed* ed to take up a whole round of
                        Shakespearian characters—Othello, Petruchio, Richard, and others— and after
                        a sojourn in the Australian Colonies and a tour in the United States he
                        returned to England in 1871, and appeared at the now Abolished Queen's
                        Theatre in a play by the late Tom Taylor, called "Dead or Alive, following
                        this op, at the Princess's, with Hamlet," which was first rendered at the
                        National Standard Theatre in Bishops gate. The actor, however,1 found his
                        principal subse qaent occupation in the provinces. Thedeoeassd married a
                        clever lady—Miss Mill; Palmer, now known as Mrs. landmann-Palmbr. For
                        several years she p ayed "lead" with hi husband in his repertoire, and she
                        is one of the few artists who have appeared both as Hamlet and as
                        Ophelia.</p>

                        survey of the diplomatic situation suggests that the Chancellor probably
                        alludes to Abyssinia. Germany has appointed, or intends to appoint, a
                        representative'the re. Negotiations have for some time! been going on
                        between England, France, and? Italy on questions of common concern, which as
                        a matter of fact, had economic rather than political objects in view. They
                        have been' jealously watched by Germany, and it Prince' Billow really had

                        it is very much with the same object— namely, that of preventing an
                        international' understanding from being concluded without Germany's having a

                    <head>THE NEW MINISTRY.</head>
                    <p>Our London Correspondent writes8ir! Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the new Prime
                        Minister, has snookered more rapid iy in getting together his colleagues in
                        the new Government than had been generally anticipated, and there is a
                        suspicion that he can only have done this by softening down his views as far
                        as the practical programme is concerdably, particularly on the subject of
                        Home Rule. The array of names is probably the best that could be selected
                        from that side of the House, and there are certainly among them men who
                        deserve the Dame of statesmen. So oh men are Sir Edward Grey, Mr. Haldane,
                        the Eiri of Elgin, and Mr. Asquith, though the latter has hardly risen to
                        the level that was expected of him. A man, may however, prove muoh more
                        powerful in active administrative work than as a snarler and barker in
                        opposition. Indeed, we are inclined to think that those who have been least
                        aggressive in their opposition tactics and speeches will proce' the sound,
                        purposeful section of the Govern ment This is, after all, only natural, as
                        loud- -sounding instruments are generally hollow. In Sir Edward Grey and Mr.
                        Haldane the * Government have men worthy of aDy Cabinet, and it is to men
                        like these rather than to ' the Prime Minister himself that the country will
                        look for safety against hysterical and unpatriotic legislation.</p>
                    <p>As, however, all the appointments are made with a view to dissolution, should
                        the council show its aversion to any particular part of the Government's
                        programme, it would no doubt lead to some of these appointments being
                        reconsidered after the election. To gain the votes of dissatisfied Unionists
                        is no doubt' the main object of a present choice of mi* maters, and does
                        credit to the Prime Minister, who has always shown himself an aoute party
                        manager.</p>

                    <p>A. S. C. u ST. ANDREW.</p>
                    <p>On Saturday last the Sorting Club had as their guests the St Andrew Football
                        Club after a lapse two years, and we regret to say the game came to a
                        premature end owing to the misbehaviour of the left back of the Saintsl a
                        soldier, who, though a useful player is Apt to forget that it is football
                        and not War he1 is engaged in. He is happy when be can bowl an opponent
                        over, and we do not complain of this, bat he cannot endure reprisals. On
                        Saturday his temper was possibly not improved by the resalt of Barnard's
                        attentions, whereby he frequently hit the dust Hus offence, however, was in
                        using insulting and sulphurous language to a player and also to the referee,
                        who rightly ordered him off the field. As he refused to go there was nothing
                        for it but that the referee should stop the game, which he did, when there
                        remained about five minutes for play. The beginning of the outburst was a
                        charge by Wiihnott on the goalkeeper, who, as the charge took plaoe, was in
                        possession of the ball. True, just before the moment of impact he got rid of
                        it, bat it was then too late for Willmott to alter his direction, though we
                        think not too late for the custodian to avoid receiving the charge. It
                        seemed to the spectators as though the goalkeeper took some appreciable time
                        to discover that his injuries necessitated a recumbent position. We have
                        seen this occur before with the same player, so we fancy it must be becoming
                        a habit </p>
                    <p>The referee* gave no sign that he considered the charge a foul one, but the
                        game was not resumed after this point Having related the facts in connection
                        with this most regrettable incident we hasten to add that but for it the
                        game would have been a most enjoyable one. We sympathise heartily with the
                        tit Andrew Clab and would advise them to rid themselves of the cause of
                        discord. The taking of this advice would, we think, greatly enhance their
                        popularity. The result at half-time was two to nil in favor of the club, the
                        first a lovely crossfoot by Byrne and the second the result of a penalty
                        kick taken by Byrae.This penalty kick, although rigorously protested against
                        by the Saints' goalkeeper on the ground that the penalty area was not marked
                        out, was well deserved, is McLean's finishing touch to a centre of Carver's
                        would certainly have gone through but for the intervention of an opponent's
                        hand. The second haif was well fought out, each side seoring once, Byrne for
                        the dub heading through a centre from the left and Rofe for the Saints
                        scoring for the visitors. The Saints' forwards combined well, but their
                        efforts were neutralised by the strength of the club's defence, Which we*
                        have not seen better. Crosier was invaluable and led his forwards
                        beautifully. Curtis had heaps of work to do and did it well, though he might
                        have saved the first goal. Byrne was in good form and had on ' his shooting
                        boots, while the rest of the club forwards were in fair form. The
                        Saints'trio of halves had a lot to do with keeping the shoring down. Final

                    <p>L'ENREGISTREMENT DES ACTES SOUS SEING PRIVE</p>
                    <p>On sait que le chiffre des documents sons seing privé que l'on fait
                        enregistrer aux Tribunaux Mixtes et qui sont trop souvent entachés de faux
                        est énorme. La loi, telle qa'elle est actuellement, n'exige môme pas que la
                        signature des parties contractantes soit léga limée et la jurisprudence de
                        la Cour qui assimile les cachets aux signatures n'est pas faite pour
                        améliorer la situation, puisqu'un oachet—qui est peut-être volé— ne peut
                        contribuer que dans une bien faible mesure à établir l'authenticité du
                        document au bas duquel il sc trouve.</p>
                    <p>En outre, œs pièces qui constatent des contrats de vente, de prêt, de gage,
                        sont généralement dressés par des gens illettrés, qui sont incapables de les
                        rédiger, et lenr teneur incompréhensible et confuse donne lieu à de nombreux
                        procès qui, pour la plupart, n'auraient pas lien si la confection de oes
                        actes était oonfiée à des fonctionnaires compétents.</p>
                    <p>Enfin il ne faut pas oablier que les droits d'enregistrement ont été
                        dernièrement réduits de 5 à 2 % ; on est donc en droit de supposer que le
                        plus grand nombre des contractants préféreront s'adresser à un notaire
                        officiel et payer des droits minimes, plutôt que de courir le risque de
                        perdre leur propriété en négligeant de remplir les formalités de
                        l'enregistrement.</p>
                    <p>La Sous-Commission judiciaire se rendant compte des défectuosités et des
                        dangers da système, a décidé que les aotes authentiques senls peuvent être
                        enregistrés ; par conséquent, tout acte auquel on a l'intention défaire
                        subir cette formalité devra être dressé, selon la loi projetée, par un des
                        fonctionnaires de l'ordre judiciaire compétent.</p>
                    <p>Cette disposition ne se trouvait pas dans le projet primitif da Gouvernement,
                        mais y a étéajootée, par voie d'amendement, par la Commission, et le
                        Gouvernement, estimant qu'elle était utile à loi qa'il proposait, l'a
                        acceptée.</p>

                    <p>LES TAXES MUNICIPALES</p>
                    <p>Nous apprenons que M. Z euro, loin de suivre certains de ses collègues dans
                        leurs projets d'entreprises grandioses dont l'exécution et l'entretien
                        occasionneraient des dépenses colossales pour la ville, se propose de
                        demander à la Municipalité de profiter de l'augmentation de ses recettes
                        pour supprimer quelques charges vexatoires, telles que la taxe sur
                        l'oocupation de la voie publique et oflle de 9 % sur les loyers; deux impôts
                        qui, s'ils rapportent brut le premier 4000 livres environ et le seoond
                        17.000, se trouvent réduits à peu de chose à cause des frais considérables
                        qae nécessite lear perception.</p>
                    <p>Certains s'imaginent à tort quela taxe de 2% sur les loyers doit disparaître
                        après la construction du quai-promenade,tandis quelle a été imposée pour une
                        dorée de cinquante ans. S'il est difficile de la supprimer complètement, du
                        moins pourrait on en exempter les locataires pauvres, o'est-à dire ceux qui
                        paient on loyer inférieur à 50 livres.</p>
                    <p>Il en est de même de l'occapation de la voie publique. On pourrait la
                        maintenir à Minet-el-Bassal et sur les grandes places pabliques ; mais on
                        devrait la supprimer partout ailleurs où elle gêne la oiroulation.</p>
                    <p>Nous souhaitons qae oes deux propositions de M. Z mro, qui ont le double
                        mérite de ne diminuer que fort peu les recettes de la ville et de remplir un
                        but hautement humanitaire, soient prises en sérieuse considération par la
                        Commission Municipale.</p>

                    <p>La Caire, 18 décembre.</p>
                    <p>Le Consolidé anglais a haussé de } de livre samedi passé à Loudres. Les
                        valeurs égyptiennes sont restées invariées, à l'exception de la Daïra, qui a
                        perd a | à 17. A Paris, le Crédit Foncier a éça'ement baissé de 2 frano3 à
                        770.</p>
                    <p>Ici, 09 matin, le marché a été calme sur la National Bank et l'Agricole, qui
                        restent plus on moins à leurs oours précédents. L'aotion Crédit Foncier a
                        reculé à 777.</p>
                    <p>Par contre, il y a beaucoup d'animation sur divers autres titres et petites
                        valeurs.</p>
                    <p>Les Enterprise and Development, par exemple, ont avancé à 12| acheteurs; la
                        part de fon-dateur.en bonne demande,a atteint 8 J. L'Agricole du Nil
                        s'inscrit à 234. La Brasserie des Pyramides gagne 2 francs à 112; les
                        dividendes 6 francs à 56.</p>
                    <p>Les Ciments restent à 75 ; les dividendes montent de 5 franos à 25.</p>
                    <p>Dans le groupe des Hôtels, les Nungovioh sont faibles à 1011/16. Ea bonne
                        demande, les Baehler avancent à 3 1/16 acheteurs.</p>
                    <p>Parmi les petites valeurs, les Estâtes donnent toujours lieu à de fortes
                        transactions. Elles atteignent 1 9/16 pour clôturer à 1 17/32 ; les parts de
                        fondateur montent à £6 J. Bon mouvement aussi sur les Hooker, qui débntent à

                        Londres une émission de £150,000 d'obligations.</p>
                    <p>On nous télégraphie de Londres que l'assemblée géoérale ordinaire de la New
                        Egyptian Company, tenne le 14 da oourant, s'est passée de la manière la plus
                        satisfaisante.</p>
                    <p>Le disoonrs du président, Sir Gérard Fitzgerald, exposant la bonne marohe de
                        tontes les affaires de la Sooiété, a été ohalearensement applaudi.</p>
                    <p>Un dividende de 12 et | pour cent a été déclaré. L'assemblée a approuvé le
                        rapport annnel et les oomptes présentés.</p>
                    <p>Des détails qui nous parviennent an sujet de l'achat du Fayoam Light Railway
                        par V Anglo Belgian Company, dont nous avons déjà parlé, il résulte qae
                        cette dernière Sooiété aurait fait une très mauvaise affaire même si elle
                        avait acheté l'entreprise à un prix beau-oonp moins élevé. Le cahier des
                        charges relatif à la oonoession faite par l'Etat à la Fayoom Light Railway
                        contient, en effet, des danses des plus onéreuses pour la Société.</p>
                    <p>Nous avons, il y a quelques jours, publié d'intéressants détails sur la
                        Khédivial Mail Line. Nons pouvons ajouter que le servioe des obligations et
                        aurions privilégiées de la Sooiété absorbe annuellement une somme de £
                        B,000, que l'avant-dernier exeroioe a donné une somme totale de f 6,000
                        livres de bénéûœa nets, le dernier plus de 80,000 et l'exeroice eu cours
                        semble devoir rapporter une somme encore supérieure. 11 est donc aisé de se
                        rendre oompte des perspectives ds l'aotion ordinaire (Il y en a 100.000 de £
                        1).</p>
                    <p>On poarra, en effdt, distribuer des dividendes très élevés, tout en
                        amortissant chaque année des sommes considérables.</p>
                    <p>En outre, la 8ooiété possède environ 23 feddans de terrains dans le port
                        d'Alexandrie. Ces terrains valent aujourd'hui environ 400,000 livres,
                        o'est-à dire qu'ils représentent senls pins de la totalité du capital
                        actions, actions privilégiées et obligations de la Société.</p>
                    <p>On peut dono s'attendre à ce que l'aotion ordinaire Khédivial Mail atteigne
                        bientôt des oours très élevés.</p>
                    <p>Les cours du coton sont arrivés hier en légère reprise d'Amérique et de
                        Liverpool.</p>

                            <p>"The Egyptian Gazette" Series is the most artistic collection to be

                        <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                        <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers
                            the accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by
                            which they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange
                            them as accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that
                            none of them are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home
                            there are several things to be considered. To begin with there is the
                            difference in climate between Egypt and the various points at which you
                            may arrive in Europe.</p>
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                            January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so
                            warm as Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more
                            uniformly warm than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt
                            far too early in the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is
                            perfect. The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                        <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent
                            at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on
                            each of the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of
                            Europe.</p>
                        <cb n="3"/>
                        <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                        <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth,
                            Southhampton, London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones
                            are as follows:—</p>

                        <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                            Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines
                            are also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by
                            travellers to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to
                            Alexandria, without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made
                            without change in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                        <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                            Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German
                            Levant line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                        <cb n="5"/>
                        <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by
                            P.&amp;O. Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd
                            Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
                        <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little
                            luggage is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several
                            good and responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed
                            charge to deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                        <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by
                            the fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these
                            leaves port Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the
                            Indian <cb n="6"/>mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                        <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                            attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats"
                            having been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to
                            Brindisi. If you are going straight through to England you will find the
                            train waiting at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without
                            changing. It has complete arrangements for sleeping and eating on board,
                            and you should arrive in London on the fifth day from leaving Port
                            Said.</p>

                        <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers
                            which leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to
                            TAORMENA, one of the most charming and popular places on the island.
                            Giardini is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina
                            is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the town is
                            much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                            restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent
                            of Etna and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and
                            Saracenic remains that are found all over the island, are an endless
                            sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a
                            Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by
                            the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be
                            seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                            about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                            delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city.
                            The Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of
                            S. Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The
                            Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also
                            worth a visit.</p>

                        <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                        <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every
                            Wednesday during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3
                            days.</p>
                        <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino
                            Co.'s steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave
                            it without wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely
                            places on its bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that
                            takes you to Sorrento [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                        <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can
                            will devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and
                            interesting portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are
                            too well-known to need comment here.</p>
                        <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five
                            hours brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent
                            admiring the City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence
                            itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the
                            local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is
                            the most attractive and fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the
                            Viale dei Colli, one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago,
                            goes winding up through the hills a distance of four miles. The most
                            delightful excursion outside Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its
                            Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is made first by ordinary
                            train from Florence to St. Ellero, thence by cog-wheel railway to
                            Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                            striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                        <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a
                            fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night
                            should if possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile
                            at sunset.</p>
                        <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near
                            Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient
                            half-way house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable
                            and the air and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy,
                            with the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European
                            cities and a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and
                            deliciously cool breezes from the surrounding mountains and the
                            Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                        <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                            gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings,
                            are a constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn
                            in Genoa. Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches
                            containing exquisite marble columns and historical paintings, and the
                            incomparable Campo Santo filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                        <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                        <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                            Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful

                        <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                            delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                            vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage
                            or bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every
                            turn. The approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any
                            other sea port. The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of
                            the sea, no hills behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of
                            Campaniles appear above the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering
                            town rises like a fairy mirage out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                        <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                            lakes.</p>
                        <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in
                            one-and-a-quarter hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                        <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is
                            very beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                            enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo,
                            Cadenabbia, and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio
                            opposite. The walk from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio
                            is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake
                            Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in
                            two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                            on the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M.

                            is an excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated
                            above the town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings,
                            "Entombment," by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>

                            Pilatus, Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other

                            scenery on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to
