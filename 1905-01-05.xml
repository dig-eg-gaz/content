                        becomes a thing of the past. The Khedive's railway is gradually creeping
                        towards the Tripolitan frontier, while the northward march of the Cape to
                        Cairo line is always moving Railhead nearer and nearer. Meanwhile, the
                        develop- ment of the railway communications in Syria is proceeding apace and

                    <p>negotiating with the Ports on the subject of the construction of a line from
                        Damascus to Hamah, and from Hamah to Aleppo, by a French company. The
                        concession has at last been granted, in spite of the efforts which the
                        Germans made to render the project abortive. The proposed line is not a long
                        one, but its oommercial importance will be very marked. Aleppo is a great
                        trading centre, and the sur- rounding conntry is very rich. Hitherto.no line
                        has connected the town with the Syrian coast, and the new railway will
                        therefore afford a valuable outlet for the agricul- tural produce and
                        manufactures of the dis- trict. The French are all the more delighted at the
                        succcess of M. Constans in obtaining the concessions for the French company,
                        since the Germans have done their utmost at Con- stantinople to include
                        Aleppo in the coontry to be served by the Bagdad railway, and to induce the
                        Sultan to forbid the construction of any other railway near the town. The
                        traffic of the district, instead of going by the Bagdad line, will now be
                        tapped by the more natural way of Beyrout. In granting the concession the
                        Sultan said that he did so in order that the ancient and traditional
                        friendship between turkey and France might receive a new con- firmation. It
                        is evident that some suspicions have entered the Sultan's mind that the
                        Kaiaer's attitude towards him is not altogether disinterested, at least so
                        far as relates to Asia Minor. The linking of the Syrian and Egyptian railway
                        systems will Inevitably come to pass and few engineering difficulties attend
                        the con- struction of a line by the short desert route via Kantara and Gaza
                        to the Jaffa-Jerusalem line. It may not be many years before there will be
                        through communioation from Cairo to Calais via Constantinople and

                                will then be free to take action. The Russians are to give plans of
                                the fortifications and mines. Considering the gallant resistance
                                made by the place, the Rus- sian officers are to be permitted to
                                keep their swords and private property. On giving their parole, they
                                will be allowed to return to Russia. The rank and file in uniform,
                                with their portable property, are to assemble, under their
                                respective officers, in a place indicated by the Japanese. The
                                sanitary corps and the accountants are to be retained in order to

                                are sick or wounded. There were 8,000 in the forts, 2,000 of whom
                                were unable to fight. During the siege, 265% of the garrison were

                            house, rushed out of the room. When he returned he found his wife had

                    <p>The Theatre at Bacos station was filled yesterday evening by a crowd of about
                        200 persons for the purpose of discussing the new tariff instituted by the
                        board of directors of the Alexandria and Ramleh Railway Com- pany. The
                        meeting began at about 8.30 p.m., when the chairman, Mr. Benjamin Arbib,
                        made a statement as to the attitude which the board of directois had taken
                        up towards the committee of Ramlehites, who had en- deavoured to set their
                        grievances before them. He said that all the inhabitants of Ramleh should
                        demand the maintenance of the former season-tickct system. This was the one
                        aud only programme which the com- mittee would ask the board to take into
                        con- sideration, as although there were many questions pending between the
                        population of Ramleh and the company, these did not ne- cessarily call for
                        immediate settlement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Halil Zenia then spoke in Arabic and expressed himself as being in hearty
                        agreement with the opinions of the chairman.</p>
                    <p>Many other speakers followed and gavo vont to a number of various and
                        conflicting sugges- tions for settling the question at issue.</p>
                    <p>Chevalier Rouci, chairman of the Tenants' Defence Committee, then rose and,
                        in an im- passioned oration in Italian, announced that the cause of Ramleh
                        was also the cause of the committee over which he presided.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Geo. B. Alderson shortly afterwards ar- rived on the scene and was
                        greeted with acclamation. A scene of great enthusiasm followed, and
                        afterwards Mr. Alderson's scheme for settling the problem was given forth to
                        the meeting in Italian by Mr. Quintavalle.</p>
                    <p>The meeting broke up at 11 p.m. All the persons attending the meeting refused
                        to pay their fares both on going and coming to the meeting. The employes of
                        the Company did not make any fuss.</p>

                    <head>THIS MORNING'S DEVELOPMENTS.</head>
                    <p>Great excitement prevailed on the line this morning. The meeting last night
                        was the subject of universal discussion by the passen- gers. As a large
                        number persisted in refusing to pay the fare the company was obliged to seek
                        for the assistanoe of the Alexandria City Police. Fifteen policemen were
                        placed at the service of the company in order to draw up "proces-verbaux" in
                        cases of non-payment of fares. Some angry Ramlehites tried to rush through
                        the cordon of police and a scene of considerable excitement ensued. But the
                        majority of them accepted the situation with an air of peaceful resignation
                        and agreed to pay tho fares. The police were stationed at the gate of the
                        station and asked each passen- ger arriving from Ramleh for his or her
                        ticket</p>
                    <p>As we go to press we learn that matters are proceeding quietly and that no
                        serious distur- bance has as yet taken place. We understand, however, that
                        the agitators do not intend to let things resume their normal course unless
                        the directors give way, and that other mani festations against the new
                        system will take place shortly.</p>
                    <p>The committee of Ramlehites will meet the directors to-day, in order to
                        ascertain from them if they intend to bow to the wishes of the inhabitants.
                        Another general public meeting of Ramlehites will be held on Saturday
                        evening next at 9 o'clock at the Bacos Theatre.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Geo. B. Alderson writes:—The company have right on their side, to a
                        certain extent. I have noticed how travellers look at the "oommissaires" and
                        say "Abonne." They may have been, as myself, an abonne for 40 years, but the
                        commissaire may have been employed 40 hours only and knows not the "Abonne"
                        of 40 years. I have also noticed how tra- vellers take tickets to Ibrahimieh
                        and go past it, and if asked, pay the difference. Control, under these
                        conditions, is difficult for the company. Their right to annul season
                        tickets without giving a "quid proquo" I dispute—and should wish to have it
                        brought before tribunals to decide. But I suggest, to meet all parties
                        amicably, that the company issue to all residents or householders who wish
                        to be abonnes and have a right at old price ''carnets'' special for 3, 6, 9,
                        or 12 months, calculated at 4 journeys per day. Each "carnet" to be for 3,
                        6, 9, or 12 months, paid in advance and every ticket dated and personal, but
                        each quarter the "carnet" to be returned to the company, and any tickets
                        unusrd to be accept- ed back by the company at 50% on its value.</p>

                        preceding year. In 1903 the number of ships passing through the canal was
                        3,775. The year just closed, therefore, shows an increase in the total, as
                        compared with 1903, of 482 vessels, a considerable advance on last year's
                        figures, which only showed an excess of 67 when com- pared with 1902. If we
                        take the number of ships returned during the past six years as having used
                        the Canal the great increase in number during 1904 beoomes still more
                        marked, the respective totals being:-</p>

                    <p>The steamer "Worcestershire" having proved herself such a complete success,
                        and commend- ed herself to the many passengers by her on her maiden voyage,
                        Messrs. Bibby Brothers Co., have placed with Messrs. Harland &amp; Wolff of
                        Belfast, an order for a sister ship, to be called the "Herefordshire," the
                        construction of which is now being proceeded with. With the advent of this
                        steamer, the "Lancashire" and "Yorkshire," which have in the past done such
                        good service in the line, will drop out as soon as possible—indeed they will
                        not again appear in the lists for the busy season, either outwards or
                        homewards. The Bibby Line will therefore in future be composed entirely of
                        twin screw steamers of the most up-to-date type. Outward passengers via
                        Marseilles will be glad to know that it has been arranged that they can now
                        leave London a day later, say on the Thursday morning, embarkation at
                        Marseilles being fixed for noon on Friday. This extension of time will not
                        alter the time at which the steamers will arrive in the East, which will be
                        as here- tofore.</p>

                    <head>PILGRIMAGE REGULATIONS. TEXT OF GOVERNMENT NOTE.</head>
                    <p>The following is a translation of ths Note issued yesterday by the Egyptian
                        Govern- ment:-</p>
                    <p>The different measures taken by the Egyptian Government with regard to
                        persons desiring to make the pilgrimage to the Holy Places have been
                        prompted by two motives:</p>
                    <p>1. To insure tho greatest freedom and facilities to all who wish to fulfil
                        this sacred duty, while guarding them from all useless expenditure and from
                        the dangers of the journey, and giving them all the medical attention that
                        their health during the pilgrimage may necessitate.</p>
                    <p>2. To control the return of the pilgrims with a view to the avoidance of
                        epidemics, which are always possible. In this connection the circular
                        addressed to all moudirs and governors on November 16, 1904, deserves to be
                        noted. This circular states that every Egyptian has the right to make the
                        pilgrimage whenever his means allow of it, and that if he fears to travel
                        alone the Government gives him the opportunity of accompanying the Mehtmal,
                        being anxious to make the pilgrimage as easy as possible.</p>
                    <p>Last year the same measures were taken and 600 pilgrims asked to be allowed
                        to accompany the Mahmal. This year 1,614 had inscribed their names on the
                        list of those desirous to accompany the Mahmal before it was closed.</p>
                    <p>Those who have already left for the Hedjaz admit that the oooditions imposed
                        on the pilgrims who accompany the Mahmal are pecuniarily the most
                        advantageous, not to mention the advantages of military protection and
                        medical assistance.</p>
                    <p>If the pilgrim travels alone he must make a deposit of P.T. 156 at the
                        Moudirieh whence he draws his passport, of which P.T. 100 represents the
                        rations given him by the Go- vernment in the quarantine camp at Tor and P.T.
                        56 the quarantine expenses. If, as is usually the case, he travels 3rd
                        class, he will have to pay some LE 5 for his return ticket on the Khedivial
                        mail boat and once in the Hedjaz will have to find a camel. Even if one
                        camel is taken by two pilgrims there is no chance of getting one for less
                        than LE 18 or 20 even for the journey from Jeddah to Mecca and Arafat and
                        thence to Yambo. Taking this cause as a test the 3rd class pilgrim will have
                        to pay:- Deposit... ...................... P.T. 156 Return ticket.
                        .................... „ 500 Minimum half share in one camel. „ 900 P.T. 1,586
                        without counting the alms and bakhshish which he will be obliged to pay.</p>
                    <p>If, on the other hand, he travels with the Mahmal he will only have to pay.
                        Deposit...................... P.T. 156 Transport and return.......... „ 300
                        Half share in a camel......... „ 675 Unforeseen expenses... ... ... „ 69
                        P.T. 1,200</p>
                    <p>But in reality this is only a deposit, and if the camel hire does not reach
                        the fixed price and there are no unforeseen expenses the sur- plus will be
                        returned to him.</p>
                    <p>So far from profiting the Government, these measures are decidedly costly
                        owing to the necessary arrangements with the Khedivial Mail S. S. Co. by the
                        guarantee of a mini- mum number of pilgrims in return for the reduction of
                        fares.</p>
                    <p>This year, moreover, the Government has not hesitated to bring the escort of
                        the Mahmal up to 400 men, this increase of 280 men involving an additional
                        expenditure of LE 5,000. In spite of this the obligatory depos- its are not
                        be increased.</p>
                    <p>Only the deposits of the lowest class cover all the expenses. As for the
                        others, if the price of a camel is the same as last year the Government will
                        pay the difference itself to convince the pilgrims of its anxiety for their
                        comfort and welfare.</p>

                        decline and! some inter-bsssar businoas resulted. At the close tho position
                        is steadier, and sellers are not quite so keen to go on, unless at an
                        advance.</p>

                    <head>IMPORTANT LEGAL JUDGMENT.</head>
                    <p>Last week a judgment of considerable im- portance vu giveu by the Mixed Court
                        of let Instance at Alexandria. Aboukir ia one of the best localities iu the
                        neighbourhood of Alexan- dria. The exquisitely bracing air, the pictures-
                        que surroundingMnd the historical associations run dor this spot the most
                        attractive -on the whole of the Egyptian sea-board.and it should develop iu
                        course of time into an Egyptian Brighton. But the one and only obstacle lies
                        in the fact that Prinoe Omar Pasha Toussoun ban set his heart on becoming
                        the solo landlord at Aboukir and does his best to discourage private.
                        persons from acquiring land. An English lady, the wife of Mr. Richmond, Sub-
                        Director of the Aboukir Land Company, was eager to build a bungalow on the
                        seashore at Aboukir for her invalid mother, whose health had greatly
                        improved in the summer of 1903 by a sojourn at Aboukir, when she rented Mr.
                        Crafton's house there. Mrs. Richmond set to work to find a suitable plot of
                        land and at last discovered a pretty little spot of half a foddan ot land,
                        which the owoer was willing to sell provided Pnnoe Omar Paaha Toussoun did
                        not pre-empt, llis Highness was ap- proached, but was proof against all
                        overtures. Consequently Mrs. Richmond arranged with the landlord to lease
                        the land for ninety yoars and built a residence there. Prinoe Omar thereupon
                        brought an aotion against Mrs. Richmond and was non-suited. The following is

                        <p>Sir,—In perusing Mr. Lang Anderson's illu- minative paper upon "land
                            values," -which recently appeared in your columns, one of the topics to
                            which he alludes especially attracted my attention. He told us that,
                            roughly speak- ing, one-third of the children of native parents die
                            within twelve months of their birth, and that another third die before
                            they reach five yean of age. Mr. Irang Anderson's reputation for
                            accuracy stands far too high for him to have allowed himself to make
                            such allegations without satisfying himself previously as to the truth
                            of his statements. They most therefore bo accepted as prima facie
                            correct. Now, 8ir, I think the public is entitled to know whether this
                            deplorable state of affaire is of xeoent date or of ancient origin, and,
                            in either eveut, for how much longer it is to be allowed to con- tinue
                            unchecked. I bold it to be the paramount duty of the Government forth
                            with toinveatigate the causes contributing to this (terrible waste of
                            human life, and, having ascertained them, to devise effective moasares
                            for arresting the shocking ravages death is making amongst the infant
                            population.</p>

                    <head>A NEW SUEZ CANAL. THE QUESTION OF MONOPOLY.</head>
                    <p>In connection with Sir Theodore Angier'a auctions that Mr. Gladstone "bad to
                        oonfeas ho »as wrong" in his assumptions that the Suer Canal Company
                        possessed a monopoly on the Isthmua of Sure, it is interesting to note mIuii
                        was said in Parliament on that subject sit,. M. Ferdinand do Lesseps, the
                        President of the Sore Canal Company, had voluntarily renounced the
                        advantages of the Agreement signed between the British Government and the
                        Sure Canal Company, on July 11, 1663. The Agreement had been presented for
                        ratifi- cation to the Houso of Commons, but the oppo- sition to it was so
                        great that Mr. Gladstone felt that even his groat infloenoe would not
                        suffice to cany it through. In his letter to the Prime Minister M. de
                        Lesseps said among other things :—</p>
                    <p>"In the interests of general peace, and in the interests of the
                        Franoo-English Alliance, indis- pensable lor the civilisation of the world,
                        I beg you not to consider yourself bound towards the shipowners and towards
                        myself by the terms of tho Agreement we have signed."</p>
                    <p>The withdrawal of that Agreement was the signal for a recrudesoenoe of the
                        agitation iu England against the Sure Canal Company, and in favour of
                        cutting what was called "a British Canal." The British Government was
                        publicly urged to use its influence in Egypt to constrain the Khedive to
                        grant a concession for a second Canal across the Isthmus to an English com-
                        pany. Replying, in the House of Commons, to a question put to him on that
                        point on July 12, 1883, Mr. Gladstone said :—</p>
                    <p>"We could not try to obtain those conces- sions, for the simple reason that
                        the Khedive has not tho power to grant them. M. do Les- seps possesses an
                        exclusive right of canal- cutting in so far as the Isthmus of Sow is
                        concerned."</p>
                    <p>This assertion was repeated in the House of Lords a fow days later—on July
                        17—by Lord Granville ; and on August 12 the House of Commons, having
                        demanded the opinion of the Solicitor General, received his declarations,
                        which ooncludcd with tho following words :—</p>
                    <p>"I profit by this opportunity to state that tho legal advice which the
                        Government has received has been not' only that of tho legal officers, but
                        also that of the Lord Chancellor." Mr. Childers, the Chancellor of the Ex-
                        chequer, had stated in the Houso of Commons on July 17 :—</p>
                    <p>"We believed that tho exclusive power possessed by the Company prevented us
                        from constructing a new Canal unless <persName>M. de Lesseps</persName>
                        should have forfeited his rights."</p>
                    <p>Having been requeate 1 to defino what ho meant by "tho exclusivo privilege of
                        the Sure Canal Company," <persName>Mr. Gladstone</persName> did so in these
                        words -—</p>
                    <p>"A power given to prevent othor persons piercing tho Isthmua ol Sure by a
                        Canal."</p>
                    <p>Peraeveringly intent on obtaining a con- cession for a second Sure Canal, the
                        advo- cates of tho project suggested that the ex- clusive privilege granted
                        to M. de Lesseps might oease, on his death. Mr. Gladstone, however, remarked
                        that a privilege granted for ninety-nine years to a man already past middle
                        ago was certainly not destined to expire with him, but that it would pass to
                        the oompany formed by him.</p>
                    <p>A little later on, tho nowspapors having insinuated that Mr. Gladstone had
                        changed his opinion, tho Prime Minister replied to a question put to him in
                        tho House of Commons that his previous declarations were definitive, rinoe
                        they had been inscribed in the Minutes of Parliament Then, addressing the
                        Chancellor of the Exchequer, a member of Parliament inquired whether it was
                        true that, to a deputa- tion of shipowners concerning M. de Lesseps's
                        monopoly, be had declared that her Majesty's Government had arrived at the
                        conclusion that M. de Lesseps or hiS company had an exclusive right of a
                        water-way across tho Isthmus of Sues. To this Mr. Childers replied :—</p>
                    <p>"I employed words in the sense indicated by tbo hon. member, and 1 see no
                        reason to deviate from that declaration."</p>
                    <p>These quotations are quite sufficient to demonstrate that the British
                        Government frankly admitted the exclusive character of tho right of
                        canal-cutting conferred on M. de Lesseps and his oompany by his oonoeesion.
                        It was alter this that M. de Lesseps came to England and negotiated with tho
                        shipowners, with tho result that the two parties agreed to what is called
                        "the London programme" It provided, as everyone knows, for the rather
                        contradictory desiderata of the reduction ol canal duos and the improvement
                        of the water- way, and also for tho admission of seven British shipowners or
                        merchants on the Board of Directors of the Suez Canal Company.</p>
