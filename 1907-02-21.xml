                        that the natives of Egypt, irrespective of their religious creed, were so
                        satisfied with the reign of law and order we have introduced into Egypt, and
                        with the abolition of the abuses prevailing previous to our military
                        occupation, that they would resist any attempt to subvert our Protectorate.
                        My assertion that, as a matter of fact, this conention was unsound, and that
                        the Moslem cared more about Islam than he did about crops and irrigation
                        works, was denounced as inconsistent with the information forwarded by
                        British officials from every part of Egypt, as to the general contentment of
                        the natives under our enlightened rule. When <cb n="6"/> I ventured to
                        repeat the truth I have so often expressed, that Egypt owes its present
                        prosperity to the presence of the British army on Egyptian soil, I was told
                        that I overlooked the extraordinary effect produced on native opinion by the
                        justice of our sway and by the success of our administrative policy. I
                        ventured to foretell that the mere rumour of Turkish intervention would
                        unite the whole Egyptian nation into partisans of the Sultan. I need not say
                        that the views I then expressed have been shown to be substantially correct,
                        while those of my critics have been proved to be utterly erroneous, I am
                        convinced that our British officials honestly believed in the loyalty and
                        gratitude of the fellaheen, but I utterly fail to understand how to their
                        delusions on the subject in question are compatible with any real study and
                        understanding of the native mind or of the extraordinary influence of Islam
                        as a political factor in Moslem countries. </p>
                    <p>Time after time during the last few months events have occurred which ought
                        to have opened the eyes of our officials to the true state of things. The
                        riot of Alexandria, the attempt to blow up the arsenal of Khartoum, the raid
                        by Sudanese who had served under the Khalifa upon a village occupied by
                        Anglo-Egyptian soldiers, a raid which was only possible on the hypothesis
                        that the sympathies of the Sudanese villagers were with the insurgents, not
                        with the Anglo-Egyptian soldiery; the sudden occupation of Akaba by Turkish
                        troops, the revival of the Sultan's shadowy Suzerainty over Egypt, were all
                        signs pointing to a general discount amidst the Mussulman population, a
                        discount which was partly due to dissatisfaction with unwelcome and
                        unpopular reforms, but, still more so to the sympathy of creed which causes
                        all Egyptian followers of the Prophet to regard Abdul Hamid with veneration
                        as being the head of Islam. When it was made manifest that in the event of a
                        collision between Turkish and Egyptian troops the latter would refuse to
                        fight against the former, and that their refusal would enlist the sympathies
                        of the whole Moslem community, the British authorities in Egypt awoke to the
                        fact that they had been living in a fool's paradise. </p>
                    <p>This much I am bound to say in the interest alike of England in the first
                        place, and of Egypt in the second. If anyone will search through
                            <persName>Lord Cromer's</persName> voluminous and interesting report for
                        1905, published at the end of April, 1906, he will fail to find any allusion
                        to the state of unrest which had already manifested itself in the valley of
                        the Nile. The only allusion to the discontent which had first made itself
                        manifest in 1904, is contained in the concluding sentence of this report:
                        "During the past year the whole machine of Government worked very smoothly.
                        It will be seen from the report which I now submit, that improvements in
                        various directions have been effected. There is every reason to believe that
                        this steady and uniform rate of progress will be maintained in future years,
                        but nowhere must there be undue haste." In order to show his belief in a
                        steady and uniform rate of progress, his Lordship had recommended, in the
                        previous pages of this report, the abolition of the Capitulations, the
                        impending dissolution of the Mixed Tribunals, the termination of the Caisse
                        de la Dette, and the creation of a consultative parliament for Egypt, whose
                        members were to be partly nominated and partly elected, who were to consist
                        exclusively of loval notabilities under conditions necessarily rendering the
                        members completely subservient to the Egyptian Government, which in its turn
                        is equally subservient, as long as the army of occupation remains in Egypt,
                        to the representative of Great Britain at the Khedivial Court. Opinions may
                        differ as to the merits or demerits of these proposals, but there can be no
                        doubt as to the fact that if they should be carried into effect they would
                        render the authority of their originator more absolutely autocratic than it
                        is at present. </p>
                    <p>Up to the date of the Denishwai outrage our British officials still cherished
                        the delusion that there was no serious unrest in Egypt, and that the
                        reinforcement of the Army of Occupation was solely due to the hostile
                        attitude of Turkey on the frontiers of the Sinai Peninsula. It was still
                        taken for granted that the resolution of England to uphold the independence
                        of Egypt by force of arms against any aggression on the part of the Sultan-
                        must be welcome to the people of Egypt, who were supposed to dread any
                        reassertion of Turkish authority, and so resent the revival of the
                        pretension that Egypt, in fact as well as in name, is a vassal province of
                        the Ottoman Empire. These delusions were dispelled when it became evident
                        that the Moslems, who form upwards of nine-tenths of the Egyptian
                        population, still acknowledged the supreme authority of the Sultan, as the
                        Commander of the Faithful, and cared far more for the interests of their
                        faith than for the material advantages they had obtained, and could only
                        hope to preserve, under our military occupation.</p>

                            Egyptians" imagined when they entertained the Radical member for the
                            Tyneside division of Northumberland to splendid banquets and luncheons,
                            and accompanied him on his pilgrimages to Denishwai and other remarkable
                            localities, that he was a political personnage, whose opinions carried
                            considerable weight in the House of Commons. The highly ignominious
                            misadventure of being "squeezed out" which has happened to what was to
                            have been an epoch making amendment, will serve to remind Mr.
                            Robertson's supporters in Egypt that his self-imposed championship of
                            the Egyptian Nationalists finds no more favour with the existing Liberal
                            Government than it would have done with its predecessors in office. In
                            the present Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs we have as good an
                            Imperialist as way any Conservative chief of the Foreign Office. Sir
                                <persName>Edward Grey</persName> formally declared shortly before
                            taking office under the present Government that he desired "to emphasize
                            the need for continuity in foreign policy," and that "at the present
                            time it is not only possible, but it is most important to adhere to the
                            principle of continuity." Our foreign policy under successive
                            administrations exemplifies the saying, "Plus ca change plus c'est la
                            meme chose," and it is happy for the welfare of the Empire, and
                            particularly of Egypt, that it is so. It was ridiculous to expect,
                            therefore, that a private member of the House of Commons would be able
                            to impose a new line of policy on the Government in regard to Egypt.</p>

                        <p>Disappointment is expressed in shipping circles at the failure of the
                            Commonwealth Government to elicit any satisfactory assurancecs from the
                            Imperial Government on the subject of the Suez Canal dues. <persName>Mr.
                                Deakin</persName>, the Federal Premier, urged upon Lord Elgin that
                            as the Suez Canal shareholders now receive a divident of 28 per cent.
                            the time had arrived for the reconsideration of the scale of dues on
                            ships passing through the waterway. Apparently the Colonial Secretary
                            submitted Mr. Deakin's letter to the three representatives of the
                            British Government on the Suez Canal board, who seem to have taken the
                            view that as Suez Canal shares at their present price do not yield more
                            than 3 or 4 per cent, that circumstance must be considered. The same
                            directors also suggested that, as the British Government gets a dividend
                            of over 1,000,000 per annum on its Suez Canal shares, a reduction of the
                            tariff would be practically equivalent to a subsidy of shipping at the
                            expense of the Government. The Treasury and the Board of Trade, it
                            seems, approved the report of the British Government directors, and
                            expressed the opinion that nothing was to be gained by pursuing the
                            subject in the absence of a due regard for the interests of those who
                            have a financial concern in the Suez Canal.</p>
                        <p>British shipowners ae waiting with some anxiety the arrival of the text
                            of the correspondence from Australia, because the point they made when
                            this subject was previously discussed was that, by a formal agreement
                            entered into by the Suez Canal Company some years back, the dividends
                            paid by the company should not have reached their present position until
                            the dues have been reduced much below the existing level. They are
                            naturally curious to know how far this argument of theirs has been
                            pressed upon the Imperial Government by the Commonwealth Premier. In the
                            meantime, the crisp comments on the correspondence which have appeared
                            in the Australian newspapers, which suggest that a British Ministry,
                            professedly anxious to strike off the shackles of trade, has in this
                            case shown itself curiously indifferent, will add no little interest to
                            the debate on the question of Suez Canal charges, at the meeting of the
                            Chamber of Shipping.</p>

                        <p>The directors of the Suez Canal have recently come in for a good deal of
                            abuse in certain shipping quarters, and the latest complaint is with
                            regard to the frequent standing of vessels in the canal. Although it is
                            admitted that in many cases these accidents are the result of
                            carelessness on the part of those in charge of the vessels, the
                            directors are accused of skimping the necessary dredging operations,
                            with the result that the fairway is narrow. A casual consideration of
                            the facts, however, is sufficient to demonstrate the shallowness of the
                            charge. If these accidents are the result of insufficient dredging it
                            remains to be explained how the largest vessels run through without
                            difficulty.</p>

                            of 1 pound each and 60,000 Deferred Shares of 1s. each. Of this capital
                            40,000 participating preferred shares have been offered for subsciption,
                            the whole of the proceeds of which will be available for working
                            capital, preliminary expenses and underwriting commissions; 60,000
                            participating Prefered Shares are issued as fully paid up to the
                            vendors, and the remaining 100,000 are set aside for issue at a later
                            date to provide further working capital as and when required. The
                            vendors have the right to apply for 60,000 Deferred Shares of 1s. each
                            at par at any time within 18 calendar months from such allotment for the
                            whole or any part of the remaining 100,000 participating preferred
                            shares. The participating preferred shares are entitled to receive in
                            each year a non-cumulative preferential dividend of 7 per cent., and in
                            addition thereto one-half of the surplus net profits of the company
                            available for dividends after payment of the director's commission. The
                            balance of each surplus net profits is payable to the holders of the
                            deferred shares. The company has been formed for the purpose of
                            acquiring as a going concern the undertaking of the Societe Egyptienne
                            d'Importation de Petrole and establishing two new branches of trade to
                            be incorporated with the business in Egypt. The prospectus states that
                            the profits made by the Societe are already sufficient by themselves to
                            pay the preferred dividend of 7 per cent. upon the 100,000 participating
                            preferred shares now issued, leaving the substantial sum of 7,411 pounds
                            over for reserve, etc, and further dividend. Having regard to the
                            increased earning powers of the company both from the additional working
                            capital of 40,000 pounds, which will, subject to payment of the
                            preliminary expenses and underwriting commissions, be provided from this
                            issue, and from the two new branches of business which the company
                            proposes to establish, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that large
                            additional profits will be earned, and that the preferred shareholders
                            may reasonable expect to receive substantial supplementary dividends
                            over and above their fixed 7 per cent.</p>

                            accounted for the rather small attendance for the first day's racing at

                    <p>American Futures. There has been no new feature in the market this week, and
                        the better tone and improved activity noticed last week have been less
                        apparent. With selling orders reported for foreign account, and with the
                        poor response from New Orleans, it has been a struggle to maintain prices,
                        although there has been a considerable strength shown, owing to the fact
                        that lower grades are being tendered by shippers, in fulfilment of contracts
                        for higher qualities, which are being rejected by importers, who

                    <p>When reviewing the results of the Bank of Egypt for 1905, we characterised
                        them as distinctly phenomenal in their excellence (says the "Financial
                        Times") and it is surprising to find that the management is able to announce
                        an equally good showing for 1906. The rapid strides made by this institution
                        in the last few years yield the following interesting table:-</p>

                    <p>The total of net profits was almost exactly the same as for the preceding
                        twelve months, at 136,750 pounds, which represents a return of about 27 per
                        cent on the paid-up capital. The Directors announce a final dividend, making
                        10 per cent for the year, and, in addition, a bonus of 8 per cent for the
                        year, bringing the total distribution up to 18 per cent, or the same as a
                        year ago. It is interesting to note that a considerable portion of the
                        distribution is still retained in the form of a bonus, which would doubltess
                        be curtailed if earnings fell off to any appreciable extent. As it is, the
                        Board are making good use of these fat years, for the reserve is
                        increasingly by leaps and bounds, the 40,000 pounds which they now transfer
                        to that fund bringing up the total so allocated during the past four years
                        to some 130,000 pounds. This will raise the reserve to 480,000 pounds and
                        practically assures its equalling the paid-up capital of 500,000 pounds
                        twelve months hence. After writing 6,048 off bank premises, the carry
                        forward is a trifle larger at 15,357 pounds.</p>

                            The Emperor and people feel nearer one another, which is much noted.
                            They approve of the essentially pacific passage in which His Majesty
                            refers to the external relations of the country, and of the way he
                            speaks of the carrying out of social reforms as a natural duty, which
                            forms the main difference between the Labour party and the Social
                            Democrats. His Majesty does not render the Labourites responsible for

                    <head>THE SITUATION IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>A FRENCHMAN'S APPRECIATION.</p>
                    <p>It is noteworthy that simultaneously with the publication of Mr. Edward
                        Dicey's attack on Lord Cromer's policy in Egypt in his new book, "Egypt of
                        the Future," a Frenchman publishes an article in the "Fortnightly Review"
                        which is full of praise for Lord Cromer's work. M. de Guerville's article is
                        an able resume of the present situation in Egypt. M. de Guerville's sympathy
                        with the work of England upon the Nile is well known, and this article forms
                        a pleasant appendix to what he has said in his recent book.</p>
                    <p>The following is the article in question:- "England has rendered an
                        indisputable service to the cause of civilisation."</p>
                    <p>This is the expression used by the famous French statesman, M. de Freyciuet,
                        in his work entitled "The Question of Egypt"- a work in which, nevertheless,
                        he is by no means sparing in his criticism of England. Nowhere is the work
                        which has been accomplished on the banks of the Nile better appreciated than
                        in France; and all serious minded Frenchmen, above all those who have
                        important interests in Egypt, are the first to declare that the English have
                        saved both Egypt herself and European interests in that country.</p>
                    <p>But at the time when Egypt was on the point of bankruptcy in 1882, England
                        was not content simply to play the part of a Newfoundland dog; she wanted to
                        achieve more than a mere rescue, which would undoubtedly have had to be
                        repeated every year in order to save that unfortunate country from final
                        disaster. Seeing her ruined, disorganised, in the hands of usureres and of a
                        few powerful pashas, at the mercy of a government composed of veritable
                        brigands, whose agents had but one care-to fill their own pockets- England
                        decided to reorganise things from top to bottom, to give Egypt an honest and
                        efficient government, and to restore her agriculture, trade, and industries,
                        Englishmen had perhaps at the time only a slight idea of the immensity of
                        the task they were undertaking; but with the courage, perserverance, and
                        intelligence which they have always displayed in colonial affairs, they have
                        succeeded in more than compassing the end they had in view, in making Egypt
                        one of the most prosperous countries on the face of the globe, and,
                        wonderful to relate, in satisfying all the other European nations, who
                        cannot, for this particular piece of work at least, refuse England and their
                        admiration.</p>
                    <p>England's success as a colonising nation has certainly been great in all
                        parts of the world; <cb n="3"/>but I do not believe it has ever been so
                        great, so rapid, and so complete as in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>There has been much talk latterly in certain quarters, both on the Continent
                        and in Great Britain, of so called "discontent" among the Egyptians, of
                        violent opposition to England, of a re-awakening of religious fanaticism
                        against Christians on the part of Mohamedans, and finally of the possibility
                        of a grave financial crisis.</p>
                    <p>I have passed the last two winters in Egypt and the Sudan, and have been in
                        daily contact with all classes of the population there, <!-- unclear --> the
                        situation with the greatest interest and the most absolute impartiality. Now
                        I have arrived at the definite conclusion that from the top to the bottom of
                        the social scale the inhabitants of the country, the very great majority of
                        the inhabitants, recognise the work achieved by England, pay her a real debt
                        of gratitude for their present prosperity, and are perfectly satisfied with
                        the existing state of things. Of this there cannot be any doubt. Egypt's
                        prosperity is very real; financially the government is more than prosperous;
                        and if a financial crisis of any kind were to arise, it would concern merely
                        the hundreds of more or less doubtful companies who have flooded the markets
                        of Alexandria and Cairo with shares that have no true value. </p>
                    <p>It is these companies, launched by speculators of questionable honesty, that
                        the European public should distrust. The great financial institutions with
                        which Egypt is now provided have nothing to fear. As for the people, they
                        remember too well the sufferings of the past, the crimes and injustice, the
                        black misery, the crushing taxation, and the grinding tyranny of the corvee,
                        to be anything but happy and content in their present state. The great
                        majority perceive that if the English were to quit tomorrow the poverty,
                        ruin, and chaos of a quarter of a century ago would return.</p>
                    <p>We may therefore be very sure that the discontent recently manifested, and
                        the slight disturbances which have occurred in Alexandria and elsewhere, do
                        not express the feelings of the great majority of the population. No doubt
                        that population is extremely sensitive to everything affecting its religion,
                        and here-as with all Mohamedan peoples- a spark will suffice to kindle
                        fanaticism and cause a conflagration to burst forth; but the English
                        understand this question of Mussulman fanaticism too well, and their
                        experience is too great and too extensive to permit of their giving it the
                        smallest foothold. Lord Cromer and his advisers leave the Khedive and his
                        Mussulman ministers in absolute control of religious affairs.</p>
                    <p>Like nearly all great seaports, certain quarters of Alexandria are infested
                        by very bad characters, the scum of all the lowest classes of Europe and the
                        East, and these have their habitation amongst those of the indigenous
                        population who are poorest, most ignorant, most wretched and consequently
                        most apt to let themselves be driven like a flock of sheep. A handful of
                        enterprising agitators may easily create a small uprising, which a telegram
                        makes the most of exaggerates, and presents to the readers of some European
                        newspaper as the beginning of a revolution that can only end in a sanguinary
                        massacre. The question is to know who has an interest to serve in creating
                        this state of things. Opinions are divided, but for curiousity's sake I will
                        specify here those that have the most adherents.</p>
                    <p>Many persons who are conversant with Eastern affairs have no hesitation in
                        declaring that the Sultan is the sole cause of that opposition movement
                        which has manifested itself of late. He certainly cannot view with pleasure
                        the definite installation of the English in Egypt, or the wonderful
                        prosperity of that country- a prosperity which brings in absolutely nothing
                        to Turkey, who nevertheless still virtuallly remains the suzerain State.</p>
                    <p>1. By creating difficulties for England in Egypt, difficulties which if they
                        became serious might oblige the other Powers to intervene, the Sultan might
                        hope to raise the Egyptian question once again. He might hope to have it
                        decided more in his favour than it was by the last treaty between France and
                        England, who, it must be allowed, troubled themselves but little about him!
                        Or, indeed, it might equally be the case that the Sultan merely seeks to do
                        what is asked of him, and uses his influence as a religious authority to
                        soothe the fanatics- a little service in exchange for which he would demand
                        an augmentation of the annual tribute which Egypt, the vassal State, pays to
                        his exchequer.</p>
                    <p>2. Others do not hesitate to accuse his Highness the Khedive of covertly
                        encouraging the malcontents, his object being firstly to be agreeable to the
                        Sultan, by thus providing that he is before all a Mussulman and the enemy of
                        the foreigner: and, further, to augment his prestige in the eyes of England,
                        and his influencec as the religious head of his subjects. In short, he would
                        like to make himself absolute master of the situation by continually keeping
                        in view the phantom of Mussulman fanaticism and of some formidable
                        catastrophe which he alone can arrest- or let loose.</p>
                    <p>I know his Highness the Khedive personally, his love of peace and quiet, his
                        care for his people, and his desire of remaining on good terms with England,
                        well enough not to attach any importance to this particular report. </p>
                    <p>3. To many foreigners, residents in Egypt and elsewhere, the question is a
                        very simple one, and can be summed up thus: "Cherchez la pe fide Albion." In
                        their eyes England alone is responsible for the movement, and it is her own
                        agents, paid by herself, who stir up discontent and provoke outbreaks.</p>
                    <p>According to some people, England's reduction of her armed forces in Egypt is
                        a piece of pure bluff, an attempt to convince the world that she was really
                        welcomed there. And now finding herself not in the least beloved, and
                        dreading some future hostile movement, she <cb n="4"/>created an occaion
                        which gave her an excuse for increasing her army of occupation.</p>
                    <p>According to others, England's aim is not to appeal to the good offices of
                        the Sultan, but, on the contrary, to profit by the difficulties presented in
                        order to say to him : "it is to us that Egypt owes her present prosperity.
                        We are absolute masters of the country. We have had enough of your
                        intrigues. Let us come to terms, and you shall be paid a certain sum down on
                        condition that you renounce your right of suzerainty." Persons who hold this
                        opinion seem to be convinced tha the Sultan, being always in need of money,
                        will joyfully accede if the sum offered be worhty of his acceptance.</p>
                    <p>Finally, there are, again, a good many foreigners who fear that England's
                        object is simply to bring on a crisis which will justify her in deposing the
                        present Khedive, whom Lord Cromer, according to them, cannot forgive for his
                        former hankerings after independence. This particular hypothesis appears to
                        me entirely absurd, and, taking into consideration, first the excellent
                        relations subsiting between the Khedive and the royal family of England, and
                        further the numerous and apparently sincere declarations which the Khedive
                        and Lord Cromer have made to me regarding their personal relations, I am
                        myself quite unable to give it credence.</p>
                    <p>4. The fourth and last explanation which I will cite is far more mercenary
                        and less political. Certain of my friends, important shareholders in the
                        large hotels of Egypt, are convinced that a formidable campaign is being set
                        on foot by Monte Carlo and the great hotel companies of the Riviera, with
                        the object of "killing" Egypt and attracting to themselves the rich
                        clinetele, more numerous every year, which goes and spends its millions on
                        the banks of the Nile!</p>
                    <p>"It is really shameful and abominable," an Anglo-Egyptian said to me on the
                        subject. "Directly a couple of Arabs strike each other with their sticks, or
                        a Greek and a negro give one another a licking, imaginary details of a
                        terrible shindy are telegraphed all over the world; it is made to appear
                        that the Mussulman population is in a dangerously inflammable condition,
                        their fanaticism is called to mind, and we are given to understand that a
                        revolution is at hand, and that the Alexandrian massacres of 1882 may very
                        well be repeated. If one out of the thousands of great steamers that touch
                        at Alexandria or Port Said has a single case of illness on board, the cable
                        is immediately set to work announcing to the four quarters of the globe that
                        we have got the plague and yellow fever here. Or if an unlucky n- has eaten
                        too much fruit, our ports are said to be attacked by cholera!"</p>
                    <p>I do not know whether the mysterious powers at Monte Carlo and the
                        hotel-keepers of the Riviera are really taking measures to ruin Egypt as a
                        winter resort; but if it is true that such a campaign has been undertaken,
                        either on a large or a small scale, it has had but a paltry result.</p>
                    <p>In my opinion, all the aforementioned hypotheses are merely the fruits of
                        wild imagination. The truth is that almost the whole of Egypt is hard at
                        work, labouring energetically for the continuance of this era of hitherto
                        unknown propserity. And it is one of the most wonderful results of the
                        English occupation that in a country where formerly laziness reigned
                        supreme, work is today being pursued with incredible fervour and energy,
                        while life is as intense as in France or England. The English have not only
                        worked themselves at the regeneration of Egypt, but have also managed to
                        induce the Egyptians to work ardently for the same end. </p>
                    <p>Whence, then, come these rumours of discontent, and all these prophecies of
                        misfortune? There exists in Egypt, as in every country in the world, an
                        opposition party made up of all the malcontents. Numbered among its ranks,
                        we find the patriots, real or sham, whose hearts bleed at the sight of the
                        Englishman, giving orders like a master, and often somewhat roughly; the
                        ambitious, who see the admirable working of the present Government, and are
                        persuaded that they could direct things quite as well themselves; the
                        envious who are furious at not being prime ministers or, at the very least,
                        collector of taxes; the disappointed, who can nowhere find any official
                        crumbs to pick up wherewith to fatten themselves without taking any
                        exertion; and finally there are the irreconcilables, among whom I should
                        include a crowd of individuals from all parts of the world, who are no
                        longer able to carry on those shady little trades by which they formerly
                        enriched themselves. Add to these all the Pashas, Beys, and former employees
                        of the Government that have been discharged for idleness, or because they
                        had a too great weakness for "bansheesh"; and you will have the largest
                        element of the "Egyptian Opposition."</p>
                    <p>No doubt there are in Egypt men of integrity and worth who sincerely regret
                        that their country should not be free and independent, made great by her own
                        unaided exertions, and by her own children. To these I accord my entire
                        sympathy, respect, and admiration; but they themselves are generally the
                        first to recognise that Egypt is as yet incapable of self-government. They
                        understand that for Egypt to become still stronger and richer, peace and
                        quiet are needful, and the support of that powerful arm which twenty-five
                        years ago snatched her by main force from destruction.</p>
                    <p>But the others- the failures, the incapables, the dishonest- have but one end
                        and aim, which is to upset existing things and to pull everything to pieces
                        in the hope of obtaining some of the pickings. Not being able to do anything
                        else, they make a great noise, and are glad to find that there are people in
                        Europe childish enough to listen to them. </p>

                            anxiety will very shortly pass away. It is difficult to get 3 3/4 per
                            cent. for money today, and the Bank's position being exceptionally
                            strong, a reduction in the rate next week becomes more than a
                            possibility.</p>

                            note circulation having shrunk by 310,000 pounds, the net addition to
                            the reserve amounts to 218,000 pounds, the total being now 26,193,000
                            pounds as compared with 24,292,000 pounds a year ago, when the Bank rate
                            was 1 per cent. lower. The proportion of reserve to liabilities has
                            risen 3/4 on the week to 50 3/8 per cent. There is a shrinkage of
                            425,000 pounds in the "Other" securities, which is probably due to the
                            repayment of Japanese money temporarily borrowed.</p>

                            attention, and that the operations connected therewith have not been
                            altogether free from uncertainty, markets have this week maintained a
                            steady appearance. The substantial improvement in the reserve which has
                            been taking place during the past few weeks has naturally led dealers to
                            anticipate an almost immediate reduction in the Bank rate, and in some
                            quarters there was disappointment yesterday when it was announced that
                            the directors had decided to make no change this week. The more
                            optimistic views now held the future of money have had a cheering
                            influence on stocks and shares, and a substantial expansion of activity
                            may now be reasonably expected. </p>
                        <p>The settlement has shown a few weak spots, and two failures have been
                            announced. Both of the defaulters were connected with the miscellaneous
                            market, but the deficits were only small, and, with these two
                            exceptions, the settlement was concluded satisfactorily. </p>
                        <p>An outside failure- that a Glasgow operator- was more serious as far as
                            the effect upon certain stocks was concerned, the defaulter being
                            largely committed to speculations in metals as well as railway shares.
                            This caused liquidation for a time, which was understood to be largely
                            responsible for the fall in North British stocks.</p>
                        <p>Today the tendency has been dull, and the majority of the changes are to
                            lower prices. </p>

                        <p>First-class securities were dull at the beginning, but subsequently
                            showed a hardening tendency. Consols, after falling to 86 15/16 for the
                            account, recovered to 86 1/8, and have today relapsed again 86 15/16.

                        <p>The international market is steady. Both Russian and Japanese stocks have
                            been dull, but Japs yesterday displayed a better tone, the 4 1/2 per
                            cents. improving 1/8 to 97 3/8. Russian Fives further relapsed to 86
                            3/4. They leave off tonight at 86 1/4, as compared with 87 3/16 a week
                            ago, and the Fours at 77 1/2, as against 78 1/2. </p>

                        <p>There are still few signs of any permanent improvement in the volume of
                            business in the home railway section. Very little real support is
                            forthcoming, and in its absence the tone continues heavy and somewhat
                            irregular.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday the feature was the weakness of Scotch stocks, which followed
                            the example of North British. The latter fell away 1 1/4 to 35 7/8 while
                            Caledonian Deferred and Ordinary respectively dropped 5/8 and 1/2.</p>
                        <p>Metropolitan were weak, declining 3/4, while North Western shed 1/2, York
                            Deferred 3/8, and Great Eastern 1/4.</p>
                        <p>Today in home railways sales have been made of Brighton Deferred,
                            Metropolitan, and North Eastern. North British, after being lower, have
                            recovered to yesterday's price. Caledonian Def. have improved 1/8, while
                            South Western are a full point better.</p>

                        <p>After a slight relapse on Saturday, following upon the advance we
                            reported in our last article, Americans began this week in steady
                            fashion, and have continued firm throughout. In most sections prices are
                            appreciably higher on balance.</p>
                        <p>The good dividend prospects of Missouri made these shares a special
                            favourite at the beginning, and up to Wednesday night the quotation had
                            gained 2 3/4 on last Friday's higher close. Yesterday, however, the
                            shares fell away, and left off 7/8 lower at 42 1/4.</p>
                        <cb n="6"/>
                        <p>There was a good deal of expectation with regard to Pacific dividends,
                            and Unions at one time rose to 182 7/8 buyers. From this point they fell
                            away in the "Street" to 181 1/4, finally rally to 182 1/4. When it
                            became known that the dividends both of the Union Pacific and Southern
                            Pacific were the same as six months ago, - namely, 5 and 10 per cent.
                            per annum respectively- the tone in the market generally weakened
                            somewhat. Canadian Pacifics were, however, an excecption, and the close
                            showed a net gain of 2 1/8 at 192 after being 193.</p>
                        <p>Today a reaction has taken place in Americans, but with few exceptions
                            the declines are not large. Southern Pacific and Unions have each
                            dropped 1 1/8.</p>
                        <p>Canadian Pacific, Milwaukee, Erie, and Louisville have lost 1.</p>

                        <p>Although the prices of the leading Egyptian shares advanced considerably
                            in the early part of the week, they have now fallen back, and in some
                            cases are even lower. There is hardly any business, which is the
                            explanation of the weakness.</p>
                        <p>National Bank were at one time as good as 28 3/4, but closed last night
                            at 28 1/4. They leave off tonight at 28 1/8 1/4. Daira, after being 17
                            13/16, close at 17 1/2. The Deferred are nominally 97.9. Agricultural
                            Bank have held their price fairly well, and close 9 15/16, the
                            Preference at 9 5/8, and the 3 1/2% Debentures at 91.</p>
                        <p>Delta Preference Bearer were reushed up to 12 1/8 and a few even changed
                            hands at 12 1/4, but close at 11 3/4. 12. Delta Land &amp; Investment
                            have not been mentioned, and close 4 3/8. Egyptian Estates keep firm at
                            2 5/8, and the Deferred are up to 25. United Egyptian Lands at 9/32
                            premium and the Deferred at 10 are also better.</p>
                        <p>There is not much market in Corporation of Western Egypt at present, the
                            old shares closing 1 1/16, and the new issue about 1/8 dis. to par.
                            Union Fonciere and Land Bank remain quiet at 6 1/8-3/8 and 9 1/4
                            respectively.</p>
                        <p>Egyptian Markets at 1 9/16 and Salt &amp; Soda at 23/6 are also very
                            nomial. Khedivial Mail Ordinary are 1 3/4-7/8 and the Preference 4
                            5/8-7/8. Bank of Roumania close at 10.</p>

                        <p>The new account is mining shares has not opened very cheerfully. A good
                            deal of liquidation has been carried out by dealers, who have had
                            another fit of nerves with regard to the political outlook, and the
                            result has been to put quotations lower nearly all around.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday the tone was a little better, but business was very scarce.
                            Allowing for the dividend reduction, Rand Mines left off 1/16 higher at
                            6 13/16 bid, and Goldfields were also slightly harder at 4 3/16 buyers.
                            Rhodesians were firm, but the movements were slight. Bankets were in
                            demand at 1 15/16.</p>
                        <p>Today Kaffirs have kept firm, but quiet. Rand Mines and East Rand are
                            1/32 better.</p>
                        <p>In the Egyptian section Nile Valleys are again better, and the quotation
                            has risen to 5/6, after being about 3/6-4/6 on Tuesday. Egyptian Mines

                    <p>Nous extrayons d'une correspondance d'Alexandrie, en date d'hier, le passage
                        suivant:</p>
                    <p>"Ici, comme au caire, la faiblesse qui prevaut sur le marche est generalement
                        attribuee aux nouvelles emissions qui pullulent et menacent de nes pas
                        prendre tiu d'ici la saison morte. Ces appels de fonds incessants sont
                        devenus un veritable cauchemar, qui pese sans repit sur les espirits et, qui
                        plus est, sur les cours. Comme le faisait remarquer samedi "The Egyptian
                        Gazette," on veud les titres qu'on a pour souscrire; c'est ce qui explique
                        l'absence d'acheteurs, l'affluence des vendeurs et l'admirable succes d'une
                        emission recente qui a ete couverte 30 fois, ce qui n'a pas empeche la prime
                        de se reduire a 1/32 et le titre de tomber aujourd'hui a 0 31/32 pounds.</p>
                    <p>"Il est naturel que ces emissions pour lesquelles il y a peu a verser aient
                        les faveurs de petits speculateurs auxquels on fait entrevoir de grosses
                        primes; mais, comme vous voyez les resultats ne repondent guere aux
                        promesses ou aux esperances. La vraie speculation demeure dans
                        l'expectative; elle semble plutot la reteuir est la crainte, exageres
                        evidemment, que la stagnation actuelle se prolonge, alors que la saison
                        active est deja passablement avancee. Le optimistes sont convaincus que la
                        crise approche de son terme."</p>
