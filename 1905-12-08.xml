                    <head>The Sultan and The Powers</head>
                    <p>For the moment the tension that has been existing between the Sultan and the
                        Powers is releived, and the Sublime Porte is state to have accepted the
                        Macedonian financial scheme subjecct to numerous modifications. The crisis,
                        it is hardly needful to point out, is only temporaryily releaved even if we
                        assume that the Sultan's concessions are genuine, ffor the Macedonian
                        problem will never be solved by the peaceful methods of diplomacy or such
                        mild acts of coercion as the seizure of custom houses. The Blue Book issued
                        yesterday week on the situation shows very clearly the disturbed state of
                        the country, and gives information as to the steps taken by the Powers to
                        bring about an improvement. Whether the measures that have been, and are now
                        being taken will improved the position is quite a different matter;
                        unfortunately there is not much room for hope that they will. The fault does
                        not rest with the Sultan, as some agitators would have us believe. It is
                        true, of course, that his honesty of the officials is seldom very
                        conspicious; but the main difficulty is in the dissensions of the Christian.
                        The creeds of the rival sects are still of that sturdy nature which disdains
                        toleration: and accordingly the long list of Macedonian outbreaks contain
                        many outrages and murders committed by one Christian body on the other,
                        while the Turkish Government looks on, only occasionally interfering that it
                        may impartially massacre both. Whille the Churches are strong enough to defy
                        the Government and to play on the fanatic feelings of their followers by
                        egging them on, and while the neighboring States are able to interfere and
                        to stir up racial as well as religious strife, it is safe to predict that
                        the condition of Macedonia will not be greatly ameliorated. The
                        establishment of a strong Administration able to depress disorder severly,
                        whether committed by Christian of Turk, seems to real way out; but at the
                        moment it is not possible; and the other alternative suggested, that the
                        country shall be divided among the disputants, would probably lead to open
                        war. </p>

                    <head>The Kaiser's Speech</head>
                    <p>The German Emperor's speech at the opening of the new session of the
                        Reichstag last week has aroused considerable attention throughout Europe.
                        The speech was delivered to the members in person. This unusual proceddure
                        might be expected to introduce some fresh programme to his people, and his
                        words accordingly have been read with close attention at home and abroad.
                        With regard to the financial proposals that were semi ofificially disclosed
                        a fortnight ago the Kaiser has given no further information; and it may
                        reasonably be concluded therefrom that they have been sufficiently well
                        understood to need no comment from the Head of State. The situation in the
                        colonies was touched on, and after a sympathetic reference to the troops in
                        South West Africa, there is a promise that the Colonial Budgets will be
                        simplified, as "the basis for a measure of colonial self government." the
                        criticism made in Berlin that self government is hardly po+ssible until the
                        colonies are self supporting will perhaps be revised onmore thorough
                        consideration. The speech continued to deal with the commercial treaties
                        about to be concluded with foreign nations, and then proceeded to treat of
                        the general international posittion, and of those trouble waters of diplomcy
                        into which the Kaiser has made so many dramatic incursions. "in foreign
                        policy the relations of the German Empire with all Powers are correect, and
                        with most Powers are correct, and with most Powers they are good and
                        friendly." The distinction, which has been seized with avidity by the German
                        Press, is important; and the politicians have quickly applied it to France
                        and ourselves by a process of elimination. In the remark- a somewhat unusual
                        one- on the internal affairs of Russia, it is speccifically stated that she
                        is a "friendly neighbor." The Japanese are welcomed into the rank of the
                        GreatPowers by an allusion to the "pacific mission of this highly gifted
                        people," that recalls, although it is certainly not intended to, the action
                        of Germany in stultifying the results of the Chino-Japanese War ten years
                        ago. On neither of the late belligerents, then, can the Imperian distinction
                        be fixed.</p>
                    <p>The United States must also be excused by a further sentence, although the
                        impending commercial war and the general American dissatisfaction at what is
                        alleged to be a wilful disregard of the Monroe doctrine, and the attempts of
                        the State-aided shipping companies to obtain a footing in the West Indies,
                        may lead to considerable coolness between the two nations. With Austria and
                        Italy, as representing the second and third Powers of the Triple Alliance,
                        relations must also be cordial: although it is freely admitted on all hands
                        that the internal condition of the former, and the openly expressed
                        discontent of the latter, with an Alliance that is " prejudices against the
                        progress of German industry," alluded to by the Kaiser, can only point to
                        England and France: and this is made clearer by a remark on the Moroccan
                        question, on which matter, however, it is allowed that an understanding had
                        been arrived at. While readily believing that "the peace of the German
                        nation is a matter of sacred concern" to Willian the Second, we may still
                        feel that in many ways his diplomacy had not tended to promote that belief
                        among other peoples, and that especially, when he intervened in Morocco, the
                        stop was mistimed.. Nobody wishes to settle affairs in which Germany is
                        concerned without consulting her: but when a categorical declaration was
                        made by the Imperial Chancellor that she acquiesced in the Anglo French
                        Agreement, it was surely more than a little surprising, if a year afterwards
                        Germany proceeded to sow strife. Everywhere outside the Empire it has been
                        taken as an intimation that the Kaiser wished to disturb the cordiality
                        between France and England: and the tone of the German Press, moderate and
                        extreme alike, has done nothing to allay that suspicion. </p>
                    <p>A remark that "tendencies suppressed at one point may reappear at another" is
                        frankly beyond our understanding, unless an interpretation is put upon it
                        that we should be loth to adopt. The fact that Germany has refused to
                        cooperate with Europe in the Macedonia imbroglio cannot be taken as a sign
                        that another surprise is to be sprung upon her neighbours. The Great Powers
                        of Europe are quite willing to work together with Germany for common ends,
                        and to remain on good terms with her in those questions where Germany alone
                        is legitimetly concerned. If the Emperor finds there is distrust, he would
                        do well to look for its cause in the diplomatic methods he has seen fit to
                        pursue. Distrust of the German people there in none; on the contrary, they
                        are sincerely admired. Prejudice against, or rather jealousy, of their
                        industrial progress is not much in evidence and most would take it as the
                        truest compliment that could be paid to a rival. We can sincerely say that
                        as regards political affairs, a good understanding with Germany is desired
                        by other nations. The only reason that relations have become difficult is
                        that considerable aggressiveness is apparent in the modern German outlook on
                        "Welt Politik." With such an attitude, that is noticeable not only in
                        utterances of University Professors, but in the tone a large portion of the
                        Press, of a leading party in the State, and too often of the Emperor
                        himself, it is scarcely wonderful if other nations are less friendly to
                        Germany than they would be if they had no reason to think themselves
                        threatened.Those are the only "signs of the times" that we can perceive: and
                        when the Emperor suggests that unjust attacks are threatened, we can only
                        suppose that either he is obsessed with unfounded suspicion of his
                        neighbours or else that he is making a not particulary astute move to secure
                        the passage of the Navy Bill.</p>

                        <p>The Moroccoa Question</p>
                        <p>Berlin, December 7</p>
                        <p>Reichstag- Prince von Bulow stated that Germany must be stong enough to
                            hold her own without allies. As regards East Asia Germany's relations
                            with Japan were good and friendly. He believed that the Japanese, who
                            through their bravery and intelligence, had won a position among the
                            Great Powers, were anxious to consolidate that position by a policy
                            inpiring confidence. The Anglo Japanese treaty contains nothing contrary
                            to Germany's aims. "We have," he continued, "striven for and desire the
                            open door. The greatest possible guarantee of peace is the maintainence
                            of the integrity and independence of Chine."</p>
                        <p>He further explained Germany's attitude in respect of Morocco. Germany
                            had by treaty the right to be heard with regards to any reshaping of
                            existing conditions in Morocco. He quoted his note of the 11th, April to
                            Count Metternich, saying in this connection that if Germany quietly
                            surrendered her rights in Morocco we should be encouraging onlookers to
                            treat us with similar disregard in much greater questions. He concluded
                            by denying that Germany was seeking an occasion to fall upon France.</p>

                            formation of the Cabinet are of the most varied character and altogether
                            conjectural, but there is a growing belief that Sir Henry
                            Campbell-Bannerman will eventually go to the house of Lords, leaving Mr.
                            Asquith to lead the Commons. The names of Mr. Asquith and Mr. Morley are
                            mentioned for the Chancellorship of the Exchequer; the latter is also
                            spoken of in connection with the India Office.</p>

                        <p>Germany has changed her attitude with regard to the Power and the Porte.
                            She now urges the former to accept the amendments proposed by the
                            latter. This action is attributed to her desire to recover the favored
                            position which she formerly occupied.</p>

                    <p>A Greek youth, a hawker of cheeses, seventeen years of age, was selling his

                        him a bit of cheese for ten paras. The Greek refused the offer, so the
                        native hit him with a swish he was carrying. Thereupon the Greek drew his
                        knife and plunged it into the Arab’s heart. Death was instantaneous. The

                        husband in consequence. The latter received a number of communication that
                        if he did not divorce his wife he would die. A few days ago the husband
                        found that he had been poisoned, and before he died told the omdeh of these

                    <p>CIRCULAR TO CAPTAINS.</p>
                    <p>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT)</p>
                    <p>PORT SAID, Tuesday.</p>
                    <p>The steamer whistle in Port Said harbor has become such a nuisance, and so
                        many complaints have been received, that Mr. D.A. Cameron, H.B.M.’s
                        Consul-General, has addressed a circular to the captains of the British
                        vessels, stating that “article 10, section 6, of the Suez Canal Company’s
                        regulations for navigation forbids master of vessels to sound their steam
                        whistles in the ports of the Canal excepts as an alarm signal in case of
                        serious danger. Of late, however, the abuse of the steam whistles by some
                        masters of vessels, especially in calling for the pilot, has increased to
                        such an extent that it has become an intolerable nuisance to the inhabitants
                        of Port Said whose dwellings are on or near the main thoroughfare facing the
                        harbor. I shall be extremely grateful if you will assist me in this matter
                        by giving orders that the steam-whistle on your vessel is to be sounded in
                        this harbor only as an alarm signal in case of danger, and that it is not to
                        be sounded in order to a pilot.”</p>
                    <p>A supply of these circulars has been given to the agents for delivery to the
                        masters immediately ships arrive. It is to be hoped that this will decrease,
                        if not entirely put a stop to one, of the biggest nuisance in Port Said.</p>

                        recently published his annual report on the scholastic work of the ulema
                        during the last year of the Hegira. The book gives full details of the
                        studies in the mosques, the number of students, and the arrangements for
                        studies which have been already adopted and which will be made in the new
                        year. The board of ulema appears to have been very successful in the past
                        year. Students from all the provinces of Egypt have enrolled themselves in
                        the list of the students of the religious school, and those who continued
                        their studies to the end of the year were 440 in number i.e., 133 Hansfieh,
                        315 Malkieh, and 92 Shafieh. The president remarks that the Hansfieh have
                        only formed about 30 percent of the total number of the students; while they
                        ought to be double that number for the Hansfieh alone have the privilege of
                        holding the official positions of Cadi, Mufti, and Mudarris (professor) of
                        the students who were successful in the last examination 80 percent were the
                        1st year, 90 percent of the 2nd, 92 percent of the 3rd, and 80 percent of
                        the 4th year.</p>
                    <p>Several inspectors have been appointed by the board of ulema for the
                        studentsm, and all the possible improvements either have been or will be
                        made. The Khedive has graciously made a gift to the board of ulema of L.E.
                        100. It is intended to spend the money on books to be given as prizes to
                        successful students.</p>

                        in refraining from appointing judges to towns of which they are natives,

                        in this case the judge does his best to be impartial, but owing to the fact,
                        that he was born and bred in that town, it is most difficult for him to be
                        scrupulously impartial, despite his best endeavours.</p>

                        looked forward to, and so replete with glowing prospects, that it would seem
                        hard to imagine how all these anticipations are to be realized.
                        Nevertheless, we think we may safely say that last night’s performance will
                        go far to gratify the most ardent expectations. The selection of Aida for
                        the first production of the season is in accordance with the time-honoured
                        custom, and the enthusiasm this noble work always evokes raises ever-fresh
                        monuments to the glorious memory of Verdi, affording at the same time a
                        striking proof of public spirit, which, in so many other directions, is
                        peculiarly scarce amongst these who have made Egypt the country of their
                        adoption.</p>
                    <p>The first act of the opera serves chiefly as a sort of prologue or foretaste
                        of the pleasures still to come; it elicited some good singing, notably
                        Aida’s and Radames solos, as well as that of the High Priest. AII. opened
                        well with an unexceptionable rendering of Amneris’ graceful melody with the
                        support of the woman’s chorus; while the passage between her and Aida came
                        in for a full share of appreciation. The second scene of the act</p>
                    <p>went off with all the blaying glory of its clarions; and the triumphal
                        marches were attacked with the vigour they demanded. The scene has little
                        scope for individual efforts, if on excepts the entry of the captive
                        Asmonaro, which, if well carried out, as it was his night, never fails to
                        impart a note of tragedy to the surrounding jubilation. Throughout the act
                        the orchestration was without blemish and we have nothing but praise for the
                        judicious and skillful manner in which Sig. Zuccni brought this portion of
                        his difficult task to a very successful termination, when it produced wild
                        enthusiasm and numerous “calls.” It is, of course, the third act which
                        decides the issue of the opera, and last night’s rendering of it was in
                        every way equal to any of the best we have heard. In particular, Aida’s
                        pathetic aria “O mis patria mai pih ti riverdro” was charmingly sung and was
                        encored by an enraptured audience; nor was the house less enthusiastic over
                        the impassioned duet of Aida with Asmonaro, whose persuasion of his daughter
                        to induce her lover into betrayal of his county was admirably put into
                        execution. The succeeding duet of Aide and Ramades was not quite on a par
                        with the previous one, but was very satisfactory. The plaintive and
                        emotional music assigned to Amneris, during the first scene of Act IV., is
                        eminently appropriate to the situation and was rendered with exquisite
                        pathos. The scene of all, however, struck us as a little hard and wanting in
                        sympathy.</p>
                    <p>The roles were all ably filled; that of Aida being taken by Signa. Giannina
                        Russ, who sang with assurance, if not with distinction; her powerful
                        soprano, though at times apt to grate a little, carries much expression and
                        found full favor with its audience; while the fine melodious tones and
                        sympathetic utterance of Signa. Blance Lavin de Cassas, an excellent
                        Amneris, leaves us with a high opinion of her splendid vocal and dramatic
                        gift. The Ramades of Signor Luigi Longobardi was energetic and stimulating,
                        while the purity of his notes and his clearness of articulation are alike
                        mark worthy. A fine spirited performance of Amonaro was given by Sig.
                        Pasquole Amato, and the part of the High Priest was very well sung by Sig.
                        Constantino Nicolay. Sig. Francesco Rusconi was satisfactory as the
                        King.</p>
                    <p>Of the ballets, those of the second set pleased us better than that of the
                        first, but none were especially noteworthy. The men’s chorus was, as usual,
                        superior to the women’s and acquitted itself well in the last act.</p>
                    <p>The house, warm and responsive as ever, presented its usual brilliant aspect
                        and was filled to its utmost confines. H.E. the Governor of Alexandria
                        attended the performance. On the whole, after so eminently satisfactory a
                        production, and with the near prospect of renewing acquaintance with Sig.
                        Bellincioni, we look forward to a brilliant season with confidence and
                        pleasure.</p>

                        comparatively mushroom growth, while the Egyptians and the other coloured

                        dry dock built for the Philippines will be $20,000 or $45,000. This has

                        necessary on the dock to handle the towing lines and operate the pumps and
                        electric contrivances for keeping the structure dry. They cannot steer the

                        100 miles in length and more than 30 in breadth, and the smaller but still

                        legible and most valuable for the study og Greco Egyptian Law. The volume in
                        which these records are published is edited by M Reinsch with the
                        assistance, for the Greek manuscripts, of M. Seymour de Ricci and for the
                        Demotic ones of the Reinach papyri consist of a series of documents which;
                        although acquired at Ashmunein, the ancient Hermopolis Magua, evidently
                        originally came from Tehneh, the old Akoris. They almost all concern the
                        family of a certain Dionysius, son of Kephalos. The majority of these papyri
                        are engrossed in Greek, the minority in Demotic. </p>
                    <p>Akoris is referred to by the "Ravenna Geographer" and by Ptolemy. It is
                        situated 11 kilometres from Minieh, 1,500 metres east of th eNile. That it
                        and Tenueh are identical is proved by a late papyrus which nited the two
                        names. </p>
                    <p>Ptolemy places it in the Kynopolite Nome, but all the new papyri speak of its
                        being an Hermopolite town, from which it would appear that the Kynopolite
                        Nome extended further to the south, in the time of Ptolemy and the extant
                        geographers, than when the papyri were written. </p>
                    <p>With the exception of a citologos' receipts the whole of the Dionysius
                        dossier from Akoris concerns himself or relatives. </p>
                    <p>Dionysius was a military cultivator of the royal demesue, not as were so many
                        personages in the Petrie papyri and those found by M. Jorgues and others, a
                        Klerouch or holder of territorial military fief. A basilikos georous farmed
                        the royal land, rendering a portion of the arvest to the king's officials,
                        retaining the remainder for his own support and for seed. </p>
                    <p>In addition to the areas Dionysius had to cultivate upon the above terms for
                        the king, his accounts prove that he rented, or owned, several other pieces
                        of ground. An important member of the family was Sarapeus, mother of
                        Dionysius; she also bore the names Senebellou ad Demetra,, and appears in
                        the documents as security for her son. </p>
                    <p>M. Reinach gives the geneology of the family as indicated by th epapyri,
                        endeavoring to trace alliances between th eGreeks and the indigenous
                        Egyptians. This part of the work is followed by a chronology of the
                        contracts, which date from 143 to 103 BC. </p>
                    <p>The legal formulae in numerous contracts are interesting not only to jurists
                        but to the "man in the street". The grain upon which loans were secured, or
                        which, as is much more frequent, was sold upon credit, and remtted to the
                        royal treasuries as rent, or tribute in kind had to be the product of the
                        recent harvest, therefore fresh: it must be compant that is, as said in
                        Manitoba today of "No. I hard" quality; and unmixedn namely with inerior
                        grain. </p>
                    <p>The majority of loans are those of corn, which it would appear must have been
                        dealt in speculatively as cotton futures are now, because instances of such
                        advances are far too numerous to have arisen from necessity for obtaining
                        grain for sowing( the dates also negative this in many cases) or for handing
                        over to the state functionaries as quittance for obligations, which should
                        have been paid out as result of the borrowers' own harvest. Doubtless
                        however a man like Dionysius, if the price in autumn was high, would be
                        tempted to sell all his harvest, hoping to buy back later on, after a fall,
                        sufficient to pay his grain tribute and for seed, though a man of weaker
                        financial position would be compelled at harvest time to render up his tithe
                        by the collectors. </p>
                    <p>The loans are always repayable in kind, becoming due immediately upon the
                        suceeding harvest, and the interest was 50%, also in kind. This appears
                        axtortionate, but it must be remembered that borrowers were obtaining grain
                        at the annual period of greatest scarcity, having, doubtless, waited until
                        the last, in the hope of a more favorable turn of the market; and were
                        conventing to repay in the month when, reaping just completed, it would be
                        lowest price. </p>
                    <p>It would appear, however, there were some illegalities in the rate of
                        interest wrung from borrowers, either in the 50% of which no mention is
                        often made, or because even a higher rate was convenanted for, so often the
                        interest is unspecified and it merely set forth that a loan od say, 30
                        artabas of wheat is to be ready in the next month Poyai, June-July. In being
                        evident that the amount advanced in the case was only 20 artabas, or less,
                        whereas the contrast was restored 30 and was so embodied in acceptances,
                        herefore on maturity 50% at least would be paid up in advance for from 5-8
                        months. </p>
                    <p>In some cases those promissory notes which omit the quantity payable
                        accordingly augmented, of accomidation granted the previous year. Should the
                        debtor fail to meet his obligation to pay in kind, contracts specify that
                        immediately that permission is changed into monetary one which was
                        compulsory and the creditor could enforcce a settleent in copper drachmas at
                        the rate (mostly) of 3,000 drachmas per artaba. Sometimees, however only
                        2,000 are specified. There was no option, it being a penal clause. The lower
                        rate may have been special to contracts between relatives, or friends, but
                        it should be noted that in the second century BC the exchange rate between
                        copper and silver drachas varied between 1-375 and 1-1500</p>
                    <p>The liability for a contract descended to the heirs of signatory, but its
                        enforcement had to be placed in the hands of certain officials. The goods of
                        the debtor could be reduced to slavery for his creditor's benefit. </p>
                    <p>One of these papyri expressed the fear of its writer that he might be
                        condemned to servitude by what, he asserts, was a fraudulent clain of
                        certain Lysikcrates. Thes person, one Kephalos, alleged that having bought
                        some wine for 24 copper talents for which he agreed to pay at Sotion, the
                        banker's, he did pay 13 talents of the amount and received back the "account
                        of sale". Subsequently, he writes, he paid the balance and asked for a
                        receipt but appears to have failed to obtain it( this looks suspicious). He,
                        however, explains this neglect because "he had no idea Lysikcrates bore him
                        any malice." The latter subsequently sent him before the strategos, of the
                        nome, obtaining judgement for 10 talents. Why is was reduced does not
                        appear, so it may be a scribal error, but the strategos permitted Kephalos 3
                        years for complete payment and no interest was added to the account, but he
                        has to provide four sureties. </p>
                    <p>Lysekcrited, it would seem, not having been particularly triumphant in the
                        litigation, handed over the new document to a third party against whom there
                        could be no defence. Kephalos, foreseening probability of his defaulting
                        some of the payments, in which case he says the amount of his liability
                        would speedily be doubled, appeals to the king to annul the decision on the
                        ground that in reality he had paid all the original sum. </p>
                    <p>One form of security is interesting. It is the guaranteeof a creditor's
                        lands, but which surety is restricted to permitting the debtor to enter
                        upon, and to cultivate them until the loan is repaid, but does not provide
                        him power to become the permanent possesor, or even endow him with right of
                        sale. Of course he would expect to reemburse himwelf to the full extent of
                        the copper drachma rate of indebtedness, failure to fulfill the covenants of
                        paying in kind at maturity having occurred. </p>
                    <p>Females could subscribe to or endorse, these contracts, and under the
                        guarantee, or their Greek word. A widow had her son for that position and a
                        wife her husband. The leader could enforce the contract against one or both
                        of them and any other personnage who was also a security, and it would
                        appear in any order or collectively as he might select. </p>
                    <p>M Reinach, appositely points out how clear a commentary this is upon the
                        anecdote in J sephus concerning Joseph, son of Tobit, who when tenering to
                        farm the Palestine ccustoms for Ptolemy. The king enquired what scuritye he
                        should offer to him. Joseph, the Jew, replied, "yourself ad wife; each of
                        you can guarate the impost accruing to the other."</p>
                    <p>As with the modern capitulations in Egypt there was a distinction between the
                        judiciary competence in the case of contracts in question, in regard to
                        whether they had been engrossed in Greek or Demotic. </p>
                    <p>If Demotic documents were in dispute, Egyptian judges decided according to
                        Egyptian law (and probably precedents). A decree of Ptolemy Energetes,
                        fortunately restored to us in the Tebtunis papyri. Sets forth that, if the
                        contracts are in Demotic, Greeks ust abide by this. The parties, hoewever,
                        were well protected because 6, and perhaps 12 witnesses were required by
                        Egyptian law to such deeds. So that a Greek if he exercised ordinary
                        precaution, could not allege that he misunderstood the important part of a
                        Demotic contract. A breif approval of it in Greek by the handwriting og the
                        party concerned is often endorsed upon the papyrus and its formula included
                        the date and place of execcution. Contracts had to be registered at the
                        proper town for the district. An Egyptian (Demotic) document was not
                        invalidated by being registered in Greek but an Egyptian notary,"a preit of
                        Thoth," had to be employed for the purpose. </p>
                    <p>The most complete contracts had the debtor's signature, the witnesses', the
                        registration or officials's signature, then a docket summarising the deed,
                        which came at the end of the papyrus when rolled up; attache to it were two
                        strips or cords which were tied and sealed. The secimen copy was deposited
                        with the official custodian, and if a dispute arose as to contract, this
                        registrar's copy could have its seals broken and the summary be compared
                        with the fuller internal engrossment, a similar plan to that adopted for
                        cuneiform tablets in Assyria and Babylonia. The seal-, however, never appear
                        to have been those of the parties concerned, as in Mesopotamia, but those of
                        the notary only. </p>
                    <p>The description of various kinds of bureaux for registration in each nome for
                        different documents has been attempted by Dr. Wessely. </p>
                    <p>The subject is completed by reference to what occurred when the contract was
                        fulfilled- the title to everything hypothecated was restored to the debtor,
                        and a formal receipt given. This it was wiser to have executed at the
                        appointed nome capital for contracts and to be registered and signed by the
                        bureau clerk. This, if he had really repaid his debt was what Kephalos
                        should have obtained from Lysikcrates, </p>
                    <p>If the original creditor was dead his widow or heir had to deliver the
                        receipt, which was termed greek word. </p>

                    <head>The Arab And The Desert</head>
                    <p>The author of this interesting work is at his best when tracing "the relation
                        between desert scenery and the character of the desert people." Here is a
                        passage which every one who spent even a few days and nights in the Sahara
                        must feel to be profoundly true. Mr. Phillippe says:-</p>
                    <p>"What I came to feel more and more strongly as time went on was the
                        extraordinarily stimulating and exciting effect of the desert and the desert
                        climate on the one hand, and its entire lack of anything substantial and
                        definite to think about and feed the mind on the other. The pureness and
                        keenness of the air, and the wonderful brilliance of light in which you
                        live, and which seems physically to invigorate and sustain you, enhance your
                        consciousness and sharpen all your facculties. You see, hear, feel, move
                        with an alertness quite new. Every sense is strung up, as it were, quicker,
                        livelier, more express in its movements than heretofore.… And as you live
                        amid these surroundings, this strung up feeling grows to tension and breeds
                        a sharp excitement. At the same time all this extra vigilance is very ill
                        requited. If a twig rattles, or a stone clicks in the sun, your ears shout
                        the message to you as if it were a gun shot, but for the most part they live
                        an idle life. Your glance rauges these wastes like a wild beast. It delights
                        in its freedom and in its own movements. Yet all the time it is sending into
                        the brain little news or none. In short, the stimulus that breathes in the
                        air is addressed to the nerves and senses, not to the mind. It makes you
                        feel intensely, but not think."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Phillipps finds in this quality of Sabara the secret of </p>
                    <p>THE ARAB TEMPERMENT</p>
                    <p>as revealed individually in the Arab as he knowns him, and collectively in
                        the lessons of Arab achievement and Arab failure in the pages of history. </p>
                    <p>"I used to think that the temperament I read on the keen faces and glancing
                        eyes under the burnous was the very temperment I felt in the blare and glare
                        and breath of the desert. All around one here quivers the nervous
                        excitability of which one sees so much in Arab doings- the nervous
                        excitability which inspired all their conquests and campaigns; and invested
                        them with their dangerous character of tremendous violence, suddenness and
                        unexpecteddness... And accompnying this excessive excitability, which was
                        the spirit in which the Arab worked, and the impulse which in old times
                        drove him forth on his career of destruction, we have round us here, too,
                        the sense of the profound limitation which undid all his work and led him
                        back eventually to the desert again... What is it this landscape of restless
                        sand lacks? The question brings us face to face with the ever lasting
                        deficiency in Arab character and the Arab civilisation. It lacks the
                        principle of cohesion which is the first condition of all prograssive
                        development. So, I used to think, the strength and weakness of the Arab were
                        alike displayed in the desert. All the influences that stimulated his nerves
                        and starved his intellect were round there. In his successes- his frantic
                        conquests and frantic art and science- is the stored up force of the
                        ddesert's nervous energy. In the decline and disintegration of all his power
                        and all his labour is the desert's fatal incoherence."</p>

                    <p>Very interesting (Though not, of course, original, being merely a collation
                        of the experience of previous observers) is the author's account of the work
                        of physical disintegration and destruction upon which the ddesert is
                        eternally engaged. </p>
                    <p>"The Sahara is not altogether the motionless, dead thing it looks. It is
                        carrying on the work of destruction all the time. The means it employs are
                        the sand itself, helped by heat and cold and wind. The variation oof
                        temperature by day and night, often eighty or a hundred degrees, causes an
                        expansion and contraction of the rocks so sudden as often to split them
                        asunder as is a quarryman's hammer had done the work... Where this process
                        stops, another begins. Apart from the newly split fragments, the common
                        aspecct of the desert is a surface scattered with stones and pebbles worn as
                        smooth and glossy as if they had laid for ages in the bed of a river. This
                        smoothness is due to the sand, which works upon the broken fragments,
                        rubbing and wearing them away... Moreover, the sand works not only on
                        detached fragments, but on the permanent rock. The flanks of the cliffs near
                        El Golea are worn and sculptured in some places to a mere lace work of
                        stone.… Thus the hills and cliffs themselves yield by degrees to the sand's
                        onset. The Sahara, it must be remembered, wears no covering of vegetation
                        and earth stitched together by innumerable roots of plants and trees to
                        protect it. It is open to all attack.."</p>
                    <p>THE FIGHT FOR LIFE</p>
                    <p>In some parts of the Sahara- their extent, Mr. Phillipps tells us, is
                        estimates to be about a ninth of its whole area- the sand has already gained
                        complete victory. In these parts, the regions of the dunes, all structureal
                        form, represented by rock and stone, has disappeared, has been decmposed
                        into grains of sand. The plateaux of tracts of firmer ground stand out, like
                        islands, from the sea of sand- and ever the sand gains upon them. The anther
                        thus sums up the raison d'etre of the Shara:-</p>
                    <p>"In all this the object of the desert is clear enough. Its one endeavour is
                        the destruction, blotting out, and utter docomposition of all organic forms.
                        Every tiny oasis in the desert has to fight for its life. Each one stands a
                        siege. Water, soil, a handful of palms give foothold for a little community.
                        Individual property, social obligations, recognised responsibilities and
                        laws, germinate and take root, keeping pace with the growth of plant and
                        tree. But all around, constantly repulsed but constantly renewing the
                        attack, the old blind monster fumbles and feels, like water round a ship,
                        indomitable persistent, assiduous, hankering to get back its own."</p>
                    <p>We have quotedd enough, however to encourage the reader to follow Mr.
                        Phillipps further in his own pages. His book shows a remarkable insight into
                        the true inwardness and soul of things; it should be read by everyone who
                        cares to know something of that grand and terrible work of nature which is
                        the Sahara. </p>

                    <p>As Egypt's lean and ill-favored kine began to come up out of the river in th
                        elow flood of 1839, and have come up yearly since till the full seven in
                        complete with this year's poor flood, the Irrigation Department has had of
                        late years a succession of short supplies to deal with. It has, therefore,
                        gained much experience in the business of distributing water and getting the
                        highest duty out of it. The conclusions arrived at as a resutl of such
                        experience, are therefore worth noting, as the principles can be applied in
                        any country, though the details of the arrangements would naturally have to
                        be modified to suit other conditions of climate and crops. Egypt burrowed
                        the idea of irrigation by rotation from India, where "Tatils" is the name by
                        which the system is known. The same practice has been adopted in Java, and
                        probably elsewhere. In Egypt it has been found most convenient, for the
                        purpose of applying this method, to divide up each seperate canal system
                        main canal and its branches into three sections or groups, which we will
                        call A,B, and C. It has been ascertained by observation that the summer
                        crops do well with one watering every eighteen days. Each section is in its
                        turn given water for six days and is prevented from taking it for twelve.
                        For such a programme to work, it is necessary that the relation between the
                        croppedd area and the available discharge be such that the supply of water
                        is sufficient for irrigating the whole area within the period of eighteen
                        days. If it takes twenty-one days, one day's general stoppage is inserted
                        between the working period of each section, if it takes twenty four days,
                        two days general stoppage is inserted. </p>
                    <p>The general day's stoppages provide for the filing of the channels whose turn
                        to take water comes next, so that the water may reach the tail ends of the
                        sections, which thus obtain as good a supply from the commencement of their
                        six days' period as the higher reaches. These stoppage days are also used to
                        give water to those crops which have been badly supplied during their proper
                        working period: The intermediate days of general stoppage provide a reserve
                        which is utilised to prevet arrears accumulating to such an extent as to
                        upset the published programmes and introduce confusion during the most
                        critical period. </p>
                    <p>In the summer of 1900 the period between waterings had to be extended to
                        twenty eight days. This necessitated a fresh subdivision of the system into
                        four sections instead of three. Each section worked six days, and there was
                        one day's general stoppage after each section's period, making in all twenty
                        eight days. This was considered the extreme crops would bear, so that, if
                        the supply was insufficient to effect the watering of all crops in twenty
                        eigtht days, the crop area in excess of what could be watered in the time
                        had to be left to its fate, as a preferable alternative to endangering the
                        whole area of cultivvation. By means of the severe rotations adopted in
                        1900, and of other measures, the summer duty of water for the cotton crop
                        was raised by one- third; one cubic metre discharge per second being made to
                        do the irrigation of nearly 4,000 acres, instead of the normal 3,000.</p>
                    <p>It is of great importance to abide by the rotation programme, once it has
                        been published. Alternations unsettle the farmers, and they do not know what
                        to expect. </p>
                    <p>It was stated in one article of this series that when the period of
                        distribution was discussed it would be explained how the summer discharge is
                        controlled so that it may flow in channels adapted to a much larger supply
                        without an inconviently low water surface. As the previous examples have
                        been drawn from Egypt, it will be preferable to illustrate this point also
                        in the same way. The principle of running he canals at high and low levels
                        alternativly at all seasons is carried out in Egypt by the application of
                        the three section rotation programme in summer for sake of economical and
                        equal distribution, and in flood by the adoptiong of a two section
                        arrangement, according to which half of the canals run full supply and half
                        of them reduced supply for alternative weeks. In summer the total discharge
                        required is 30 cubic metres a day per acre of crop, the crop area being 40
                        per cent. of the area commanded, or gross area. In flood the total discharge
                        required is 25 cubic metres a day per acre of crop, the area being 100 per
                        cent. of the area commanded. The calculation that follows is theoretical,
                        and the figures arre not exactly those which a recent official note on the
                        design of canal sections gives; but actual practice roughly agrees with the
                        methos of reconciliation between summer and flood conditions, as will now be
                        shown to be possible. Supposing a system to consist of six canals commanding
                        equal areas, the summer programme would group these into three sections of
                        two canals each, and the flood programme into two sections of three canals
                        each. During summer rotation, the discharge is concentrated in two canals,
                        and in flood in three. The summer discharge of 30 cubic metres a day per
                        acre of 40 per cent of the area is equivilent to an allowance of 12 over the
                        whole area commanded. When this is concentrated into a third of the canals
                        the discharge is trebled and becomes 36. Similarly, in the case of the flood
                        season, if the discharge of 25 cubic metres a day per acre of area commanded
                        is conceentrated into half the canals, the discharge in them becomes 50. </p>

                    <head>To "Turn" Gibraltar</head>
                    <p>France has now in hand what, after Panama and Suez is undoubtedly the
                        greatest maritime canal project of modern times, and one that in its
                        political and strategical aspacts, probably ecclipses all others. It is
                        known to Frenchmen as the canal of the two seas, and its object, stated in a
                        sentence, is simply to "abolish" Gibraltar, or, in strict parlance, to
                        "cunr" that fortress by means of a ship canal, navigable by war ships of the
                        largest size, between Bordeaux and Toulon, thus letting the North Sea into
                        the Mediterranean. Twice a Parliamentary committee has studied the question
                        in all its aspects, has inspected British and German canals, and has had
                        plans and estimates prepared. Up to the present no decisive action has been
                        taken, but another great effort is going to be made to impel the Chambers to
                        a decision. </p>

                    <head>Cyprus</head>
                    <p>The completiong of harbour improvements at Famagusta, of which official
                        announcement is made, should impart a stimulus to industry and commerce
                        throughout Cyprus. With a port sufficiently capacious to admit large
                        steamers, and connected by railway with Nicosia, the capital, the only
                        excuse for British indifference to the island as a market disappears. It
                        remains to be seen, however, whether that indifference itself will equally
                        vanish. The official report mentions, it is true, that the improved harbour
                        is already being used by merchant steamers, but it omits to define their
                        nationalities, their number and their individual tonnage. From the date of
                        outtaking over the beautiful island, Famagusta has been intermittently
                        patronised by comparatively small craft belonging to Mediterranean nations,
                        especially Italian and French. But the British shipowner has not played the
                        leading part in this commercial competition which he might have done, the
                        assigned reason for his aloofness being the deficiency of harbour and
                        wharfage accommodation for ocean going steamers. It may be hoped, therefore,
                        that hiis energies and enterprise will now be roused. When Lord Beaconfield
                        leased the island from the Porte his shrewd mind attachedd value to it, we
                        may make sure, as market for British goods, as well as a place of arms
                        commanding the Levantine and Egyptian littorals. </p>
