                    <head>The Case for Greece</head>
                    <p>In view of the excitement in Athens over the suggested reforms in Crete, the
                        critical situation in Macedonia, and the German official protest against any
                        aeparate settlement of the Cretan question likely to disturb the status
                        (/uo, the case fur the Greeks deserves tu be understood, fur of late the
                        Græco- Bulgarian eonflict in Macedunia his produced net a few critics who
                        seem te consider that the Greek nation is in this case the provoker. We will
                        take the Cretan question fir$t, as that has reached a délicate position and
                        is more closely associated with Hellenic ainis. The four protecting Powers,
                        Great Britain, Russia, France, and Italy, a few weeks ago, under pressure of
                        the constant and unaninious Cretan demand for annexation to Greece, and
                        under the threat of Prince George of Greece, the High Commissioner, to
                        resign, formulated a reform scheme professedly put forward to satisfy, as
                        far as possible, the aspi-rations of the Cretan peuple. This project of
                        reform, as a whole, lias created immense disappointinent, or even
                        indignation, throughout Greece and Crete, and the Powers hâve now intimatxl
                        te the Greek Government that they are considering a modification of the
                        scheme. Briefiy, the reforrns provide for :</p>
                    <p>(1) the creation of a Militia, the withdrawal of the Italian officers from
                        the Gendarmerie, and the appointment of Greek Army officers to conimand the
                        whole, provided these officers aie struck oft the active list of the Greek
                        Army} (2) a qualified promise of the évacuation of the island by the foreign
                        troops at a time not specified ; (3) the extension of the financial Control
                        Commission at Athens to einbraco Cretan finance ; and (4) the right of the
                        Consuls of the protecting Powers to supervise the acts of the High
                        Commissioner's Ministirs or Councillors. And ail this in the interests of
                        order in Crete and of the protection of the Moslem minority. There are other
                        minor points. </p>
                    <p>The Greek objections te these reforms may be stated thus : In the first place
                        the world aeknowledges Greece's pre-eminent ethno- graphieal, geographical,
                        and historical daims in Crete. The appointment of a Greek Prince as High
                        Commissioner after the Græco- Turkish War proves that. Again, the entire
                        Cretan population is Hellenic. Out of 301,000 some 33,000 are Mohamedans,
                        but even these are Greok and speak only Greek. Then, again, Crete has proved
                        that there is no Christian versus Moslem question under fr(>. j
                        institutions—in fact sinee the appointment of Prince George absolute
                        tranquillity would bave resulted had it not been for the intrigues of
                        certain interested Power». And the Cretam bave been quiet, and Greece has
                        loyally urgod peaceful acquiescence in the régime of the last eight years,
                        firrnly believing that union with Greece would be the reward of such an
                        attit ude. There is no more Moslem trouble in Crete than there is in
                        Thessaly. Prince George would not countenance it. King Georgo again, is one
                        of the most enlightened of Eur./ pean rulers, and most liberal and kindly
                        ininded, and ail his efforts hâve been and will lie towards complété harmony
                        in thô island. Take Thessaly. So amicably do the Greeks live with Mohamedans
                        there that Thessaly actually serïds deputies of the Moslem faith to
                        theAthenian Chamber. It is in this spirit that Moslems bave been appointed
                        to various offices in Crète by the présent High Commis sioner. Thus if there
                        is every évidence (,f assured tranquillity and harmony, provided that
                        foreign intriguera cease to hâve the présent reason for meddling in Cretan
                        aftairs, why do the Powers delay to grant union with the raotherland f Why
                        do they présent reforrns which are calculated to wound both Greek and Cretan
                        amour propre, and te defer annexation indefinitely, and which will if put
                        into force fling the whole Cretan question back into the misérable posi-.
                        tion from which it has emerged I The fact is the British Government would
                        grant annexation, but cannot accord it alone. Italy is not too friendly te
                        Greece, having aspirations in Epirus, Albania, etc. France is compelled te
                        please Russia now as much as ever. Russia will always oppose Greek airas.
                        And now Germany, who withdrew from the Cretan complication years ago,
                        official ly pronounces against the proposed reforrns, not from a Greek point
                        of view, but because she déclarés them calculated to hasten annexation
                        wishes the statua guo to be maintained.</p>
                    <p>Of course neither Greece nor Crete can oppose the will of the Powers. If the
                        Powers cannot grant annexation now they at least hâve no reasons for
                        rendering it more difficult in the near future. Greek sentiment would be
                        satisfied if the Greek officers be not compelled to quit the Greek Army,
                        that being considérai an unjust demand, debarring them from their legitimate
                        military ambitions in the Mother Country; it would be satisfied if Crotan
                        finance be left to Cretans—the International control of the Greek finances
                        is humiliating to a proud people ; it would be satisfied if the foreign
                        Consuls, as in any other country, be confined to making any représentations
                        their Govern- ments may consider necessary to the High Commissioner—whereas
                        the new proposai cannot but undermine his authority. In a word, union is the
                        only fair thing for both parties. If union be deferred indefinitely, or if
                        the suggested reforrns be carried through, the Cretan trouble will
                        recommence. But let us say it has no possible connection with the the
                        Macedonian question, as the German Press now prétends.</p>
                    <p>As regards Macedonia the facts are as follow: There was no Macedonian trouble
                        until four years ago. Macedonia is largely Hellenised, but it has for some
                        décades been subject te a Bulgarian propaganda, the Bulgarians being
                        determined to oust the Greek element in readi- ness for possible
                        eventualities. Four years ago the Bulgarian propaganda assumed the fonn of
                        force—until then it had been social, educa- tional, political, or religious,
                        as you like. Armed bands were formed under the eyes of the Bulgarian
                        Go.vernment in Sofia and in other Bulgarian towns,and despatched to
                        Macedonia to persécute the Greeks and Bulgarise unprotectod villages. Within
                        a year or two over one thousand Greeks, men, women, and chil- dren, were
                        brutallÿ doue to death by these Komitadjis. The Greek Govérnment protestod
                        time after time to Turkey and to the Greek Powers. Nothing, or next to
                        nothing, has been done to stay the Bulgarian atrocities. British Blue-books
                        give a long list of the massacres, village by village. Hitherto the Greek
                        Government endeavoured to assist the Powers, policed the Græco-Turkish
                        frontier, and ordered the Greek Consuls to prevent the local formation of
                        Greek armed bands. But short of a Chinese wall or the total prohibition of
                        ail peaceful transit between Greece and Macédonian Army that even gréater
                        military Powers tlian Greece could provide could wholly prevent the passage
                        of adventurous patriots resol ved to avenge their kith and kin.</p>
                    <p>The Greeks Smart under the loss of cKlldren, brothers, womenkind, schools,
                        and churches. It.is only recently that they hâve commeuced to retaliate. And
                        now, when the Bulgarian» hâve begun to disCover that Macedonia is not
                        Bulgarian, they hâve commenced to murder Greeks in Bulgaria itself. Last
                        year it was Rumania, now it is Bulgaria. Everything points to coneerted
                        action between the two States. Ail these recent barbarous act», notably in
                        Philipj>opolis, Tatar-Bazardjik, Peristera, Stenimaka, Burgas, and Anchia-
                        los, show the race hatred for Greece owing to her prépondérance in
                        Macedonia. This is the Hellenic view held in Athens to-day. It is not a
                        religious question, although the Greek Patriarch regards the Bulgarian
                        Orthodox as schismatics It is a race question, Slavs versu» llellenes. Who
                        is responsible The Great "owers undoubtedly. And how will it end i
                        Unfortunately armed intervention would ap- pjar to be the only ptoper
                        remedy.</p>

                        OPERATIONS.</head>
                    <p>The ordinary general meeting of the Egyptian Delta Land and Investment
                        Company, Ltd., was held last Thursday at Winchester House, Old Broad-street,
                        E.C.,Sir Auckland Colvin,K.C.S.I., K.C.M.G., C.I.E. (the Chairman of the
                        company), presiding.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary (Mr. F.J. Horne) having read the notice convening the meeting
                        and the auditor's report,</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said: The report and acoonnts before ns, which 1 presume yon
                        will take as read, are for half a year only, for which I prepared yon at our
                        general meeting in December last, and though I shall be happy to explain
                        them so far as I am able, I wish to pass from them to a more general
                        description of our position, in which I must review the whole period
                        oMbejompany's existenoe. I shall not detain you by again going over the
                        ground covered by our recent extraordinary meeting, when you sanctioned the
                        re3plntions, which will be pat to yon for confirmation immediately after the
                        close of this mee'ing.bnt I have still to ask yon to realise that the whole
                        status of our company has been materially changed from that on which it was
                        started in 1904, with a comparatively small oapital of £ICO,OOO under the
                        auspices of the Egyptian Delta Light Railways. Under our original oonditions
                        we effected some very good purchases,and were enoonraged to increase our
                        oapital, but I pointed out to yon at our last general meeting th-vt the
                        prices of land in our particular sphere of operations had risen so rapidly
                        that we hesitated to boy further. We have since that time been ab'e to
                        acquire other properties, notably the valuable properties of Les Moulins
                        Francis d'Egypte, but in some oases we have had to depart from the letter of
                        oar original intentions, so far as our memorandum and artioles of
                        association permitted, and yon can readily understand the serious
                        disadvantage under which we laboured in having to face keen competition in
                        our own limited sphere of operations,without being able to enter into
                        basiness outside of it. I am pleased to be able to state that although we
                        thus suffered in what I will deseribe as a restricted quantity of basiness,
                        we made up for it in quality, and I take this opportunity of mentioning that
                        great credit is due to Captain A. Adams, R.E , for the selections of land
                        purchased by him in his daal oapaoity of agent and general manager of the
                        railways, and of manager of thii oompany in Egypt. We can hardly hope to
                        repeat such bargains, and though time is neoessarily taken up in developing
                        or disposing of these properties, so as to bring profits to aooount, we oan
                        claim that such profits have been found to have continuously grown in amount
                        Satisfactory Land SaJes.</p>
                    <p>Following the preparations which I told y. u we were mak'ng, we have held a
                        sale of plots of land for building purposes on an estate of about 1,809,000
                        square metres, ray 430 feddans or acres, which we own in the proximity of
                        Cairo, and thoagh the results do not appear in the accounts before yon, the
                        sales having been held at and after the olose of the period, they proved
                        highly satisfactory and continuously improving. Other profitable sales have
                        also been effected, but do not for tho same reason appear in these acoonnts.
                        I rhall have to refer to them later, but mention them here in Bnpport of
                        what I have said. The time has now arrived when it is very necessary for ns
                        to extend our sphere of operations in order to avail ourselves more
                        generally of the opportunities which offer in Egypt and the Sudan. The
                        arrangement of this involved the severance of our connection with the Delta
                        Light Railway Company—te the regret of bolh companies I may say—whose
                        memorandum of association did not permit of their reserve funds even being
                        invested in a land oompany whose business is thus unrestrioted. Subj°ot to
                        the consent of the Court, we became an independent Land and Investment
                        Company by yonr to-day confirming the resolutions to this end. We shall
                        oontinue to extend to the railway company its right to purchase lands from
                        us to meet its own requirements on speoial terms, and mast give dae
                        consideration to any representation they may make to ns in consequence of
                        the severanoe of the connection between the two companies. In the early part
                        of this year we availed ourselves of the presence in Egypt of one of our
                        London direotors to carefolly consider our fntnre methods of business.
                        Valuable properties were then purchased. Oar Board in Egypt was strengthened
                        by the nomination of Mr. J. W. Williamson, of Cairo, thereto, and we shall
                        proceed to appoint one or two direotors, as soon as we deoide upon the most
                        suitable gentlemen, as further additions to that section of the Board. Iu
                        some matters we are necessarily and greatly dependent upon the
                        recommendations of the Board in Egypt, and we wish to feel that such are
                        based upon wide consideration.</p>
                    <p>The Question of the Staff,</p>
                    <p>The question of our staff was also gone into on the spot. I had prepared yon
                        for additional appointments being made thereto, but the more expended
                        consideration of this matter was forced upon ns by the threatened reoall of
                        Captain Adams to India, and now by our separation from the railway oompany.
                        Captain Adams's services were fioally aud wholly transferred to the Egyptian
                        Delta Light Railway*, Ltd., in the winter of 1905-6, and we had to consider
                        the question of his successor. It had . been evident to ns that we were at a
                        disad-vantage, as oompared to other land companies, in only having suoh time
                        and attention as oould be devoted to our affairs by a staff who, however
                        able and energetic, were busy railway officials, and attention to our
                        inoreased basiness and the development and sales of our proporties reqaired
                        that we should have a staff of our own. With the consent of the Delta Rvil
                        ways, we appointed their ohief engineer as oor manager, and ha—Mr. J. W.
                        Peacock —accordingly resigued the former appointment, and took up his duties
                        as our manager in February last. Since that time the necessary staff of oar
                        own has been got together, favourable purchases and sales have been
                        effected, as I have already stated, and the active proseoation of oar
                        basiness undertaken. It was not to be expected that much result could come
                        into the period ended 31st March last, or,in other words, into the report
                        and acoounts before you. As a matter of fact, no sales are entered, as none
                        had been completed within the period. Per contra, our working expenses were
                        only increased by the inclusion of a staff of our own for quite a short
                        time, aud the small balance of profit may simply be regarded as the excess
                        of rents and interest received over oar oharges for working. As more
                        correotly indicating the benefits to ns of the ohangea made and the basiness
                        done, I will state that, subject to their due completion, the result of
                        sales effected between the 1st April And the 30th June is a profit to ns of
                        at least £50,000, and we have reason to hope that sach sales will now
                        proceed continuously. We regard it that oar position and prospeots woald be
                        sufficient to jastifyasin recommending the payment even now of an interim
                        dividend on aooount of the oarrent year, but purchases and sales of land in
                        Egypt are usaally made by a system of deferred payment, and there is an
                        objection to anticipating the realisation of these instalments. </p>
                    <p>I prefer to a?k yon to exercise a little patienoe and look forward to the
                        aooonnts of the oarrent year showing a substantial dividend,whioh they
                        should do if 111 goes well. With referenoe to the proposal to increase this
                        oompany's oapital which was intended to be pot to you,it has been
                        represented to us by oar legal advisers that as it was not our intention—as
                        publicly stated by me—to make an issue before calling a meeting to consider
                        the objects thereof, there is no advantage in taking powers to inorease our
                        oapital now instead of at a later date, so as the probability of our now
                        requiring more money is not clear this proposal will be farther postponed.
                        The Board's General Policy.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, I offer you a few remarks upon our general polioy. We are a
                        land and investment company, oar moneys raised consist of capital and of
                        premia on shares. We may well expeot sach premia to equal or evea exceed our
                        capita1. At present our moneys are nearly wholly invested in land purchases
                        ; but we propose to confine these—in oonrse of time —praotioally to capital
                        moneys, and from our premia to invest amounts at least equal to our oapital
                        in sound mortgages, in boildings and sach things as supplies of light and
                        water. On these latter we feel we oan get good returns for our money, and
                        thoagh not so profitable aa dealings in land have been in the past, it
                        safeguards ns against reaotion or cessation of profitable purchases. Before
                        moving the adoption of the directors' report and accounts I shall be pleased
                        to answer any questions which shareholders may wish to ask. (A pause). As no
                        questions are asked, I now have to move the following resolution :—"That the
                        report of ( the directors, dated 27th July, 1906, together with the audited
                        statement of accounts and balance sheet for the half-year ended 31st March,
                        1906, be and they are hereby received, approved and adopted." (Applause). </p>
                    <p>MsjorW. I. Le Breton seoonded the resolution, which was carried unanimously. </p>
                    <p>Major Le Breton next moved the re-election of Sir Auokland Colvin as a

                        entre toquais de la Douane étce'ii du Gabbari. Il est évident que le» deux

                    <p>M Dietrich Bey propose d'y porter remède en élargissant le pont tournant du

                    <p>BtaminortS maintenant la que»tion du pas- nage de» trains sur la ligne de
                        Gabbari et le pont projeté du chemin de fer sur le canal maritime au sud dn
                        jardin Nouzha. Ici nous avons une moyenne de 24 train» par jour avec «le»
                        perspectives d'augmentation progressive. Avec un tel enoombrement, il semble
                        dilli ile à notre ingéoienr municipal que dans l'intervalle d'un train à un
                        autre on troave le temps de faire passer le» barque» à travers .lo pontet
                        le» éolanes projetée», »an» causer de» retard» préjudiciable» à
                        l'administration de» chemin» de fer. Il propose dono de rechercher une
                        meilleure solation dans leoa» où l'on insisterait sur la oréation d'un canal
                        maritime, Holution qui allégerait considérablement le trafic si intense de
                        Minit el Ba»»al, et dirigerait sur ne autre voie que le Mahmoudieh le)
                        transports de bois ou de charbon destiné» à l'inté- tient 'du pays.</p>
                    <p>Voici cette solution, toujours d'après M. Dietrich :</p>
                    <p>Bile consiste tout simplement à créer à travers le lac Maréotfs entre les
                        jardin» du Uxbbari et le Mariout an large chenal relié à la mer do chaque
                        côté par do» pilotis servant à indiquer la direction de» bateaux. Aux deux
                        extrémité» de oe ohenal, dragué à 3 mètre» sous l'eau, deux éclase» seront
                        construites, l'une au nord poar communiquer avec le canal maritime et le
                        port et l'autre au sud poar rejoiadfe le otfaâl Nubarieh qui devra être
                        élargi et prolongé jusqu'au lac. Le» barques poarront ainsi veuir par le
                        cuiul Klntatba au canal Nubarieh et se rendra an canal maritime par le
                        Mariout. Le retour dan» l'intérieur s'effectuera par la môme voie. Pour le
                        Bébéra le trafic jura lieu par les écluse» de Minet el fiassal et le oanal
                        Mahmoudieh.</p>
                    <p>Grâoe à ce moyen, l'on évitera ot la cou» traction da pont sous le chetaia de
                        fer du Gabbari, et la surélévation du remblai du chemin da fer estimé à 4
                        mètres de hauteur, travail compliqué et fort coû'eux.</p>
                    <p>Mais, objectera t on, oe chenal portera en trave aux travaux d'épuisement dn
                        lao. Pa» le moiusdu monde, car oe chenal n'aura pa» de digne» de retenue ot
                        laissera le» eaux s'écouler librement vers les pdrnpés du Mex.</p>
                    <p>Blargi et prolongé, le Nubarieh »ora navi gable et l'écluHeque l'on
                        installera à son entrée dans le lac servira à retenir 1rs eaux dont le
                        sarplus sera envoyé sur le) terrains incultes du Mariout, dont une vaste
                        étendue sera de la Sorte transformée en plaiuo» fertiles.</p>
                    <p>De plus l'utilisation du Nubarieh aura l'avantage pendant l'étiage du Nil de
                        ruviour oir le trajet autre Gbalanga et Aloxaudrie de plus de 6 kilomètre) ;
                        pendant le» hante» eani du Nil, période où lès barques prennent le fleuve
                        pour se rendre au Mahmoudié, eetîe différence en m lins sera d'environ 70
                        kilomè tre» an profit du Nubarieh.</p>
                    <p>Comme conclusion, M. D otrioh Bry affirme que l'élargissement do Canal
                        Mahmoudieh f. Kafr ul Aohri, l'amélioration dé» quai» actuel» et leur
                        prolongement jusqu'à la rue Ragheb Pacha » i diront I mgtemps encore au
                        trafic de» marchandises à Nîinst el B tssal, et cola d'au tant plu» q ie le»
                        entrepôt» de bois soron» prochainement transporté) au Gibbari. Dan» le cas
                        où uo trati i prendrait toutà c )up de» proportion» inattendue», on pourrait
                        touj uir» araser le quartiei de K»tr el Achri et oréei à cot endroit un port

                    <p>Ces améliorations olïictuée», le) quai» do Minet ôl Bissai auront un

                    <head>ENGLISH PRESS OPINION-</head>
                    <p>The article in the "Deutsche Revue," o which a summary appeared in our issue
                        o Tuesday last, induce* the "Times" to make the following reflections :—</p>
                    <p>The attempt to construe political claims o any kind in Egypt upon the
                        strength o commerrid and economic interests is ever morequestionab'e than in
                        the case of Morocco Germany's share represents only a small frao tiou of the
                        to'al trade of E/ypt and merely at infinitesimal fraction of the valne of
                        her owe total exports and imports. The number o German tubjeots in Egypt
                        amounts to juste little over 1 per cent, of the whole foreige population.
                        Moreover, the value both of Ger man exports and imports t» and from Egypt
                        considerably declined during 1905, asoompared with the year before. To nrge
                        the extent of German interests in the Suez Canal in oon nexion with Egypt is
                        not to the point, while to oarry out the threat which has ignorantly been
                        made in one quarter and to revoke the German assent to the decree of 1901
                        with regard to the Publio Debt, would place Germany in a false position.</p>
                    <p>The motives from which th's agitation has sprung are perhaps worth
                        examination. The results of the Morocco campaign were hardly as satisfactory
                        as Germany from her point of view could have desired. The further evidence
                        ol harmony between the Mediterranean Powers which was exhibited by the
                        Abyssinian Railway agreement has produced anything but a sooth ing effect in
                        the ooui try. If English, French, and Italian should come to be established
                        as the r ffirial languages in Egypt this arrangement wouli merely bn
                        symbolical of a position in the Mediterranean to which G rmany can offer no
                        parallel and lay no claim. The obief consideration, however, which appears
                        to have weighed with the authors of the present agitation is the future of
                        the Baghdad Railway. German writers are fond of protesting that the whole of
                        the necessary capital has been found and that Germany is perfectly
                        independent of foreign co-operation or foreign opposition. As Sir Edward
                        Grey recently pointed out, that is a German sfftir. If Germany desiros
                        assistance from outside the question of participation will no doubt be
                        considered. Bat in spite of this vaunted self stfficienoy, it is evident
                        that the d fficulties which have been encountered in connexion with the
                        proposed increase in the Turkish Customs and the incontestable position of
                        Great Britain in the Persian Gulf have aroused anxiety for the prospects of
                        the railway. The manner in which the attitude of the British Ambassador at
                        Constantinople with regard to the Cosh his questions has been criticized in
                        the Press within a few hours of a co? fnenoe of the diplomat pj
                        representativeaof the Kwjrabas a savour and moaning of its ojyu. The various
                        difficulties, therefore, which surround the completion of the Baghdad
                        Railway seem to have inspired the idea of imputing to Great Britain a deal
                        re-to annex Egypt, simply for the purpose of propounding a one sided
                        bargain. In order to compel acquiescence the threat of international
                        investigation into Egyptian affairs is held out, with the further menace of
                        growing dissatisfaction on the part of Franoe. The whole agitation seems to
                        have lean designed as a trap, yet after Sir Edward Grey's plain statement
                        with regard bot h to Egypt and t bi Baghdad Railway, the hope that the
                        British Government might be iuduoed to walk into it must surely be
                        abandoned.</p>

                    <p>Notwithstanding a downward tendenoy in foreign exchange the money market

                        rise in money is likely. The Bank position is excellent. Coin is already
                        returning from the country, and with this and about half a million from
                        abroad and a contraction of the note oiroulation of £426,COO, there is an
                        addition to reserve of £1,147,000. This makes the proportion of oash to
                        liabilities 50 per cent. The total reeerve is in fact the highest for ten
                        years at this period of the year.</p>

                    <p>The market for silver seems likely to rise. The United States have purchased
                        100,000 ' oz«., and India, contrary to expectation, is 1 coming in for
                        considerable supplies. Egypt has j purchased a considerable amount recently.
                        It is probable that with the present short supply in London and the prospect
                        of a steady demand i of about 500,000 ozi.for America yearly which has now

                    <p>I The nineteen day account just ended has failed to justify the evil

                        at its height business has improved, and an inoreaee in values has been
                        noted all round. Contrary to expectation the dissolution of the Duma by the
                        Tsar has been taken lying down, and the feared general uprising has not come
                        about, the result being an inclination to buy Russian securities. Gilt-edged
                        Beourities have continued in favour during the past week and Consols have
                        touohed 88$, but have now dropped back a little to f-8. Colonial loans are
                        coming into favour and substantial advances have been noted. Johannesburg
                        Fours have advauoed 3 points and Spanish and Turks have gained 1 to 2
                        points. Australian issues are in demand, con6is'ent with the evidetce of the

                    <p>One of the greatest surprises of the account has been the interest displayed
                        in Kaffirs. At this season of the year dealers are more inolined to take
                        holidays than to think of opening fresh business. Paris has been a buyer and
                        professional bidding has helped to maintain 'prices, and it is hoped that if
                        sufficient interest oan be taken in this market until after the holidays the
                        publio may be induced to oome in, and the oondition of things restored to
                        their former level. The leading Kaffirs show gains, and any shares on offer
                        are generally snapped up. Kand Mines have improved to 6 17/32, and after
                        easing off a little have farther strengthened to 6 19/32. East Rands have
                        hardened to 4 j, and Gold Fields have been in good demand at 4 13/32. </p>
                    <p>Egyptian mining shares have benefi'ed by the improved tone of other markets
                        and a rise has been noted in some of the principal issues. United Africans

                        the atook markets. Vickers have oontinned in strong demand and a farther
                        rise to 51/9 has been the result. The Steel Company of Scotland have

                        le dégoût ni la fatigue, parce que, à l'opposé des autres purgatifs,
                        celui-ci n'opère bien que lorsqu'il est pris avec de bons aliments et des
                        boissons fortifiantes, telles que vin, café, thé. Chacun choisit, pour se
                        purger, l'heure et le repas qui lui conviennent le mieux, selon ses
                        occupations. La fatigue de la purgation étant annulée par l'effet de la
                        bonne alimentation, on se décide aisément à recommencer autant de fois que
                        cela est nécessaire.</p>
