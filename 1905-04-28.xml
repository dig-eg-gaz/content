                    <head>FRIDAY, APRIL 28. 1905. ANOTHER RUSSIAN LOAN.</head>
                    <p>The most interesting news today is the announcement that the Russian
                        Government has decided to raise another loan of 200 million marks owing to
                        the poor success of the recent internal loan. There is no appeal to France
                        this time, and the preliminaires have been arranged in Berlin. It has become
                        perfectly plain that the French financiers, who were strongly opposed to the
                        war from the very outset, are still more opposed to its continuance under
                        the hopeless conditions to which Russia has been reduced. France has been
                        unprecedentedly generous and confiding during the last ten years, though it
                        must not be forgotten that the Russian Alliance gave her a feeling of
                        security in Europe to which she had long been stranger, and for which she
                        was willing to make the most handsome acknowledgments in her power. Her
                        thrifty and frugal people hold Russian securities to the extent of four
                        hundred milliona sterling —a stupendous sum in itself, and still more
                        stupendous when one thinks of Russia’s financial status in the scale of the
                        nations. During the lest twelve months France has found Russia fully thirty
                        millions more. The Russians, therefore, cannot possibly complain that their
                        ally has not trusted them. On the contrary, she has trusted them; if
                        anything, too implicitly, and allowed her political gratitude to interfere
                        considerably with strict business prudence.</p>
                    <p>Russia’s one financial hope now is Berlin, for the English market is closed
                        to her, and the American regards Ruasian securities with equal disfavour.
                        But Berlin finance plumes itself on its purely business principles strained
                        dear of every extraneous sediment, and this morning’s telegram states that
                        the terms of the new loans are to be inoreased in severity. But it is not
                        probable that Germany will finance the war for Russia indefinitely, and if
                        her reverses continue, it is unlikely many more loans will be raised. At the
                        same time it is advisable to discount all the ill-considered talk and
                        writing about the strain of the war upon the financial resources of the two
                        belligerants. No well-informed person, of course, will dispute that war is
                        very costly. It wastes both wealth and life ; it lessens production because
                        it diverts both labour and capital from productive to unproductive
                        employment ; it lessens confidence by causing apprehensions, and even scares
                        ; and it adds to taxation. But the merely financial effects of war very soon
                        pass away. In the present instance, and especially in the case of Russia,
                        the real danger is to be found not in the financial, but in the sentimental
                        influence which the struggle may have. She has a vast amount of gold at
                        home, and she has the power to issue inconvertible paper to any extent she
                        pleases. It is quite true, of course, that all this will tell upon the
                        materiel condition of the people, and will be felt as a sore burden for a
                        time. But it will be so chiefly, not because of the mere cost of the war
                        itself, but because of the unfavourable economic condition of Russia when
                        hostilities broke out. Owing partly to misgovernment, partly to the
                        ignorance of the people themselves, partly to rash speculation, and partly
                        to unfavourable seasons, Russia was in the throes of a long drawn-out crisis
                        when the struggle began. The crisis was due immediately to bad seasons
                        causing failure of the crops over a large part of the Empire, and it was
                        intensified by rash industrial enterprise, injudicious loans by the bank,
                        and of course, by the heavy taxation of the Government. The people
                        consequently, are not in a state to bear any material addition to their
                        burdens, and the war, therefore, will tell upon them, more than it otherwise
                        would have done.</p>

                    <p>But even so, it is not the mere financial results so much as the possible
                        sentimental effects that are to be dreaded. The whole population, as we have
                        just been saying, is in deep distress, which is aggravated by the shock to
                        credit and the disturbance given to all kinds of business by the war. In
                        addition to that, misgovernment had driven a very considerable section, even
                        of the Russians themselves, into a suppressed revolt, which every now and
                        then demonstrates itself by the assassination of Ministers and other great
                        officials. Outside of Russia proper, the Poles, the Finns, and the Armenians
                        have been driven almost to madness by oppression ; and it is hardly
                        necessary to add that the Jews are equally disaffected. As long as the army
                        obeys orders the Government can maintain order, in spite of the almost
                        universal disaffection. But if Russian reverses continue there is a
                        possibility, though we doubt if it amounts to a probability, that a
                        considerable part of the army may become disaffected. And in that case
                        nobody can foresee what may happen. On the other hand, there is an equal
                        possibility, and we think a greater probability, that the Government may be
                        alarmed respecting the consequences if reverses continue in Manchuria, or if
                        the armada of Rodjestvensky and Nebgotoff is destroyed, and that it may,
                        therefore, enter upon a great policy of reform as the grandfather of the
                        present Tsar did after the Crimean war. If this should happen, the war will
                        prove to be a blessing in disguise, and its unfavorable , financial effects
                        will soon pass away.</p>

                        arrived here. There has been a general exodus of the aristocratic and middle
                        classes over the holidays. Reports from the provinces indicate similar fears
                        there, and especially in connection with the lst May, which is the Russian
                        Easter Monday. General Trepoff in a proclamation assures the population that
                        order will be presarved with the armed force if necessary.</p>

                    <p>The Cairo correspondent of “ Al Bassir" writes: — Many liquor merchants in
                        Cairo and the provinces complain of the way in which their licenses are
                        being taken from them by the authorities on the ground that it is in
                        accordance with the circular issued by the Ministry of the Interior. If this
                        is so it is very strange, for a license once granted and delivered should
                        not be withdrawn without good reason, but if the Government should think
                        proper to do so at least it should refund the amount paid for the license. I
                        am told that a cafe keeper sold his cafe to another man; the buyer applied
                        for a liscnese, but the Government refused to grant one; the applicant
                        protested, but the Government persisted, and at last he was told that if be
                        wished to go on with the cafe he should allow it to remain in the name of
                        the former proprietor, and induce him to stay with him there. If a license
                        was given to the former owner why should it not be given to the new comer as
                        well? Both offer similar guarantees and are of the same profession.</p>
                    <p>If it is the intention of our Government to suppress the safe of alcoholic
                        drinks by this treatment we must thank them and wish them all success in
                        their efforts; but this is not the wav bring about the end desired. A heavy
                        tax should be imposed on alcoholic liquors; if the tax he not paid in time
                        then the place should be closed, as is the case in the Sudan and in America,
                        where the Government also makes it a condition that liquors of bad quality
                        are liable to be confiscated and spoiled, and the place closed. Under these
                        conditions the sale of intoxicants would be greatly diminished, and the
                        quality of liquors be kept at a high grade.</p>
                    <p>The plan followed by our Government of withdrawing a license or delaying to
                        grant one, has no effect whatever, especially when the applicant depends
                        upon a foreign authority; and acts in accordance with orders received from
                        his own consul exclusively. What could the Government do with such a person
                        if he persisted in opening his shop, whether he had previously obtained a
                        license or whether a license bad been refused.</p>

                        of hashish has been eliminated from the market. On the contrary it is well

                        money, but it is sold afterwards, it is believed, by the ill-paid Coastguard
                        "Tommy," who only gets a pittance of four dollars a month. Unless a heavy
                        penalty is placed on hashish it will continue to be a moveable commodity,
                        shifting backward and forward between those who seize it as contraband and
                        those who sell it to the small captains of the wooden crafts in port who
                        manage to convey it into town for sale. It most be hoped that the "white
                        slaves" will not pass from hand to hand in a similar manner. They will
                        certainly be harder to keep dark than the noxious herb.</p>

                        <head> A Slump.</head>
                        <p>— In financial circles yesterday; evening rumours were in circulation,
                            that compliostions had occurred in regard to Morocco. Private telegrams,
                            which were received on the subject, showed that the London and Paris
                            Exchanges had been adversely affected, something of a slump having taken
                            place. The absence of any confirmation of the rumours in either Reuter
                            or Havas's wires this morning, however, and the firmer tone in Europe,
                            tends to show that the slump was purely a Stock Exchange maneovure. It
                            is lucky that the local Bourse was closed to day, as some excitable
                            spirits might have been led away by these rumours. The chance of a great
                            European war at the present moment is very remote, and there is
                            extremely little likelihood that the Morooco question should enter on an
                            acute phase at the very moment of the King's vitit to Paris.</p>

                    <head>THE TRADE OF EGYPT. MARCH RETURNS.</head>
                    <p>The value of the imports into Egypt during last month is given in the Customs
                        returns as LE. 1,674,052. This figure exceeds the total for the
                        corresponding month last year by LE. 57,985. This is very significant, for
                        March, 1904, was an exceptionally prosperous mouth as regards the import
                        returns, they having exceeded the total returns for the previous March by
                        LE. 354,574, or 28 percent. If last month Egypt succeeded in increasing this
                        by nearly LE. 60,000, it shows the extraordinary prosperity of the country.
                        We have drawn special attention to the comparison, because March, 1904, was
                        exceptional, the great increase in imports being the inevitable consequence
                        and indication of the profits made by the country on the cotton crop, which
                        realised the highest prices of recent years. The high price last year formed
                        a purely adventitious factor in this prosperity, and it would therefore have
                        been no matter for surprise if we had to register a decline during last
                        month from the maximum figures of foreign trade, which would only have been
                        a legitimate reaction. But instead of such a reaction we find that last
                        month, with cotton far below last year’s prices, Egypt increased her total
                        imports by nearly LE. 60,000 over March, 1904. The permanent expansion of
                        trade is surely the safest criterion of the country's progress.</p>
                    <p>For the first quarter of the year the exccess over 1904 is LE. 552,985. The
                        excess of that quarter over the corresponding period in 1903 was LE.
                        431,460.</p>
                    <p>The exports amounted to LE. 1,924,770, a decrease of LE. 366,133 on March
                        last year. The cotton exports totalled LE. 1,445,331, a decrease of LE.
                        432,148 on the figures for March in the corresponding year. The total value
                        of the cotton exported during the first quarter was LE. 193,225, a decrease
                        of LE. 1,963,361 on the same period last year.</p>

                    <p>There was considerable stir upon the Liverpool cotton flags when it became
                        known that board of directors of the Cotton Association had, after prolonged

                        the association, who have been buying broker. The said brokers have, it is
                        said, seriously broken the rules and regulations of the association as to
                        comission charges for buying cotton futures. Four spinners who are associate
                        members of the association are implicated, and havo been fined £250 each. It
                        seems the two brokers have not been charging the usual fees for purchasing
                        futures, in the hope of securing the spot buisness of the four spinning

                        fully considered. The question of railway communication, which is equally
                        important to that of water-supply, will have received a partial solution
                        when the Nile Red Sea Railway is completed.</p>

                    <p>A deposit of lignite has been found in the province of Dongola, and the
                        question of whether it is of sufficient extent to be of any general use is
                        now being investigated. The report on samples sent to London by the Nubia
                        Sudan Development Company has proved so satisfactory that the directors have
                        decided to start operations on the east bank of the Nile, opposite the town
                        of Dongola, and a diamond-drill has been brought up for this purpose.</p>

                    <p>One after another the theatres of Alexandria are going, and now it is the
                        turn of the cafes to disappear. The Zizinia Theatre has been disposed of and
                        will, it is said, have to make room for the palatial additions which the
                        Splendid Hotels Company intend to graft on the New Khedivial Hotel. The site
                        of the Alhambra Theatre is only awaiting a purchaser to be turned into flats
                        or offices. The Abbas Helmy Theatre has been burnt down, and it has not been
                        decided to erect another theatre on the site. New Zarani’s Cafe which is
                        undoubtedly the finest cafe in Egypt, is to disappear. The Alexandria
                        Exchange Company have leased the place and its appurtenances to Messrs.
                        Thos. Cook and Son (Egypt) Limited, for a number of years. Messrs. Cook
                        intend making it their offices at Alexandria for not only their tourist
                        buisness but also for their engineering department, their forwarding
                        business, etc. It is one of the most commanding sites in Alexandria and we
                        congratulate Messrs. Cook on their enterprise in having acquired this
                        excellent property for a term of years on what, we understand, are favorable

                    <p>This morning, at 6 o’clock, I proceeded on board this vessel and found that
                        already a very considerable portion 7 of the cargo of rice had beea
                        discharged during the night. It was all quite spoilt by fire, smoke, and
                        water. The seat of the conflagration was apparent in one corner of the
                        ’tween decks of No. 2 hold, where now nothing is to be seen but charred and
                        blackened bags of ruined rice.</p>
                    <p>Several hold beams, and frames are much damaged by heat, and excluding the
                        value of the cargo, which is practically speaking quite spoiled in that
                        hold, I should ray the damage to the ship is very considerable.</p>
                    <p>The vessel is fully insured, I understand, and the damaged cargo will, in so
                        far as the water-damage is concerned,come under the “General Average"
                        clause.</p>
                    <p>There is still a large quantity of water in the holds and the ship in
                        consequence has a heavy list, which, however, is not dangerous. The work of
                        discharging still goes on.</p>

                    <head>“THE HOLY CITY"</head>
                    <p>On Tuesday last, an eflective rendering of Gaul’s sacred cantata “The Holy
                        City"'was-given in St. Mark's Church by the choir, augmented, by members of
                        the choir of All Saints', Ramleh, under the steady and able conductorship of
                        Mr. William Smith. It is perhaps to be regretted that the openingvquartet
                        was not sung as such, as a somewhat overpowering result was produced, by
                        singing it in "full," which detracted from the general effect evidently
                        intended by this beautiful piece of harmony. It would obviously be invidious
                        to pick out any individual rendering from among the solo work, as it was
                        evident the soloists had taken great pains, and one and all gave great
                        pleasure in the numbers that bad been allotted them. Miss MunGavin was heard
                        with great effect in the solo, “He that overcometh.” and the trio, "At
                        Eventide it shall be light," sung by Mrs. Baylis, Miss Callender, and Mrs.
                        Roberts, was rendered with a great appreciation of the spint in which both
                        words and music are so happily combined. Tho quartet and chorus, "List! the
                        Cherubio Host," over which a bass solo was exocellently sung by Mr. Percy
                        Smith, gave great pleasure, and by no means the least effective feature was
                        the “Harp", accompaniment played on the piano by Mr. Crofton in a manner
                        which quite made up for the absence of the instrument originally intended.
                        Mention must also be made of the duet between Miss Calendar and Mrs.
                        Roberts, which in the, opinion of some, was the most thoroughly artistic
                        piece of singing of the evening. Mr. W.F. Sarjeant and Mr. J. Purvis were
                        admirable in what they had been given to do, and last in order, though
                        possibly first in importance, must we mention the steady playing of the
                        organist, Mr. Heaton, who contributed very largely to the success of what
                        was universally pronounced a most enjoyable and musically performance of
                        undoubetdly beautiful work. As regards the singing of the choruses, it is
                        not so easy to speak. The basses were a trifle weak and there was a certain
                        lack of "attack" noticeable, but the sopranos did very good work. There will
                        be another performance of this cantata in All Saints' Church, Ramleh, on
                        Tuesday, May 2, at 6.30 p.m.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. Editor, - I quite agree with "Harmony" that your scanty report
                        regarding Tuesday 'recital' at St. Marks showed a great want of taste and
                        courtesy towards those who gave up their time, talent, and gifts for weeks
                        towards making the show of the afternoon a success. The cursory reference by
                        the writer to the choir, and the prominence given to the tablet and persons
                        present at the unveiling cannot but give one the idea that he knows which
                        side his bread is buttered, but he may make a mistake.- Yours truly,</p>

                    <p>M. Bourgeois, directeur de la Cio du Gaz, a fait mercredi soir à l’Université
                        Populaire une conférence sur les maisons économiques. En parlant des
                        premiers efforts tentés ici pour trancher cette question épineuse, il
                        oonstate l’abord que les promotéars ont fait fausse route en s’adreesaat aux
                        autorités administratives. M. Bourgeois veut qu’on s’adresse à l’i-nitiative
                        privée, qn’on éveille dans le peuple les sentiments de solidarité et de
                        coopération, jt à l’appui de sa thèse il oite les résultats obtenus de oette
                        façon en Europe et surtout en Angleterre oh de grands philanthropes
                        s’occupent de faire œavra durable. Quant au meilleur système à adopter,
                        l’émi-aent conférencier se déclare à juste titre contre les fameux blocs
                        préconisés par M. Al-lereon et la commission des locataires et appe-és à
                        devenir des oentree de contagion et de naladies; il se prononoe au
                        (contraire en faveur le la maison aveo jardin proposée par M. Zouro et qoe
                        noua avons à diverses reprises recommandée dans notre journal. Les distances

                        malsain*. M. Bourgeois voudrai t dono qu’on «construisit su Mex et à Kom
                        el-Dik des cités jardins à l’instar de oelles qui ont déjà fait leurs
                        preuves en Angleterre pour leur supériorité hygiénique, économique,
                        récréative et morale. On élèverait des maisons à on seul étage, qni, le
                        jardin et 1a oour (compris, occuperaient une superficie totale de 444 mètres

                        feddau, l’emplaoement nécessaire ne coûterait brut que 80 LE. et 40 LE. tout
                        nivelé. La construction, qni se «composerait de 5 ch*mbres,reviendrait à LE.
                        180, soit en tout 220 LR qui, an taux de 5 %, représenteraient un loyer de
                        11 LB. per an, «oit I P.T. per jour. Bu payant un loyer de LE 21 1/2par an,
                        soit 7 P.T. par jour, le locataire deviendrait propriétaire an bout de 15
                        années. Non* n’avons pas l’espace voulu pour donner à cette intéressante
                        conférouoa tout le déve loppement qu’elle mérite, mais qn’il nous suffise
                        aujourd’hui de dire que voilà uo beau champ ouvert pour l’intiative privée
                        sane sacrifice d'argent de sa part, puisque la om-binaison ci-dessus

                        next in order to read Lord Cromer’s reply to the pharmacists in regard to
                        the new regulations, and to discuss matters of general interest appertaiuing
                        to thg profession, 'lhe following réoumiS of tho «ituation will be , of
                        iuterestiin view ot this meeting. Tho proteste of tho Pharmaoentioal
                        Socie-tie» of Cairo and Alexandrin againat certain causes of the new
                        Pharmacy Régulations, eui n'otably against Clause II., haviog failed t ■
                        aiove the autborittea, it wae reeolved, u a last resource, that the membera
                        shonld appeal to théir respective diplomatio agente, and a pétition was
                        drawn up, whioh atated in etfect that the new Pharmacy Law for Egypt,
                        publiahed in September last by the Sahitaiÿ Authonty, and approved by the
                        Jlixed Court of Appeal at Alexandria, had raised just proteatatiotis on the
                        part Of the qualified pbannaciate. lt waa admitted that the new law was a
                        real stop towarda progrès», but that Clause IL took away pharmacy irom the
                        real pharmaciste and deliver-ed it over to commerce and spéculation,
                        mmstuuch as it autboriaed auy person to ;urry on a pharmacy and to selland
                        prépare mcdicines »o long as a qualitiod cbemiat *\i in charge.-It waa
                        pointed ont that in ïuch a case, the qualitiod man mnst submit to every
                        caprioe of the capitalist and that .«iween the two tbere must exist a
                        certain ittagouism, which .would be to the pnblio ■runent. On the other
                        hand, qualified damnais without much capital would fiud iittle’ or no
                        opportnnity of astablishing thern-wlvw on thoir own acoount. No Européen
                        pbarmaceutioal législation, it was shuiiirn, makes mention of such an
                        inegu.anty/Even Turkey (under Capitulations hke Egy (it) takes o exception
                        tb the rnle that the qualified chemist has alone the right to open and to
                        canyon a pharmacy. The International Associations of Caire and Alexandria
                        there-foie drsired to protest againatr Article II., and rVqnested that the
                        necessary ateps be ta ken Mi seeure its abrogation and replacement bÿ\he
                        lollowing : ' Nu one s hall in Egypt exercise the pro-ioD of pharmacist,

                        pharmacy." The petitiorers asserted that they did not wish to modify the
                        status of exiating phar macies run by uuqualified proprietor*; so long as

                        the fntnn only qualified chemists «hall be able to bny 01 open a pharmacy.
                        They stated thoir oonvictior also that a pharmacist delegated by thon
                        associations shonld be présent at ail inspec lions of pharmacies. A pétition
                        to this effect " itjgned by the President of the Association anc by the
                        English chemists establiahed in Cairo was duly presented to Lord Grenier, wh
                        replied at leugth. Ho began by expreasing hii entiro agreeœent with the
                        principle advocatoc —tbat, on the whole, a System under whicl the ownetship
                        of pharmacies is restrioted U qualified pharmaciste offera greater guarantee
                        to the pnblio than one under which the owue —»y be unqualified. He believed

                        towards securing what th armacists desire. The practical question «ever, was
                        not what System would theoreti cally be most satistsetory, but wbat System
                        cai be most effectively onforoed in Egypt, ha vin, regard to the-

                        efficieutly and with least 1 friction. He depresatod the anticipation of the

                        fears were somewhat exag- 1 gorated. The view taken by such managers
                        themselves, as éxpreased in a pétition to the t Direotor-General of the
                        Sanitary Department, » was that the new law, by regulatiug a situa-f don
                        which already existed, had already im-* proved their position pecuniarily.
