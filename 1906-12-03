                    <head>Egyptian "Ingratitude."</head>
                    <bibl>
                        Tits Egyptian Moalem i« frequently critici*- i«l becauM of hi* “ingratitude" in peroiiting in maintaining an attitude of hostility to the Brituh Occupation. Hie journaliat at home wonder* how it i* that after all the benefit* tve conferred on thia country the native continue* to dUlike and criticiie our *y*tem of govorning Egypt, although heia well aware that he would be quite unable to do it bettor, if left to hi* own device*. Recently we noticed a comment in the "Spectator" on thin ingratitude, and that journal aeemwl to be amaxed at the attitude. It ia therefore instructive to note that in one of the articlee in the la teat itaue lo liand of our contemporary the very reverie of tbi* itandpoint i* maintained, namely, that the improvement and progmm made by a poop I* r an alien rule ia never recognised gratefully by the aubjecta, and that Englishmen ould bo the fint to maintain *uch an ••ungrateful" attitude. The paaaage in question run* as follow*. We have underlined the two interrogative question* dealing with the Englixh : — “Moreover, to *tate a truth which ia too often forgotten, the mass of the people, though it feel* terribly the imped of physical neceomtiea, and of that vague pessimism a* to the obtaining of food which haa inaD ages been the whip that made industry, however painful, ne- M-rtheleu continuous, is hardly to be bought. The Roman populace waa ; but that populace never once after the Empire waa founded elected tho Emperor. The man ia ruled in the laat resort by idea® rather than by the hopo of comfort, and there can l>e no security that dominant ideas and those of the Sovereign ill be the aame. For Koto much a week per houeehold tcould Englishmen tolerate with pleasure a foreign conqueror 1 Or Jar ’chat promises of gain would they endure' a ruler who had proclaimed himself a Uueeulman I In modorn. Europe one soldier of genius haa been permitted to be a tyrant; but it waa pith glory, rather than comfort, that he paid hi* aubjecta, and during hi* reign, though political freedom did nof exut, every career waa open to the humblest who had the strength to follow Ik This idea of establishing absolutism by securing- physical comfort to the moat numerous lection of the people would only be well founded if the ambition of the majority of mankind were always to grow fat. It i® Yiot true that the god of the proletariat in ' their belly any more tlian it is true that Zhe god of the poeta is applause.”eThe argument used by the "Spectator" • is absolutely valid an regards the Egyptian Moslem's attitude to tho British Occupation.' To wonder, therefore, at hia ingratitude and blame him for aucii a characteristic is quite unreasonable, however much w* may deplore it. If, say, under the present Government England went from bad to worse, and the whole system of Empire waa diaoTganued by crude Socialistic fad* arid nostrums, while all the wealth of the count! y was dissipated on foolish Utopian scheme#, imagine then the Kaiser stepping in and again in a few years' time under German Advisers we resumed our flourishing state. Would we be grateful 1 Not a bit of it. Un the contrary, we should always prefer the worst form of Radical ‘self-government to the best form of alien rule, even although such control was maintained by men of the same religem and the same Teutonic stock as ourselves. Yet we call the Egyptian's attitude "base ingratitude." Surely such a standpoint is unreasonable and implies a low view of human nature.

On the oontraiy, the Qivcrn- merit are in a posi'jnn to take a very much larger number of boys to All the minor appointments in the various departments than the enllsge can possib'y furnish, and a long time mo-t elsp-e kefoio 'he supply can in any degree meet tbe demand. It will be interesting to observe how the young sheikh*, who have just completed their five years' ooorse, and are about to take np work in the Mt-hamedan Law Courts and in tbe various sohool*. respond to the training and ednoation th*y have so qnired in the oollege. There is every reason to hope that their entry into the Government service will mark an important epoch in the country's development and progreu."

On tbe right of M. de la Boolinidre was M. de Refiye, who succeeds him a* Diplomatic Agent in Cairo, and on his left was M. de Valdrome. Among tbe other 150 guests were M.VaoAri, M. Maspeio, M. de Kramer, M. Barois, President Prunidreo, Dr. Brotaard, M. Pioelli, and Chela Bey.
                            At the conclusion of dessert M. VsnAri, depute de la nation, in an eloquent speech, expressed tbs great regret of tbe whole Prenob colony at the sereranco of their connection with M. de la Boulioidre. whose aervioe* daring his foor years' slay in Cairo bad been highly s teemed. In wishing M. da la Boulioidre every soooess in bis new appmntmeot which he was aboot to assume, be expressed tbe sentiment of not only (hose who were present bat of the united colony.
                            M. Maspero. in handing an illomioated address to M. de la Boulioidre, which waa signed by all attendiog the banquet, eohoed the wishes of M. Vaodri, saying that this aot of bomago was but so evidence of tho retiring DiplomatioAgont'e immense popularity among those whom be represented in this ooontry, and to a man who had faithfully fulfilled bis allotted doty.
                            After M. do la Boulinidro'i reply, in which he expressed the groat regret with whiob he left his many friends in Bgypt, and h:e gratitude forth* only too kind aud flattering sentiments to whiob ho h^d just listened, the band of tbe Inniakilling Dragoons, which supplied tbe mnsio for vho occasion, nndor the oondootorship of Mr. Prosser, struck op the "Marseillaise," at the oonolasioo of which the gnest of bonoar made bis departure, shaking bands with all present.
                            It only remains to say that the banquet was most satnptuous, and, under the direot supervision of Mr. Braon, even exeelled the pre- vioos menus of the Grand Continental Hotel
                            on similar oooasions.

                            Tbe 8t. Andrew's Dinner on Priday night was a great and notable soooess. 8h*pheaid' Hotel excelled iteelf, and provided a first rate menu and first-rate wines. Tbe Haggis was solemnly "played io“ by the bagpipes, and a telegram sent to Mr. James Hewat et Alexandria, to whore patriotism and generosity the oompany owed tbe famons dish. The band of the Ioniskilliog Paailien played throughout the dinner ; and the haunting ebarm of tbe Northern melodies most have awakerel many memories, pleasant and pathetio. All tbe nsoal toasts were proposed and drank. Mr. MitoheH-lnnes, the chairman, made a really fire speech for the "Land o' Cakes." Mr. Monteith Smith, Mr. Dioey, O.B., Mr. D.B Clark, Mr. Ross Taylor, and Mr. B. Thomson wet* all eloqoent and amosiog. There ware 39 pnaint in all, and among them Harvey Pasha, Messrs. MoGillivray, Granville, 8oott Monerieff, Hewitt ; and we mast not forget Mr. Marray, the piper, who oame "fall kit,” kilt and all. Ia fact, it was a memorable and delighttnl function, and it ia to be hoped that St. Andrew's Day will always be a* genially and loyally oelebrated in Bgypt as it was last Priday,

                            One of tbe first needs of e oritio Is self-asior- anoe, yet there are ooossions on whiob thoee bolder than our selves might reasonably quail; • ooh as. I tr instance, ths performance of "Bar- Kohba," a melodrama aoted in Yiddish and dealing with a ha'f forgotten period of Jewish hratory. That suoh a play oan find in Alexandria a large and appreciative audienoe is proof, if one wove needed, not only of the site but also of tbe oonstanay and enthusiasm of tbs Jewish oommnnity. Their able support to 3«torday‘s performance will be a welcome o mtribotion to tbe fnndsof the ‘Gmilet Heied.’ in aid ot whiob charity the entertainment was given.
                            Tbs acting as wall as tbe incidental music, ware apparently of no very high order, while the stage management waa divtiootly poor.

                            Oor Constantinople Correspondent is ii formed that the qocation of Tbaaaos baa beoome international, and that tbe Khedive, supported by Boglacd, is making a olaim to the port on the island and to'tbe foreign mioing oonoeasions given by Tatkey to a German company. The Khedive, who also opposes tbe concession for a cable between Tbaaaos and Tenedor, a Ays the island belongs to him.
                            The news that the Khedive is again actively pressing his olaim to the little island of Tbassos revives tbe memory of one of the curiosities of Oriental history.
