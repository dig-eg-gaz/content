                    <head>CYPRUS AND ITS SHIPPING INTERESTS.</head>
                    <p>In a note about Cyprus in a recent issue of the “Gazette” it was stated that
                        shipowning has had so far only an inferior share of the commerce of the
                        Island. Large, indeed, as is the field yet for the development of the
                        British shipping trade in Cyprus it should not be denied that British owners
                        have so far had the lion’s share, especially in the exportation department
                        of Cyprian trade. The Westcott and Laurance Line and the Prince Line, Ltd,
                        have for some time now been running a more or less regular service to
                        Cyprus, but the credit is in a great measure due to the enterprise of the
                        latter company. Indeed the Prince </p>
                    <p>Line steamers have for the last decade been serving the Island with fair
                        frequency and despite conditions of the most ungrateful and discouraging
                        nature, have slowly but surely been contributing to the development of the
                        Cyprian trade with the United Kingdom. The bulk of the material for the
                        Famagusta harbour and railway and for the extension of the latter to Morfou,
                        has been transported by the Prince Line steamers. The number of this
                        company's ships that have called at Cyprus since January last year amounts
                        to about 21, and had it not been for the diversion last year, to Egypt and
                        the North African Coast, of a great part of the cereals, principally barley
                        and wheat, that would have otherwise been destined to the United Kingdom,
                        the tonnage supply would have been larger still. </p>
                    <p>Unfortunately the Government of Cyprus, busy perhaps with more pressing
                        reforms, have not given the attention due to a British company that has laid
                        itself out so generously and enterprisingly to aid in the development of the
                        Island’s agricultural and commercial resources. Quite recently, however, the
                        Prince Line, through its general agent for Syria and Cyprus, has drawn the
                        attention of the High Commissioner to certain disabilities under which its
                        steamers were labouring. His Excellency has accorded a generous attention to
                        the matter, and one of the first fruits of his efforts in this direction has
                        been the abolition of the old Sunday fines that had not much raison d’etre,
                        and their replacement by a rational system of overtime fees to be allowed to
                        Customs officials, registrars, weighers, etc. His Excellency has, moreover,
                        taken the initiative in another and far more important direction, viz, the
                        suppression of certain out-of-the-way places not to be found on any chart of
                        Cyprus for the simple reason that there are scarcely, if any, habitable,
                        dwellings to mark the spots, and from which an appreciable part of the
                        staple product of the Island, viz., locust beans, is shipped. </p>
                    <p>The locust bean crop of 1904 was estimated at as many as 40,000 tons, and at
                        least half of this quantity has been exported to the United Kingdom. Now, as
                        we have noted, a not inconsiderable part of this stuff is shipped from the
                        above-mentioned outlandish places where there are none of the modern
                        appliances for loading and not even small wooden jetties and frequent have
                        been the disastrous detentions sustained by steamers attempting to load
                        thereat. The Prince Line, in view of its preponderant supply of tonnage, has
                        naturally home the largest share of the losses sustained through these
                        abnormal detentions, and it naturally felt a legitimate feeling of
                        satisfaction and pride in having been the pioneer for the introduction of
                        reforms calculated to contribute so considerably to the advancement of
                        British shipping interests. The loading of looust beans and indeed any other
                        produce is to be confined to recognised ports where the loading conditions,
                        whether natural or artificial,are more or less favourable. </p>
                    <p>But it seems that the Cyprian peasant, with his laziness and his inherent
                        aversion to innovations even in the shape of beneficial reforms, has set
                        himself against the application of the new measure, and has, strange as it
                        may seem, got his way. One cannot but share the disappointment that must
                        have been felt by the shipping companies concerned in the shipping trade
                        ofCyprus and the majority of whom are British. But the largest share of
                        sympathy is due to the Prince Line, whose generous and enterprising efforts
                        have been so ill-requited, seeing that this company, to help in the
                        development of Cyprian trade with the United Kingdom, has so far refrained
                        from stipulating lay days in its engagements and obviated the onerous
                        conditions of demurrage. At the worst, however, the Prince Line, with its
                        fast growing trade in Syria and Palestine, may find it suitable to divert
                        part of its tonnage, hitherto allotted to Cyprus, to this coast, where the
                        loading conditions are manifestly superior, and the Island itself will then
                        be the loser. It is to be hoped, however, that in the interest of the land
                        whose </p>
                    <p>government has been entrusted to his wise management and judicious care his
                        Excellency the High Commissioner will not heed the protests of an ignorant
                        and shortsighted class of Cyprians, and vouchsafe a generous cooperation to
                        shipping interests, for to an island, steamship communication is a factor of
                        absolutely vital importance. </p>
                    <p>We have omitted to mention that in his plan of reforms, prompted by the
                        representations of the Prinoe Line, his Excellency the High Commissioner has
                        included the construction of wooden jetties at the principal small ports at
                        which the operations of loading were to be authorized only. It will take
                        probably some time for the accomplishment of this very important project but
                        we are sure that once it has received the attention of the Governor it will
                        eventually be realized.</p>

                        officers, the specioas ball was packed and many friends from town were
                        present. The chair was taken by Mr. W. F. Sargeant, and to him thanks was
                        due for the excellent programme. Mr. 0. S. Heaton opened with pianoforte
                        solo and he also accompanied most of the BODgs in an artistic style. Mr.
                        Poms’ songs were given with fine vigour and were well received. Mrs. Bay lie
                        as usual charmed the audience with her light and pretty sin? ing, and won
                        well deserved enoores. Mrs. J. E Roberts’ songs ‘ Eternal Rest" and “The
                        Three Wishes” were received with warm applaose. Mr. Byrne spirited singing
                        of “Off to Philadel phia” with the Irish brogue carried away the audience
                        and he had to respond with another vorse ; he also sang “The Tompest" which
                        showed off hi* fine quality of voioe. Mr. Pieroe Hill’s ventriloqoial
                        entertainment was excellent, a»d it appeared as though the voio# actually
                        came from the figures themselves, and very funny wi rothf ir references to
                        "George." Mr. Hill aho gave some vory natural imita tions of sawing and
                        planting wood. Mr. Sergeant's ditties, “The Ghost of a (.oon ard "Oi )y a
                        Y«ar /go” fairly brought down tbo house. Ton and cake was served to the men
                        during the interval. The Rev. 11. P Refl1 called for a vote of thanks to all
                        those who had taken part and the hearty singing off ' God Savo the King”
                        brought the concert to a close. </p>

                        Alexandria Municipal elections, which have, it would appear, caused some
                        stir. The writers ream to be under the impression that absolute
                        disinterestedness in non existent in the Municipality and that self-seeking
                        or vanity are the motives, which iuduce persons to come forward as
                        candidates at the Municipal elections. We are therefore delighted to publish
                        the following letter from the Vice President of the Municipality, which
                        categorically oontradicts these assumptions. At the same time we might point
                        oot that the members of the Municipalsy carefully exclude all attempts to
                        admit the Press at their debates, and this may possibly have induced a
                        certain seotion of the pohlio to D^"f^rm sone unfavourable opinions as to
                        the oi motives for this decision, especially in view of the faot that a
                        former Municipal Councillor dec ared the official reports of the debates to
                        he ‘cooked.’’ Whether the authors of these litters deserve to be stigmatised

                    <p>IMPRESSIONS OF A COUNTRY BY ONE WHO HA8 NEVER VISITED IT. </p>
                    <p>As everybody knows, “ Gyp,” novelist politician, aejiyely associated with
                        the Bonlangist, Anti-Semitic, and Nationalist movements, has strong feelings
                        against England, which she ha3 never visited. In an interview with a
                        representative of the “Standard” these are expressed with amusing vigour. </p>
                    <p>“ When one contrasts a woman who is a 8U00688 as a woman with the annexed
                        female— well it serves England right that she possesses so many caricatures
                        of femininity ! It is such a pity, too, for the women there are very
                        beantifal, muoh more so than the Frenchwomen. Even when they dress in London
                        they have a chic all their own, and the sympathet:o Englishwoman is fall of
                        charm. The men ? Oh, they are beantifal—to look at. The aristocratic
                        Englishman is snperb; no man dresses so well ; he is chivalrous ; his
                        manners are absolutely correct. He would be perfeot if he never talked, but
                        directly he opens his month I detest him. He is—mode !" </p>
                    <p>“But snrely the English have some virtues, I said, after a lively disoussion
                        as to the exact meaning of “mufle.” “Can’t you pay a good word for anything
                        but the beauty of the women? ’ She reflected. “English people eat very
                        nicely. I like to watch them at table just for the pleasure of seeing how
                        graoefully they do iK Even the lower classes have something of the same
                        elegance—always a clean cloth, always a change of knife and fork, and a neat
                        way of disposing of their food. And they never rob the bread round and round
                        the plate to sop op the saloe as other people do, as I do when I have sanoe
                        Ilemonlade—with my fingers, mark, not with a fork. I admire their patriotism
                        ; their love of oonntry is beantifal. As business people they are, of
                        coarse, admirable ; they have a genius for finance, are generous in their
                        payments, and honest Never so honest, however, as when they are very
                        dishonest. One of the strong points of the English character is its
                        elasticity of conscience. They strive not only to j astify—that is excas-
                        able—bnt to olcthe with virtue their every aotion. Take the history of their
                        wars, for example. How many have they had in which they have not posed as a
                        moral as well as a material force ? It is always for the good of the other
                        nation. The *entente cordiale V An excellent arrangement for the English, as
                        those who made it will find out to their coat sooner or later. I prefer to
                        believe it is not seripns enough to be discussed. Parlous dautre chose.'* A
                        Strong Indictment. </p>
                    <p>But it was too late. Gyp is a red hot Nationalist, and sitting with her
                        profile outlined against, and astonishingly like, that of the bust of
                        Mirabeu juBt behind her, she spoke her mind. “It’s the same
                        self-righteousness that destroys their sense of jastice, and makes them
                        anable to mete out an unprejudiced punishment. There have been one or two
                        ocoaions when the whole of civilised Earope has tram bled with indignation
                        at their actions. Think. They knew an evil existed, and that it ought to be
                        eradicated, or at least subdued. Trfo bien. They concluded they must make au
                        example of some one. Not fur, but still—not oriminal. Who was the victim to
                        be ? There was a man of genins who had already done something to beautify
                        life for them, a man -wlnse brilliant talents aid artistic temperament onght
                        to have exonerated Am from ordinary roles, or at least have made him an
                        objeot of sympathy and pity. That was the man they chose to make their
                        publio example of, gloating over their chanoe, raking op all th\t belonged
                        to hi* private life and himself, disgracing him in the eyes of all
                        conventional persons, throwing him in prison, broken in spirit, wasting his
                        genius, sending him to a pauper’s grave—murderers ! And all England hugged
                        itself and said, ‘How virtuous we are !’ Those who committed the same sin
                        saying it the loudest. Hypocrites 1” Hypocrite*. </p>
                    <p>“Yes, hypocrites !” she cried, her eyes blazing.. “The English character is
                        rooted in hypoorisy, and that is why I hats it. To hear them talk, and read
                        their books, and see their pose yon would think them the pnreot and only
                        pure nation in the world. Look below the sarface, and what do yon find ?
                        Making allow ance for the dififerencs of temperament caused by racial and
                        o'imatio influences the English are exactly the same morally as any other
                        nation. In which o*her country is religion so often used as a oloak for
                        every kind of breach of confidence ? </p>
                    <p>Not to be found out is the real religion of the English, and they
                        demonstrate their belief in the efficacy of the ten commandments by crying
                        shame on the unpardonable sinners who have broken this first law.” </p>
                    <p>It was only when Gyp had vigorously poked the fire, had carried a very heavy
                        log of wood across the room, had settled it energetically into place and
                        poked and raked again, that she recovered her equanimity. Then she sat down,
                        sighed, and finally smiled her vivid smile. </p>
                    <p>“Anyway, we’re all human here,” she said, getting op again to hand round
                        some bon-bons “tat’a talk of things as they are, and be happy. Have o’e of
                        the^e—th y are made specially for ite.” </p>

                    <p>The trade in confectionery in this conntry may be roughly divided into two
                        classes viz : the very cheap goods for the Arabs, and the more expensive
                        qualities for the Europeans. As regards the first and greatest division,
                        England practioally has a monopoly, whilst h^r . rontribntion to the seoond
                        category is almost nil, except in the case of two or three firms sending
                        over plain ohocolates. </p>
                    <p>Althoagh the total turnover in oonfeotionery rons into fairly large figures,
                        the trade is not important enough to warrant separate returns being kept for
                        it at the Customs, and we aro, therefore, unable to quote statistics
                        relating solely to the sweets imported into Egypt daring any period. </p>
                    <p>In regard to the 1904 retnrnp, we find that the quantities supplied by the
                        various countries for every L.E. 1 received by them were as follows: —
                        Turkey 42.8 kilograms, England 31.9, Italy 13.7, France 10.8 and Switzerland

                    <p>Outside Turkey with her comparatively small shipment, no country can compete
                        with England in supplying this market with the low grade artiole required
                        for the native consumption. The Arab is distinctly a sugar loving
                        individual, and the question of quality dees not trouble him, the main point
                        is quantity. This being the case, it is scarcely surprising to find that the
                        only manufacturers having a footing here are those turning out the cheapest
                        possible artiole which will pass for oonfeotionery, </p>
                    <p>In view of the quantity sold, the competition for the native supply is to
                        exceedingly keen that the trade is now praotioally in the hands of three or
                        four British firms. It is no uncommon thing to come aoross a commission
                        agent who has lost his entire confectionery oonnection within a few months,
                        owing to another firm having discovered a manufacturer able to sell a shade
                        cheaper —and only a shade—than his own house. </p>
                    <p>It is, of oourse, impossible to say whether wa have yet reached rook bottom
                        prices, but the following order, reoently sent home by an agent here, will
                        give some idea cf the conditions ruling in the trade. </p>
                    <p>The requited shipment was to consist of mixed drops, mints with and without
                        pepper, balls, beans, and galatines, and the price 23/- to 25/- the owt,
                        tree English port, payable cash 30 days after rece pt of goods with 2 1/3 %
                        discount As regards the packing, some cf the oases ware to oontain 22 tins
                        of 4 1/2 lbs net, and others of 5 1/2 lbs. The oasks were to hold 86 bottles
                        each weighing 3 1/2 lbs. It is perhaps only fair to add that the
                        manufacturer refused the order on the grounds that his lowest prioe was 27/-
                        per owt. The agent, however, stated that the business could be done at even
                        less than 23/- per owt but, unfortunately, he did not represent the right
                        maker. </p>
                    <p>The principal kb ds of oheap oonfeotionery sold on this market consist of
                        A.B.C. lozenges, assorted boilings, and mixed drops. After these oome mixed
                        midget beans, fruit pastilles, lemon slice0, tangerine oranges, white
                        garibaldis, ching ch9n*s, and pyramids. An indication of price may be
                        obtained from the figures given in the proceeding paragraph, though we may
                        say that at the present moment, owing to the drop in sugar, the firm which
                        does perhaps the largest turnover in sweets here is, we understand, able to
                        buy at about 21/- per cwt. f.o.b. To this figure must be added say 10 % for
                        freight, and another 10 % for Customs dees and clearing chargee. </p>
                    <p>A very low class, but exceedingly cheap, sweet kuown as “halawah” comes from
                        Constantinople. It is sent in blooks either loose in barrels or in tins, and
                        has a large sale amongst the Arabs. </p>
                    <p>There are sundry small coi fectionery factories iD Egypt, the goods turned
                        out being entirely for native consumption. </p>
                    <p>Taking the second division of the trade viz: the dearer qualities for
                        European consumption, we fiod that the main source of supply is Franoe, her
                        principal speciality being “dragees” i.e. chocolates containing almonds, li
                        queurs, pastes, nuts, etc. The wholesale lates containing cream with
                        different flavour inga. The ohocolates, which are moulded into almost eveiy
                        conceivaVe shape, are wrapped in coloured papers. The cost of producing an
                        article of this deecript;on is naturally high, and it is, therefore,
                        scarcely surprising to find that from 2 frs. 50 cent. (2/-) to 3 fre. 80
                        cent. (3/-) the kilo c.i.f. Alexandria is the wholesale selling price for
                        the.cheapest qnali!j\ </p>
                    <p>The lowest in the scale of countries competing for the European trade here
                        is Austria, which, in a s:milar manner to Italy, copies Switzerland in the
                        class of confectione*y manu- tactnred. Although outwardly the gcods are in
                        many instances identical with the 8wiss productions, the quality is
                        distinctly inferior and the prices as much as 50 % lower. </p>
                    <p>In conclusion, we would suggest that home firms, who are Dot already
                        interested here, should turn their attention to the question of supplying
                        this market with the higher grade confectionery e.g. crystallized fruits,
                        dragees, peels, etc. At 21/- par owt. f.o.b. there cannot be very large
                        profits for the manofacturer even taking into account the low quality of the
                        article produced. Ou the other hand, the more expensive sweets certainly
                        offer greater scope in this respect. </p>
                    <p>It has been said to us by more than one commission agent that England oannot
                        compete with Switzarl^itd as regards quality, leaving prices altoseperofit
                        of the calculation. How far this is true we xSannot say, but the fact
                        remains that the quantity of first class oonfeotionery imported trom England
                        is very small. </p>

                    <p>GLASSWARE. </p>
                    <p>In ancient Egypt the blowing of glass and the contriving of glass vessels
                        were in vogue quite 2,000 y»ars before the Christian era. Mr. Percy Cook
                        Bi°hop, in the coarse of an article on “Glass, Ancient and Modem/’ in the
                        “Colleotior’s Magazine,” points ont that one of the tombs at Sakkara bears a
                        representation of glafs-blowing considered to be the earliest known record
                        of an art whioh, even at that riy date, might have been quite an old-
                        established institution among the dwellers by the Nile. The ancient Egyptian
                        glasswork was usually opaque, and more or less brightly coloured. The vases
                        and other vessels were generally small. Glass beads of various oolours were
                        made, and one of these, still surviving, is reputed to bear the name of
                        Queen Hatason, which, if true, would date this very anoient bead back to
                        about 1440 B.o. In the British Mneeum are many examples cf early Egyptian
                        glass or e of the most notable pieces being the Nineveh goblet, reputed to
                        have left the hands Of Feme glass-worker of ancient Egypt in or about the
                        year 700 B.c. From the Phoenicians and Egyptians the Fecrets of glass-making
                        spread to, and were handed on by, the Greeks, Etruscans, and Sicilians </p>

                    <p>“A Hick sailor Is pretty helpless man. I have found that J’oruna will do
                        more to restore one than any other medicine I know, and I have carried a
                        couplo of bottles on board for many seasons. </p>
                    <p>“Seven years ago Peruna cured me of bronchial trouble in a few weeks and
                        gave me such new life and nerve force that I certainly believe in telling
                        you of it. Olve me my compass and Peruna and I will steer dear of wrecks of

                    <p>“Peruna has my heartiest endorsement. If there is any place that you are
                        helpless when ill, it is on board a steamer, at sea, miles away from any
                        assistance. </p>
                    <p>“Sometimes two or three of my men would be siok at one time and serionsly
                        cripple the foroe, but since we have learned of the value of Peruna, by
                        taking a few doses they recuperate very quickly. </p>
                    <p>“We use it for colds, lung trouble and kidney diseases, and have also found
                        It very fine for la grippe. </p>

                    <p>London, Febrnary 2. all praotioal purposes the General has come to an end and
                        Sir Henry Campbell Bannennann will meet the new Parliament with by far the
                        largest majority known since the first Reform Bill. featare of the election
                        victories to the Premier most be the enthnsiapm with which his triumph is
                        received abroad. The French, being merely oonoerned in an entente with ns,
                        have indeed made few comments, save on the appointment of the Foreign
                        Minister; but elsewhere there has been general jnbilation. There have been
                        signs of exuberant joy in Germany and Austria, and other States have shown
                        they do not intend to be unheard A telegram of congratulation was sent from
                        the Belgian Liberals to Sir H. Campbell-Banner- man io which he has replied
                        suitably ; and Rnssia has been able to spare some time from her own internal
                        troubles to rejoice at the vitality of the "Kobdenovskie idea” in the
                        country of its origin. A few years ago, we may remember, England was
                        somewhat of an iihmael abroad ; and we must surely all be glad to possess a
                        man whose words, uninspired at times as they may have seemed to oar blind
                        selves, can work a change of feeling BO general throughout the Continent,
                        Critios may object that it would be more satisfactory still if
                        congratulations were equally forthcoming from the colonies, but as in every
                        celebration some small points are overlooked, so in the present case
                        Imperial opinion can well be forgotten in International. It is interesting
                        to observe the unanimous way in which it is proved by our good friends
                        abroad that, although Protection is the only possible policy for them, yet
                        Free Trade is necessary for England. So, we may add, it ie—if their export
                        trade is to flourish at our expense. It may have no importance, but it is
                        ourious that France, whose trade with us is praotically independent of
                        tariffs, has given far less attention to our Fiscal Reform polioy than other
                        countries, whose foreign commerce has been built up on our free imports. It
                        is from the latter that we receive congratulations to-day. </p>
                    <p>Almost every day brings additional evidence that the Eoglish community
                        throughout South Africa, but more particularly the Transvaal section,
                        believes that the Radical Government at home will shortly play into the
                        hands of the Dopper Boers. 'These irreconcilable) themselves are whispering
                        that their turn fi»r reprisals on the Britishers has arrived, and Het Volk,
                        with unotuoos sanctimoniousness, quietly but firmly inculcates the pagan
                        dootrine of "v® victis.” 'There is nothing surprising in this sudden revival
                        of dh’oyalty; Radicalism having adop ed the Majuba attitude to pacify the
                        inner workings of the Nonconformist Conscience, the Dopper* are sufficiently
                        logical to give completeness to the pose. </p>
                    <p>The gigantio rnsjority obtained \y Sir Henry Campfcel’-Bannerman may or may
                        not turn out to be unmanageable politically, but it is oer* taiu that,
                        physically, it wi 1 be the cause of not a little embarrassment to itself.
                        Supposing the present proportion 8 of parties towards one another are
                        maintained until the eud of the election, it is exceedingly difficult to see
                        where the majority will stow itself. The Radicals and the par ies at present
                        in alliance with them will more than fill the whole Chamber, which was never
                        designed to suit such a state of things as weshall see when Parliament
                        opens. </p>
                    <p>E en though thi Irish Nationalists remain, arcording to their custom, on the
                        left of the Speaker it will be physically impossible to accommodate the
                        Ministerialists and the Labour members on his right. On great nights they
                        must either take possession of the Peers Gallery, or overflow into the
                        quarters sacred to the Opposition. Either alternative almost equully
                        objectionable. The first would lead not ouly to frictiou with the Peers, but
                        to serious breaches of order, for one may be tolerably certain that a mem
                        her relegated to the gallery through want of room in the House itself, will
                        not consent to be deprived also of his right to cheer or interrupt speeches
                        which stir his feelings. The second alternative—that which I am afraid will
                        be adopted in practice—is even more ohjeotionable. It was the tension caused
                        by the overflow of the one party into the peats usually appropriated to the
                        other which led to that conflict which is the most regrettable incident in
                        all the long history of the Hou^e of Commons. It is not likely that feeling
                        will run less high in this Parliament than it did then, and with the
                        extraordinary d'fhculty of finding room for the Radicals on their own Hide
                        of the House, the greatest tact And owe will have to be exercised to avoid
                        Another and perhaps a worse explosion. </p>
                    <p>An old complaint against the House of Con mons is that it contains too many
                        barristers ar d too few men of business. There was Always someth brewers and
                        distillers (10), bankers,stock brokers, and &amp; whole miscellaneous
                        company are quite entitled to rank under the same heading. Altogether,
                        business iB well represented in the new House. It remains to be proved that
                        it is a business House. </p>
                    <p>There is a quite remarkable consensus of opinion among those personally
                        acquainted with Uganda that the East Africa Protectorate will some day
                        become one of the most prosperous provinces of the British Empire. Sir
                        Charles Eliot, than whom there is no higher authority on the subject,
                        coincides with Sir Harry Johnstone ard Sir George Goldie in looking forward
                        to its industrial and economic development with the utmost confidence. 8ome
                        difficulties have yet to be surmounted, it is true, the financial being the
                        most prominent. But the revenue steadily grows with out any enhancement of
                        taxation, vlrle wherever the railway penetrates, productiveness inoreses.
                        The soil is so rich and the olimatio conditions are so suitable for almost
                        all kinds of plant life that no limits can be set to the future expansion of
                        cultivation. There are still large areas of very fertile land which only
                        need European skill and enterprise, backed by capital, to yield good
                        profits, and among them aro soma suitable in every respect for white
                        colonisation. The supply of native labonr is also adequate, the Waganda
                        being immeaaarbly more steadfast as workers than the Kaffirs down Sooth. </p>
                    <p>It is a pity that more of the surplus labour aud capital of Great Britain
                        does not risk the venture of exploiting the natural resources of the East
                        Africa Protectorate, especially iu the beautiful highlands, with their
                        invigorating climate. </p>
                    <p>To Lord Roberts and the campaign of education with regard to our military
                        needs wh;ch ho is oonducting the nation may owe a deeper debt than it yet
                        contemplates. If his last remarks at Liverpool seem sweeping and large, it
                        is impossible to assert that his ideas are extravagant Commenting on the
                        neoessi'y of being able to reinforce sea power with our land forces — "the
                        fruits of Trafalgar,” paid Loid Roberts, ‘ were not reaped till Waterloo” he
                        suggested a million msn as the standard which we ought to attain. Of these,
                        500,000 would be for the defence of India, aud the other half for the
                        purposes of any possible campaign in Europe and the defeuoe of these bores.
                        How that army is to be got and maintained Lord Roberts shows, as he has
                        shown before, And he reverts to that alternative to oinscription, a modified
                        form and measure c f compulsory military training in sohools aud boys'
                        brigades, etc,, which he has always advocated, and which I have always
                        supposed. All that Lord Roberts said should be taken deeply to heart by the
                        nation as a whole, for it is well worthy of close attention, and delays may
                        be daugerons. Speaking of war he said, *T devoutly hope it never may come,
                        but I can say with oonfidenoe that it will come inevitably if you are not
                        prepare!” That is SO true as to be alarming. </p>
                    <p>The official report of our Consul-General at Hambarg makes it clear that
                        while England still retains the chief balk of India's external oommerce,
                        Germany has been socoessfnlly nibbling at the rioh cake. That wonld, no
                        doobt, be yet more apparent had not Lord Carzon rescued the great sugar
                        industry from the insatiable Teutonic maw. With fine courage, the ex-Viceroy
                        opposed tar ff reform to the subsidy system, and wheo his first effort to
                        stem the tide in that way did not sneoeed as completely as he desired, he
                        followed it by a second of more strenuous character. The outcome is that au
                        industry providing good employment for tens of thousands of Indian
                        workpeople has been ke^t going, without even fractional loss to any one
                        except the Continental producers and exporters of beet sugar. Some of those
                        too enterprising firms have gone down ; others can barely keep their heads
                        above water ; in fine, the Corzon remedy for unfair competition in British
                        market* has, iu this particular instanoe, proved absolutely effective. But
                        the Teuton is not easily choked off when once he has decided to attempt the
                        oapture of important trade. At any cost, he continues the campaign, as
                        witness his repeated purchases of British steamship fleets en gaged in
                        Southern Asiatic trade. It appears to be much the same in the case of India,
                        with the exception of sugar ; Sir William Ward speo'fioally asserts that
                        during the last </p>
                    <p>In every three or four families there is one il o rit'mate child, more than
                        one in the particularly marine oounties of Elgin, Banff, Aberdeen, and
                        Wigtownshire, as if the neighbourhood of the sea had some effect in this
                        direction, though this theory is contradicted by the faot that the Shetland
                        Isles are particularly free from this stain. Everywhere, however, matters
                        have been steadily improving from year to year for forty years and more. </p>
                    <p>One of the most startling features in the report is this, that Scotsmen are
                        becoming year by year more subject to oanoer. It appears, however, that
                        different methods of registration are partly respomible for this result, but
                        there ?9 sennthing in it, as is proved by the faot that the years of a man's
                        life when he is peculiarly liable to oanoer, fifty-five to seventy-five,
                        show an increased death rate in contrast with a decrease for all the other
                        years of his life. </p>
                    <p>Although the net tonnage entering and leaving the Port of London last year
                        showed small increase compared with 1904, we see little in this gain to
                        jastify the optimistio complacency of the Thames Conservators at their last
                        meeting. They make to aooount of the greater briskness of shipping business
                        almost all over the kingdom in 1905, oonse* qnent on the recovery in trade,
                        both home and foreign. When that undeniable improvement is reckoned in,
                        there does not seem mnoh cause for glowing satisfaction in the expansion of
                        25,689,400 tonnage by saoh a very limited amount as less than 200,000 tons.
                        In the ciroumstanoes, the growth of business at the premier port of the
                        United Kingdom ought to have been considerably larger than that, and the
                        Conservators might have mnoh more reasonably deplored such a stagnant state
                        of things than lauded it as a proof of enhanced prosperity. I do not affirm
                        that shipping bnsiness generally is leaving London, although many experts
                        hold that view. Owing to the prodigious population olose at hand, there must
                        always be a big ooasting trade, carried on by small craft to save the heavy
                        railway rates. Being of shallow draft, these vessels make light of
                        navigation difficulties up river. But the case is wholly different with the
                        great ooean steamers, and I suspect that Liverpool would oome out ahead of
                        London if the coast traffic were eliminated by both. </p>
                    <p>Not the least significant of the many signs that China is throwing off the
                        sloth of centuries, i» the report that the Chinese women are agitating to
                        remove some of the;r disabilities. The position of the women in the ordinary
                        Chinese household has long been a subject for wooder to European minds, and
                        it is &amp; tremendous step in the direction cf reform that anything is
                        being done to alter that position. Among other things, it is stated that the
                        wife of the ex-Ambassador at Washington is undergoing an operation for the
                        purpose of restoring her feet to their normal shape. Chinese ladies of rank
                        have now almost entirely left off having their children’s feet bandaged, aud
                        the effect of this :>n the nation as a whole oannot very well be
                        over-estimated. </p>
                    <p>It may be that a oritioal hint from a woman's journal may sink deeper into
                        the mind of the average woman than any kind of suggestion from mere men,
                        whose comment m;ght simply besn ffed at, which fate reduce the educational
                        value of comment to precisely nothing at all. The “Gentlewoman” says,
                        briefly, that the Englishwoman, when without any other national strain in
                        her blood, is apt to be uninteresting, and to place man upon a pedestal upon
                        which he finds it hard to keep his footing. "She gives the impression of one
                        who does not think sufficiently for herself.” That is the kernel of the
                        "Gentlewoman's” indictment, and it is worth re fleotion and consideration.
                        If an Bng’ish- woman expresses a vivid interest in, say, Browning’s poetry,
                        you may confidently sesrch among the men kind of her intimate cirole for a
                        real lover of Browning. If he drops out. Browning drops out of the li«t of
                        our Englishwoman’s vivid appreciations In Amerioan women we have strains of
                        various nationalities blended in a nimble, stirring atmosphere of strenuous
                        endeavour an'1 liberal freedom. The resalt, personified, is a woman who
                        proves a veritable magnet in English. </p>

                    <p>Captain W. J. St J. Harvey, 1st Battalion Black Watch, Fort George, has been
                        selected for servioe with the Egyptian Army. Captain Harvey, who has served
                        in the Royal Highlanders for over fourteen years, reached his present rank
                        in November, 1900. He was with the Black Watch in the advance to Kimberley,
                        and was badly wounded at Magersfontein. </p>
                    <p>The S S. Dunera, which sails from Southampton on the 10th Febrnary, brings
                        on* troops for the Mediterranean garrisons and Egypt. The latter inoludes 50
                        non-commissioned officers and men 1st Battalion Royal Berkshire Regiment,
                        Dnblin, under Lieutenant A. E. F. Harris ; 26 non-commissioned officers and
                        men 1st Battalion Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, Belfast, under Captain D.
                        Mathers, reoently transferred to the lnniskillings from the Royal Soots, and
                        Second Lieutenant S. B. Duffin, just appointed to the regiment from the 5th
                        Battalion Royal Irish R flee; and 71 non-oommisaioned officers and men 2nd
                        Battalion Royal Dnblin Fusiliers, Buttevant. </p>
                    <p>The vacant majority in the 91st (Empress of India's) Lanoers, Hounslow, has
                        been filled by the promotion to substantive rank of Captain and Brevet-Major
                        R Napier Smyth. D.8.0 Major Smyth was with the 21st in the Sudan Campaign of
                        1890, including their historio oharge at Omdurman (mentioned in despatches,
                        medal and Khedive’s medal with o*asp), and he was attached to the 13th
                        Hus-ars in the South African war, including the fighting into Ladysmith, the
                        actions of Colenso, Spion Kop, Val Krantz, and Pieter’s Hill (mentioned
                        three times in despatches, brevet majority, D.S.O., medal with two olasps). </p>
                    <p>The Army Coanoil has notified that the decision to discharge to pension
                        non-commissioned officers of the Royal Garrison Artillery who, on the 1st of
                        Janaary last were over 40 years of age, and has completed over 25 years’
                        service was temporary expedient only and that it is not intended that non
                        commissioned officers who reach the age and servioe mentioned subsequent to
                        the 1st of January, 1906, shall he discharged to pension. </p>
                    <p>Strict regulations in future are to be enforoed to prevent sailors of the
                        Fleet from smoggliug tobacco ashore. The number of men appie hended for
                        taking large quantities of tobeooo ashore is very mach on the increase, and
                        seamen are now to be restricted to one ounoe of duty free tobacco each
                        lending day. Naval, as well as Custom1, pnoishment will in future follow
                        disobedience of this order. </p>
                    <p>It is understood that when the battleship Dreadnought is laauohed the
                        particulars of her displacement, armament, construction, and so forth, which
                        are generally officially issued at launches, will not be giveo. </p>
                    <p>A further disadvantage is the fluctuating strength of companies on change of
                        station consequent on the change of armament to he manned, the strength
                        either having to be increased or decreased. To obviate all these
                        disadvantages the companies will be localised both at home and abroad. The
                        establishment of eaoh station will he maintained by drafts from home depots,
                        or by the individual relief of > ffioers and men, as in the Royal Engineers. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Arnold Foster's succesor is setting to work as the new broom ; hut there
                        is to be no more clean sweeping. So far as may he seen from the *et eral
                        p’an or his administration published iu "The Standard,” he is inclined to
                        act with that oaution and common sense which were expeot- ed of him. A
                        redaction in the fortress artillery, Arhich should effeot some economy,
                        while increasing efficiency, is all to the good as far as it goesy and Mr.
