                    <head>THE GREAT MYSTERY.</head>
                    <p>Directivity is a word not to be found in any lictionary, and yet it sums up
                        in one word the great mystery of the universe-the mystery of Who directs its
                        pulsating life.</p>
                    <p>Professor G. Henslow uses the word in a most interesting number of the
                        "Hibbert Journal" (Oct.), and says that he is indebted or it to the eminent
                        chemist Prof. A.H Church. "It has long been contended," he says, "that there
                        is no force in a living body which cannot ultimately be identified with the
                        physical forces of the inorganic world or be converted into tbem--chemical,
                        mechanical, electrical, or otherwise. No one disputes this now; but there is
                        something else which cannot De so explained, and that is directivity, and it
                        is my object to trace this property through the world." "Directivity is no
                        force, but a characteristic of life."</p>
                    <p>To illustrate this he points out that "in every case the food may be the same
                        for a great variety of organisms, as for a multitude of species of plants
                        growing in the same meadow; or when sheep, oxen, horses, and even geese may
                        be feeding on the same grassland. In each case the molecular compounds of
                        the grass are identical, but they find themselves ultimately disposed in
                        very different arrangements in the different animals. This can only be
                        possible, under the influence of directivity, but 'directing differently in
                        each creature. This directivity is therefore a characteristic of life."</p>
                    <p>"Why," asks Prof. Henslow, "should certain substances be guided to certain
                        places --- salts of line to bones, silica to teeth and claws, phosphates to
                        brain, etc. The molecules are first driven about mechanically in the blood
                        by certain forces ; various chemical combinations are made under the action
                        of other forces; but what directs all the foroes which finally impel the
                        new-nade molecules to take up certain positions over others in the building
                        up of a body ? Directivity is a useful word to express the fact. It commits
                        one to nothing as to its source, but it at least supplies a term to express
                        the analogy between the chemist's mind and Nature's what ?"</p>
                    <p>Once more he points out that "if a water plant be growing up submerged but
                        reaches the surface of the water and then grows into the air, the whole
                        anatomy at once alters at the water level. If a leaf happen to stand
                        obliquely at the surface so that one half grows under water, the other half
                        developing above it, the former is constructed to be in harmony with a
                        submerged existence, the other half being adapted to live in air. Again, if
                        the hook-like extremities of the tendrils of the Virginia creeper touch a
                        wall, the points at once begin to swell into adhesive pads. What is it which
                        guides the constructive forced to build up the tissues in response to the
                        above external conditions ?' The provisional answer is, Directivity is
                        life."</p>
                    <p>Prof. Henslow then points out that Haeckel in his "Riddle of the Universe,"
                        and other modern rationalists, do not explain this. "They can do no more
                        than assert that it is all done by blind forces; as if forces possessed a
                        sort of consciousness of what they are about and a will "to determine their
                        own motions and directions."</p>
                    <p>"Are all organic structures the outcome of some Universal Intelligence in
                        some sort of way akin to that in ourselves which every human being is
                        profoundly conscious of possessing l" asks the Professor. "How is the
                        question to be decided ? It seems to depend on the capacity of individual
                        brains as to their power of appreciation of induction."</p>
                    <p>"In universal directivity there is recognised as immanent an Omnipresent
                        Director as head; to which again, judging by analogy with our own human
                        consciousness of directivity, the result of our will, the induction now
                        super-adds consciousness and will. Because it is inconceivable how these
                        properties of man's psychology can have arisen at all if there bad not been
                        some origination in qualities of a like mind or nature."</p>
                    <p>"We thus realise conception of God in Nature," concludes Prof. Henslow, "or
                        the Power' of Mr. Herbert Spencer, by direct inductive reasoning. If Haeckel
                        cannot accept this induction, all we can say is that from our point of view
                        his mind must have a 'want.' On the other hand, he will retort, 'Your
                        inductions are all superstitions."</p>

                        <head>The Rangabe Case.</head>
                        <p>The Hellenic Consular Court at Alexandria has recently delivered an important
                        judgment atlecting the divorces pronounced by the Orthodkex Patriarchate
                        between Hellenic sok jects domiciled in Egypt. Mrs. Smaragia Rangabe
                        summoned her husband, Mr. Otho Rangabe before the Consular Court for
                        alimony. The defendant pleaded that the plaintiff's demand for alimony was
                        inadmissible as no matrimonial obligations existed between them now,
                        inasmuch as the Orthodox Patriarchate has dissolved the marriage. The court
                        held that the dissolution of the marriage pronounced by the Patriarchate was
                        null and void and ordered Mr. Rangabé to pay £18 per month as alimony. In
                        matrimonial cases, especially in cases of divorce the Hellenic Civil
                        Tribunal have sole competence of jurisdiction and the main principle
                        therefore must be held to exist in countries where the régime of the
                        capitulations exist. Hellenic subjects dwelling in such countries in order
                        to get a valid decree of divorce must apply to the courts where the husband
                        was last domiciled in Greece, as divorce cases do not come within the
                        jurisdiction of the Consular Courts. Therefore all divorces pronounced by
                        the Oribodox Patriarchate in Egypt between them are null and void.</p>

                            against Herr Harden. It is also stated that Prince Eulenberg and Count von

                            necessary, and it is considered that the impending cases will bring to a

                        <p>Two sons of a notable of Faccous have been found murdered on their father's
                        property. The police are actively engaged in investigations. The district is
                        greatly agitated by this brutal crime, the motive of which is at present
                        incomprehensible. Up to the time of telegraphing no trace of the murderer of
                        murderers has been found. It is, however, suspected that more than one man
                        is implicated, and the police's attention is directed towards the Bedouins
                        of the district. With overy murder committed discussion not unnaturally
                        involves the wholo question of crime in the provinces and the difficulties
                        of bringing the authors to book. As far as I can judge, the general
                        impression is that more English officials are required in the country
                        districts as resident authorities. First of all there is no question as to
                        their incorruptibility, secondly an order given by them is sure to be
                        carried out to the best of their enbordin. ates' capability, and thirdly
                        their determination to solve a set problem usually ineets with success. We
                        cannot do without the British "bull dog," and, despite the wailings of
                        Mustapha Kamel, the more we have of him the better it will be for Egypt and

                        quartz of high value may be met with. To treat the ore already opened up a

                        January last and set in operation in Juno. A consignment of gold of the

                        <p>Though it only just November, Cairo already shews signs of the coming season
                            and whereas a few weeks ago one might lunch or dine in comparative solitude
                            even in the most popular hotels, such hotels as are already open present
                            quite an animated appearance now. The Sudan Budget is of course keeping a
                            good many men in town, but apart from these there is quite a fair number of
                            visitors at the hotels, and the accomplished salesmen who frequent the
                            streets at the first appearance of the tourist are already exhibiting their
                            wares and rubbing up their half forgotten English.</p>
                        <p>And after all why should the tourist shun Egypt until the latter end of
                            November, when the country offers such a perfect climate nearly A month
                            earlier. It may be that the days would strike the stranger as being a little
                            too warm perhaps, but if it is change that they are seeking it will be more
                            readily found in the earlier months of the winter, when dinner is served on
                            the terraces under the naked sky agd the life and colour of the East is
                            really in evidence.</p>
                        <p>The ordinary tourist who comes out to Egypt in December and leaves again in
                            February or March has really no idea of the drowsy Eastern life at all, and
                            very often leaves with theimpres. sion that after all life here is much the
                            same as life in Europe, except perhaps that the latter possesses charms of
                            cleanliness which the former Jacks. It is the old story of Padgett M.P., as
                            year by year the tourist comes, lingers bis few months, and vanishes before

                            country as ignorant of the true nature of the place and people as when he
                            arrived. Indeed, he is usually more ignorant, for he has received
                            impressions which no power on earth will rid him of, ideas which he fondly
                            imagines he has assimilated from personal observation, but which have in
                            reality been grafted into bis mind by the dragoman who accompanied him in

                        <p>Let the tourist for his own benefit, come out and study the conditions which
                            obtain before the place is Buropeanized both in climate and manners, let him
                            wander amongst the Natives alone, without a dragoman at his side to proclaim
                            his helplessness to all concerned, and he will find that life in Cairo is of
                            a very different nature to that which presents itself to the eyes of the
                            visitor who comes here to "do" the sights.</p>

                        <p>The intestine disputas of the various sections of the Nationaliuta appear to
                            be inoressing it virulence, for the speech of Mustapha Pasha Kamel at the
                            Zinnia Theatre has resulted in exasperating rather than mollifying the other
                            groups. Some of the Nationalista are spending money freely to get rid of
                            their once powerful chief and agents are going about the country offering
                            P.T. 120 to each native who will sign a petition against him. The statement
                            is made in Kamel's own organ, which would be inclined to minimise rather
                            than exaggerate the agitation against him. The "Egyptian Standard of
                            yesterday's date contained the following paragraph, beaded "A Carious
                            Intrigue" :</p>
                        <p>The "Lews" of yesterday published a communication from a notable of Manaura,
                            which confirms a telegram sent the previous day, and in which he states that
                            for some time past an individual, delegated by a well known native
                            journalist in Cairo, has been endeavour ing to secure signatures, on a
                            promise of 120 P.T. to each signatory, to a document directed against the
                            "Lewa" and its proprietor. We think that this intriguer is likely to find
                            himself one day hoist with his own petard. Sach tactics neither discourage
                            nor frighten us."</p>
                        <p>While these tactics are being pursued in the towns and villages, the attacks
                            in the other Nationalist newspapers against Kamel continue with unabated
                            force. The Moderate Nationalist section of the vernacular Moslem Press,
                            represented by "Al Moryad" and "Al Minbar", never relar their efforts to
                            expose the hollowness of Kamol's pretentions. A contributor to the latter
                            newspaper, Mohamed el-Hai, writes :</p>
                        <p>"I ought to mention that the unanimous opinion of the thoughtful section of
                            the Egyptian nation is that this young man, Mustapha Kamel, has become
                            subject to powerful illusions and that these illusions of his will in the
                            end be disastrous to himself or to the nation and probably to both
                            together."</p>

                        <head>THE PARTY OF THE NATION.</head>
                        <p>While the Moderate Nationalists are fighting Kamel and his followers, a
                            fierce conflict is being carried on in another part of the field of battle
                            between the Party of the Nation and the Egyptian Liberals. The trouble has
                            arisen because the Cairo correspondent of the "Manchester Guardian" in
                            writing to that newspaper stated that the various points in the political
                            programmes of the Party of the Nation and the Egyptian Liberals were so much
                            alike that it was strange that a fusion of the two sects had not taken
                            place. Now to declare that any of the pro. grammes of the various political
                            parties in Egypt bears the slightest resemblance to any of the others, is an
                            insult of the most bitter character, for each party prides itself on being
                            original. As soon as the copy of the "Manchester Guardian" containing this
                            article arrived in Egypt, the organ of the Party of the Nation, "Al Garida"
                            became very annoyed that anybody should venture to suggest that its
                            programine had the slightest affinity with the tenets of the Egyptinn
                            Liberals. It declared that the Party of the Nation was in its very essence
                            utterly unconnected with any of the dogma, forming part of the creed of the
                            Egyptian Liberals, for the Party of the Nation insisted on the independence
                            and self-governinent of Egypt, while that the Egyptian Liberals actually
                            accepted and recognised the Occupation. Moreover the Liberals were only an
                            imaginary party whereas the Party of the Nation was the only real and
                            genuine political party in the whole country. As El Sayed Hassan Moussa EI
                            Akkad had recently declared in the columns of Mustapha Pasha Kamel's organ
                            that the Party of the Nation only existed in the imagination of a few
                            individuals, the object of this taunt no doubt thought that it would be a
                            good stroke of policy to pass it on to the Liberals.</p>

                        <head>THE EGYPTIAN LIBERALS.</head>
                        <p>Of course these terrible calumnies worked up the Egyptian Liberals to a pitch
                            of exasperation and as much ink has of late been spilt over this squabble as
                            has been the case in the struggle between the Moderate Nationalists and
                            Kamer's party. The Leader of the Liberals, Mohamed Bey Wahid, at once took
                            up the challenge and issued a manifesto wherein be declared that the policy
                            of the Party of the Nation was as fantastic as the party itself. He went on
                            to state that neither his party nor the Party of the Nation could ignore the
                            fact that the English were in Egypt and that it was not possible for them to
                            order the English to at once evacuate the country. After attempt.ing to
                            prove at great length that the arguments of the Party of the Nation were all
                            absolutely fallacions be appended to his manifesto two articles of the
                            programme of the Egyptian Liberals wherein it was openly declared that the
                            Liberals claimed the independence and autonomy of Egypt.</p>
                        <p>The statement that neither the Party of the Nation nor the Egyptian Liberals
                            Are able to ignore the fact that the English are in Egypt has been received
                            with some interest, and the announcement must be welcomed as an original
                            contribution to local politics, for it has raised a problem which still
                            awaits solution. Bron Kamol does not ignore the fact of the English being in
                            Egypt but accepts it as an unnecessary evil. Whether the Party of the Nation
                            can draw up a political programme which will completely ignore this
                            disagreeable fact, remains to be seen, but at any rate the Egyptian Liberals
                            leader declares it to be an impossibility.</p>

                        <p>The Copts, who were specially urged by Kamol in his Zizinia speech to
                            join with the Moslems under his leadership, seems to be very slack in
                            making any reply. The leading Coptio organ, "Al Watan," in an article on
                            the state of political parties in Egypt, remarks :-</p>
                        <p>"Our friends are still hammering at the question of Egyptian parties and
                            their names To one who reads the comments of our Arabic contemporaries
                            on this subject nothing is clearer than the fact that political parties
                            in this country are mere names and that the whole talk about there
                            parties sounds like the vague and meaningless promise of the old Tork.
                            There is no doubt, a vast number of low-class illiterates and
                            simple-minded patriots who believe that Mustafa Pasha Kamel is the
                            incarnation of statesmanship and patriotism and who are bis followers.
                            On the other hand it may be safely asserted that among the higher
                            classen the majority is anti-Kamelite. The Copta, almost to a man, are
                            moderates on the lines of AlWatan; while the Syrians, who after the
                            Copts are the strongest native element in Egypt are advocates of the
                            dogma of political moderation As expounded by "Al-Mokattam" with which
                            we share views on most of our questions. Among the Mohamedans it cannot
                            be denied that the majority is with the leader of low class politics,
                            but &amp; considerable number of notables side with "Al-Garida,"
                            "Al-Minbar," and other newspapers of this variety. As these papers are
                            unsettled and ancoufirmed in their professed political faith we can see
                            no wonder in the apparent confusion and vagueness of their - political
                            programmes. Some of these papers shew irreconcilable enmity to the
                            supporters of their own party for no reason save the innate fanaticism
                            of their editors and the false natore of their political moderation. One
                            has only to read "Al-Garida," "Al-Moayad," "Al-Minbar" to see this
                            abominable fraud in our party politics. These three papers profess now
                            to be moderates on the lines of "Al-Mok. attam," "Misr," and "Al-Watan".
                            There is no essential difference between our side and theirs on any
                            great question affecting general interests in Egypt. Yet these three
                            Mohamedan papers cannot bide their great hatred to the three papers
                            owned by Christians. They are Actually fighting us although they declare
                            to be of our own opinion now. They reproduce articles in support of
                            their views but they never reproduce anything from "Al-Mokattam,"
                            "Misr," or "Al Watan."Surely we have ample reason for losing all faith
                            in their sincerity and in the firm nature of their political creed." </p>

                        <p>A work, which is sure to cause some discussion in Egypt, is to be
                            published in London shortly. It deals with constitutional institutions
                            in this country and the author is Mr. Pox-Bourne, of the Aborigines
                            Protection Society. The work will be to a large extent retrospective,
                            tracing the history of the condominium, Cherif Pasha's Chamber of
                            Deputies, and the existing Legislative Council and General Assembly
                            established by Lord Dufferin. The work will contain numerous citations
                            from official documents and some use will be made of Mr. Wilfrid Scawen
                            Blunt's testimony. The pamphlet will end with a statement and
                            elaboration of the proposals for the amendment of the constitution,
                            recently put forward by Sheikh Aly Youssef, of "Al Moayad," and Hafiz
                            Effendi Awad, of "Al Minbar." It is no doubt. in his advocacy of such
                            changes that the author will arouse the most divergent views and
                            encounter considerable opposition.</p>

                    <head>LECTURE ON EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>At one of the special evening lantern slide lectures held at the Annual
                        Exhibition of the Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain Mr. G. K.
                        Marshall A.RI B.A. gave a description of Ancient Egypt to a crowded
                        audience, indicating the keen interest taken in this subject in London. The
                        photographs displayed in connection with the first part of the Address were
                        of various antiquities in Museums including the mummy of Rameses II., and
                        the very early set of "bracelets made of turquoise and gold found by
                        Professor Petrie upon the broken-oft arm of some lady's mommy. Several
                        illustrations were also given of the funerary statuettes or doll models, of
                        the domestics and agriculturalists preparing items for the sepulchral feast
                        The most valuable pictures shown however were a series specially taken by
                        the lecturer at Thebes including many of the temple of Karnak. One of these
                        showed the scenes graven, and the hieroglyphic texts, upon the corridor of
                        the temple at Elfa, a most difficult subject for photography because of the
                        impossibility of placing the camera at a distance from the wall. The lecture
                        itself was both learned and interesting and gave great satisfaction. It is
                        to be hoped that soon an enlarged series of photographs of Egyptian Temples
                        will be exhibited at these annual salons of the Photographic Society. The
                        Cathedrals and Churches of Western Europe have been exhausted and the never
                        yet equalled edifices of ancient Egypt should have their turn.</p>

                    <p>There was a fairly large assembly at the Grand Contigental Hotel to-night to
                        attend the meeting convened by Shiekh . Aly Yosel, proprietor of "Al
                        Moayad," with the object of preparing the way for an Islamic Congress. The
                        meeting was timed to start at 9 p.m. and at that time a large crowd had
                        gathered on the terrace of the hotel, and in the crush which resulted one of
                        the glass panels of a door was broken.</p>
                    <p>Shiekh Aly Yusef first addressed the meeting briefly, explaining the object
                        for which it had been called, and introducing the chief speaker of the
                        evening, lainail Bey Goafrensky, who speaking in Turkish called upon the
                        Mohamedans of the world to unite and follow the example of the other nations
                        of the world in the pursuit of civilization and knowledge. The first
                        endeavour of the Mamluwan world, should, he mid, be the formation of schools
                        in every sphere where Mosalumans aiated, for this work a sum of one million
                        and a hak mould be necessary. It is a large sum, where to into be obtained
                        from the Mussluman himself. Let each man who had the welfare of his creed at
                        heart subscribe his mito let the pin who smoked 10 cigarettes a day, reduce
                        the number by balf and pat the money raised to the canine which would
                        benefit the whole Mohamedin world.</p>
                    <p>The Christians he said had left the Mohamedan behind in every walk of life.
                        The latter could hardly boost the ponension d a single steamship, or a
                        single bank, and why, because the Mussloman was not alive to his duty, was
                        not sufficiently united in bis endeavours, and was too content to follow a
                        loul without attempting to rise to the same place as the other nations.</p>
                    <p>He quoted the nation of the Greeks who have, in losing hold of the older
                        civilization common to the East, might hold of the new, and still holds
                        position duong the power of the world.</p>

                    <head>EGYPT'S TRADE</head>
                    <p>CHEMICAL MANURE IMPORTS.</p>
                    <p>A trade in Egypt which has been increasing, says the British Chamber of
                        Commerce Bulletin, by leaps and bounds during the past three or four years,
                        and which will undoubtedly continue to do so for some time to come, is the
                        one dealing with the handling of artificial fertilisers. The accompanying
                        statistics, which have been prepared from the Customs House returns, show
                        that in 1902 the total imports of all artificial manures were 2,000 tons
                        valued at LE. 13,000, whilst last year the figures were nearly 13,000 tons
                        declared at over L.E. 122,000. For the first nine months of 1907 the
                        deliveries totalled 7579 tons L.E. 76,907.</p>
                    <p>Apart from the influence of the Assouan Dam and other irrigation works in
                        largely increasing the area of cultivable land, and so causing a bigger
                        demand for manures, the main reason for the recent rapid growth in the trade
                        is the fact that the native is now endeavouring to grow cotton once every
                        two years instead of once in three, and, consequently, finds that he must
                        return something to the land which will replace the nourishment taken out of
                        it by thu cotton. When we remember the high figure the fellah pays for his
                        land, whether he buys or rents it, coupled with the phenomenal price at
                        which he has recently been able to dispose of his crop, we can readily
                        understand that tho man will endeavour to squeeze cotton out of his fields
                        as often as possible.</p>
                    <p>Prior to the introduction of artificial fertilisers, the credit for which
                        being due almost entirely to the Khedivial Agricultural Society, the native
                        mainly depended upon "Sabakh," that is to say the remains of old buildings
                        villages and cemeteries for his manure. Such remains-generally in the form
                        of small hills -were found all over the Delta, but they are gradually
                        becoming appreciably scarcer, or too far away from the scenes of cultivation
                        Other native manures are river and canal mud and stable refuse, but these,
                        together with "Sabakh," are totally insufficient to meet the requirements of
                        the country, and we therefore scarcely think we are wide of the mark in say.
                        ing that chemical manure imports are likely to still further largely
                        develop</p>
                    <p>In the Nota published by the financial Adviser to the Egyptian Government on
                        the subject of the budget for 1906, attention was drawn to the fact that,
                        while the area under cotton cultivation had steadily grown during the past
                        few years, there had been no increase in total crop productions, the quality
                        also having left much to be desired. A word of caution was given to those
                        cultivators who were then growing cotton on the same land every two years,
                        and who did not also pay sufficient attention to the question of the
                        seed.</p>
                    <p>In a similar Note a year later on the Budget for 1907, the Adviser said
                        "Although the area devoted to cotton has steadily increased of late years,
                        the total amount of the crop has scarcely varied, and it was feared that
                        overcropping had seriously impaired the productivity of the soil.</p>
                    <p>"The record this year does not altogether bear on this theory. The present
                        cotton season has proved very satisfactory. The total crop will probably
                        exceed that of its predecessor by from one half to three-quarters of a
                        million kantars."</p>
                    <p>A partial explanation of the improved state of affairs at the end of 1906
                        was, undoubtedly, the fact that imports of chemical manures in that year
                        were 12,725 tons against only 6,200 tons in 1905.</p>
                    <p>For cotton, the native usually puts on each feddan (a little more than an
                        acre) 200 kilos of superphosphates and from 80 to 90 kilos of nitrogenous
                        fertilisers, of which about two thirds are nitrate of soda and one-third
                        sulphate of ammonia. Manures in these proportions will cost about P.T 180 to
                        P.T. 185 (£1.16.11 to £1.17.11) delivered to any railway station in Lower
                        Egypt</p>
                    <p>For wheat, the cultivator uses from 90 to 100 kilos of nitrate of soda per
                        feddan. He can obtain this delivered to any station in Lower Egypt from P.T.
                        115 to P.T. 120 (£1.3.7 to £1.4.7) per feddan.</p>
                    <p>The prices of chemical manures vary considerably from time to time, but the
                        following may be taken as average rates :</p>
                    <p>Nitrate of soda £ 12.10.- per ton c. i. 1. Alexandria,</p>
                    <p>Sulphate of Ammonia £ 13 to £ 13.5.per ton c. i. f. Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>Superphosphates $ 3.2.--to £ 3.6.----per ton c. i. f. Alexandria,</p>
                <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>The above prices include the packing of the manyres in double sacks.</p>
                    <p>The quality of superphosphates imported is that containing from 16 to 18 per
                        cent. of phos. phorio acid water and citrate soluble..</p>
                    <p>Owing to the very small Egyptian demand prior to last year, it was found
                        cheaper and more convenient to bring the nitrate of soda from Chili to
                        Belgium and then trans-ship to Alexandria According to requirements. This
                        largely accounts for the foot that in 1905, Belgium had practically the
                        whole of the Bgyptian trade. In 1906, the sales having increased so
                        enormously, the Khedivial Agricultural Society of Cairo chartered two
                        vessels and brought full cargoes (besides having part cargoes on their
                        ships) direct from Chili to Alexandria, and the same process is being
                        repeated this year.</p>
                    <p>Belgium is the principal source of supply for superphosphates, the manures
                        being actually prepared in that country. Glasgow also ships &amp; few
                        superphosphates, but Antwerp does nearly the whole of the trade.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Sulphate of Ammonia, the main port of shipment is Glasgow,
                        after which comes Antwerp.</p>
                    <p>Practically the only manures fnanofaotared in Egypt are those turned out by
                        the Cairo Sewage Transport Co. such as "Poudrette" and other sewage
                        prodnots. The Company also works ap various slaughter house products such as
                        dried blood, powdered hoof and horn and ground bones. When these were first
                        pot on the market some years ago, the Company had great difficulty in
                        selling them, as the dative did not appreciate the value of artificial
                        manares, and, moreover, was not in a good enough financial position to incur
                        the necessary expense. These difficulties, however, have now been overcome,
                        thanks to the work done by the Khedivial Agricultural Society in edu. cating
                        the natives in the use of fertilisers, and Also to the fact that the
                        fellaheen can dow afford to pay for the same.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the Khedivial Agricultural Society of which mention has
                        already been madle, we may say that this body has interested itself in the
                        distribution of chemical manures, during the past six or seven years. With
                        the object to assisting the Society in this work, the Government between
                        September and December 1906 lent them £100,000 at 2% per annum interest</p>
                    <p>Speaking on the above matter in his report for the year 1906 Lord Cromer said
                        that the whole of the £100,000 "was employed and reimbursed to the Society,
                        which was thus in a position to repay the Government. In view of the large
                        amount of money required in the future, the Government has informed the
                        Society that it is unable to advance further sums. The question thus becomes
                        one of ordinary commerce. So long as the Governmentadvanced money to the
                        Society at a low rate of interest, and the Society distributed manure at a
                        profit of only 2 %, it was obviously impossible for commercial enter I prise
                        to enter into competition with the Society,</p>
                    <p>In future the Society will not be able to carry I on the whole of this work
                        as in the past. Com. merce will, it is hoped, gradually replace the Society,
                        and, by selling at a reasonable price, will induce cultivators to obtain
                        their supplies through this channel."</p>
                    <p>We may mention that the Egyptian Markets Ltd. have recently entered into the
                        trade of supplying the natives with artificial manares. The Company which
                        was established in 1898 with a capital of $175,000, runs official markets in
                        120 centres in Egypt and, therefore, possesses the necessary organization
                        for distributing the fertilisers direct to the Arabs.</p>
                    <p>The imports of chemical manures are allowed into the country daty free (the
                        only other instance of free entry here being books by parcel post) and
                        special reduced rates are in force on the State Railways for carriage into
                        the Interior. It will thus be seen that the Government is encouraging the
                        native, as far as possible, to use chemical manures.</p>
                    <p>There is no monopoly for the import of artifi. cial fertilisers, and any
                        manufacturer or mer: chant is that able to engage in the trade.</p>

                    <p>Lieutenant Colonel J. M. Jones, Royal Army Medical Corps, who, as already
                        intimated in these notes, has been appointed P. M. O., in. Egypt, is a very
                        clever medico of mnch experience in many lands, particularly in the tropics,
                        for such as the Mediterranean foxer, etc. As a çivil surgeon, he saw a great
                        deal of service in the Zulu War, 1879-80, for which he holds the medal with
                        clasp.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant C. P. Heywood. 2nd Battalion Coldstream Guards, has been selected
                        for service with the Egyptian Army. Mr. Heywood has worn the bearskin since
                        Augnet, 1899, and he served with the Guards Brigade in the South African War
                        through the fighting in Orange River Colony and the Transwaal to Pretoria
                        via the battlefields of Vet River, Zand River, Johannesburg and Pretoria,
                        and later on in the actions of Diamond Hill and Belfast and the minor
                        affairs in Cape Colony down to the close of the war (Queen's medal with five
                        clasps, King's medal with two clasps). He was latterly adjutant of the 2nd
                        Battalion.</p>
                    <p>When Captain S. G. Roe, Royal Inniskilling Fasiliers, now on the way home
                        from Egypt, relieves Captain D. G. H. Auchinleck in the adjatancy of the 4th

                        the promotion of Corporal F. T. L. Friend, a smart young subaltern of the
                        Leinster Regiment, to a compilation.</p>
                    <p>On return to regimental duty from service with the Khedive's army, Captain M.
                        J. Hamilton, Lancashire Fusiliers, has been posted to the 2nd Battalion,
                        Fermoy.</p>
                    <p>Major C. S. Wilson, Royal Engineers, who has just been appointed for duty to
                        Egypt, will embark for Alexandria on the 2nd prox. Major Wilson has spent
                        over twenty one years in the Scientific Corps, and has had considerable
                        experience of Bastern Africa, having been engaged on the Anglo-Portuguese
                        Boundary Commission, 1892-95, and 1898-99. He was with the Royal Engineers
                        in the South African War, 1899-1902, earning a mention in deg. patohen, and

                    <p>Nearly all hands of the "Green Howards," at Aldershot, have submitted
                        themselves to inoculation against enterio in view of their approaching tour
                        in Egypt and India, and lectures in hygiene have been given to all ranks. It
                        is hoped by these means to minimise the effects of this tropical
                        scourge.</p>
                    <p>In January next, Captain J. G. Lawrence, Army Pay Corps, will embark for
                        Egypt for a tour of duty there. Captain Lawrence originally entered the
                        Royal Irish Regiment ten years ago, and transferred in 1903 to the financial
                        branch of the service. He has the Tirah Expedition, 1897 (medal with clasp)
                        to his credit.</p>
                    <p>The move of the 6th Inniskilling Dragoons' Reserve Squadron from Ballincollig
                        to Hounslow has been postponed till the 23rd January,</p>
                    <p>The 3rd Battalion King's Royal Rifle Corps, Aldersbot, is getting ready for

                        will embark on the 18th Pebenary i next. Nearly all hands have been
                        inoculated against the enterio, fiend preparatory to.going. eastwards. The
                        battalion, which will become on the strength of the Malta oomraad during -
                        its stay in Crete, has been on home service. since the close of the South

                        Khartoum.</p>
                    <p>Probably no more striking proof of the great changes that have taken place in
                        the Bapino's. naval strategy can be adduced than that there are ng

                    <p>It is expected that the battleship "Goliath" will be despatched to the
                        Mediterranean about the beginning of the New Year.</p>
                    <p>The old line of battleship "Asia," 80 guns, which flew the flag of Admiral
                        Sir Edward Codrington commanding the British, French and Russian Fleets at
                        the battle of Navarino against the Turkish and Egyptian Fleeta--in the
                        course of which the latter were practically annihilated on the 20th October

                    <p>Today, Lord Charles Beresford has a fleet of 110 battleships cruisers and
                        smaller ships operating under his orders in the North Sea. It is the
                        mightiest naval demonstration--for that is really what it is-ever sent from
                        one scores to prove that in all verity "Britannia rules the waves." No war

                    <p>The Army Council has just issued a very important circular in connection with
                        the musketry season of the regular and ancillary forces. From this it
                        appears that the average in shooting in the cavalry rose from 171 to 176,
                        and in the infantry from * 169 to 173, the improvement being attributed to
                        the new wind gauge which came into use last year. Recruit training was
                        marked by improvement, particularly At the local depots. Instruction in
                        firing from behind cover is to receive greater attention during the barrack
                        square stage, and the soldier is to be farther looked after in regard to his
                        physical development in order to fit him for prolonged spells of firing. On
                        the whole, it is considered that firing is too fast. The manual lays down 15
                        rounds per minute, but 10 is considered to be a good general average.</p>
                    <p>Aprop 9 of nával gannery, it sometimes happens that the man behind the gun is
                        not to blame when the sbot fails to hit the target. Recently, the very bad
                        shooting of the battleship "Hannibal" provoked some sharp comment, but an
                        investigation of the sights of the big guns showed that they were
                        practically useless, and no gunner could hit the mark by their aid.
                        Stringent instructions have just been</p>

                        future the sights are to be covered constantly, save when in age, or
                        cleaning, with stout canvas protectors. Coaling is particularly severe on
                        the delicate mechanism of the sights, Aa the gritty particles force their

                        rien ne justi fiait l'amélioration qu'on tichait de consolider, le maximum
                        pratiqué hier matin, soit 19 3/8, n'a pa etre maintenu et le soir le
                        Novembre a été affiché à 19 7/32.</p>
                    <p>On remarquait un désir intense de réaliser et cette impression était
                        tellement vraie qu'aujourd'hui et malgré les exportations dépassant les
                        prévisions, la tenge du marché a été pitoyable et que la semaine a fini sur
                        la cote de-19 1/32 pour Novembre, soit tout bonne. ment en perte de 9/16 sur
                        Vendredi dernier.</p>
                    <p>Ce n'est certainement pas la un brillant résultat pour ceux qui veuleot la
                        hausse A tout prix et qui ont peut-être sérieusement cru pouvoir l'imposer
                        par des moyens factices; mais ce qu'il y a de plus mauvais encore, c'est la
                        tendauce qui ce soir semble être franchement pour la baisse. Les positions
                        des haussiers sont trop chargées et l'on dirait presque qu'il n'y a plas
                        moyen pour eux de continuer à absorber tout ce que le commerce vend en
                        contrats contre ses achats en disponible. Du reste il y a limite à tout,
                        surtont quand tout le monde n'a pas encore fini avec ses difficultés
                        financières, témoin certains incidents, sans con séquences graves, dans le
                        règlement de la dernière liquidation et qui n'ont pu être tenus aussi
                        secrets qu'on l'aurait vouln.</p>
                    <p>Cette semaine on a inauguré les affaires sur Mai avea 11/16 de report sur
                        Mars, et comme il fallait s'y attendre, la spéculation n'a rien eu de plus
                        prossé que de se jeter sur cette échéance, pour laquelle elle n'a pas à
                        envisager l'éventualité d'une filière comme cela semble etre le cas pour
                        Novembre courant. Cette façon d'agir a eu pour effet de porter le report à
                        13/16 et de permettre à quelques négociants de consentir des transferts de
                        Novembre à Mai avec 2 1/4 tallaris. - C'est la rente habituelle que les
                        arbitragistes empochent au détriment de Ik spéculation qui ne veut pas voir
                        qu'à opérer dans ces conditions il n'y a que de l'argent à perdre, à moins
                        que des circonstances de l'autre monde ne viennent prodaire une hausse
                        formidable par la suite et suffisante pour offrir une compensation à ces
                        sacrifices et laisser en fin de compte un bénéfice quelconque à celui qui
                        court tous ces risques. C'est toat simplement absurde et ce n'est pas quand
                        le coton égyptien est tenu à 10 ou 11 tallaris au-dessus de l'américain que
                        l'on peut espérer de ces miracles !</p>
                    <p>Pour ce qui est de la filature, son abstention est toujours complete:
                        l'importance des exportations actuelles est d'ailleurs la meilleure preuve
                        que pour le moment elle est approvisionnée et qu'elle peut pour quelque
                        temps persisterdans a réserve.</p>
                    <p>Les nouvelles de l'intérieur au sujet de la récolte sont un peu
                        contradictoires, mais prenant l'enseinble des informations que l'on reçoit
                        de tous les côtés, le diable ne serait pas après tout si noir qu'on a voulu
                        le dire. Il est vrai que les idées de 7 1/4 et même de 7 mil. lions comme
                        minimum perdent du terrain, mais nous avons entendu dire par des personnes
                        on ne peut plus compétentes et à même d'être bien renseignéer, que ce serait
                        une profonde errenr que de croire à une récolte infe. rieure à 634.</p>
                    <p>Et puis comment veut-on on'une ricolte soit cléficitaire ni, avec des
                        arrivages par enn entravés et en retard de 15 ou de 20 jours, et avec une
                        pénurie d'argent qui ralentit les transactions à l'intérieur, les recettes
                        sont à ce jour de 110.000 cantarsupériears A cenx de l'ann'e paesde à la

                    <p>Nous donnons plus loin les détails de la dernière enchère des Domaines ; les
                        résultats ne sont pas aussi bons que ceux obtenus dans les ventes
                        précédentes, mais il paralt qu'en dehors de l'état du marché, il y a cette
                        fois une question de qualité qui doit entrer en ligne de compte à la
                        comparaison.</p>
                    <p>Les avis d'Amérique varient chaque jour, mais ni l'annonce d'une amélioration
                        sensible dans la situation financière, ni la nouvelle d'une tempête
                        sévissant à Galveston, ni la prétendue tendance à diminuer les estimations
                        de la récolte n'ont eu le don de provoquer une reprise durable. Par contre,
                        ce que l'on sait positivement, c'est que malgré le bon marché il n'y a aucun
                        engouement de la part de la consommation et que la grève des portefaix n'est
                        pas encore terminée. Ce dernier point explique du coup l'infériorité des in

                    <p>Notre marché da disponible est faible depuis quelques jours et la marehandise
                        continue à prendre de plus en plus le chemin des magasins des vendeurs. Pour

                        comme les nouvelles affaires font défaut et que rien ne presse s'il y a des
                        engagements pour des époques éloignées, ce ralentissement dans la demande
                        s'explique d'autant plus facilement que les banques ne sont pas si larges à
                        consentir de nouvelles Avances.</p>
                    <p>Pour ce qui est des prix il y a grande irré. gularité et tandis que certaines
                        qualités ont suivi les contrats, d'autres en ont différé et c'est
                        précisément ponr cela que les différences en moins pour la semaine dans la
                        cote officielle de ce matin vont de 1.8 à 1 tallari.</p>
                    <p>Les expéditions de la semaine ont été supé. rieures aux prévisions avec leur

                    <p>On prétend qu'on a anticipé certains ernbargnements et que la semaine
                        prochaine le cas sera le même, ce qui nous vandra pent-être une quantité

                        l'interruption des affaires à l'occasion du Bairam tombant jeudi prochain.
                        Du reste, il paralt avéré que les Banques pressent leurs clients d'expédier
                        un moment plus tôt et qn'à cause des nécessités de son trafic, plus d'un
                        exportateur envoie à Liverpool et à Manchester en dépôt contre avances par

                    <p>Liverpool a été peu actif pour les Egyptiens disponibles et sous le rapport
                        des prix, la cote se trouve réduite de 1/16 à 10 1/8. - Les futurs aussi ont

                    <p>LA SEMAINE La séance de lundi a été presque pulle. On criait beaucoup,
                        surtout les petites valeurs au rabais, mais les acheteurs faisaient défant.
                        L'attention était concentrée sur la National Bank, l'Agricole, l'United et
                        le Comptoir.</p>
                    <p>Le lendemain la corbeille a présenté l'aspect d'une séance d'été. Peu de
                        monde, la plupart assis ou dósceuvrés et quelques raros transactions en
                        titres secondaires, United Lands, Rita Hotels et Delta Land. Les valeurs
                        dirigeantes et en général toutes celles dépassant un certain prix ont été
                        négligées Bien que la plupart des agents se soient tenus sur ane predeute
                        réserve pour ne pas casser inutilement les cours en l'absence de toute
                        contre partie, il s'est produit cependant une dépression partielle,
                        provenant de l'insistance de quelques détenteurs tmp prenses de réaliser. La
                        baisse et l'inaction ont rainené la majeure partie des spéculateurs à me
                        plus joste notion de la réalité et ils avouent enfin que les affaires ne
                        vont pas. Il était temps de s'en apercevoir</p>
                    <p>Josques-là pourtant on n'avait ici que pen ressenti les effets de la crise
                        américaine ; mais les dépêches de Londres nons ayant transmis mercredi une

                        vaines recherches d'ailleurs, restées pour la plupart sans résultat. On a

                    <p>Hier enfin, bien que notre marché ait été loin d'être bon, il n'a cependant
                        pas été aussi mauvais dans l'ensemble que ne le faisait entrevoir la

                        que des acheteurs se soient présentés, mais simplement que las intéressés

                    <p>Aux ENCHERRA PUBLIQUES</p>
                    <p>Dans le courant de la semaine, il a été vendu aux enchères publiques 100

                    <p>LES PLUCTUATIONS DE LA COTE Il est bien évident qu'avec une allure dépri. mée
                        comme celle que nous avons eue les cours cont du fléchir. Sur une
                        soixantaine de valeurs inscrites à la cote officielle de notre bourse, 81
                        sont en baisse et 4 seglement en hausse, les autres demeurant stationnaires
                        aux prix anterieurs.</p>
                    <p>Disons tout de suite que les 4 titres phéno. mènes sont les Markets en gain
                        de 8 pence, l'Obligation nouvelle Crédit Poncier de i Irano, la Delta Land
                        de 1/32, et les Splendid Hotels de 1/16.</p>
                    <p>Parmi les titres en rétrogradation, on constate 3/4 de baisse en National
                        Bank, 1/2 en Alexandria Water, 5/8 en Deira, 8/4 en Be. héra, 1/2 en

                    <p>Sur tout le reste de la cote il n'y a pas de changement à signater. On voit
                        que si une cer taine catégorie de valeurs a été assez durement #prouvée,
                        l'ensemble a fait preave d'on sontien relatif. Il est vrai que certains
                        attribuent cette apparente fermeté a l'absence à peu près complete de
                        transactions ; dans ce cas la forte de préciation des seuls titres
                        immédiatement réalisables est tout-a-fait compréhensible.</p>

                        égyptiennek ent bel et bien nocasionnée par des offres provenant d'Egypte.
                        Ce sont donc bien les porteurs égyptiens goi jettent leurs paquets sur le
                        marché et il importe peu qu'ils vendent ici ou à Londres. Ce sont tonjours
                        enx qui déterminent la baisse.</p>
                    <p>LA SITUATION MONÉTAIT Les exportations d'or de la Banque d'Angleterre ont
                        sériensement ébranld sa réserve qui, à 39 7/8, se trouve diminuée de 7 3/8%.
                        C'est pentrêtre la plus forte secousse qu'elle ait reça cette année. Aussi,
                        après avoir longtemps hésité à mayınenter le taux de son escompte, espérant
                        toujours que les affaires s'arrangeraient en Amérique, elle a été obligée
                        hier A la suite de la crise de le porter d'un coup de 4 1/2</p>
                    <p>5 1/2 % pour défendre son etichisse. Et l'on s'est inême pas sûr qu'elle ne
                        doive pas l'arginenter encore prochainement : tout 86I pendra de l'allure
                        qne prendront les événements là New-York. La Banque d'Allemagne avait</p>
                    <p>déjà au début de la semaine élevé son taux de 15 à 8 1,2%</p>
                    <p>En ce qui concerne la crise américaine, bien qu'on ne puisse encore rien dire
                        de definitif à ce sujet, cependant il est arrivé ce qui arrive presque
                        toujours av lendemain d'une paniqne. De sang-froid on a constaté que la
                        situation, quoique d'une exceptionnelle gravité, n'était pas aussi
                        désespérée qu'on l'avait era tout d'abord L'intervention prompta et
                        énergique du Sporétaire du Trésor, ainsi que lle des milliardaires
                        américains, n'a pas été sans prodoire une certaine détente. Il n'empêche que
                        la crise existe toujours et que New-York anra sans doute besoin de beaucoup
                        de numéraire. C'est ce qui a porté la Banque d'Angleterre a augmenter son
                        taux d'escompte, comme nons venons de le dire.</p>
                    <p>loi la situation n'est pas changée ; la spécolation suit avec une inquiétude
                        bien naturelle les diverses pbases de la crise monétaire mondiale. De
                        l'issue de la lutte dépend en partie son avenir à elle. Elle n'a pas réussi
                        jusqu'à maintenant à se décharger de quantités considérables de son stock,
                        et si l'aggravation de la crise devait occasionner une accentuation notable
                        de la baisse, il est clair qu'elle se tronverait engagée dans de nouvelles
                        complications dont le résultat ne pent qne difficilement être prévu.</p>

                    <head>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</head>
                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which few
                        of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it were, of
                        the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its causes (for
                        they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the more prominent
                        being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness, depression of spirits
                        and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of life. Now, what alone is
                        absolutely essential in all such cases is increased vitality—vigour--</p>
                    <p>VITAL STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY</p>
                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night succeeds
                        the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the celebrated
                        life-reviving tonic</p>
                    <p>THERAPION No.3</p>
                    <p>than by any other known combination. So surely as it is taken in accordance with

                        "used up," and valueless. This wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and
                        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease or
                        derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative essence,
                        which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had preceded it for this
