                <div type="item"><head> THE THEATRE AT CAIRO.</head>
                    <p>Before writing this we happened to look at the August number of the ‘Revue d’Egypte et d’Orient,” and found on pages 352 and 353 a note on the coming season, the crowning glory in the brilliant existence of the Cercle Artistique. We will not repeat it here, but we will cite a few names mentioned—Tamagno, Caruso, Alvarez, Renaud, Boroi, Charlotte Wyns; Sammareo, Bellincioni, for opera ; for drama, Bartet, Rejane, Brand's, Guitry, pos¬sibly Sarah Bernhardt and Mounet Sully, An¬toine, Jean Coquelio, Le Bargy. Anyone can look up these names in the review in question. Whom have we had? Bellincioni for opera; for drama a week of Le Bargy, a week of the Lamberts, two performances of Coquelin,—and Moreno. And that is all. And what have we had? In opera, Asrael, a vulgar pantomime, Iris, Tannhaiiser completely travestied,Tosca, and Aida, of course; and in drama such stuff as Coeur de Moineau and La Closerie des Genets—all this done by a third-rate provincial troupe whose only two stars were far too dis<cb n="6"/> couraged to show their worth to any real extent. We are told that the reign of the Cercle is over, and that a new theatre is to be built. That is good news : we shall no longer have hurried selections made anyhow (with the exception of one or two performers chosen for individual reasons), and no more pieces which no one wants to see, even well done. We know our Cercle and have suffered much at their hands : they are indeed a Cercle en-¬closing in an unbroken ring all choice, and im-¬pervious to all public opinion, getting up exhibitions of pictures in which only a few bad French paintings are shown, to represent an International Fine Arts Exhibition. And we know our theatre at Cairo,—small, chilly, badly ventilated, with its interminable entr’-actes, and its crowd of apathetic abonnes, who annex every stall in the place long before the season begins, and who, daring the season, drown all the performance by ceaseless coughs, whispers, rustling, and shifting of feet.</p><p> They are not a large nor an important notion of Cairo : they have bought their seats as they might buy a frockcoat: a certain cachet, and veil of taste, gentility, and artistic propensities, enhanced by the chance of wearing evening dress, is obtained for the money. The few enlightened people who have boxes are an entire minority. Now that very minority—a few French and Italian and Syrian theatregoers, and very occasionally two or three of the English community, represents the real Cairo public for which the theatre should be open, that public who would go to good places in a good theatre, for good performances, but who will not go near the Khedivial Opera House except once in a way to a box. And that public is highly educated, musical, possessing more than one language, knowing books and plays and pictures, a public most of whom have heard the great plays and operas at Paris, London, and elsewhere : why then exclude them 1 We want a large theatre properly built, with not only stalls but some convenient circle where the abounds might be housed—they might have the seats there—and welcome. The stalls and boxes, except a very few, should be open to everyone: in a word it should be an attraction for this very resident public and for the Visitors. A ; good manager who knows that his “house” depends on his efforts would soon see that good pre- formances were given, and that people were not played with, and laughed at, treated with that cynical and financial contempt which we have had hitherto; the artistes would respond to a good audience instead of showing, as did Coquelin, and to a slight degree the Le Bargy troupe, that they are playing to the ignorant. The Cairo audience has been called cold : of course it is, this abound section which takes up so much place in the Cairo theatre, the Con¬tinental Bar, and such places. and so little if any—in the life and thought of European Cairo.</p><p> The state of affairs and the remedy is obvious to anyone who frequents the theatre. Everyone has paid, and so no one cares : the very few who do are not listened to. The whole at¬mosphere real as metaphorical of the theatre is now chilly, now stifling—apathy smiled on by cynicism. Of course we can net always hope for the great names we have quoted, but we can always have some: and the troupe in general can be better selected, as also some conductor whose sole interests are not brass and crashing effects out of place,—as also a chorus with some sort of voice and volume, not to mention time. At present the average night is like, let us say, an "off-night” at Malta, if as good : and in the Valetta Theatre you pay eighteenpence , or at most two or three shillings, for a stall. Let us hope that the change is really going to take place that we are going to have what we want, and that-the 1905-6 season is the last inglorious flicker of what can we call it but pre artistic Cairo. Let the financiers return to their stocks and shares, and the abounds to their bars, and leave the management open for those who will devote themselves to pleasing Cairo, and the theatre to those who are only too ready to be pleased, who can appreciate and applaud whatever is really worthy of their attention. </p>

                <p>A SUCCESSFUL COMPANY.</p>
                <p>NEXT YEAR’S PROSPECTS.</p>
                <p>The first annual report of the above com¬pany, which appeared in our columns yesterday, will have been pleasant reading to the many shareholders of this very successful enterprise. Seldom in any country, and hardly ever in Egypt, has a board of directors been enabled to show such splendid results for the first year of a company’s existence. This is all the more remarkable when one considers that, the working period has only been for about nine months, and that the company has only had full use of the total issued capital during six months.
                </p><p>The dividend on the ordinary shares is at the rate of 20% per annum, free of income tax, or l/ in the £ and the large sum of £102,090. 12.10 has been placed to reserve. Besides this, the whole of the preliminary expenses, amounting to £23,98.14.8, are written off, and a balance profit of £9,189 11.7 is carried forward into the newyear. Doubtless the Chairman at the first annual meeting, which will be held in London on the 11th inst., will give some further information of an interesting nature to the shareholders, but the above figures already speak for themselves with much force, notwithstanding what he may yet have to say
                </p><p>It is known that the company own large and valuable agricultural estates, besides several building lands, bought at considerably below present values, and these, coupled with the conservative policy of placing the above sum of £102.090. 2.10 to the reserve fund, entitle the Egyptian Estates to rank with the premier companies in this country.
                </p><p>In most cases the success of a company is the work of one individual and the Egyptian Estates, Limited, is no exception to the role. Mr. Montagu Summers, the managing director and founder of the company, has displayed remarkable ability in the conduct of the com-pany’s affairs, as the balance-sheet proves, and the ungrudging way in which he has worked for the benefit of the general body of shareholders has presented to us an object- lesson on the conduct of public companies in this country. His efforts have at the same time been well backed up by the very able members of the advisory board in Egypt.
                </p><p>Although the first year has been so successful, we are informed that there is every sign that the coming year will be even more so. The company begins its new year free of all preliminary expenses, which is quite exceptional, and with a profit of £9 189.11.7 in hand. Considerable profits on building lands, of which only a part were taken into last year's accounts, are due in the coming 12 months, and the agricultural estates will also have a full twelve months’ working, which will materially enhance the profits in the next balance sheet.

                    <p>PRINCE AT SAKKARAH.</p>
                    <p>THE PROGRESS OF ROYALTY.</p>
                    <p>Bedreshein, Sunday.</p>
                    <p>The usually somnolent village of Bedreshein, which is the station for Sakkara (refer to Baedaecker), is in a great state of excitement over the approaching visit of the Royal tra-vellers, who are timed to arrive there at ten o’clock tomorrow, Inshallah! Inter alia the venerable Sheikh of Bedreshein, Mohamed Dodo, has prepared according to his humble estimation a worthy reception, consisting of Bedouin flags and banners draped across the hamlet's most noble thoroughfare. Mohamed is the proud owner of sixty donkeys and donkey-boys, and these have also been decked out for the auspicious occasion.
                    </p><p>With all due acknowledgments for the kindly intention, his Royal Highness will be wise in preferring the more comfortable locomotion of the Khedive’s brougham, which his Highness has graciously placed at the disposal of his Royal guests. In this vehicle, by the bye, the distinguished travellers will drive to the Tombs of Sakkara. The progress of Princes acts as a healthy stimulus to national life. Potemkin built villages along the route followed by Catherine of Russia ; Kaiser William’s visit extended very considerably the system of com- munications of the Ottoman metropolis ; H.I.M. the Sultan proceeds once a year to Stamboul by way of a sanded road. So, too, at Sakkara. a carriageable route, formed of Nilotic mud, crosses the smiling grass lands between the palm-groves of Bedreshein and the edge of the Lybian wilderness.
                    </p><p>In the scant shade of this magnificent grove lie the rains of the Temple of Phta, the Sun-God, a picturesque grouping of columns and Egyptian capitols, scattered around a silent pool. Beyond this, and similarly protected from the tense rays of the real god of day, is the statue of Rameses II, on whom be peace. It is of gigantic proportions but withal has nothing of awful majesty about it—indeed the sculptor has given to the Royal lips an expression of beautiful benevolence. When the writer arrived, he found the custodians busily engaged in washing his Egyptian greatness with a plentiful supply of soap and water !
                    </p><p>The desert route is lined with stones, and is regularly patrolled by Egyptian police. The Matson Marietta has also been fitted out for the nonce and in one of the rooms looking out on to the desert a table has been daintily pre¬pared on which two glasses and as many napkins stand conspicuous. This, however, was a sacri¬-legious peep through a crack in the partition. Also we may note that a wag has added to the Osirian inscriptions on the Tomb of Mira the more popular one of “God bless the Prince of Wales.”	XENOS.
                    </p><p>The Prince and Princess of Wales paid a visit to Sakkarah yesterday. T.R.H. left Abdeen Palace at 8.25 a.m. for Cairo station, whence they proceeded at 8.40 by special train to Bedreshein, arriving there at 9.10 a.m. The journey to Sakkarah was accomplished by 11 a.m. and after visiting the Temple and the Serapeum, the Royal party lambed at Mariette’s House. Leaving Sakkarah about 8 p.m. their Royal Highnesses reached Cairo at 6 o’clock, having travelled from Bedreshein on board H.H. the Khedive's yacht Tehel el Bahrein.

Prince Fuad, Lord and Lady Cromer and the members of the Corps Diplomatique, the Ministers, Advisers, heads of Departments, and Under Secretaries of State were present, with numerous members of H.H the Khedive’s civil and military household.
                    </p><p>NATIVE APPRECIATION</p>
                    <p>"Al Zaher” says : -</p>
                    <p>The Kings of England have a very good custom of sending their Heirs Apparent to visit the colonies, which they are one day de-tined to role over. These visits are not only useful for the Government hot for the Princes themselves. The Prince and Princess of Wales are now on a visit to Egypt, which welcomes them and receives them with great joy and with as much cordiality as was our own Khedive received at Windsor Castle. Now on this matter we have a word to say to some native cavillers, whose gossiping must cease. Some people appear to think that this official visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales to Egypt is equivalent to an acknowledgment that in the opinion of England this country is a British colony. They argue that the pro¬gramme of the arrangements made for the visit of the Prince aid Princess show that the official festivities in Egypt will be quite as elaborate as they were in India. They declare that we Egyptians are, just as though we were Skilluks from the Sudan, to be decked up to please the royal guests, for a joust with old rifles and holding Arab sports of an anti¬quated fashion. Where are Amrhibn-el-Aassi and his heroes, where i- Khalid ih el-Wel eed and Tarik ibn Zyad ? What would there say when they saw how the world was now-a days and how poor a figure their descendants now out! To these and all such cavillings we make the following reply :—
                    </p><p>The visit of our Royal guests is of great use to Egypt. They will see with their own eyes how prosperous and peaceable is the state of our land and thus they may take measures on their return home to induce the high Govern¬ment authorities to bestow on Egypt the in¬dependence which she deserves.

                    <p>A PILOT’S EXPLOITS.</p>
                    <p>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.)</p>
                    <p>Port Said, Monday.</p>
                    <p>The leviathan S.S. Quiloa, the second of four new British India steamers of the same type, recently built for their coast service, arrived here on Friday. One of our brilliant examples of seamanship, a Greek pilot, board-ed her at once and proceeded, much to the amusement of the numerous onlookers, to run over two buoys, one of which was 17 feet high and was surmounted by a gas lamp and gallery. After some ‘ little incidents,” which he informed the captain were "No-ding Sare” (Anglice "Nothing sir”) he sent two enor¬-mous lines to a mooring buoy on the wrong side of the harbour and went ahead in such a manner that these had to be left OD the buoy and recovered afterwards. The process of bringing the ship in, etc., occupied four and a half hours,— a record performance, the ship being eventually fast at half-past two p.m.
                    </p><p>The Quiloa is a turret ship of the latest type, carrying 12,500 tons cargo and displacing 16,700 tons. She has a length of 478 feet and a huge beam of 50 feet, which measurements make her quite the largest ship to go through the Canal. She steams 11 knots and is intended for service between Bombay and Calcutta. She went through the Canal in 29 hours, of which three were taken up in being tied up to permit the passage of other ships.
                    </p><p>The S.S. Chatham.
                    </p><p>Two days ago a telegram arrived, "Passage round Chatham dear,” and ships passed the spot with ease. To-day, evidently, other pieces of broken hall have been discovered, for the passage has been stopped for a few hours until such time as the channel can be re- buoyed, as was the case form«rly. No actual reliable information can be gathered as to the state of things at Kil 10, but it is antici¬pated that the Canal will be absolutely clear of all signs of wreckage of this somewhat interesting ship by the end of April. Consi¬derable dredging has to be done, but the greater part of the mass of twisted and broken ironwork has been removed When down at the spot a fur days ago I saw on the eastern bank no less a quantity of broken plates and frame* than 8'H) tons. This, coupled with the 700 tens odd now in Port Said, should pretty nearly represent the whole of the hall.
                    </p>
                    <p>Dinner to the Governor.</p>
                    <p>Last Saturday the elite of Port Said gave a farewell banquet to H.E. the Governor at the Eastern Exchange. Over 70 sat down to dinner, including all the Consuls. After dinner speeches were made by the British and Greek Consuls, the Slub Governor, and others. His Excellency, in replying, said that it grieved him very much to leave all his friends here, and added that he would remember their friendship as long as he lived. During dinner a band played.
                    </p><p>THE HOLY CARPET.</p>
                    <p>(PROM OUR CORRESPONDENT).</p>
                    <p>Suez Monday.</p>
                    <p>Early this morning a salute of guns announ-ced the arrival of the Holy Carpet by the S.S. Rehmanieh from Tor.
                    </p><p>In the afternoon the usual procession through the principal streets of the town took place, the route being decorated with flags. The escort of the Mahmal in-cluded Mounted Police, Infantry, and Mountain Artillery.
                    </p><p>The Mahmal leaves by special train for Cairo to-night.</p>
                    <p>The Holy Carpet and its escort left Tor for Suez on Sunday. The festival of the return of the Holy Carpet will take place in Cairo pro¬bably on Saturday next. H. H. the Khedive will preside at the ceremony and the Ministries and State Departments will be closed.
                    </p><p>ARCHDEACONRY OF THE CHURCH
                    OF ENGLAND IN SYRIA.</p>
                    <p>The Venerable Archdeacon Frere has accept¬ed the offer of preferment in England in the diocese of Gloucester, and will vacate the archdeaconry and the chaplaincy of Beyront early in the summer. The Bishop in Jerusalem has offered the archdeaconry and also the chaplaincy of Beyront to the Rev. Canon Strange, who has held the chaplaincy at Port Said since 1882. Canon Strange has been a most diligent and earnest chaplain in this difficult post. He built the station church. He was nominated by the Bishop to an honorary canonry in St. George’- Church in 1901.
                    </p><p>Canon Strange will take time to consider his acceptance of the offer now made to him. There can be no doubt of his suitableness for it.
                    </p><p>FLOREAT DAMANHOUR.</p>
                    <p>The inhabitants of Damanhour have been eager for the Government to endow their town with a municipal regime of a similar character to those at Mansourah and Medinet el-Fayoum, and it has been therefore decided to establish a mixed local Commission of eleven members in that town. The members will be the Moudir of the Behera province (chairman), the inspector of the Western Towns and State Buildings or his delegate, and the sanitary inspector of the province or his substitute. These persons will be members in right of their position. The remainder wall consist of four European and (oar native members chosen by the electorate.

                        <p>The Egyptian weather is undoubtedly gaining an evil reputation.

Certainly we have had unusual weather-sudden changes from hot to cold, from dry to wet. A gale blew last night and con-tinues til this morning, when rain fell and threatended to con-tinue throughout the day. The glass shows a tendency to rise.</p>

                    <p>ANOTHER ACCOUNT.</p>
                    <p>(BY OUR LADY CORRESPONDENT).</p>
                    <p>All Cairo tamed out en masse to witness the great Military Tournament at Abbassieh on Friday, which was also honoured by the pre-sence of H. H. the Khedive and T. R. H. the Prince and Princess of Wales. A long pro¬cession of carriages followed the interminable Sharia Abbas to the huge parade-ground, round which fluttered innumerable flags and which was surrounded by a seething crowd of people of all nationalities. Gaily-decorated archways at either end of the ground led on to a broad drive of sand for the use of the illustrious guests, the more lowly visitors finding 'heir way to the back of the ground, where admit¬tance was gained by the production of invita¬tion cards. The sumptuous tent and enclosure of honour erected opposite the centre of the ground divided the gay European crowd on one side from the ranks of the tarbooshed on the other, and the number of fashionable people among the former showed that Cairo is still far from being emptied. A grateful wind tem¬pered the high sun, though the latter neces sitated such a display of sunshades that it was impossible to follow what was happening on the ground unless luck gave one a seat in the first row or the chance of standing on one in the background.
                    </p><p>H.H. the Khedive drove on to the ground preceded by his Body Guard soon after 8.30 and some quarter of an hour later the band struck up our national anthem and the Prince of Wales appeared upon the scene. The Prin¬cess of Wales, who had spent the earlier part of the afternoon with the Khedival at Koub- beh, did not arrive till nearly 4.80, when tea was served, and after which she presented the prizes to the victorious individuals and teams. The Princess, who never has looked better than she does at the present was wearing white of some soft filmy description, and many others were favouring this ever-popular hot-weather colour.
                    </p><p>There was a plethora of pretty frocks, per haps none so cool and fresh-looking as those pure white tinons with insertions of coarse lace and embroidery. The young girls were radiant in their dainty muslins, and many a new hat, was giving satisfaction to its fair wearer. There was not sufficient time to take in both tourna¬ment and onlookers, and we fancy the human element gained most of the attention. We noticed Mrs. Huteson in a smart skirt with a lace blouse and one of the small brimmed hats she so much affects, and the youngest Miss Hurley was also wearing a small brimmed hat of much the same calibre which suited her to per-fection. Mrs. Wynne is always lucky in her head-gear and never more so than on this occasion, when she was wearing a straight wide-brimmed fawn straw very much banked up at the back with ruchings of tulle and adorned with a few Urge roses. Miss York was wearing a very dainty costume of soft grey, a grey mushroom hat giving her a delight¬fully old-fashioned air. Mrs. 8oott-Dalglei-h was in a cool muslin with some suspicion of mauve both about her dress and hat, and Miss Whittaker had also chosen mauve colouring for her pretty muslin. Mrs. Bayley, who is always original in her toilettes, was wearing a curious little green silk cape with a thin cloth skirt of the same colour. Mrs. George Royle was in violet with a touch of blue at the waist, and though on paper the colours do not seem on friendly terms the combination of them was quite attractive. There wire many other pretty toilettes, but space forbids their men¬tion.
                    </p><p>As for the tournament, as before remark d there was but little time to watch it. V/8 caught glimpses of deadly little guns on their carriages being rattled round the course at a tremendous gallop, and the wrestling on bare backed horses by swarthy riders was most exciting. So, too was the tent pegging by squads, the men all showing great dexterity and wonderful finish. There were some ex-cellent boats of fearing and also sword and bayonet work, but the latter took place too far off to watch with any satisfaction. Hence we confined our attention to things nearer at hand, not forgetting the attractions offered by the tea tent, which were appreciated to the fall by one and all. It was a most successful after-noon and came to a most successful conclusion with the presentation of prizes by our own gracious Princess, who wins the people’s hearts wherever she appears.

                    <p>THE FRONTIER QUESTION.</p>
                    <p>In the course of a letter to the editor of the 1 Tribune” on the Akaba question, Mr. Wilfrid Blurt remarks : —
                    </p><p>"The question in dispute is a serious one, but one we have brought upon ourselves by a long course of gratuitions meddling. At present it largely occupies the native mind at Cairo. The creation of a strong Turkish military sta¬tion, within striking distance of Suez - for the pilgrim road is a hard gravel easily traversed by artillery - appeals to the imagination of the many dissatisfied with English rule, and native hopes have been raised that at last the Sultan means to intervene.
                    </p><p>A PJea tor an Agreement.</p>
                    <p>I do not myself believe any such design to be within the Sultan's view, nor, even if it were, do I see in what way our Government could practically resent it It is clear that we cannot go to war with Turkey on so frivolous a pretext as the prevention of an improve-ment in one of the Ottoman seaports or the exact interpretation of a Firman affecting a few miles of occupied desert which are as likely the Sultan's as oars or the Khedive’s. Nor, again, can we prevent by force his garrisoning the station as he pleases. 8till less do I see what we practically could do through our military position in Egypt. We might indeed, bombard the fort of Akabah, hot it is very doubtful if we could dislodge the Ottoman troops already in possession and entrenched inland. What I do see, however, very plainly in the matter—and it is my original pleading—is that we shall come to terms quickly on all these disputes with the Sultan by an honest statement that we mean to meddle no more with his Arabian affaire. It will be well for me, too, if we could condescend to regularize with him our position in Egypt, at present wholly irregular.”
                    </p><p>In a second communication Mr. Blunt com¬plain" of the attitude of the home Press with regard to the situation, which he described as a real danger. "It reminds me,” he remark", "precisely of the days before the bombardment of Alexandria in 1882, when the then Liberal Cabinet, led on by Lords Granville and Northbrook, with Mr. Chambar'ain, was pre¬paring for the b'oody plunge whioh proved their min The Tory Press was olamonring then, as now for armed intervention, and the "Daily News” and the rest of the Liberal Press were dumb —dumb till it was all too late.
                    </p><p>"1 trust, therefore, that you (the "Tribune”) will con Tone your protest against violent measures, and I trust, too, that some members of the Radical section of the party will closely question Sir Edward Grey as to the whole affair and press at once for papers.
                    </p><p>“As a postscript to my letter printed on Saturday I may add that I know the whole locality of Akabah personally, having visited it thirty years ago. At that time there was certainly no such inhabited place as Tabab, nor was the island of Faraoun inhabited. I feel quite certain now that Tabah has never been an Egyptian village, or has ever been under Egyptian authority in any form. Its name, which is probably identical with the Turkish Tabia, a fort, suggests that it has bean recently put up by the Turkish garrison from Akabah, as showing their right to the Gulf head. There is a tradition that the island of Faraoun was once occupied by the Crusa¬-ders, but Akabah, even in the days of Solomon, can never have been more than a seaport, standing, as it does, in a dear country quite uncultivable through lack of water. There are no remains, as far as I remember, of any buildings outside the Akabah fort of ancient dale.
                    </p><p>Who the Wirepuller ?</p>
                    <p>The “Globe” says:-</p>
                    <p>It is reported by the “Daily Telegraph’s” representative at Constantinople that German diplomacy holds strictly aloof from the bound¬ary dispute between Turkey and Egypt. But if that be the case, the inevitable question presents itself who is the subterranean mani¬pulator of Yildiz Kiosk? The Sultan, astute and wily statesman as he undoubtedly is, would never defy Egypt’s Western protector— for that is what it comes to—unless he was encouraged to do so by promises of support from one quarter or another. To hazard such a perilous venture as that Abdul Humid would need to have lost, to a lunatic degree, all sense of proportion. Then, what European ruler can it be who secretly instigates the Grand Turk to essay that insane.fiat? That is a riddle beyond the power of an Eclipus to solve; as matters stand, it certainly would appear that either the Kaisar must be trying to bring off another Morocco coup, to lower both British and French prestige or that there is no one operating behind the scenes. Happily in either instance, the proper course to be followed by England is too plainly marked even for Radical perversity to mistake. This country is pledged up to the hilt to uphold all Egyptian interests, whether purely political or territorial, by force of arms, if necessary. We frankly accepted that responsibility when Mr. Gladstone ordered the bombardment of Alex¬andria and the overthrow of Arabi Pacha’s usurped power. British contact became still more direct and binding when France voluntarily surrendered her political position on the Nile by executing the Anglo-French Agree¬ment. And it was the same diplomatic compact that sought to strengthen French authority in Morocco, that being the chief make weight for the recognition of British control on the Nile.

                    <p>FRESH LIGHT ON FASHODA.</p>
                    <p>M. Etienne Lamy, the eminent academi¬-cian, who conducts " Le Correspondent,” has just republished under the title "The Lesson of a Century,” the complete collection of his historic studies on France’s role in Egypt—its greatness, its decline, and its fall.
                    </p><p>The last of the articles, which appeared a few days ago, was devoted entirely to the Congo-Nile Mission, and gave several pre-viously unpublished details of great interest with respect to the Fashoda affair.
                    </p><p>M. Lamy proceeds to tell how Marchand conceived the Fashoda plan. In doing so he pictures Marchand’s keen penetration with regard to England’s policy in Africa. Marchand not only saw that England had begun to connect the Cape and Cairo, but also that, she was preparing for the other great effort, which would create a junction between her East African possessions and those of the Niger.
                    </p><p>If this immense English cross” was traced on the map of Africa, the Continent would be carved up into four sections, the com-munications between which could be opened or shut at England’s will.
                    </p><p>England would thus "become mistress of what she seemed to leave to others” and no interests were more menaced than those of France. Marchand’s solution of the problem shortly was: Fashoda was the key of the situation. Here the two arms of the "cross" intersected. Take this, and the cross was severed with a single stroke. In case England preferred to pay rather than to fight for its Cape-Cairo domination, large concessions in Eastern Africa might be wrested from it.
                    </p><p>After prolonged persuasion Marchand suc¬ceeded (in June. 1896) in bringing the French Government around to his way of thinking and left for Fashoda, with the command not to make known, before his end was achieved, his true role as ‘Chief of the Congo Nile Mission.”
                    </p><p>The difficulties that the expedition had to encounter are dealt with at length, Marchand’s progress being traced down to his arrival in Fashoda, where he found "the ruins of a popu¬lation in the ruins of a city.” Marchand had conquered nature; now began the struggle against man. "L’Eclair,” which publishes the remarkable story of the former to-day, will produce to-morrow what it describes as the most tragic part of M. Etienne Larey’s memorable study—that of the Anglo-French conflict, em- barrassed by the pusillanimity of Delcesse, and, thanks to his lack of discernment, brought to an end so unprofitably for France.”
                    </p><p>GORDON MEMORIAL MISSION.</p>
                    <p>An encouraging message has been received in London from the headquarters of the above mission at Bor, on the Upper Nile. The letter says, respecting the journey to Bor : ‘We had a most interesting journey, and at a distance if only eleven miles inland found a chain if immense villages stretching northwards - so they assured us—for 250 miles to Tar. This vast inland plateau was absolutely free from mosquitoes at night, so that for the first time for many days we need no mosquito nets. The people were everywhere most friendly.’
                    </p><p>The missionaries were accompanied by Archdeacon Gwynne.</p>
                    <p>The advantage of a station at Bor is that the workers are in direct contact with the Dinkas, a tribe numbering about two millions.
                    </p><p>CYPRUS MAIL SERVICE.</p>
                    <p>A Nicosia correspondent writes :</p>
                    <p>"Cyprus has been deprivedfor somn weeks of a regular mail service. Few here believed that such a thing would be allowed actually to come to pass, and even when the blow fell the inhabitants refused to believe that this isola¬tion would be other than of very short dura-tion. Consternation has now given way to a fueling of bewilderment and reluctant resigna-¬tion and merchants and others whose business is with foreign parts are suffering by reason of the uncertainty and delay in correspondence and means of transport which the cessation of the mail contract implies. The invariable testimony of impartial and competent persons who have from time to time visited the Island is that Cyprus possesses exceptional possibili¬ties of development. There is an unvarying expression of opinion that with capital and proper means of transport the island might again become what it formerly was, the granary and the garden of the East, and within the last few years a good trade with Egypt and European  countries has grown up. The isola-tion now imposed upon Cyprus can scarcely fail to check her powers of expansion and cause a most unfortunate shrinkage in her trade. It is earnestly to be hoped that a remedy for this pitiable state of things will soon be found."
