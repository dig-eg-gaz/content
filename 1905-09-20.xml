                    <head>THE CONGO.</head>

                    <p>The Congo supplement of the "West African Mail" for September contains some
                        interesting extracts from the report of Captain Baccari of the Royal Italian
                        Navy on the administration of the Congo. We do not propose to discuss the
                        question whether the Congo State Government is cognisant of the atrocities
                        which have been committed by some of its European and many of its native
                        agents, but will confine ourselves to giving a summary. of Capt. Baccari's
                        views on the colonisation of the Kivu-Rasizi district, and the economic
                        shortcomings of the state to which the Italian officer refers. The Free
                        State Government having suggested that the Kivu country might with advantage
                        be colonised by Italians, and having attempted to persuade white emigrants
                        to settle there, Captain Baccari describes the routes which the would-be
                        colonist must follow to reach this new El Dorado. Like the hero of the
                        "Pilgrim’s Progress” he will be confronted by every species of opposition if
                        he travels from Boma or Mombasa. The Boma route is the worst, involving from
                        93 to 108 days of continuous travel through districts where the majority of
                        emigrants would be exposed to attack from every species of malarial fever,
                        not to mention dysentery and sleeping sickness. The survivors would be fit
                        for nothing but a long stay in hospital, and as the promised land contains
                        only one doctor, who would be obliged to travel on foot over a district as
                        large as Belgium, their chances of obtaining medical cure and aid are by no
                        means promising. Much of the Mombasa route is dangerous, and even if there
                        was rapid communication with the Kivu country, it is extremely doubtful if
                        the European settlers would thrive, much less increase there. A white man
                        cannot devote himself to manual labour, and as the blacks are being
                        exterminated by two forms of sleeping sickness, one of which more especially
                        affects the negro, and the other, the authorities at Brussels, it would be
                        most difficult for the settlers to find any labour. Nor would the Italian
                        farmer, in Kivu or Ruga-Roga or any other pestilential and unpronounceable
                        locality under the equator, have even the dubious satisfaction of knowing
                        that while he was losing his health he was making an income, seeing that the
                        export of onions or bananas enclosed in soldered tin boxes of 25
                        kilogrammes, carried for hundreds of miles by porters is likely to pay no
                        one. Experiments in the crossing of zebras and horses, or in the
                        introduction of asses and mules to assist the Congolese officials in the
                        task of transport, may solve the problem,but the climatic dangers cannot be
                        met by any but millionaire colonists, who are always ran, and, if the
                        experience of the South American Republics may hie taken as a guide, have a
                        disappointing way of returning after a brief stay in their new homes, to
                        reside in state directed establishments. Future Galleys and Jabez Baltours
                        may seek Kivu and Ruzizi, but if farmers are really being called upon to
                        settle in these horrid regions, we can only imagine that some official,
                        whose brain has suffered from too long a residence in the tropics, is
                        attempting a cruel practical joke. </p>

                            Mansonr of Shou-brabola, near Santa, has been found buried in a cotton
                            field. The lad, who was only twelve years of age, had been missing from
                            his home for three days, and the grief of the parents, at finding that
                            the child has been the victim of foul play, is great. The police are
                            making every effort to find some trace of the criminal, but up to the
                            present they have met with no success. </p>

                            Monday was noted for the début of M. Gaspard and Mlle. Néva, who
                            sustained the reputation which they have brought with them from other
                            countries. These artistes sing duets of a light vein in an attractive
                            manner, and introduce a good deal of dancing, of which art both are good
                            exponents. Mlle Néva has a pleasing voice, and is a very sprightly
                            dancer, and M. Gaspard is an excellent humourist. The items provided by
                            these duettists, added to the rest of the programme, constitute a good
                            all-round evening’s entertainment. </p>

                            the British Chamber of Commerce of Egypt, which was formed in 1896 with
                            the sole object of assisting British trade in this country. The services
                            of the Chamber are always at the disposal of any member desiring
                            information on trade matters generally, including the question of
                            appointing suitable agents. As no fee is charged for such advice, it is
                            obviously in the interests of all British traders here to become
                            members, especially when it is remembered that the annual subscription
                            is merely the nominal one of £1. The latter payment also includes a copy

                    <head>THE SUCRERIES. THE CONCORDAT PREVENTIF.</head>
                    <p>The application of the Sucreries and Raffinerie d’Egypte to be allowed the
                        benefit of the concordat ’préventif came before the Commercial Chamber of
                        the Cairo Mixed Court yesterday morning. The court was naturally full, the
                        Cairo Bar and Press being well represented. The Court was composed of Mr.
                        Somerville Tuck, presiding Judge, Messrs. Rassim Bey, Boustros, Montan, and
                        Coghlan, Judges, M. Beer and Hussein Effendi Gallal, assessing Judges, Maher
                        Bay, substitute, and M. Zigliara, greffier. After eight unimportant
                        bankruptcy oases had been disposed of, Maître Carton de Wiart rose to plead
                        that the Sucreries Company should be allowed the benefit of the concordat
                        préventif. After recounting the origin of the company and describing its
                        development, he pointed out that the feeling of the creditors was all in
                        favour of the granting of the concordat as the beet solation for themselves
                        and for the company. He cited numerous authorities in support of his
                        contention that a joint-stock company can demand the application of the
                        concordat and that its directors are at fall liberty to state the balance
                        without calling any general meeting of shareholders. As to the question
                        whether the company was in debt, all depended on the question whether it was
                        to be held responsible for the agreements entered into by the late M.
                        Cronier in its name. If so, it was in debt without question, but not
                        otherwise. </p>
                    <p>Then came the question of the good faith of the directors. There was no
                        reason to doubt it, for they, like the rest of the world had entire
                        confidence in the agreement made by the firm Henri Say to guarantee the sums
                        for bills discounted. In previous balance sheets the bills accepted by the
                        company were balanced by the say guarantees and these balance sheets had
                        been unanimously approved by the shareholders. Under these circumstances the
                        conduct of the directors could not be impugned. </p>
                    <p>Turning to the interests involved, the speaker called the attention of the
                        court to the disastrous results that would follow a declaration of
                        bankruptcy. The agricultural population of a large tract of Upper Egypt, and
                        the employé of the company would suffer terribly and their losses would
                        react most injuriously opon the general prosperity of Egypt. </p>
                    <p>Should the directors be found to have acted in a manner unauthorised by the
                        statutes of the company, proceedings might be taken against them in, the
                        future, bat this was not a question for the moment. A provisional
                        arrangement was required in the interests both of the company and its
                        creditors. The names of Sir Elwin Palmer, Harari Pasha and M. Debourg, the
                        proposed administrator under the concordat, were a good guarantee of a
                        successful solution. </p>
                    <p>The speech ended a few minutes before 11 a.m. and Maher Bey rose to speak on
                        behalf of the court. He was also in favour of the application of the
                        concordat, but reserved the right, after the examination of the company's
                        books and the expert’s report thereon, to demand that the company should be
                        wound up and its directors—if necessary—prosecuted. The court then retired
                        to deliberate, leaving the audience to discuss the situation and to
                        congratulate Maître Carton de Wiart on his admirable speech. At 12.55 a.m.
                        the court returned and the judgment was read granting the concordat
                        Preventif. It ran as follows : </p>
                    <p>“ Le ministère public entendu, nomme M. Tuck, président de la Chambre, jage
                        commissaire à l’effet de procéder aux opérations édictées par la loi en
                        conformité des dispositions de l’article206 (nouveaucode), dépens réservés;
                        ordonne à la Société des Sucreries d'avoir dans les huit jours du prononcé
                        du présent jugement à déposer au greffe ses livres et pièces comptables. " </p>
                    <p>The general impression in the audience was one of unalloyed satisfaction. It
                        was felt on all sides' that the granting of the concordat was the only
                        possible solution of the present crisis that would satisfy creditors and
                        shareholders and stave off a disastrous crash. Maître Helou who appeared as
                        counsel for a group of Alexandrian shareholders declined to speak, after the
                        remarks made by Maher Bey with whom he entirely agreed, and the bar was
                        obviously under the impression that the only course that could reconcile a
                        number of conflicting individual interests had been followed by the court. </p>
                    <p>(By Telephone).</p>
                    <p>To-day by the order of Judge Somerville Tuck the Sucreries were authorised to
                        continue their business, bat under the control of Sir E Palmer, Harari Pasha
                        and M. Eugène Debourg. The meeting of creditors will take place on October 4
                        at 10 a.m. under the presidency of Judge Took, at the Mixed Tribunals,
                        Cairo. </p>

                            Medinet el Fayoum's history. Both visitors and those who were
                            exhibiting, expressed themselves as greatly pleased with the
                            arrangements which were made and the organising committee is to be
                            highly congratulated upon the success with which their efforts have met.
                            Daring the three days of the exhibition the whole town was "en fête”,
                            and bands of music were greatly in evidence. There were also two
                            fashionable native weddings, which added to the festivities, especially
                            that of Gofar Pasha, son of the ex-Governor of the Sudan. The Princes
                            visited the house of Tobla Bay, a member of the Legislative Council, and
                            they took afternoon tea with Khalid Bey yesterday. Amongst the most

                    <p>London, September 19. The writer George Macdonald, LL.D. is dead. (Reuter)
                        George Macdonald, the celebrated poet and author has passed away at the ripe
                        age of 81. Of late years his name has not been very prominent in the
                        literary world, and living abroad, he only paid annual visits to England.
                        Daring the latter half of the last century he was, however, a power in the
                        land, and such books of his as the "Annals of a Quiet Neighbourhood,” “Guild
                        Court,” “Robert Falconer,” and others were highly appreciated, especially by
                        those in sympathy with his advanced theological views. As a poet he ranked
                        high in the public estimation, and his occasional appearances in the pulpit
                        always drew large congregations. Dr Macdonald was born at Huntly,
                        Aberdeenshire, in 1824, and was educated at the parish school there, and at
                        King’s College and University, Aberdeen. After taking his degree he became a
                        student for the ministry at the Independent College, Highbury, London, and
                        was for a short time an Independent minister, bat soon retired, became a lay
                        member of the Church of England, and settled in London to pursue a literary
                        career. His first work was "Within and Without, a Dramatic Poem,” 1856 ;
                        followed by "Poems,” 1857 ; "Phantasies, a Faerie Romance,” 1858; “David
                        Elginbrod,” 1862; "Adela Cathcart,” 1864; •The Portent, a Story of Second
                        Sight,” 1864 ; “Alec Forbes of Howglen,” 1865 ; "Annals of a Quiet
                        Neighbourhood,” 1866; “Guild Court,” 1865; The Disciple and other Poems,”

                        Cumbermede,” 1871; 'The Vicar's Daughter,” "Malcolm,” 1874; "St. George and
                        St. Michael” 1875; "Thomas Wingfield, Curate,” 1876 ; "The Marquis of
                        Lossie,” 1877. "Sir Gibbie,” 1879; "The Diary of an Old Soul ”1880; "Castle
                        Warlock,” 1882; "Weigh-ed and Wanting,” 1882 ; "The wise woman,” 1888;
                        "There and Baok,” 1891; "Heather and Snow,” 1893 ; "Lilith,” 1895 ; "Salted
                        with Fire,” 1897; "Rampolli,” 1897. Besides these Dr. Macdonald has written
                        books for the young : "Dealings with the Fairies,'' 1867 ; Ranald
                        Bannerman’s Boyhood,” 1869 ; "The Princess and the Goblin,” 1871 ; “At the
                        Back of the North Wind,” 1870 ; and others. He is also the author of
                        "Unspoken Sermons,” 1866 ; and a treatise on the "Miracles of our Lord,”
                        1870. In 1877 he received a Civil List pension of £100, in consideration of
                        his contributions to literature. Among his well-known works should be
                        mentioned. "The Gifts of the Child Christ,” and other poems, 2 vols., 1882 ;
                        and "The Princess and Cardie,” a fairy romance, 1882. </p>

                    <p>Suakin, September 13. Mr. Urquhart, bridge contractor for the Suakin-Atbara
                        line arrived by the Khedivial Mail S S. Dakahlieh and brought with him a
                        number of workmen to replace those whose contracts have expired. Kaimakam
                        Longfield Bey, RE, left for Railhaed on the 11th inst., and will meet
                        Kaimakam Midwinter Bey, RE, and .discuss with him several matters, including
                        the question of what is to be done with the surplus material which remains
                        over from that brought out for the construction of the Suakin-Atbara line.
                        Bim-bashi Sowerby, RE, has taken over Longfield Bey’s work during the
                        latter’s absence. The British steamer Shahristan arrived here on the 8rd
                        inst. with a consignment of steel sleepers and material for the bridges. She
                        left for India yesterday. </p>

                    <p>The work of erecting the new railway bridge at Zifta will shortly be
                        commenced, a large quantity of material having recently arrived from France.
                        This bridge is to be constructed by Messrs. Dayde and Pillé who are one of
                        the three firms whose designs for the Rodah bridges were finally selected,
                        out of a large number that were sent in and submitted to the Ministry of
                        Public Works for final decision, with the resalt as our readers are aware,
                        that the tender of Messrs. Sir William Arrol and Co. was accepted. The new
                        bridge will be to the north of Zifta, between that town and the barrage, and
                        will serve for the new line from Tantah to Zagazig. When this bridge is
                        completed, next year, the same firm will commence the construction of three
                        others, one on the Damietta branch of the Nile, and the other two on the
                        Tewfikieh and Menoufieh canals respectively. </p>

                    <head>THE COMING TOURIST SEASON.</head>
                    <p>Messrs. Thos. Cook and Son have just issued their annual illustrated handbook
                        for the Nile services for the coming winter, which will be practically the
                        same as those of last season. Their steamers will begin to ran between Cairo
                        and the First Cataract on the 3rd November and continue until the 23rd of
                        March, with later connecting steamers between the First and Second
                        Cataracts. A new feature, to which we call attention, is the arrangement of
                        combined bookings by Messrs. Cook’s steamer and the Egyptian and Sudan
                        Railways, enabling tourists with only limited time at their disposal to make
                        their visits to Upper Egypt and the Sudan more rapidly than can be done by
                        using the steamers only. Combined tickets are issued as far as Gondokoro, a
                        Uganda, to which there is a Government steamer service once a month from
                        Khartoum by up-to-date boats fitted with electric light, hot and cold baths,
                        etc. </p>
                    <p>Messrs. Cook will charge specially reduced rates for residents in Egypt
                        daring November and December. </p>

                    <p>Constantinople, September 12. As the telegraphic agencies have doubtless
                        informed you, H.H. the Khedive arrived here last Saturday by the Orient
                        Express. </p>
                    <p>At the Sirkeje station Ibrahim Pasha, grand master of ceremonies,
                        representing the Sultan, H H. Field-Marshal Prince Mohamad Ali Pasha,
                        brother of H H. the Khedive, General Husni Pasha, Captain Hassan Bey, A.D.C.
                        to the Saltan, Mahmoud Bhukri Bey, and numerous other officials were waiting
                        to greet the distinguished visitor. Immediately after leaving the train the
                        Khedive entered a state carriage, accompanied by Ibrahim Pasha, and,
                        followed by two other carriages, in the first of which were Ahmed Pasha Zeki
                        and General Husni Pasha, while Izzet Bey followed in the seoond, drove to
                        the Yildiz Kiosk with a mounted escort. On his arrival the Khedive was most
                        warmly received by the Sultan and remained some time in conversation with
                        him. He then left for Bebek, where he visited his mother, Princess Emina
                        Hanem, and afterwards left for Chiboukli in the launch Rehber, accompanied
                        by his physician and his chief Imam, Sheikh Osman Effendi. </p>
                    <p>Izzet Bey and the thief eunuch, Almas Aga, met his Highness at Mustafa-Pasha
                        station on the Turkish frontier. </p>
                    <p>In the evening the Khedive received the visits of the first dragomans of the
                        Powers represented at Constantinople, and begged them to transmit his
                        salutations to their respective ambassadors. Yesterday evening he was
                        present at a grand dinner given in his honor by the Sultan at Yildis. </p>

                    <head>THE COTTON INDUSTRY.</head>
                    <p>As soon as the wages difficulty in the Lancashire cotton spinning industry
                        had bee arranged trade resumed its normal state fo the time of the year.
                        August has always been a leading holiday month, and buying and sell ing in
                        piece goods are confined within comparatively small limits ; this year has
                        been no exception to the rule. For several weeks past shippers to India have
                        operated quite sparing-ly, but, as they had previously bought freely for
                        distant delivery, makers have still fairly full order lists. China, too, has
                        been inactive, and scarcely any contracts of important dimen sions have
                        recently been given cut Stocks in Shanghai are undoubtedly increasing in
                        vo-lume as compared with a year ago. Egypt has increased her purchases, and
                        so has Turkey, but the demands from these outlets are quieter now. The
                        several markets in South America vary somewhat in their imports, but in the
                        aggregate it is astonishing what extensive customers they are for Lancashire
                        calico. At the moment all our cotton looms are very busy, and it looks as if
                        there would be steady employment for several months to come. Manufacturers
                        are still enjoying a most remunerative state of trade ; new weaving sheds
                        are being put down as fast as possible, and loom makers are very much
                        pressed to deliver weaving machinery. There would certainly be more looms
                        running if they could bo obtained, and it would cause no surprise if the
                        leading loom producers increased the size of their machine shops. </p>
                    <p>Spinners of American yarn in South Lancashire are not doing quite so well,
                        either as regards the profit margin or in the extent of orders coming in
                        from cloth manufacturers. During the recent slack period the margin has been
                        slipping away, and trade has not been nearly so remunerative as it was
                        earlier in the year. The Oldham holidays, which were observed at the end of
                        August, brought some relief to employers, who were finding a little more yam
                        than usual accumulate at the mills. The question of the yarn supply and
                        demand is engaging the attention of those who carefully watch matters of
                        this kind, but it will probably be the close of this month before any
                        opinion on the point worth anything can bo given. In the meantime a good
                        deal will depend on the probable course of prices in the American raw
                        material. Shipping yarns have been dealt in to an enormous extent this year,
                        as may be seen in the Board Trade returns, but in August and part of July
                        there was indeed very little trade passing. Bolton spinners of carded counts
                        have gradually increased, and there is, on the whole, a healthier state of
                        affairs in the "fine numbers" than has been known for some time past. </p>
                    <p>Raw American cotton for future delivery in Liverpool has fluctuated in price
                        a good deal during the last few months, and rather violent changes have
                        occurred each week in values. Current prices on the whole are still looked
                        upon as too high, in view of the condition of the supply. The bulls urge
                        that more consideration should be given to consumption, which is no doubt on
                        a larger scale than ever previously experienced. The new American crop is an
                        unknown quantity, but estimates are being put forward, though it is as yet
                        too early to give trustworthy figures. The cotton trade of the County
                        Palatine, as one body, is being urged to get its own reports of the crop, in
                        consequence of the recent Washington Bureau scandal, and it is felt that an
                        experiment of this kind will be forced upon the trade in Great Britain. The
                        matter is being discussed, and after the September holidays more, probably,
                        will be heard of the subject Cotton mill building is still going on, and
                        textile machinists are extremely busy and are quoting, it is said, higher
                        prices for spinning and weaving machinery than was the case twelve months or
                        so ago. </p>
                    <p>The other week a "slump" occurred in raw American cotton in Liverpool, spot
                        cotton on Friday last being at 5.56., or about 1/2d. per lb. below the
                        highest point of a few weeks ago. The Washington Bureau statement issued
                        last Wednesday week respecting the condition of the growing plant was better
                        than the bulls anticipated and this accounts for the decline in New York.
                        Lancashire spinners are continuing to buy in retail lots, preferring to use
                        up old supplies rather than to purchase tar ahead. The trade want to see a
                        further drop in raw material. The crop is believed to be doing well on the
                        whole. </p>
                    <p>The total shipments of cotton piece goods for the last eight months are given
                        in the following comparative table : — </p>
                    <p>1905 4,076,229,300yds. </p>
                    <p>1904 3,599,155,300yds. </p>
                    <p>1903... 3,588,314,800yds. </p>
                    <p>The greatest increase this year as compared with 1904 is to China
                        (230,000,000 yards) ; then comes Japan (61,700,000 yards), Bengal
                        (47,000,000 yards), and Dutch East Indies (39,0x0,000 yards). The Argentine
                        Republic shows a decrease of 26,000,000 yards, and Venezuela 16,000,000
                        yards. The other few cases of smaller takings are quite unimportant. </p>
                    <p>The aggregate shipments of cotton yarn for the year so far amounted to
                        132,114,200lb., against 102,638,1001b. in the corresponding period of 1904
                        and 101,918,300lb. in the same eight months of 1903. Most of our customers
                        increased their imports, notably India (7,300,0001b.), China (4,700,0001b.),
                        Turkey (3,600,000lb.),Roumanian (2,100,0001b.),Netherlands (5,600,0001b),
                        and Japan (l,600,000lb.). </p>

                    <head>RADIUM AND DIAMONDS.</head>
                    <p>Whenever a new element or compound is discovered, the orthodox course of
                        investiga tion consists in noting its effect upon every form of living or
                        non-living matter, in the hope of observing reactions which will throw some
                        light upon the branch of physics concerned. The peculiarities of radium at
                        once attracted the attention of experimentalists, with the result, that a
                        very large number of chemical electrical, and physiological effects have
                        been traced to it. Neglecting those—such as the alleged production of living
                        organisms—which require verification, we still have enough to provide much
                        food for reflection ; and, in fact new properties of the substance are
                        discovered more rapidly than rational explanations can be found for them.
                        Sir William Crookes has investigated the action of radium on diamonds, and
                        described the results obtained in a lecture before the British Association
                        at Kimberley on September 5. Beyond the development of an induced radio
                        activity in the diamonds, no thing very striking might have been expected ;
                        but with radium it seems to be the unexpect ed which generally happens, and
                        in the present case some very curious effects were observed. The diamond is
                        very sensitive to the bombardment of the B radiations, and scintillates
                        under their influence so much that a layer of diamond powder makes almost as
                        good a coating for the screen of a spinthariscope as the usual zinc
                        sulphide. Prolonged contact with radium bromide was found to impart a
                        beautiful blue colour to previously colourless diamonds, materia ly
                        in-creasing their value as “fancy” stones. The effect is not transient, and
                        is not destroyed by long continued heating in strong nitric acid and
                        potassium chlorate. The diamond may also be heated to redness without
                        affecting the tint. Diamonds which had been buried fo over twelve months in
                        radium bromide had also acquired strong radio-active properties, in addition
                        to their blueness. The radiations emanated from the crystals in regular and
                        geometrical patterns, the cause of which is still under investigation. The
                        radio-activity, like the colouration, withstands the most drastic treatment,
                        leading Sir William Crookes to the belief that both these properties depend
                        upon changes deeper than the surface layer of the stone. A diamond made blue
                        and radio active by burial in radium bromide was slowly heated to redness in
                        a dark room. A faint phosphorescence spread over the stone just before the
                        red heat was visible, but after cooling both the colour and the
                        radio-activity seemed quite unaffected. If a diamond is bom barded by
                        radiant matter from the negative pole of a vacuum tube, it not only phosphor
                        esces, bat turns brown and, in time, black. This blackening is only
                        superficial, and is caused by the formation of a layer of graphite on the
                        surface ; different forms of graphite show different degrees of resistance
                        to chemical reagents, some being dissolved by strong nitric acid and others
                        resisting, for a longer or shorter time, the intense powerful oxidising
                        agency of a mixtare of highly concentrated nitric acid and potassium
                        chlorate. Moissan has shown that the power of resistance to this last
                        reagent is in proportion to the temperature at which the graphite was formed
                        ; and it can be deduced with tolerable certainty that the graphite due to
                        molecular bombardment cannot have been formed at a lower temperature than
                        3,600 deg. Cent. The surface layer of the diamond mast then have been raised
                        to the temperature of the electric arc, although the body of the stone
                        remains comparatively cool. That this is possible is supported by the fact
                        that the superficial layers of a mass of so highly conducting a metal as
                        silver can be raised to a red heat by radiant action, while the interior of
                        the metal is no more than warm. —"Engineering." </p>

                    <head>GOLD DISCOVERIES NEAR TETE.</head>
                    <p>In the course of his report on the trade of Chinde for the year 1904, Mr.
                        Vice-Consul Stanley Hewitt-Fletcher says : </p>
                    <p>"The discoveries of gold, silver, and copper made some eighteen months ago in
                        the territories of the Compania da Zambesia, and referred to in the last
                        report, are now beginning to be thought important. Two experts have been
                        sent up by a Berlin house to report on the alleged deposits. Should their
                        report be as favorable as is expected in some quarters, considerable
                        developments may be looked for. It appears that there are two goldfields,
                        called respectively Chifumbase and Missale, situated some 100 or 150 miles
                        north-west of Tete. The Compania da Zambesia is desirous of opening up these
                        gold properties, and has appointed a commissioner of mines with full powers
                        to deal with these matters. His offices are at Tete, but a pamphlet in
                        English giving a brief account of the mining regulations may be obtained at
                        the head offices at Lisbon.” </p>
                    <p>A correspondent of the "Morning Post" says it was the hope of finding the
                        precious metal hat induced the early Portuguese "conquis-tadores” to explore
                        the "River of Good Indica-tions,” and contest its possesion with their Arab
                        predecessors. When Tete was at the height of its prosperity, two and a half
                        cent-uries later, the output of gold passing through this town alone
                        amounted to 130lb. annually, but the growth of the slave trade, which seem
                        ed to offer a speedier mode of becoming rich, depopulated the country and
                        caused the decline of the mining industry. When Livingstone visited Tete in
                        1856 the annual output was from 8lb. to 10lb., and in recent years it has
                        been still less. Though the Portuguese have practically abandoned the
                        industry, gold-washing is still carried on in a fitful and halfhearted
                        manner by natives, who pack the dust in goose quills and offer it for sale
                        (too often adulterated with copper filings) to such hunters and traders as
                        pass through the country. Curious as it may seem, Livingstone stated on good
                        authority that when natives discovered nuggets they buried them again,
                        believing that they would breed and propagate their species in the form of
                        gold dust, </p>

                    <head>THE NAPHTHA FOUNTAINS OF BAKU.</head>

                    <p>Some interesting facts concerning Baku and its oilfields were published a few
                        years ago in a curious little book criticising the Russian Empire, by "An
                        Oriental Widow." Baku, wrote the author, "well deserves the epithet of
                        Petropolis, for no matter where you roam, or what you eat, a hazy odour of
                        petroleum dings about the tea, wine, beefsteak, or tipsy-pud-ding, proving
                        more than nauseous during certain phases of atmospheric disturbance."
                        A-visit to the fountains of naphtha is thus de-scribed </p>
                    <p>The naphtha jets, spouting up to hundreds of feet, are facilitated in their
                        discharge by steel ramrods, so worked by machinery that they descend into
                        the bowels of the subterranean passages with a sharp crack, and there loosen
                        the surroundings, with the result that the pent-up oil, following in the
                        wake of the retreating steel, forces its way out in gushing torrents. These
                        rods, thirty feet long and eight inches in circumference, descend about a
                        thousand feet, and take half an hour to slide down to the bottom of the
                        shaft, and be pulled up again. The famous geysers of Iceland, the
                        Yellowstone, and New Zealand occurred to our mind, as we watched the
                        enormous black columns of naphtha shoot into the air, and scatter their
                        spray over the adjacent ponds. </p>
                    <p>One’s clothes develop after a few hours' visit to Baku a decidedly yellow
                        tone, and colours are soon eradicated to the no delight of incompetent

                        signalling regulations. Special training of senior officers and their
                        attendance at manoeuvres, and extra training for non-commissioned officers,
                        are suggested for discussion; and there are proposals for the attachment of
                        Regular officers to regiments during their training. </p>

                    <p>La maladie par exemple était entrée chez Madame Marie G. Exarohou Agée de 81
                        ans, demeurant an Pirée Rue Areos, et elle y régnait depuis 6 ans sons forme
                        d’nne anémie grave. Du jour où Madame Exarohou a prb les pilnles Pink elle a
                        commencé à regagner la santé. Si vous prenez en effet les pilules Pink
                        aujourd’hui votre guérison commencera aujourd’hui. </p>
                    <p>"J’ai eu, écrit-elle, plusieurs aooouohemente pénibles qai avaient
                        complètement ruiné ma santé. J’étais devenae toat-à-fait anémique. I me
                        semblait que je n’avais pins de sang bouf la peau, et mes mains et mes pieds
                        tonji n glacés donnaient bien cette impression. J'était excessivement faible
                        et avec la meilleure vo Ion té, je ne pouvais pas entreprendre ud ouvrage
                        tant soitjeea pénible. J’avais en outre an mauvais estomac, de mauvaises
                        digestions qni me faisaient d'abord beanoonp souffrir et indépendamment de
                        cela m’empêchaient de me nourrir suffisamment et contribuaient par oela même
                        à augmenter ma faiblesse déjà très grande. J'ajouterai que je dormais mal,
                        quo je ressentais de l’oppression, des étourdissements. Au bout de six ans
                        de soaffranoes, sans que les médicaments aient pn me soulager, on comprendra
                        qae j’avais perda tout espoir de guérir. On jugera dono de mon étonnement
                        quand, sur les conseils d’ane amie ayant ess >yé les traitements des pilnles
                        pink, je me sentis beanoonp mieux. Mes forces étaient bien certainement
                        lentes à revenir, mais je m’en sentais cheque joor davantage. Je repris
                        bonne mine, toas mes malaises s’atténuèrent et après avoir continué le
                        traitement pendant quelques semaines j’obtins nne gnérison que je n'aurais
                        jamais souhaité plus complète.’* </p>

                    <head>CHANNEL FLEET AT COPENHAGEN.</head>

                    <p><hi rend="bold">"Times.'’</hi></p>

                    <p>The extremely cordial welcome which the Channel Fleet is receiving at
                        Copenhagen will be viewed with real satisfaction by this country. We
                        thoroughly appreciate the spontaneous warmth of the greeting offered to our
                        sailors by the kingdom with which we have so much in common. A South German
                        paper, struck by the significant utterances of distinguished Danish authors,
                        asks in bewilderment whether Denmark is to become a British colony. We do
                        not suppose that Denmark intends to become anybody’s colony, but we are glad
                        to think that she has unmistakably shown herself our friend. It is in every
                        way natural that it should be so. The ties of marriage that unite the Royal
                        Houses of the two countries, the ties of commerce that have linked us closer
                        every year— these things form a solid foundation for good friendship ; and
                        even these are not all. We admire in the Danes, as in their Scandinavian
                        neighbours, the same qualities of sturdy independence and manliness which we
                        prize in our own stock. The sense of the connexion between us will certainly
                        gain in depth and durability from the events now going on at Copenhagen. </p>

                    <p>The British fleet is a welcome guest to the whole Danish people. With the
                        exception of our Scandinavian neighbours there is no other nation to whom we
                        are bound by such strong ties of friendship and sympathy as with England,
                        the master of the free, open seas, the pioneer of sound and honest commerce
                        all over the world. The Danish nation understands that when such an imposing
                        and mighty representative of the naval power of Great Britain visits our
                        shores it is for the purpose of honoring the venerable old Monarch of
                        Denmark, the father of the British Queen, of demonstrating the friendship
                        towards Denmark, and of intimating that Britain demands the mainten-ance of
                        the freedom of the seas all over the world. </p>

                    <p>It is with unaffected pleasure that Englishmen are watching the satisfactory
                        progress of the negotiations between France and Germany with regard to
                        Morocco. Direct interest in that region we have none, except that the person
                        and property of British subjects shall be held inviolate, and that we shall
                        enjoy all reasonable facilities for trade and commerce. The only reason why
                        we took a hand in the diplomatic game that was being played was flat we were
                        bound by Treaty to support the claims of France. Bat it was no part of our
                        policy to draw her into a quarrel with any other Power, or to place on her
                        rights a stronger interpretation than she was herself disposed to assert, We
                        are rejoiced to think that the calm discussions which are being held in
                        Paris between Dr. Rosen and M. Rouvier will result in au equitable
                        compromise. </p>

                    <p>The "Matin,” discussing the interview which took place between Dr. Rosen, the
                        new German Minister to Morocco, and M. Rouvier, says that the serious
                        difficulties which existed between France and Germany on the subject of the
                        Morocco Conference seem likely to be settled more quickly than had been
                        anticipat-ed. The German Government, in fact, taking into consideration the
                        state of anarchy that prevails at Tangiers, is stated to be willing to
                        abandon its original choice of that place the venue of the Conference. </p>

                    <p>The impression derived from the interview between Dr. Rosen and M Rouvier is
                        that Germany’s representative is well-disposed and competent, and that he is
                        endeavouring to find a basis of understanding. Unfortunately Dr. Rosen
                        possesses only limited powers. </p>

                    <p>Englishmen plume themselves on having evaded conscription. The pride would be
                        better grounded if they had gained security by other means. They boast of
                        their freedom from the curse of militarism. But unmilitarism is evidently
                        equally expensive, and while other nations get something for their money we
                        are told by Lord Roberts that the British Empire is wholly unprepared for
                        successful war against a first-class military Power. There is no need to
                        discuss conscription, but what does require elucidation by those in
                        authority is how the needful army of half a million men is to be obtained
                        for the defence of the Indian frontier, how it is to bo officered when
                        obtained, and how the wastages of war are to be met, as the Army is at
                        present constituted. </p>

                    <p>The essence of the Volunteer Force is its voluntary character. Let Ministers
                        treat the force frankly on that basis, and do all that is possible within
                        that limit to encourage and npromote its efficiency ; and they will find a
                        ready response. But if they try to dragoon it, or by a side-wind to shift
                        the basis of it, they will go a long way to destroying what the Prime
                        Minister declares to be an integral and indispensable element in any sound
                        scheme of Imperial Defence. </p>

                    <p>Our Foreign Office is only too true to its traditions of waiting till a
                        crisis is reached, and it shuns, as it did in Morocco and in the Far East,
                        any attempt, to regulate matters before they have reached the acute stage.
                        But the position we occupy towards both Sweden and Norway, the dynastic ties
                        which have so recently connected ns with the Royal House of Bernadotte, and
                        the substantial interest which we have in the nonintrusion of foreign Powers
                        on the North Sea littoral, render it most important to us that matters
                        should not reach extremity in the Peninsula. There is no time to be lost,
                        and an intimation that the Swedish claim with regard to the Norwegian
                        fortresses is unreasonable might bring about a peaceful solution of the
                        present difficulty within forty eight hours. </p>

                    <p>The "Intelligens Sedlerne” says that apparently the principal Swedish
                        stipulation in the question of the dissolution of the Union is the
                        demolition of the new Norwegian forts, and adds that at present Sweden will
                        not accept a treaty of arbitration. In these circum-stance, the journal
                        adds, Sweden’s conditions absolutely cannot be accepted by Norway. </p>

                    <p>The "Dagbladet” says that from the Swedish side it is asserted that only by
                        acceding to Sweden’s conditions can Norway obtain international recognition.
                        It is not until Norway his accepted her conditions that Sweden will discuss
                        the question of an arbitration treat. "If so,” the journal continues,
                        "everybody here understands the difficulty of the situation. Our leading men
                        consider, as we all do, that war is a terrible calamity. But they agree that
                        a faithless peace bought with national humiliation is worse than war.” </p>

                    <p>The "Morgenbladet” states that the demand for the demolition of the Norwegian

                        bitterness and strife. If the demand appears excessive, Norway might
                        categorically refuse to accede to it. </p>

                    <p>M. Hanotaux has a great belief in the new Anglo-Japanese alliance. In an
                        article in the "Journal” he points out that, though the treaty does not
                        directly menace any other Power, all the Powers will need a great deal of
                        prudence to avoid coming into collision with so formidable a maritime
                        combination. He cannot, however, reconcile the new treaty with the old
                        German treaty respecting the Yangtse Valley If this does not speedily lead
                        to a rapprochement with the Anglo-Japanese group, Germany will be obliged to
                        act independently to maintain and strengthen her present position in China.
                        Russia, of course, is a possible ally, but the unfortunate feature of such a
                        prospect is that Germany now has more to give than to receive. M. Hanotaux
                        does not appear to con template the possibility of China, under the moral
                        influence of Japan, being able to take matters into her own hands. That may
                        be a remote possibility—too remote, perhaps, to be considered. But one day
                        it will have to be reckoned with. Meantime, M. Hanotaux’s tribute to the
                        strength of the Anglo-Japanese alliance may be accepted as a testimony to
                        the chances of peace in the Far East THE TOKIO RIOTS. </p>

                    <p>Whilst it would be too much to say that the agitation against the terms of
                        peace has ceased in Japan, steps taken by the authorities have clearly led
                        to a cessation of mob violence. It looks, however, as if it would be some
                        little time before affairs will be normal—the dissatisfaction with the peace
                        will probably be only got rid of by a change of Ministry. The scapegoat
                        method of coarse is not scientific, but it is often very effective, however
                        unjust to the unfortunate scapegoat. </p>

                    <head>STORY OF THE SEA.</head>

                    <p>On the arrival at Plymouth on the 9th Inst of the Orient Pacific liner Omrah,
                        en route to London, a thrilling story of the sea was related. </p>
                    <p>It appears that on the morning of the previous Wednesday,soon after passing
                        Cape St. Vincent, the third officer, Mr. A. H. Fraser, who was on the
                        bridge, detected something unusual away on the port beam of the mail
                        steamer. What it was could not be at once determined, but Mr. Fraser
                        continued to examine the object floating on the surface of the water away on
                        the seaward side of the Omrah, and speedily other telescopes were trained in
                        the same direction as his, in the effort to detect what it could be. </p>
                    <p>Later fuller views of this object were ob-t tained, as from time to time the
                        wreckage, for so it now appeared to be, rose on the top of a huge wave, only
                        to be lost sight of the next moment in the trough of the seas, which then,
                        were running very high. The weather indeed, was of a most boisterous
                        character at this time, and the wind was rapidly hardening to a gala. Once
                        convinced, however, that there was wreckage near, the course of the Omrah
                        was altered so as to permit of the object being closely examined, with a
                        view to discovering whether there was anyone on it in need of assistance. </p>
                    <p>As the great liner drew nearer, Mr. Fraser, made out the form of a human
                        being lying across what was really an improvised raft, constructed of just a
                        couple of planks. Then, almost before the throbbing engines had eased, and
                        while the Omrah was still slowly moving forwards, the lifeboat was rushed
                        into the water, and pulled off under the direction of Mr. Fraser. </p>
                    <p>In a very short space of time the boat got alongside the raft, and there,
                        without food and water, they found a Spanish sailor lad in a state of
                        collapse and unconscious. The crew hauled him into the boat, Bent adrift the
                        little raft, and then started to pall back to the steamer. The Omrah had
                        been maneuvered by her commander, Lieutenant W. S. Shelford, R.N.R., so as
                        to afford the rescuers as much shelter as possible, and, amid the cheers
                        from the passengers and ship’s company, the boat safely reached the
                        steamer’s side, and soon all were on deck. The castaway was at once handed
                        over to the care of the ship’s surgeon, Dr. Lucas and he gradually
                        recovered, and later was able to relate tragic details of a disaster in
                        which he bad taken a part </p>
                    <p>His name, he said, was Juan Delgardo Lam-tano, and he was one of a crew of
                        seven belonging to the Spanish brigantine Carmen, on which he sailed from a
                        port in southern Spain for Setubal, Portugal, on Sunday night, the 3rd inst
                        The Carmen encountered squally weather, and at one o'clock the following
                        morning she suddenly capsized, without the slightest warning, all her crew
                        being thrown into the water. </p>
                    <p>Juan Lamtano, who is only between eighteen and nineteen years of age,
                        managed, however, to grasp a couple of floating planks, on which he found
                        two other of his fellow-seamen. The two planks were lashed together, and for
                        a time served to keep the trio afloat When daylight came, the horror of the
                        situation presented itself more folly to the minds of the sailors. They wore
                        afloat on a waste of waters with a storm rising, and without a sail in
                        sight. Of food or water there was none, but just before the catastrophe the
                        crew bad all been served with hot coffee. Then night came on, and in those
                        hours of darkness Lamtano lost his two companions, both being swept away by
                        the seas. Overcome by exposure, the lad drifted on the raft for three nights
                        and two days, and daring that time only two vessels came within hailing
                        distance of him, but so weak and feeble was he that he could do nothing to
                        attract their attention. In fact, he gradually feel into a sort of stupor,
                        from which he was roused only to find himself on the Omrah, which con-veyed
                        him to London. </p>

                    <head>COTTON-GROWING IN THE-WEST INDIES.</head>
                    <p>In view of the interest which is being taken in Colonial cotton-growing, and
                        the importance of the scheme to Great Britain, an official return of the
                        cotton grown in the West Indies will arouse considerable attention. The
                        return also affords convincing testimony to the fact that in some of our
                        Colonies, at all events, cotton can be grown in large quantities and with
                        profit to the producer. </p>
                    <p>The return alluded to shows that during the quarter ended March last 1,369
                        bales of cotton were exported from the West Indies, the total weight
                        amounting to 418.1661b., and the estimated value being £19,608. For the
                        second quarter of the year the export totalled 1,637 bales, aggregating
                        450,4301b, and valued at £16,013. Thus the Weft Indian Colonies exported
                        during the half year 8,056 bales, valued at £85,621, and representing
                        868,596lb. This return does not include the returns from Jamaica and St
                        Lucia for the second quarter. The amount of Sea Island cotton exported from
                        the five principal Colonies exporting cotton in the West Indies during the
                        half year is given as follows Barbadoes, 589 bales (308,3631b. ), value
                        £10,418; Nevis, 658 bales (131,6581b.) value £6,582 ; St Vincent, 290bales
                        (95,8151b.), value £4,790 ; 8t Kitt’s, 246,bales (75,8451b.), value £8,767 ;
                        Antigua, 228 bales (40,1401b.), value £2,007. </p>

                    <head>TREATIES AND PENS.</head>

                    <p>That another treaty has lately Been signed the world at large is folly aware,
                        but what the world at large does not know is to whom the precious pen with
                        which the treaty is signed is to devolve. To the collector there are few
                        objects more rare than treaty pens, and few that are more highly treasured
                        by those who possess them, which probably accounts for the fact that, apart
                        from the pen used when the Treaty of Paris was signed in April, 1856— and
                        only one pen was used—the average treaty has increased the world’s reliquary
                        by several items. </p>
                    <p>Thus, when in 1898 the American Commissioners met their Spanish confreres for
                        the purpose of signing the Hispano-American Treaty of Peace, a document that
                        originally comprised. ,600 pages of type-written matter, it was noted that
                        whereas a number of the Americans were provided with handsome pens,
                        expressly purchased for the occasion, the Spaniards were content to use the
                        ordinary quill pens strewn on the table. When each commissioner had signed
                        his name to the Spanish and English versions of the treaty, opposite to his
                        signatures his private seal was attached by tri-colour ribbons, out of
                        compliment to France, in whose capital negotiations were carried on. </p>
                    <p>Concerning these ribbons an amusing story is related. The commissioners of
                        both countries, as a slight acknowledgment of the courtesy extended to them,
                        requested the officials of the Quai d’Orsay present kindly to furnish them
                        with tri-coloured ribbon for the affixing of the seals, but to the
                        consternation of those in charge of the proceedings,. though diligent search
                        was made, not an inch of the familiar red, white, and blue ribbon could be
                        discovered at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. That the situation was almost
                        painful can easily be understood, but fortunately its awkwardness was
                        quickly dissipated by a genius who was at the head of a department, but who
                        showed by his action on this occasion that he was worthy of an Embassy at
                        the least. "Go,” said he to a messenger, “to M , the confectioner in the Rue
                        St. Honoré, for a pound of chocolate cakes, and be sure you ask him to tie
                        them up with a tri colour ribbon." The situation was saved. </p>
                    <p>When in due course this treaty was brought to Washington for the signature of
                        the President, the late Mr. McKinley, Mr. Secretary Hay provided for the
                        occasion a silver penholder, which he expressed his intention of preserving
                        as an historical memento. Whether this historic instrument will eventually
                        be made over to a National collection remains to be seen, but in such event
                        it would form the nucleus of an interesting treaty exhibit that might
                        include the flags of the United States and Panama, in which the Canal Treaty
                        was wrapped when early in 1904 it was carried in triumph from the Palace to
                        the United States Consulate in Panama by policemen. </p>
                    <p>At precisely 11.15 p.m., on May 31, 1902 the Boer delegates deputed to do so
                        subscribed their signatures to the articles that brought peace to South
                        Africa, in the presence of Lord Milner and Lord Kitchener. What became of
                        the historic pens used on this occasion did not transpire, but it is to be
                        hoped that such historic relics as these are pre served with the same care
                        as that used when the Treaty of Paris of 1856 was signed. </p>
                    <p>This last-mentioned instrument, at the re quest of the Empress Eugénie, was
                        used by each of the fourteen Plenipotentiaries subscribing their signatures
                        to the document, a graceful concession on their part, inasmuch as the use of
                        one pen may have prejudiced the legibility of their writing not a little.
                        The pen in question, unlike the gold pen presented by some manufacturers of
                        Pforzheim, town in Baden famous for its jewellery work, to Bismarck, on the
                        occasion of the signing of the treaty of peace with France in the year 1871,
                        was a quill plucked from golden eagle’s wing. What rendered the pen
                        remarkable, apart from its associations, was the fact that the quill was
                        mounted in gold and encrusted with diamonds. "Handsome is that handsome
                        does” — the provisions of the treaty proved no more binding through the use
                        of this gorgeous instrument than would have been the case if a goose-quill
                        and disappearing ink had been employed. </p>
                    <p>That treaty pens have a value other than that which is the product of
                        historic associations was proved when, on bankruptcy proceedings being
                        instituted against the estate of the late Count Franz Falkenbayn in 1901,
                        the pen and penholder used to sign the treaty of the "Holy Alliance,” in
                        1815, was put op for auction in Vienna. The treaty, it will be recalled, was
                        signed at Paris on September 26, 1815, by Francis I. of Austria, Alexander
                        I. of Russia, and Frederick William III. of Prussia, and the pen used by
                        them on this occasion, when put up to auction a few years ago, elicited a
                        first bid of £5 and a final bid (on the part of Consul-General von Lindheim)
                        of £32. </p>

                        seraient des prix tout k fait normaux, puisque les meilleurs titres
                        Egyptiens, n’ayant pas les réserves énumérées oi-nant, ne pourraient, k leur
                        prix actuel, so capitaliser au toDx de 3 %. </p>
                    <p>Il faut encore mettre en ligae de compte les .conditions de constitution, de
                        partsge de béné fioes, etc ; car le Crédit Foncier a été fondé haineusement
                        k nne épcqae f ù il il était plus difficile qu’actuellement de trouver dns

                    <dateline>Paris, September 13.</dateline>

                    <p>The controversy, entitled “La Crise du Patriotism,” is a sign of the times.
                        It has revealed the great broach that really exists between Jaurès and his
                        party and the rest of the nation. Its real meaning is that the Socialist
                        leader has lost much, very much, of his influence. He is no longer the power
                        he once was to sway the Government, and I doubt if he will recover his
                        position. He, alone, cries out against any action in Morocco, preferring to
                        see France adopt a rôle of effacement. No policy could be more out of
                        harmony with the public sentiment. It is his second great mistake: the first
                        was his announced intention to go to Berlin to preach peace and no
                        frontiers. He failed then, as he fails now, to carry the greater number of
                        his party with him. </p>
                    <p>I am struck with the feeling of disquietude that still prevails. It is
                        reflected on the Bourse. The horizon is covered with clouds, and the wisest
                        heads profess to be unable to read the future. The actual situation in
                        Morocco gives cause for no great anxiety ; it is elsewhere that trouble is
                        looked for- with Morocco as the "motif.” Anglo-German rivalry, according to
                        some, is likely to assume an acute and dangerous form, and, according to
                        others, the anglo-Japanese treaty is fraught with menace to this country. It
                        is supposed that the conquerors will now have their head in Asia, and that
                        Cochin China and French interests therein will be the sufferers. Speculation
                        is still rife as to the real meaning of the compact of Portsmouth. An
                        authority in foreign politics remarked to me “You may take it that China has
                        to pay the price. There is no doubt a secret stipulation between the two
                        belligerents that China should provide a pecuniary 'quid pro quo’ to Japan
                        for the return of Manchuria. It is not likely that Japan would be foolish
                        enough to give it back for nothing. I imagine, also, that under the head of
                        prisoners’ maintenance, Japan will receive a pretty considerable
                        compensation from Russia. Otherwise the forfeiture of the indemnity is
                        inexplicable." </p>
                    <p>The tares so sedulously sown by the French Internationalists in the good
                        wheat of French patriotism are producing the evil crop that might have been
                        expected. Last Friday, during the army manoeuvres near Avignon, two shots
                        were fired at the colonel commanding the 58th regiment of infantry. The
                        bullets whizzed past the colonel’s ear, and one of them carried away two
                        fingers from the hand of a soldier standing near. In spite of a strict
                        examination of all the rifles and ammunition pouches, the author of the
                        attempt was not discovered. It is a regular maxim of the followers of M.
                        Gustave Hervé and his fellow "Sans-patrie” that it is the duty of the
                        soldier in time of war to shoot down his officers, and that doctrine is
                        openly preached on the platform and in infamous pamphlets such as the
                        "Manuel du Soldat.” The German scare has opened the eyes of the French
                        people to the danger of this sort of propaganda ; but no real progress will
                        be made towards suppressing it until the Government frankly make up their
                        minds to treat the enemies of France within her own household as if they
                        were no better than mere monks and nuns. They are reaping as they have
                        allowed the Socialists to sow, and they have no right to be surprised at the
                        character of the harvest. </p>
                    <p>The well-known French journal "La France Militaire” of September 1 discussed
                        in an article entitled "The Entente Cordiale : Its Strategical Hypotheses,”
                        the future of France in a war with Germany if Great Britain joins the Dual
                        Alliance. Col. Gaedke comments in the "Berliner Tageblatt” upon the article
                        referred to. He thinks it unlikely that France and Russia will unite in a
                        war against Germany, and also that Austria's attitude would be a doubtful
                        one in case of such a war, </p>
                    <p>After referring to the loss of the Elbe mouth and the general moral effect of
                        a successful English landing in Holstein, Col. Gaedke says that "alliance
                        between England and France would not be, perhaps, so disagreeable to Germany
                        as has been that between France and Russia, but it would result,
                        nevertheless, in a very unpleasant and serious war, which could inflict upon
                        Germany’s national flourishing welfare a blow from which it would not
                        recover. Will Germany make the necessary deductions from these remarks ?” </p>
                    <p>Col. Gaedke was one of the first military critics to warn the outside world
                        against under-estimating Russia’s military strength even after its overthrow
                        by Japan ; still, is of opinion that Russia will not be able to undertake
                        any great military activity for a very long time, especially as the war with
                        Japan has left it far more vulnerable in Asia than it was before. In view of
                        the recent Anglo-Japanese Treaty Russia will have to increase its strength
                        in Turkestan. France cannot remain long with two irons in the fire, and if
                        war breaks out in Europe, then France must quickly choose between England
                        and Russia, and even, perhaps, between England and Germany. The French
                        article says that England and France could together send to the German
                        coastline a united squadron twice as large as that of Germany. Col. Gaedke
                        points out that the two Powers could send a naval squadron thrice a large as
                        that of Germany. "La France Militaire” points out that a powerful English
                        fleet in the Baltic would compel the German fleet to keep under the
                        protection of its coast defences; the English squadron could blockade
                        Dantrig. Swinen Unde, and Kiel, while an Anglo-French Squadron could
                        blockade Cuxhaven. Moreover, Germany’s outlook is by no moans cheering from
                        a landing aspe3t thus, the Schleswig-Holstein coastline, especially on the
                        east, offers many points suitable for landing troops, while the German
                        railways running thither are only of single tracks ; that is they would not
                        be of very much use in conveying large bodies of troops to repel an
                        invasion, and it would be quite possible for au immense English force to
                        land if the necessary preparation had been made, and if the Gorman Reserve
                        Division had not been mobilised in Schleswig-Holstein in due time. </p>
                    <p>The influence of fatigue on workmen, and the part it plays in relation to
                        accidents has lately formed the subject of an exhaustive inquiry on the part
                        of M. Imbert Professor at the Montpellier Faculty of Medicine, and M.
                        Mestre, a factory inspector in the Department of the Hérault. From their
                        united investigations very dear and important indications have been obtained
                        relating to the physio-logioal conditions during the hours of labour. These
                        observations have shown that the number of accidents increases progressively
                        hour by hour during the first half-day : that after the rest at midday the
                        number of accidents is notably less than in the last hour of the forenoon ;
                        that in the ourse of the second halfday accidents again become, from hour to
                        hour, progressively more numerous ; and that the maximum number of accidents
                        towards the end of the second half day is notably higher than the
                        corresponding maximum in the morning. The influence of the workmen’s fatigue
                        on the production of accidents stands out clearly from these observations,
                        and it is easy to understand how this comes about when it is remembered that
                        with fatigue the attention rapidly diminishes and disappears. The
                        conclusion, therefore, is that in order to produce a diminution in the
                        number of accidents it would be sufficient to intercalate in the middle of
                        each halt day of work a period of repose, naturally not so long as that at
                        midday, but the length of which remains to be determined. In fact, one would
                        only have to apply to the manual labour of adults, the measures which for a
                        long time have been put into practice for children as regards their
                        intellectual labour. </p>
                    <p>However this theory may suit in France, it is hardly likely to commend itself
                        at once to the practical minds of Englishmen. The Englishman’s theory is :
                        Not too long hours, but the maximum of effort while you’re at it. The
                        Frenchman, on the other hand, does not greatly mind if he starts fairly
                        early, and keeps on till seven or eight o'clock, provided that he has two
                        hours for luncheon and a rest in the afternoon. If you ever watched
                        Frenchmen at work on a building in course of construction you would be
                        surprised at the number of times during the day that they are missing from
                        the building, and if you wanted to find them yon would only have to discover
                        the nearest wineshop. There they are—masons, plumbers, and painters, having
                        copious draughts of claret, and when it comes to the luncheon hour they sit
                        down to a repast whose courses are never less than four or five, followed by
                        café and the inevitable "petit verre.” Should any of the workmen feel in a
                        sportive mood—and the Frenchman is an inveterate gambler—then the dice will
                        be brought out, and another "petit verre” will be thrown for, with the
                        result that when the meal is finished, and the last glass of cognac and the
                        final cigarette have been paid for, the mason and the plumber and the
                        painter would much rather remain at table than restart work. At the same
                        time, I most say this injustice to the tradesmen in Paris, that when they
                        build they build well, for I have never seen anywhere more solid and more
                        artistic work than in Paris. </p>
                    <p>One result of the extensive excavations now going on in Paris, owing to the
                        operations rendered necessary by the metropolitan under-ground railway, is
                        that several districts of the city have been invaded by enormous quantities
                        of rats. Before the navy and his pick dislodged them from their quarters in
                        the sewers and drains the rats were quite comfortable in their retreat, but
                        now that they have been obliged to quit their haunts the ratepayers along
                        the line of the new railway are complaining bitterly of the unwelcome visits
                        paid to them by the homeless rodents. On the 7th inst., while a temporary
                        bridge for the passage of tramways was being pulled down in the Boulevard de
                        Strasbourg, enormous numbers of rata ware expelled from their quarters, and,
                        in anticipation of this, arrangements had been made to exterminate them. Men
                        with sticks, stones, and picks wore waiting for the rats, and when the
                        moment came, and the four-footed army swept in their flight through the
                        galleries of the underground railway they were massacred by hundreds. </p>
                    <p>After the system of underground railway lines has been completed, the next
                        big work to be taken in hand is the levelling of the fortifica tions—the dry
                        ditch and zig-zag bastions round Paris, which lost all military value years
                        ago, but which the War Office, conservative as our own, has been reluctant
                        to pull down. They have served as an octroi barrier; as a play ground for
                        the national guard in 1870 ; and since for the poorer people of Paris, who
                        pic-nic there on Sundays, and know no other country scene. But as the
                        fortifications they have been always known. Now they are to disappear. At
                        the right moment, when work begins to get scarce in Paris, the unemployed
                        will be turned on to throw the bastions into the ditch, and level the
                        glacis, and to break op the girdle of earth and stone which binds the city
                        round, and cuts it off from its suburbs as from a foreign land. This rule of
                        the paternal French Government of always having in view some work for spare
                        hands to do is excellent and necessary, for unemployed demonstrations in
                        Paris might take an awkward turn. Ratepayers sometimes grumble at having to
                        pay more taxes in consequence, but really the scheme saves money as well as
                        trouble. The costs are sometimes more apparent than real on works undertaken
                        for the benefit of the unemployed, such, for instance, as the great Paris
                        exhibitions, which, in addition to filling the pockets of hotel proprietors
                        and shop-keepers, served to balance the scales of supply and demand in
                        labour. Fortunately, work will be plentiful enough during the next few years
                        to make the holding of an exhibition in 1911 unnecessary. </p>
                    <p>To come back to the fortifications, the Prefect of the Seine has anticipated
                        the day of their demolition, at least of that portion of them between the
                        Porte de Suresnes and the Porte Maillot, by having a plan drawn, in which
                        the ground is marked out in building lots for sale. Now, this strip of
                        ground, 170 acres in extent, borders the Bois de Boulogne; indeed, in places
                        where trees grow thickly in the ditch and across the military zone, it may
                        be said to form part of it The Parisian is rightly proud of the Bois. The
                        idea of the builders’ men cutting up their scaffold poles in its precincts
                        has filled him with anger and alarm, and brought down a shower of
                        imprecations on the practically minded Prefect’s head. Paris demands that
                        the land which the fortifications occupy shall be given back to the Bois
                        from which it was taken, to increase, however infinitesimally, its
                        all-too-small breathing spaces ; and in the end Paris will have its way, The
                        authorities may demur for a time, but Republicans cannot refuse to accord an
                        inch where an Emperor gave an ell, and the fortifications will be saved, as
                        were La Muette and Bagatelle, to be open spaces for ever. </p>
                    <p>Comte Henry de La Vaulx, the well-known French aeronaut, has had many and
                        various adventures in his day, but his latest one smacks somewhat of
                        vaudeville. He and another aeronaut, M Jaubert, went to Algeria to see the
                        eclipse of the sun, and to take observations from their balloon, the
                        Centaure. The trip was most successful, and some very interesting scientific
                        data were scoured. The trouble came after. When the aeronauts made their
                        descent the natives, thinking the aerial monster had something to do with
                        the eclipse, were at fir t disposed to give its passengers a hostile
                        reception ; but in the end they overcame their fear and aided the voyagers
                        from the clouds to come to anchor. When Comte de La Vaulx and his companion
                        had made everything fast they went off in search of something to eat,
                        leaving their photographic apparatus slung up to the rigging of the balloon.
                        "The natives,” they argued, "are so ignorant and superstitions that they
                        will be afraid to touch our cameras.” Bat the native has a very strong
                        propensity for thieving, and as soon as he had come to the conclusion that
                        there was nothing supernatural about the balloon or its passengers, he began
                        to look for plunder. It did not take him long to find it. The result was
                        that when the aeronauts returned to the Centaure they found it stripped of
                        its photographic apparatus. The natives had stolen all the instruments, and
                        although the Count tried to frighten them by telling them that in case of
                        inexpert handling tiny would "go off" with terrible consequences, he might
                        as well have saved himself the trouble. The instruments were not returned. </p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding the exploits of Holbein and Miss Kellerman, the ordinary
                        methods of crossing the Channel are still by steamboat For one thing, it is
                        quicker, and every one has not M. Faure’s balloon and trail rope. Even that
                        interesting machine has to wait upon the wind, Vet, though Channelswimming
                        seems to lack upon the practical side it continues to encourage the art of
                        natation. We had proof of it on Sunday in the contest arranged by the Paris
                        sporting journal known as the "Auto.” Thousands came out to view the prowess
                        of the Channel champions and certain others of home celebrity. The condition
                        were to swim from the Pont National on the East of Paris to the Viaduct at
                        Auteuil on the West. The course is twelve kilometres, or about eight miles—a
                        mere bagatelle one would thing for the famous Trudgeonists who attempted to
                        trudge the path of the ill-fated Webb, this year. But one had not reckoned
                        the wind and the waves, which upset everybody’s calculations. The result was
                        a startling victory for France. </p>
                    <p>If Miss Kellerman’s graceful exhibition of the art of natation had taken
                        place at the beginning of the summer instead of at the end I should in no
                        wise have been surprised to find all the young ladies in Paris—to say
                        nothing of the men—earnestly engaged daring their holidays in a resolute
                        endeavour to learn the art of swimming. Ever since the French began to
                        devote some part of their leisure to the pursuit of sport, swimming has had
                        its place in their programme. But until the athletic young lady from
                        Australia, whose progress under the bridges of Paris on Sunday was watched
                        by thousands of astonished Parisians, visited this city they had never
                        dreamed that swimming was an art in which those of the gentle sex might
                        without effrontery compete on equal terms with the lords of creation.
                        Feminine education in this country is so fundamentally different from what
                        it is in England or in our colonies, that it takes an actual demonstration
                        like yesterday’s to bring the fact home to French people. What the women
                        really think of Miss Kellerman I do not know. But the men were so
                        enthusiastic over “la belle Australienne” that it took all her father’s
                        efforts to prevent bis daughter being wrested bodily from him and carried
                        shoulder high. </p>
