                <head>THE CONGO.</head>
                
                <p>The Congo supplement of the "West African Mail" for September contains some interesting extracts from the report of Captain Baccari of the Royal Italian Navy on the administration of the Congo. We do not propose to discuss the question whether the Congo State Government is cognisant of the atrocities which have been committed by some of its European and many of its native agents, but will confine ourselves to giving a summary. of Capt. Baccari's views on the colonisation of the Kivu-Rasizi district, and the economic shortcomings of the state to which the Italian officer refers. The Free State Government having suggested that the Kivu country might with advantage be colonised by Italians, and having attempted to persuade white emigrants to settle there, Captain Baccari describes the routes which the would-be colonist must follow to reach this new El Dorado. Like the hero of the "Pilgrim’s Progress” he will be confronted by every species of opposition if he travels from Boma  or Mombasa. The Boma route is the worst, involving from 93 to 108 days of continuous travel through districts where the majority of emigrants would be exposed to attack from every species of malarial fever, not to mention dysentery and sleeping sickness. The survivors would be fit for nothing but a long stay in hospital, and as the promised land contains only one doctor, who would be obliged to travel on foot over a district as large as Belgium, their chances of obtaining medical cure and aid are by no means promising. Much of the Mombasa route is dangerous, and even if there was rapid communication with the Kivu country, it is extremely doubtful if the European settlers would thrive, much less increase there. A white man cannot devote himself to manual labour, and as the blacks are being exterminated by two forms of sleeping sickness, one of which more especially affects the negro, and the other, the authorities at Brussels, it would be most difficult for the settlers to find any labour. Nor would the Italian farmer, in Kivu or Ruga-Roga or any other pestilential and unpronounceable locality under the equator, have even the dubious satisfaction of knowing that while he was losing his health he was making an income, seeing that the export of onions or bananas enclosed in soldered tin boxes of 25 kilogrammes, carried for hundreds of miles by porters is likely to pay no one. Experiments in the crossing of zebras and horses, or in the introduction of asses and mules to assist the Congolese officials in the task of transport, may solve the problem,but the climatic dangers cannot be met by any but millionaire colonists, who are always ran, and, if the experience of the South American Republics may hie taken as a guide, have a disappointing way of returning after a brief stay in their new homes, to reside in state directed establishments. Future Galleys and Jabez Baltours may seek Kivu and Ruzizi, but if farmers are really being called upon to settle in these horrid regions, we can only imagine that some official, whose brain has suffered from too long a residence in the tropics, is attempting a cruel practical joke.

In spite of the offer of £10 reward, no trace has been found of the stolen articles.

    <p>Boy Found Buried in a Cotton Field.— Our Santa correspondent writes:—The body of the son of Sheikh Shahata Mansonr of Shou-brabola, near Santa, has been found buried in a cotton field. The lad, who was only twelve years of age, had been missing from his home for three days, and the grief of the parents, at finding that the child has been the victim of foul play, is great. The police are making every effort to find some trace of the criminal, but up to the present they have met with no success.
</p>
    <p>The Ibrahimieh Casino.—The performance at the variety theatre of the Casino, lbrahimieh, on Monday was noted for the début of M. Gaspard and Mlle. Néva, who sustained the reputation which they have brought with them from other countries. These artistes sing duets of a light vein in an attractive manner, and introduce a good deal of dancing, of which art both are good exponents. Mlle Néva has a pleasing voice, and is a very sprightly dancer, and M. Gaspard is an excellent humourist. The items provided by these duettists, added to the rest of the programme, constitute a good all-round evening’s entertainment.
</p>
    <p>Italian National Fete.—To-day being the anniversary of the entry of the royal troops into Rome the Italian communities of Cairo and Alexandria will celebrate the occasion this evening at the various places where special entertainments are to be given. In Alexandria the chief event will be the grand fête at the Alhambra theatre, consisting of short plays, a firework display, and a vocal and instrumental concert, and we feel sure that the knowledge that the proceeds will help to swell the relief fund for the Calabrian sufferers will attract even larger crowds than is usual on these anniversaries.
</p>
    <p>British Chamber of Commerce.—We would draw the attention of manufacturers and merchants to the work of the British Chamber of Commerce of Egypt, which was formed in 1896 with the sole object of assisting British trade in this country. The services of the Chamber are always at the disposal of any member desiring information on trade matters generally, including the question of appointing suitable agents. As no fee is charged for such advice, it is obviously in the interests of all British traders here to become members, especially when it is remembered that the annual subscription is merely the nominal one of £1. The latter payment also includes a copy of the monthly Journal issued by the Chamber. Home enquirers can obtain farther particulars from our London office, 36, New Broad-street, which acts as agents to the Chamber.

<div type="item"><head>THE SUCRERIES.</head>
<head>THE CONCORDAT PREVENTIF.</head>
<p>The application of the Sucreries and Raffinerie d’Egypte to be allowed the benefit of the concordat ’préventif came before the Commercial Chamber of the Cairo Mixed Court yesterday morning. The court was naturally full, the Cairo Bar and Press being well represented. The Court was composed of Mr. Somerville Tuck, presiding Judge, Messrs. Rassim Bey, Boustros, Montan, and Coghlan, Judges, M. Beer and Hussein Effendi Gallal, assessing Judges, Maher Bay, substitute, and M. Zigliara, greffier. After eight unimportant bankruptcy oases had been disposed of, Maître Carton de Wiart rose to plead that the Sucreries Company should be allowed the benefit of the concordat préventif. After recounting the origin of the company and describing its development, he pointed out that the feeling of the creditors was all in favour of the granting of the concordat as the beet solation for themselves and for the company. He cited numerous authorities in support of his contention that a joint-stock company can demand the application of the concordat and that its directors are at fall liberty to state the balance without calling any general meeting of shareholders. As to the question whether the company was in debt, all depended on the question whether it was to be held responsible for the agreements entered into by the late M. Cronier in its name. If so, it was in debt without question, but not otherwise.
</p>
<p>Then came the question of the good faith of the directors. There was no reason to doubt it, for they, like the rest of the world had entire confidence in the agreement made by the firm Henri Say to guarantee the sums for bills discounted. In previous balance sheets the bills accepted by the company were balanced by the say guarantees and these balance sheets had been unanimously approved by the shareholders. Under these circumstances the conduct of the directors could not be impugned.
</p>
<p>Turning to the interests involved, the speaker called the attention of the court to the disastrous results that would follow a declaration of bankruptcy. The agricultural population of a large tract of Upper Egypt, and the employé of the company would suffer terribly and their losses would react most injuriously opon the general prosperity of Egypt.
</p>
<p>Should the directors be found to have acted in a manner unauthorised by the statutes of the company, proceedings might be taken against them in, the future, bat this was not a question for the moment. A provisional arrangement was required in the interests both of the company and its creditors. The names of Sir Elwin Palmer, Harari Pasha and M. Debourg, the proposed administrator under the concordat, were a good guarantee of a successful solution.
</p>
<p>The speech ended a few minutes before 11 a.m. and Maher Bey rose to speak on behalf of the court. He was also in favour of the application of the concordat, but reserved the right, after the examination of the company's books and the expert’s report thereon, to demand that the company should be wound up and its directors—if necessary—prosecuted. The court then retired to deliberate, leaving the audience to discuss the situation and to congratulate Maître Carton de Wiart on his admirable speech. At 12.55 a.m. the court returned and the judgment was read granting the concordat Preventif. It ran as follows :
</p>
<p>“ Le ministère public entendu, nomme M. Tuck, président de la Chambre, jage commissaire à l’effet de procéder aux opérations édictées par la loi en conformité des dispositions de l’article206 (nouveaucode), dépens réservés; ordonne à la Société des Sucreries d'avoir dans les huit jours du prononcé du présent jugement à déposer au greffe ses livres et pièces comptables. "
</p>
<p>The general impression in the audience was one of unalloyed satisfaction. It was felt on all sides' that the granting of the concordat was the only possible solution of the present crisis that would satisfy creditors and shareholders and stave off a disastrous crash. Maître Helou who appeared as counsel for a group of Alexandrian shareholders declined to speak, after the remarks made by Maher Bey with whom he entirely agreed, and the bar was obviously under the impression that the only course that could reconcile a number of conflicting individual interests had been followed by the court.
</p>
<p>(By Telephone).</p>
<p>To-day by the order of Judge Somerville Tuck the Sucreries were authorised to continue their business, bat under the control of Sir E Palmer, Harari Pasha and M. Eugène Debourg. The meeting of creditors will take place on October 4 at 10 a.m. under the presidency of Judge Took, at the Mixed Tribunals, Cairo.

<head>THE AGRICULTURAL SHOW.</head>
<p>(From our Correspondent.)</p>
<p>Fayoum, Sunday.
The agricultural show, which came to an end yesterday, has been a great success. and will long remain a red letter event in the annals of Medinet el Fayoum's history. Both visitors and those who were exhibiting, expressed themselves as greatly pleased with the arrangements which were made and the organising committee is to be highly congratulated upon the success with which their efforts have met.
Daring the three days of the exhibition the whole town was "en fête”, and bands of music were greatly in evidence. There were also two fashionable native weddings, which added to the festivities, especially that of Gofar Pasha, son of the ex-Governor of the Sudan.
The Princes visited the house of Tobla Bay, a member of the Legislative Council, and they took afternoon tea with Khalid Bey yesterday.
Amongst the most prominent visitors to the show on Saturday I might mention Mr. Wilson, of the Ministry of the Interior, Tadrous Bey, proprietor of the “Misr” and Abrahim Bey Ramsi, proprietor of the "Tamadou”.

<div type="item"><head>DEATH OF GEORGE MACDONALD.</head>
<p>London, September 19.
The writer George Macdonald, LL.D. is dead.	(Reuter)
George Macdonald, the celebrated poet and author has passed away at the ripe age of 81. Of late years his name has not been very prominent in the literary world, and living abroad, he only paid annual visits to England. Daring the latter half of the last century he was, however, a power in the land, and such books of his as the "Annals of a Quiet Neighbourhood,” “Guild Court,” “Robert Falconer,” and others were highly appreciated, especially by those in sympathy with his advanced theological views. As a poet he ranked high in the public estimation, and his occasional appearances in the pulpit always drew large congregations.
Dr Macdonald was born at Huntly, Aberdeenshire, in 1824, and was educated at the parish school there, and at King’s College and University, Aberdeen. After taking his degree he became a student for the ministry at the Independent College, Highbury, London, and was for a short time an Independent minister, bat soon retired, became a lay member of the Church of England, and settled in London to pursue a literary career. His first work was "Within and Without, a Dramatic Poem,” 1856 ; followed by "Poems,” 1857 ; "Phantasies, a Faerie Romance,” 1858; “David Elginbrod,” 1862; "Adela Cathcart,” 1864; •The Portent, a Story of Second Sight,” 1864 ; “Alec Forbes of Howglen,” 1865 ; "Annals of a Quiet Neighbourhood,” 1866; “Guild Court,” 1865; The Disciple and other Poems,” 1868 ; "The Seaboard Parish,” 1868 ; "Robert Falconer,”1868; "Wilfrid Cumbermede,” 1871; 'The Vicar's Daughter,” "Malcolm,” 1874; "St. George and St. Michael” 1875; "Thomas Wingfield, Curate,” 1876 ; "The Marquis of Lossie,” 1877. "Sir Gibbie,” 1879; "The Diary of an Old Soul ”1880; "Castle Warlock,” 1882; "Weigh-ed and Wanting,” 1882 ; "The wise woman,” 1888; "There and Baok,” 1891; "Heather and Snow,” 1893 ; "Lilith,” 1895 ; "Salted with Fire,” 1897; "Rampolli,” 1897. Besides these Dr. Macdonald has written books for the young : "Dealings with the Fairies,'' 1867 ; Ranald Bannerman’s Boyhood,” 1869 ; "The Princess and the Goblin,” 1871 ; “At the Back of the North Wind,” 1870 ; and others. He is also the author of "Unspoken Sermons,” 1866 ; and a treatise on the "Miracles of our Lord,” 1870. In 1877 he received a Civil List pension of £100, in consideration of his contributions to literature. Among his well-known works should be mentioned. "The Gifts of the Child Christ,” and other poems, 2 vols., 1882 ; and "The Princess and Cardie,” a fairy romance, 1882.

<p>Suakin, September 13.
Mr. Urquhart, bridge contractor for the Suakin-Atbara line arrived by the Khedivial Mail S S. Dakahlieh and brought with him a number of workmen to replace those whose contracts have expired. Kaimakam Longfield Bey, RE, left for Railhaed on the 11th inst., and will meet Kaimakam Midwinter Bey, RE, and .discuss with him several matters, including the question of what is to be done with the surplus material which remains over from that brought out for the construction of the Suakin-Atbara line. Bim-bashi Sowerby, RE, has taken over Longfield Bey’s work during the latter’s absence.

<p>The work of erecting the new railway bridge at Zifta will shortly be commenced, a large quantity of material having recently arrived from France. This bridge is to be constructed by Messrs. Dayde and Pillé who are one of the three firms whose designs for the Rodah bridges were finally selected, out of a large number that were sent in and submitted to the Ministry of Public Works for final decision, with the resalt as our readers are aware, that the tender of Messrs. Sir William Arrol and Co. was accepted. The new bridge will be to the north of Zifta, between that town and the barrage, and will serve for the new line from Tantah to Zagazig. When this bridge is completed, next year, the same firm will commence the construction of three others, one on the Damietta branch of the Nile, and the other two on the Tewfikieh and Menoufieh canals respectively.

<div type="item"><head>THE COMING TOURIST SEASON.</head>
<p>Messrs. Thos. Cook and Son have just issued their annual illustrated handbook for the Nile services for the coming winter, which will be practically the same as those of last season. Their steamers will begin to ran between Cairo and the First Cataract on the 3rd November and continue until the 23rd of March, with later connecting steamers between the First and Second Cataracts. A new feature, to which we call attention, is the arrangement of combined bookings by Messrs. Cook’s steamer and the Egyptian and Sudan Railways, enabling tourists with only limited time at their disposal to make their visits to Upper Egypt and the Sudan more rapidly than can be done by using the steamers only. Combined tickets are issued as far as Gondokoro, a Uganda, to which there is a Government steamer service once a month from Khartoum by up-to-date boats fitted with electric light, hot and cold baths, etc.

<head>THE KHEDIVE'S ARRIVAL</head>
<p>(From our Correspondent).</p>
<p>Constantinople, September 12.
As the telegraphic agencies have doubtless informed you, H.H. the Khedive arrived here last Saturday by the Orient Express.
</p>
<p>At the Sirkeje station Ibrahim Pasha, grand master of ceremonies, representing the Sultan, H H. Field-Marshal Prince Mohamad Ali Pasha, brother of H H. the Khedive, General Husni Pasha, Captain Hassan Bey, A.D.C. to the Saltan, Mahmoud Bhukri Bey, and numerous other officials were waiting to greet the distinguished visitor. Immediately after leaving the train the Khedive entered a state carriage, accompanied by Ibrahim Pasha, and, followed by two other carriages, in the first of which were Ahmed Pasha Zeki and General Husni Pasha, while Izzet Bey followed in the seoond, drove to the Yildiz Kiosk with a mounted escort. On his arrival the Khedive was most warmly received by the Saltan and remained some time in conversation with him. He then left for Bebek, where he visited his mother, Princess Emina Hanem, and afterwards left for Chiboukli in the launch Rehber, accompanied  by his physician and his chief Imam, Sheikh Osman Effendi.
</p>
<p>Izzet Bey and the thief eunuch, Almas Aga, met his Highness at Mustafa-Pasha station on the Turkish frontier.
</p>
<p>In the evening the Khedive received the visits of the first dragomans of the Powers represented at Constantinople, and begged them to transmit his salutations to their respective ambassadors. Yesterday evening he was present at a grand dinner given in his honor by the Saltan at Yildis.

               <div type="article" scope="international"> <head>THE COTTON INDUSTRY.</head>
                <p>As soon as the wages difficulty in the Lancashire  cotton spinning industry had bee arranged trade resumed its normal state fo the time of the year. August has always been a leading holiday month, and buying and sell ing in piece goods are confined within comparatively  small limits ; this year has been no exception to the rule. For several weeks past shippers to India have operated quite sparing-ly, but, as they had previously bought freely for distant delivery, makers have still fairly full order lists. China, too, has been inactive, and scarcely any contracts of important dimen sions have recently been given cut Stocks in Shanghai are undoubtedly increasing in vo-lume as compared with a year ago. Egypt has increased her purchases, and so has Turkey, but the demands from these outlets are quieter now. The several markets in South America vary somewhat in their imports, but in the aggregate it is astonishing what extensive customers they are for Lancashire calico. At the moment all our cotton looms are very busy, and it looks as if there would be steady employment for several months to come. Manufacturers are still enjoying a most remunerative state of trade ; new weaving sheds are being put down as fast as possible, and loom makers are very much pressed to deliver weaving machinery. There would certainly be more looms running if they could bo obtained, and it would cause no surprise if the leading loom producers increased the size of their machine shops.
                </p>
                <p>Spinners of American yarn in South Lancashire are not doing quite so well, either as regards the profit margin or in the extent of orders coming in from cloth manufacturers. During the recent slack period the margin has been slipping away, and trade has not been nearly so remunerative as it was earlier in the year. The Oldham holidays, which were observed at the end of August, brought some relief to employers, who were finding a little more yam than usual accumulate at the mills. The question of the yarn supply and demand is engaging the attention of those who carefully watch matters of this kind, but it will probably be the close of this month before any opinion on the point worth anything can bo given. In the meantime a good deal will depend on the probable course of prices in the American raw material. Shipping yarns have been dealt in to an enormous extent this year, as may be seen in the Board Trade returns, but in August and part of July there was indeed very little trade passing. Bolton spinners of carded counts have gradually increased, and there is, on the whole, a healthier state of affairs in the  "fine numbers" than has been known for some time past.
                </p>
                <p>Raw American cotton for future delivery in Liverpool has fluctuated in price a good deal during the last few months, and rather violent changes have occurred each week in values. Current prices on the whole are still looked upon as too high, in view of the condition of the supply. The bulls urge that more consideration should be given to consumption, which is no doubt on a larger scale than ever previously experienced. The new American crop is an unknown quantity, but estimates are being put forward, though it is as yet too early to give trustworthy figures. The cotton trade of the County Palatine, as one body, is being urged to get its own reports of the crop, in consequence of the recent Washington Bureau scandal, and it is felt that an experiment of this kind will be forced upon the trade in Great Britain. The matter is being discussed, and after the September holidays more, probably, will be heard of the subject Cotton mill building is still going on, and textile machinists are extremely busy and are quoting, it is said, higher prices for spinning and weaving machinery than was the case twelve months or so ago.
                </p>
                <p>The other week a "slump" occurred in raw American cotton in Liverpool, spot cotton on Friday last being at 5.56., or about 1/2d. per lb. below the highest point of a few weeks ago. The Washington Bureau statement issued last Wednesday week respecting the condition of the growing plant was better than the bulls anticipated and this accounts for the decline in New York. Lancashire spinners are continuing to buy in retail lots, preferring to use up old supplies rather than to purchase tar ahead. The trade want to see a further drop in raw material. The crop is believed to be doing well on the whole.
                </p>
                <p>The total shipments of cotton piece goods for the last eight months are given in the following comparative table : —
                </p>
                <p>1905	 4,076,229,300yds.
                </p>

                <p>1903...		 3,588,314,800yds.
                </p>
                <p>The greatest increase this year as compared with 1904 is to China (230,000,000 yards) ; then comes Japan (61,700,000 yards), Bengal (47,000,000 yards), and Dutch East Indies (39,0x0,000 yards). The Argentine Republic shows a decrease of 26,000,000 yards, and Venezuela 16,000,000 yards. The other few cases of smaller takings are quite unimportant.
                </p>
                <p>The aggregate shipments of cotton yarn for the year so far amounted to 132,114,200lb., against 102,638,1001b. in the corresponding period of 1904 and 101,918,300lb. in the same eight months of 1903. Most of our customers increased their imports, notably India (7,300,0001b.), China (4,700,0001b.), Turkey (3,600,000lb.),Roumanian (2,100,0001b.),Netherlands (5,600,0001b), and Japan (l,600,000lb.).

                <p>Whenever a new element or compound is discovered, the orthodox course of investiga tion consists in noting its effect upon every form of living or non-living matter, in the hope of observing reactions which will throw some light upon the branch of physics concerned. The peculiarities of radium at once attracted the attention of experimentalists, with the result, that a very large number of chemical electrical, and physiological effects have been traced to it. Neglecting those—such as the alleged production of living organisms—which require verification, we still have enough to provide much food for reflection ; and, in fact new properties of the substance are discovered more rapidly than rational explanations can be found for them. Sir William Crookes has investigated the action of radium on diamonds, and described the results obtained in a lecture before the British Association at Kimberley on September 5. Beyond the development of an induced radio activity in the diamonds, no thing very striking might have been expected ; but with radium it seems to be the unexpect ed which generally happens, and in the present case some very curious effects were observed. The diamond is very sensitive to the bombardment of the B radiations, and scintillates under their influence so much that a layer of diamond powder makes almost as good a coating for the screen of a spinthariscope as the usual zinc sulphide. Prolonged contact with radium bromide was found to impart a beautiful blue colour to previously colourless diamonds, materia ly in-creasing their value as “fancy” stones. The effect is not transient, and is not destroyed by long continued heating in strong nitric acid and potassium chlorate. The diamond may also be heated to redness without affecting the tint. Diamonds which had been buried fo over twelve months in radium bromide had also acquired strong radio-active properties, in addition to their blueness. The radiations emanated from the crystals in regular and geometrical patterns, the cause of which is still under investigation. The radio-activity, like the colouration, withstands the most drastic treatment, leading Sir William Crookes to the belief that both these properties depend upon changes deeper than the surface layer of the stone. A diamond made blue and radio active by burial in radium bromide was slowly heated to redness in a dark room. A faint phosphorescence spread over the stone just before the red heat was visible, but after cooling both the colour and the radio-activity seemed quite unaffected. If a diamond is bom barded by radiant matter from the negative pole of a vacuum tube, it not only phosphor esces, bat turns brown and, in time, black. This blackening is only superficial, and is caused by the formation of a layer of graphite on the surface ; different forms of graphite show different degrees of resistance to chemical reagents, some being dissolved by strong nitric acid and others resisting, for a longer or shorter time, the intense powerful oxidising agency of a mixtare of highly concentrated nitric acid and potassium chlorate. Moissan has shown that the power of resistance to this last reagent is in proportion to the temperature at which the graphite was formed ; and it can be deduced with tolerable certainty that the graphite due to molecular bombardment cannot have been formed at a lower temperature than 3,600 deg. Cent. The surface layer of the diamond mast then have been raised to the temperature of the electric arc, although the body of the stone remains comparatively cool. That this is possible is supported by the fact that the superficial layers of a mass of so highly conducting a metal as silver can be raised to a red heat by radiant action, while the interior of the metal is no more than warm. —"Engineering."

                <p>In the course of his report on the trade of Chinde for the year 1904, Mr. Vice-Consul Stanley Hewitt-Fletcher says :
                </p>
                <p>"The discoveries of gold, silver, and copper made some eighteen months ago in the territories of the Compania da Zambesia, and referred to in the last report, are now beginning to be thought important. Two experts have been sent up by a Berlin house to report on the alleged deposits. Should their report be as favorable as is expected in some quarters, considerable developments may be looked for. It appears that there are two goldfields, called respectively Chifumbase and Missale, situated some 100 or 150 miles north-west of Tete. The Compania da Zambesia is desirous of opening up these gold properties, and has appointed a commissioner of mines with full powers to deal with these matters. His offices are at Tete, but a pamphlet in English giving a brief account of the mining regulations may be obtained at the head offices at Lisbon.”
                </p>
                <p>A correspondent of the "Morning Post" says it was the hope of finding the precious metal hat induced the early Portuguese "conquis-tadores” to explore the "River of Good Indica-tions,” and contest its possesion with their Arab predecessors. When Tete was at the height of its prosperity, two and a half cent-uries later, the output of gold passing through this town alone amounted to 130lb. annually, but the growth of the slave trade, which seem ed to offer a speedier mode of becoming rich, depopulated the country and caused the decline of the mining industry. When Livingstone visited Tete in 1856 the annual output was from 8lb. to 10lb., and in recent years it has been still less. Though the Portuguese have practically abandoned the industry, gold-washing is still carried on in a fitful and halfhearted manner by natives, who pack the dust in goose quills and offer it for sale (too often adulterated with copper filings) to such hunters and traders as pass through the country. Curious as it may seem, Livingstone stated on good authority that when natives discovered nuggets they buried them again, believing that they would breed and propagate their species in the form of gold dust,

                <div type="article" scope="international"><head>THE NAPHTHA FOUNTAINS OF BAKU.</head>
                
                <p>Some interesting facts concerning Baku and its oilfields were published a few years ago in a curious little book criticising the Russian Empire, by "An Oriental Widow." Baku, wrote the author, "well deserves the epithet of Petropolis, for no matter where you roam, or what you eat, a hazy odour of petroleum dings about the tea, wine, beefsteak, or tipsy-pud-ding, proving more than nauseous during certain phases of atmospheric disturbance." A-visit to the fountains of naphtha is thus de-scribed
                </p>
                <p>The naphtha jets, spouting up to hundreds of feet, are facilitated in their discharge by steel ramrods, so worked by machinery that they descend into the bowels of the subterranean passages with a sharp crack, and there loosen the surroundings, with the result that the pent-up oil, following in the wake of the retreating steel, forces its way out in gushing torrents. These rods, thirty feet long and eight inches in circumference, descend about a thousand feet, and take half an hour to slide down to the bottom of the shaft, and be pulled up again. The famous geysers of Iceland, the Yellowstone, and New Zealand occurred to our mind, as we watched the enormous black columns of naphtha shoot into the air, and scatter their spray over the adjacent ponds.
                </p>
                <p>One’s clothes develop after a few hours' visit to Baku a decidedly yellow tone, and colours are soon eradicated to the no delight of incompetent laundresses.

                <p>The military authorities propose taking up shortly the consideration of several matters affecting the efficiency of the Imperial Yeomanry. The necessity of keeping down the expenses of officers and men, and of filling up the (commissioned ranks, will have attention ; and the musketry training, with the Hythe course for officers, will be considered, as well as the signalling regulations. Special training of senior officers and their attendance at manoeuvres, and extra training for non-commissioned officers, are suggested for discussion; and there are proposals for the attachment of Regular officers to regiments during their training.

Eu dônuant à votre femme quelques boites de pilules Pink vous faites an oadeau d’au prix modique et cependant d’une grande valeur Vous assurez le bonheur physique et la tranquillité de votre femme et vous assarezen môme temps votre propre tranquillité dômes tique.

Un foyer où la maladie a élu son domicile est bientôt nn foyer malhenrenx. Quand les pilules Pink entrent dans nne maison la maladie en sort.

                <p>La maladie par exemple était entrée chez Madame Marie G. Exarohou Agée de 81 ans, demeurant an Pirée Rue Areos, et elle y régnait depuis 6 ans sons forme d’nne anémie grave. Du jour où Madame Exarohou a prb les pilnles Pink elle a commencé à regagner la santé. Si vous prenez en effet les pilules Pink aujourd’hui votre guérison commencera aujourd’hui.

                <p>"J’ai eu, écrit-elle, plusieurs aooouohemente pénibles qai avaient complètement ruiné ma santé. J’étais devenae toat-à-fait anémique. I me semblait que je n’avais pins de sang bouf la peau, et mes mains et mes pieds tonji n glacés donnaient bien cette impression. J'était excessivement faible et avec la meilleure vo Ion té, je ne pouvais pas entreprendre ud ouvrage tant soitjeea pénible. J’avais en outre an mauvais estomac, de mauvaises digestions qni me faisaient d'abord beanoonp souffrir et indépendamment de cela m’empêchaient de me nourrir suffisamment et contribuaient par oela même à augmenter ma faiblesse déjà très grande. J'ajouterai que je dormais mal, quo je ressentais de l’oppression, des étourdissements. Au bout de six ans de soaffranoes, sans que les médicaments aient pn me soulager, on comprendra qae j’avais perda tout espoir de guérir.

            <p>The extremely cordial welcome which the Channel Fleet is receiving at Copenhagen will be viewed with real satisfaction by this country. We thoroughly appreciate the spontaneous warmth of the greeting offered to our sailors by the kingdom with which we have so much in common. A South German paper, struck by the significant utterances of distinguished Danish authors, asks in bewilderment whether Denmark is to become a British colony. We do not suppose that Denmark intends to become anybody’s colony, but we are glad to think that she has unmistakably shown herself our friend. It is in every way natural that it should be so. The ties of marriage that unite the Royal Houses of the two countries, the ties of commerce that have linked us closer every year— these things form a solid foundation for good friendship ; and even these are not all. We admire in the Danes, as in their Scandinavian neighbours, the same qualities of sturdy independence and manliness which we prize in our own stock. The sense of the connexion between us will certainly gain in depth and durability from the events now going on at Copenhagen.

            <p>The British fleet is a welcome guest to the whole Danish people. With the exception of our Scandinavian neighbours there is no other nation to whom we are bound by such strong ties of friendship and sympathy as with England, the master of the free, open seas, the pioneer of sound and honest commerce all over the world. The Danish nation understands that when such an imposing and mighty representative of the naval power of Great Britain visits our shores it is for the purpose of honoring the venerable old Monarch of Denmark, the father of the British Queen, of demonstrating the friendship towards Denmark, and of intimating that Britain demands the mainten-ance of the freedom of the seas all over the world.

            <p>It is with unaffected pleasure that Englishmen are watching the satisfactory progress of the negotiations between France and Germany with regard to Morocco. Direct interest in that region we have none, except that the person and property of British subjects shall be held inviolate, and that we shall enjoy all reasonable facilities for trade and commerce. The only reason why we took a hand in the diplomatic game that was being played was flat we were bound by Treaty to support the claims of France. Bat it was no part of our policy to draw her into a quarrel with any other Power, or to place on her rights a stronger interpretation than she was herself disposed to assert, We are rejoiced to think that the calm discussions which are being held in Paris between Dr. Rosen and M. Rouvier will result in au equitable compromise.

            <p>The "Matin,” discussing the interview which took place between Dr. Rosen, the new German Minister to Morocco, and M. Rouvier, says that the serious difficulties which existed between France and Germany on the subject of the Morocco Conference seem likely to be settled more quickly than had been anticipat-ed. The German Government, in fact, taking into consideration the state of anarchy that prevails at Tangiers, is stated to be willing to abandon its original choice of that place the venue of the Conference.

            <p>Englishmen plume themselves on having evaded conscription. The pride would be better grounded if they had gained security by other means. They boast of their freedom from the curse of militarism. But unmilitarism is evidently equally expensive, and while other nations get something for their money we are told by Lord Roberts that the British Empire is wholly unprepared for successful war against a first-class military Power. There is no need to discuss conscription, but what does require elucidation by those in authority is how the needful army of half a million men is to be obtained for the defence of the Indian frontier, how it is to bo officered when obtained, and how the wastages of war are to be met, as the Army is at present constituted.

            <p>The essence of the Volunteer Force is its voluntary character. Let Ministers treat the force frankly on that basis, and do all that is possible within that limit to encourage and npromote its efficiency ; and they will find a ready response. But if they try to dragoon it, or by a side-wind to shift the basis of it, they will go a long way to destroying what the Prime Minister declares to be an integral and indispensable element in any sound scheme of Imperial Defence.

            <p>Our Foreign Office is only too true to its traditions of waiting till a crisis is reached, and it shuns, as it did in Morocco and in the Far East, any attempt, to regulate matters before they have reached the acute stage. But the position we occupy towards both Sweden and Norway, the dynastic ties which have so recently connected ns with the Royal House of Bernadotte, and the substantial interest which we have in the nonintrusion of foreign Powers on the North Sea littoral, render it most important to us that matters should not reach extremity in the Peninsula. There is no time to be lost, and an intimation that the Swedish claim with regard to the Norwegian fortresses is unreasonable might bring about a peaceful solution of the present difficulty within forty eight hours.

It is not until Norway his accepted her conditions that Sweden will discuss the question of an arbitration treat. "If so,” the journal continues, "everybody here understands the difficulty of the situation. Our leading men consider, as we all do, that war is a terrible calamity. But they agree that a faithless peace bought with national humiliation  is worse than war.”

            <p>M. Hanotaux has a great belief in the new Anglo-Japanese alliance. In an article in the "Journal” he points out that, though the treaty does not directly menace any other Power, all the Powers will need a great deal of prudence to avoid coming into collision with so formidable a maritime combination. He cannot, however, reconcile the new treaty with the old German treaty respecting the Yangtse Valley If this does not speedily lead to a rapprochement with the Anglo-Japanese group, Germany will be obliged to act independently to maintain and strengthen her present position in China. Russia, of course, is a possible ally, but the unfortunate feature of such a prospect is that Germany now has more to give than to receive. M. Hanotaux does not appear to con template the possibility of China, under the moral influence of Japan, being able to take matters into her own hands. That may be a remote possibility—too remote, perhaps, to be considered. But one day it will have to be reckoned with. Meantime, M. Hanotaux’s tribute to the strength of the Anglo-Japanese alliance may be accepted as a testimony to the chances of peace in the Far East THE TOKIO RIOTS.

            <p>Whilst it would be too much to say that the agitation against the terms of peace has ceased in Japan, steps taken by the authorities have clearly led to a cessation of mob violence. It looks, however, as if it would be some little time before affairs will be normal—the dissatisfaction with the peace will probably be only got rid of by a change of Ministry. The scapegoat method of coarse is not scientific, but it is often very effective, however unjust to the unfortunate scapegoat.

            <p>On the arrival at Plymouth on the 9th Inst of the Orient Pacific liner Omrah, en route to London, a thrilling story of the sea was related.
            </p>
            <p>It appears that on the morning of the previous Wednesday,soon after passing Cape St. Vincent, the third officer, Mr. A. H. Fraser, who was on the bridge, detected something unusual away on the port beam of the mail steamer. What it was could not be at once determined, but Mr. Fraser continued to examine the object floating on the surface of the water away on the seaward side of the Omrah, and speedily other telescopes were trained in the same direction as his, in the effort to detect what it could be.
            </p>
            <p>Later fuller views of this object were ob-t tained, as from time to time the wreckage, for so it now appeared to be, rose on the top of a huge wave, only to be lost sight of the next moment in the trough of the seas, which then, were running very high. The weather indeed, was of a most boisterous character at this time, and the wind was rapidly hardening to a gala. Once convinced, however, that there was wreckage near, the course of the Omrah was altered so as to permit of the object being closely examined, with a view to discovering whether there was anyone on it in need of assistance.
            </p>
            <p>As the great liner drew nearer, Mr. Fraser, made out the form of a human being lying across what was really an improvised raft, constructed of just a couple of planks. Then, almost before the throbbing engines had eased, and while the Omrah was still slowly moving forwards, the lifeboat was rushed into the water, and pulled off under the direction of Mr. Fraser.
            </p>
            <p>In a very short space of time the boat got alongside the raft, and there, without food and water, they found a Spanish sailor lad in a state of collapse and unconscious. The crew hauled him into the boat, Bent adrift the little raft, and then started to pall back to the steamer. The Omrah had been maneuvered by her commander, Lieutenant W. S. Shelford, R.N.R., so as to afford the rescuers as much shelter as possible, and, amid the cheers from the passengers and ship’s company, the boat safely reached the steamer’s side, and soon all were on deck. The castaway was at once handed over to the care of the ship’s surgeon, Dr. Lucas and he gradually recovered, and later was able to relate tragic details of a disaster in which he bad taken a part

            <p>His name, he said, was Juan Delgardo Lam-tano, and he was one of a crew of seven belonging to the Spanish brigantine Carmen, on which he sailed from a port in southern Spain for Setubal, Portugal, on Sunday night, the 3rd inst The Carmen encountered squally weather, and at one o'clock the following morning she suddenly capsized, without the slightest warning, all her crew being thrown into the water.
            </p>
            <p>Juan Lamtano, who is only between eighteen and nineteen years of age, managed, however, to grasp a couple of floating planks, on which he found two other of his fellow-seamen. The two planks were lashed together, and for a time served to keep the trio afloat When daylight came, the horror of the situation presented itself more folly to the minds of the sailors. They wore afloat on a waste of waters with a storm rising, and without a sail in sight. Of food or water there was none, but just before the catastrophe the crew bad all been served with hot coffee. Then night came on, and in those hours of darkness Lamtano lost his two companions, both being swept away by the seas. Overcome by exposure, the lad drifted on the raft for three nights and two days, and daring that time only two vessels came within hailing distance of him, but so weak and feeble was he that he could do nothing to attract their attention. In fact, he gradually feel into a sort of stupor, from which he was roused only to find himself on the Omrah, which con-veyed him to London.

            <p>In view of the interest which is being taken in Colonial cotton-growing, and the importance of the scheme to Great Britain, an official return of the cotton grown in the West Indies will arouse considerable attention. The return also affords convincing testimony to the fact that in some of our Colonies, at all events, cotton can be grown in large quantities and with profit to the producer.
            </p>
            <p>The return alluded to shows that during the quarter ended March last 1,369 bales of cotton were exported from the West Indies, the total weight amounting to 418.1661b., and the estimated value being £19,608. For the second quarter of the year the export totalled 1,637 bales, aggregating 450,4301b, and valued at £16,013. Thus the Weft Indian Colonies exported during the half year 8,056 bales, valued at £85,621, and representing 868,596lb. This return does not include the returns from Jamaica and St Lucia for the second quarter. The amount of Sea Island cotton exported from the five principal Colonies exporting cotton in the West Indies during the half year is given as follows Barbadoes, 589 bales (308,3631b. ), value £10,418; Nevis, 658 bales (131,6581b.) value £6,582 ; St Vincent, 290bales (95,8151b.), value £4,790 ; 8t Kitt’s, 246,bales (75,8451b.), value £8,767 ; Antigua, 228 bales (40,1401b.), value £2,007.

           <div type="article" scope="international"> <head>TREATIES AND PENS.</head>
            
            <p>That another treaty has lately Been signed the world at large is folly aware, but what the world at large does not know is to whom the precious pen with which the treaty is signed is to devolve. To the collector there are few objects more rare than treaty pens, and few that are more highly treasured by those who possess them, which probably accounts for the fact that, apart from the pen used when the Treaty of Paris was signed in April, 1856— and only one pen was used—the average treaty has increased the world’s reliquary by several items.
            </p>
            <p>Thus, when in 1898 the American Commissioners met their Spanish confreres for the purpose of signing the Hispano-American Treaty of Peace, a document that originally comprised. ,600 pages of type-written matter, it was noted that whereas a number of the Americans were provided with handsome pens, expressly purchased for the occasion, the Spaniards were content to use the ordinary quill pens strewn on the table. When each commissioner had signed his name to the Spanish and English versions of the treaty, opposite to his signatures his private seal was attached by tri-colour ribbons, out of compliment to France, in whose capital negotiations were carried on.
            </p>
            <p>Concerning these ribbons an amusing story is related. The commissioners of both countries, as a slight acknowledgment of the courtesy extended to them, requested the officials of the Quai d’Orsay present kindly to furnish them with tri-coloured ribbon for the affixing of the seals, but to the consternation of those in charge of the proceedings,. though diligent search was made, not an inch of the familiar red, white, and blue ribbon could be discovered at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. That the situation was almost painful can easily be understood, but fortunately its awkwardness was quickly dissipated by a genius who was at the head of a department, but who showed by his action on this occasion that he was worthy of an Embassy at the least. "Go,” said he to a messenger, “to M	, the confectioner in the Rue St. Honoré, for a pound of chocolate cakes, and be sure you ask him to tie them up with a tri colour ribbon." The situation was saved.
            </p>
            <p>When in due course this treaty was brought to Washington for the signature of the President, the late Mr. McKinley, Mr. Secretary Hay provided for the occasion a silver penholder, which he expressed his intention of preserving as an historical memento. Whether this historic instrument will eventually be made over to a National collection remains to be seen, but in such event it would form the nucleus of an interesting treaty exhibit that might include the flags of the United States and Panama, in which the Canal Treaty was wrapped when early in 1904 it was carried in triumph from the Palace to the United States Consulate in Panama by policemen.
            </p>
            <p>At precisely 11.15 p.m., on May 31, 1902 the Boer delegates deputed to do so subscribed their signatures to the articles that brought peace to South Africa, in the presence of Lord Milner and Lord Kitchener. What became of the historic pens used on this occasion did not transpire, but it is to be hoped that such historic relics as these are pre served with the same care as that used when the Treaty of Paris of 1856 was signed.
            </p>
            <p>This last-mentioned instrument, at the re quest of the Empress Eugénie, was used by each of the fourteen Plenipotentiaries subscribing their signatures to the document, a graceful concession on their part, inasmuch as the use of one pen may have prejudiced the legibility of their writing not a little. The pen in question, unlike the gold pen presented by some manufacturers of Pforzheim, town in Baden famous for its jewellery work, to Bismarck, on the occasion of the signing of the treaty of peace with France in the year 1871, was a quill plucked from golden eagle’s wing. What rendered the pen remarkable, apart from its associations, was the fact that the quill was mounted in gold and encrusted with diamonds. "Handsome is that handsome does” — the provisions of the treaty proved no more binding through the use of this gorgeous instrument than would have been the case if a goose-quill and disappearing ink had been employed.
            </p>
            <p>That treaty pens have a value other than that which is the product of historic associations was proved when, on bankruptcy proceedings being instituted against the estate of the late Count Franz Falkenbayn in 1901, the pen and penholder used to sign the treaty of the "Holy Alliance,” in 1815, was put op for auction in Vienna. The treaty, it will be recalled, was signed at Paris on September 26, 1815, by Francis I. of Austria, Alexander I. of Russia, and Frederick William III. of Prussia, and the pen used by them on this occasion, when put up to auction a few years ago, elicited a first bid of £5 and a final bid (on the part of Consul-General von Lindheim) of £32.

               <p>Malgré la sympathie dont jouissent les obligations k Lots da Crédit Foncier, les action de cetteSociété n’ont pas eu jasqu’ici on Egypte nn marohé aussi important que oolui de h Dsira, National Bank, Banqae Agricole, Dslts Light, Land Bank, etc. Les fluctuations de prix de cette excellente valeur ont toujours été subordonnées à la Bourse de Paris ; jamais, comme pour les autres titres égyptiens, notri marché n’a pu faire preuve de quelque indépendance, et les transactions ont toujours été restreintes.
            </p>
            <p>La raison de oette inditlérenoe est qu’il y a peu d’aotions en Egypte et que le gros public ne s’est jamais intéressé à cette valeur, ce qui est bien regrettable, car elle constitue un placement de premier ordre.
            </p>
            <p>Il est à espérer que la nouvelle émission de 200:000 actions et l’introduction officielle dn titre sur les marchés de Londres, Alexandrie, le Caire, permettra au publie de prendre position an peu tard, il est vrai, mais, enoore a temps, pour n’avoir pas à le regretter ; car au cours de Frs. 810 moins Frs. 375 non versés soit Frs. 435, les actions du Crédit Fonoier Egyptien pouvent encore avec avantage soutenir la comparaison, soit oomme prix de revient, valeur intrinsèque, valeur d’ave nir, avec n'importe quelle valenr de notre cote offioielle, de quelque importance qu’elle soit. Et à cette comparaison elles tiendraient le premier rang.

            <p>(From a Correspondent.)</p>
            
            <p>Paris, September 13.</p>
            
            <p>The controversy, entitled “La Crise du Patriotism,” is a sign of the times. It has revealed the great broach that really exists between Jaurès and his party and the rest of the nation. Its real meaning is that the Socialist leader has lost much, very much, of his influence. He is no longer the power he once was to sway the Government, and I doubt if he will recover his position. He, alone, cries out against any action in Morocco, preferring to see France adopt a rôle of effacement. No policy could be more out of harmony with the public sentiment. It is his second great mistake: the first was his announced intention to go to Berlin to preach peace and no frontiers. He failed then, as he fails now, to carry the greater number of his party with him.
            </p>
            <p>I am struck with the feeling of disquietude that still prevails. It is reflected on the Bourse. The horizon is covered with clouds, and the wisest heads profess to be unable to read the future. The actual situation in Morocco gives cause for no great anxiety ; it is elsewhere that trouble is looked for- with Morocco as the "motif.” Anglo-German rivalry, according to some, is likely to assume an acute and dangerous form, and, according to others, the anglo-Japanese treaty is fraught with menace to this country. It is supposed that the conquerors will now have their head in Asia, and that Cochin China and French interests therein will be the sufferers. Speculation is still rife as to the real meaning of the compact of Portsmouth. An authority in foreign politics remarked to me “You may take it that China has to pay the price. There is no doubt a secret stipulation between the two belligerents that China should provide a pecuniary 'quid pro quo’ to Japan for the return of Manchuria. It is not likely that Japan would be foolish enough to give it back for nothing. I imagine, also, that under the head of prisoners’ maintenance, Japan will receive a pretty considerable compensation from Russia. Otherwise the forfeiture of the indemnity is inexplicable."
            </p>
            <p>The tares so sedulously sown by the French Internationalists in the good wheat of French patriotism are producing the evil crop that might have been expected. Last Friday, during the army manoeuvres near Avignon, two shots were fired at the colonel commanding the 58th regiment of infantry. The bullets whizzed past the colonel’s ear, and one of them carried away two fingers from the hand of a soldier standing near. In spite of a strict examination of all the rifles and ammunition pouches, the author of the attempt was not discovered. It is a regular maxim of the followers of M. Gustave Hervé and his fellow "Sans-patrie” that it is the duty of the soldier in time of war to shoot down his officers, and that doctrine is openly preached on the platform and in infamous pamphlets such as the "Manuel du Soldat.” The German scare has opened the eyes of the French people to the danger of this sort of propaganda ; but no real progress will be made towards suppressing it until the Government frankly make up their minds to treat the enemies of France within her own household as if they were no better than mere monks and nuns. They are reaping as they have allowed the Socialists to sow, and they have no right to be surprised at the character of the harvest.
            </p>
            <p>The well-known French journal "La France Militaire” of September 1 discussed in an article entitled "The Entente Cordiale : Its Strategical Hypotheses,” the future of France in a war with Germany if Great Britain joins the Dual Alliance. Col. Gaedke comments in the "Berliner Tageblatt” upon the article referred to. He thinks it unlikely that France and Russia will unite in a war against Germany, and also that Austria's attitude would be a doubtful one in case of such a war,
            </p>
            <p>After referring to the loss of the Elbe mouth and the general moral effect of a successful English landing in Holstein, Col. Gaedke says that "alliance between England and France would not be, perhaps, so disagreeable to Germany as has been that between France and Russia, but it would result, nevertheless, in a very unpleasant and serious war, which could inflict upon Germany’s national flourishing welfare a blow from which it would not recover. Will Germany make the necessary deductions from these remarks ?”
            </p>
            <p>Col. Gaedke was one of the first military critics to warn the outside world against under-estimating Russia’s military strength even after its overthrow by Japan ; still, is of opinion that Russia will not be able to undertake any great military activity for a very long time, especially as the war with Japan has left it far more vulnerable in Asia than it was before. In view of the recent Anglo-Japanese Treaty Russia will have to increase its strength in Turkestan. France cannot remain long with two irons in the fire, and if war breaks out in Europe, then France must quickly choose between England and Russia, and even, perhaps, between England and Germany. The French article says that England and France could together send to the German coastline a united squadron twice as large as that of Germany. Col. Gaedke points out that the two Powers could send a naval squadron thrice a large as that of Germany. "La France Militaire” points out that a powerful English fleet in the Baltic would compel the German fleet to keep under the protection of its coast defences; the English squadron could blockade Dantrig. Swinen Unde, and Kiel, while an Anglo-French Squadron could blockade Cuxhaven. Moreover, Germany’s outlook is by no moans cheering from a landing aspe3t thus, the Schleswig-Holstein coastline, especially on the east, offers many points suitable for landing troops, while the German railways running thither are only of single tracks ; that is they would not be of very much use in conveying large bodies of troops to repel an invasion, and it would be quite possible for au immense English force to land if the necessary preparation had been made, and if the Gorman Reserve Division had not been mobilised in Schleswig-Holstein in due time.
            </p>
            <p>The influence of fatigue on workmen, and the part it plays in relation to accidents has lately formed the subject of an exhaustive inquiry on the part of M. Imbert Professor at the Montpellier Faculty of Medicine, and M. Mestre, a factory inspector in the Department of the Hérault. From their united investigations very dear and important indications have been obtained relating to the physio-logioal conditions during the hours of labour. These observations have shown that the number of accidents increases progressively hour by hour during the first half-day : that after the rest at midday the number of accidents is notably less than in the last hour of the forenoon ; that in the ourse of the second halfday accidents again become, from hour to hour, progressively more numerous ; and that the maximum number of accidents towards the end of the second half day is notably higher than the corresponding maximum in the morning. The influence of the workmen’s fatigue on the production of accidents stands out clearly from these observations, and it is easy to understand how this comes about when it is remembered that with fatigue the attention rapidly diminishes and disappears. The conclusion, therefore, is that in order to produce a diminution in the number of accidents  it would be sufficient to intercalate in the middle of each halt day of work a period of repose, naturally not so long as that at midday, but the length of which remains to be determined. In fact, one would only have to apply to the manual labour of adults, the measures which for a long time have been put into practice for children as regards their intellectual labour.
            </p>
            <p>However this theory may suit in France, it is hardly likely to commend itself at once to the practical minds of Englishmen. The Englishman’s theory is :	Not too long hours, but the maximum of effort while you’re at it. The Frenchman, on the other hand, does not greatly mind if he starts fairly early, and keeps on till seven or eight o'clock, provided that he has two hours for luncheon and a rest in the afternoon. If you ever watched Frenchmen at work on a building in course of construction you would be surprised at the number of times during the day that they are missing from the building, and if you wanted to find them yon would only have to discover the nearest wineshop. There they are—masons, plumbers, and painters, having copious draughts of claret, and when it comes to the luncheon hour they sit down to a repast whose courses are never less than four or five, followed by café and the inevitable  "petit verre.” Should any of the workmen feel in a sportive mood—and the Frenchman is an inveterate gambler—then the dice will be brought out, and another "petit verre” will be thrown for, with the result that when the meal is finished, and the last glass of cognac and the final cigarette have been paid for, the mason and the plumber and the painter would much rather remain at table than restart work. At the same time, I most say this injustice to the tradesmen in Paris, that when they build they build well, for I have never seen anywhere more solid and more artistic work than in Paris.
            </p>
            <p>One result of the extensive excavations now going on in Paris, owing to the operations rendered necessary by the metropolitan under-ground railway, is that several districts of the city have been invaded by enormous quantities of rats. Before the navy and his pick dislodged them from their quarters in the sewers and drains the rats were quite comfortable in their retreat, but now that they have been obliged to quit their haunts the ratepayers along the line of the new railway are complaining  bitterly of the unwelcome visits paid to them by the homeless rodents. On the 7th inst., while a temporary bridge for the passage of tramways was being pulled down in the Boulevard de Strasbourg, enormous numbers of rata ware expelled from their quarters, and, in anticipation of this, arrangements had been made to exterminate them. Men with sticks, stones, and picks wore waiting for the rats, and when the moment came, and the four-footed army swept in their flight through the galleries of the underground railway they were massacred by hundreds.
            </p>
           <p>After the system of underground railway lines has been completed, the next big work to be taken in hand is the levelling of the fortifica tions—the dry ditch and zig-zag bastions round Paris, which lost all military value years ago, but which the War Office, conservative as our own, has been reluctant to pull down. They have served as an octroi barrier; as a play ground for the national guard in 1870 ; and since for the poorer people of Paris, who pic-nic there on Sundays, and know no other country scene. But as the fortifications they have been always known. Now they are to disappear. At the right moment, when work begins to get scarce in Paris, the unemployed will be turned on to throw the bastions into the ditch, and level the glacis, and to break op the girdle of earth and stone which binds the city round, and cuts it off from its suburbs as from a foreign land. This rule of the paternal French Government of always having in view some work for spare hands to do is excellent and necessary, for unemployed demonstrations in Paris might take an awkward turn. Ratepayers sometimes grumble at having to pay more taxes in consequence, but really the scheme saves money as well as trouble. The costs are sometimes more apparent than real on works undertaken for the benefit of the unemployed, such, for instance, as the great Paris exhibitions, which, in addition to filling the pockets of hotel proprietors and shop-keepers, served to balance the scales of supply and demand in labour. Fortunately, work will be plentiful enough during the next few years to make the holding of an exhibition in 1911 unnecessary.
            </p>
            <p>To come back to the fortifications, the Prefect of the Seine has anticipated the day of their demolition, at least of that portion of them between the Porte de Suresnes and the Porte Maillot, by having a plan drawn, in which the ground is marked out in building lots for sale. Now, this strip of ground, 170 acres in extent, borders the Bois de Boulogne; indeed, in places where trees grow thickly in the ditch and across the military zone, it may be said to form part of it The Parisian is rightly proud of the Bois. The idea of the builders’ men cutting up their scaffold poles in its precincts has filled him with anger and alarm, and brought down a shower of imprecations on the practically minded Prefect’s head. Paris demands that the land which the fortifications occupy shall be given back to the Bois from which it was taken, to increase, however infinitesimally, its all-too-small breathing spaces ; and in the end Paris will have its way, The authorities may demur for a time, but Republicans cannot refuse to accord an inch where an Emperor gave an ell, and the fortifications will be saved, as were La Muette and Bagatelle, to be open spaces for ever.
            </p>
            <p>Comte Henry de La Vaulx, the well-known French aeronaut, has had many and various adventures in his day, but his latest one smacks somewhat of vaudeville. He and another aeronaut, M Jaubert, went to Algeria to see the eclipse of the sun, and to take observations from their balloon, the Centaure. The trip was most successful, and some very interesting scientific data were scoured. The trouble came after. When the aeronauts made their descent the natives, thinking the aerial monster had something to do with the eclipse, were at fir t disposed to give its passengers a hostile reception ; but in the end they overcame their fear and aided the voyagers from the clouds to come to anchor. When Comte de La Vaulx and his companion had made everything fast they went off in search of something to eat, leaving their photographic apparatus slung up to the rigging of the balloon. "The natives,” they argued, "are so ignorant and superstitions that they will be afraid to touch our cameras.” Bat the native has a very strong propensity for thieving, and as soon as he had come to the conclusion that there was nothing supernatural about the balloon or its passengers, he began to look for plunder. It did not take him long to find it. The result was that when the aeronauts returned to the Centaure they found it stripped of its photographic apparatus. The natives had stolen all the instruments, and although the Count tried to frighten them by telling them that in case of inexpert handling tiny would "go off" with terrible consequences, he might as well have saved himself the trouble. The instruments were not returned.
            </p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the exploits of Holbein and Miss Kellerman, the ordinary methods of crossing the Channel are still by steamboat For one thing, it is quicker, and every one has not M. Faure’s balloon and trail rope. Even that interesting machine has to wait upon the wind, Vet, though Channelswimming seems to lack upon the practical side it continues to encourage the art of natation. We had proof of it on Sunday in the contest arranged by the Paris sporting journal known as the "Auto.” Thousands came out to view the prowess of the Channel champions and certain others of home celebrity. The condition were to swim from the Pont National on the East of Paris to the Viaduct at Auteuil on the West. The course is twelve kilometres, or about eight miles—a mere bagatelle one would thing for the famous Trudgeonists who attempted to trudge the path of the ill-fated Webb, this year. But one had not reckoned the wind and the waves, which upset everybody’s calculations. The result was a startling victory for France.
            </p>
            <p>If Miss Kellerman’s graceful exhibition of the art of natation had taken place at the beginning of the summer instead of at the end I should in no wise have been surprised to find all the young ladies in Paris—to say nothing of the men—earnestly engaged daring their holidays in a resolute endeavour to learn the art of swimming. Ever since the French began to devote some part of their leisure to the pursuit of sport, swimming has had its place in their programme. But until the athletic young lady from Australia, whose progress under the bridges of Paris on Sunday was watched by thousands of astonished Parisians, visited this city they had never dreamed that swimming was an art in which those of the gentle sex might without effrontery compete on equal terms with the lords of creation. Feminine education in this country is so fundamentally different from what it is in England or in our colonies, that it takes an actual demonstration like yesterday’s to bring the fact home to French people. What the women really think of Miss Kellerman I do not know. But the men were so enthusiastic over “la belle Australienne” that it took all her father’s efforts to prevent bis daughter being wrested bodily from him and carried shoulder high.
