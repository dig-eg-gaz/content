                    <p>"Four newly discovered MSS. of the Bible were reported at the meeting of the
                        Archæological Institute of America." says the New York "Nation," "Prof. H.
                        A. Sanders, of the University of Michigan, reported on four manuscripts of
                        the Bible, now in the possession of Charles L Freer, of Detroit. The
                        manuscripta were bought by Mr Freer early in 1907 in Egypt. They were
                        probably buried or lost at the time of the Moslem conquest in 639 A.D. At
                        any rate the manuscripts all date that period, nor, in the opinion of
                        Professor Sanders, do they contain any inarks of a second hand even, which
                        can be placed later than this date. </p>
                    <p>"Two of the manuscripts are in a large ancial hand, two in small, and there
                        are other variations sufficient to convince Prof. Sander that the individual
                        manuscripts were written at different dates, ranging from the third to the
                        sixth century. He refers to the manuscripts by the Roman numerals I, II,
                        III, and IV. Manuscript I now contains Deuteronomy and Joshua; Genesis to
                        Numbers inclusive, which it once contained, are missing. It is next to the
                        oldest of the four manuscripts, and presents an exceptionally accurate text
                        of this portion of the Septuagint. Manuscript II, contains the Psalms.
                        Although it is the oldest manuscript of the four, and is badly decayed,
                        large portions of every Psalm will prove recoverable. A comparison of a
                        portion of the text shows that it is one of the best manuscripts of the
                        Psalms in existence; in the large portions where the Vaticanus fails, it is
                        perhaps the very best. </p>
                    <p>"Manuscript III. contains the four Gospels entirely. It was probably written
                        in the fifth or sixth century, and contains many interesting variant
                        readings. It is most important, however, because it contains the following
                        extra paragraph : </p>
                    <p>"And they answered, saying that this age of unrighteousness and unbelief is
                        under the power of Satan, who does not permit the things which are made
                        impure by the (ovil) spirits to comprehend the truth of God (and) his power.
                        For this reason, "Reveal thy righteousness now," they said to Christ, and
                        Christ said to them: "The limit of the years of the power of Satan has been
                        fulfilled, but other terrible things are at hand, and I was delivered unto
                        death on behalf of those who sinned in order that they may return to the
                        truth and sin no more, to the end that they may inherit the spiritual,
                        indestructible glory of righteousness (which) is in heaven." </p>
                    <p>"This new paragraph was known to St. Jerome, and the first few lines of it
                        are oited in Latin translation. It has long been held that Mark xvi. 8-20
                        was a state addition to the Gospel, thought to have been borrowed from some
                        other unknown Gospel near the end of the second century. This new manuscript
                        probably presents the original form of that part of the lost Gospel, which,
                        mutilated, was added to Mark. The reason for the omission is quite apparent,
                        as the new verse contains the statement that the destruction of sin in the
                        world is near at hand. This idea is found in the epistles of Peter and Paul,
                        but the four Gospels do not have it, and it is avoided by the later Church
                        writers. </p>
                    <p>"Manuscript IV. is only a badly decayed fragment. It once contained Acts and
                        the Epistles, but not Revelations. It is an older and better manascript than
                        the four Gospels, and its readings will be of value." </p>

                            Cairo which the hand of time and the exigencies of modern life have

                    <head>The Abdin Incident</head>
                    <p>The Sheikh Razi incident continues to arouse the keenest excitement and
                        interest in native circles and contradictory rumours are as usual published
                        and repeated as facts in every direction. If all the versions current in the
                        native Press are accurate then we are faced by the fact that Sheikh Razi was
                        and is, at one and the same time, a bigoted reactionary and a pestilent
                        revolutionary, an impious wretch and a virtuous cleric, that he was expelled
                        from the Khedivial reception on the ground of a personal quarrel with a
                        member of the Maieh Sanieb, and that he left Abdin on his own motion on
                        hearing that H. H. The Khedive declined to receive him, etc. etc. In any
                        case, it is quite certain that a group of Ulema who had made certain
                        complaints concerning the administration of the Al Azhar University, was
                        admitted to the presence of his Highness at the Courban Beiram reception and
                        by him severely reprimanded. Their excuse was the usual one – "it was the
                        other boy that did it, Sir, not me," and Sheikh Razi was held responsible.
                        "Al Akhbar" adds that the Sheikh who has been loud in his complaints was
                        recently informed that if he continued to discuss his grievances in public
                        he would be degraded from his office. Meanwhile "Al Zaber" deplores a
                        national calamity and brings out funereal columns with the deepest and
                        blackest borders and the non-Moslem public demands more anxiously – who is
                        Sheikh Razi "What has he done." Can "Al Moayad" or "Al Garida" give us a
                        good account of the incident and its causes ?" </p>

                    <p>To the Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette."</p>
                    <p>Sir --Referring to the letter signed "Observer" in your issue of yesterday I
                            beg to state that the statutes of the above named company provision is
                            made for operating "dans des pays limitrophes à l'Egypte'' and the
                            opening of business in Cyprus was voted in due form at a general meeting
                            of shareholders held a few months after the company's formation. As on
                            this point "Observer" seems to have misunderstood the letter signed by
                            myself and colleagues which appeared in your number of the 22nd instant,
                            others of your readers may have likewise done so. You will therefore
                            find room for this rectification in your columna. There may possibly be
                            cases in which the suggestions of "Observer" might prove exceedingly
                            pertinent and useful, but they are not of application to the
                            Anglo-Egyptian Land Allotment Co. The success of the company in Cyprus
                            will depend on the degree to which intelligence and a rigid economy are
                            exercised in the administration there, but the directors were
                            unquestionably entirely within their rights in opening business in the
                            island. </p>

                    <p>The Egyptian Bonded Warehouses Company Limited have already begun working the
                        freight service of the Express Nile Steamers Limited. There are fourteen
                        steam barges and some tenders belonging to the Express Nile Company. </p>

                    <p>False Report in "Times"</p>
                    <p>We are astonished to read the following report in the weekly edition of our
                        London contemporary the "Times" : </p>
                    <p>"A bulletin issued at Cairo says that 27 cases of cholera have occurred. At
                        Mecca there have been 241 deaths, but none at Jeddah." </p>
                    <p>We can safely assert that no such bulletin was issued, as there has as yet
                        been no case of cholera either in this country or in Sudan. </p>
                    <p>We trust that our contemporary will immediately rectify their error, which
                        may prove deplorably detrimental to Egypt. The report will be eagerly seized
                        upon and enlarged by those who are responsible for booming rival winter
                        resorts, and, emanating from the paper which has the highest standing in the
                        world of journalism, will be relieved by all who read it. </p>
                    <p>We trust that in the interests of the Egyptian public the "Times" will give
                        prominence to an emphatic contradiction of so damaging and so false a
                        report. </p>
                    <p>The upmost possible precautions are being taken by the authorities to exclude
                        the disease, and, though its advent is possible, it is at the same time
                        probable that we shall escape it altogether. </p>
                    <p>We greatly deplore the fact that the first newspaper of the world should have
                        given publically to this incorrect news, the effect of which no one can at
                        present judge.</p>

                    <head>Zizinia Theatre</head>
                    <p>"Lohengrin"</p>
                    <p>With the production of Wagner's "Lohengrin" the Societa Artistica of
                        Alexandria have placed before their ever appreciative audience perhaps the
                        most successful attempt this season. The opera itself is too well known to
                        require mach comment at this period. It might be of interest however to
                        remark that Lohengrin, Knight of the Holy Grail, is introduced as a symbol
                        of Christianity defeating the Frieslandish heathenism in the wiles and
                        machinations of the sorceress Ortrud. </p>
                    <p>After the splendid performance of Signorina Salomca Crucsenski in "Madame
                        Butterfly" it was a foregone conclusion that her "Elsa" would be, at least,
                        in no degree inferior to any previous interpretation of the character on the
                        Zizina stage. Last night's production clearly proved this. Her performance
                        was throughout, artistic in the extreme A delightful rendering of one of
                        Wagner's tenderest compositions, a rendering overflowing with inexpressible
                        sweetness and played with perfect grace. </p>
                    <p>As "Lohengrin" Signor Italo Cristalli met with very hearty appreciation. He
                        contributed considerably to the entire success of the opera and with
                        Signorina Crusceniski on several occasions moved the large audience to a
                        pitch of unwonted enthusiasm. </p>
                    <p>Signor Oreste Benedetti's "Federico" was a very meritorious performance and
                        in conjunction with Signorina Margherita Julia, who gave an excellent
                        portrayal of the rather thankless, and at the same time extremely difficult,
                        rôle of Ortroda, scored a distinct success. </p>
                    <p>Signor Lodovico Contini appeared hardly sufficiently robust for the trying
                        music of King Enrico, but his rendering was on the whole a good one. A
                        special word of praise is also due to the "Herald," Signor F. Rosconi. </p>
                    <p>Signor Giovanni Zaocani is to be congratulated on the excellence of his
                        orchestra, and the chorus master is certainly to be complimented upon the
                        high degree of perfection attained in his particular sphere.</p>

                    <p>"La Boheme."</p>
                    <p>Surely no more touching and exquisite Mimi than Signora Coniglio could be
                        seen. Not a detail of her acting, not a least inflection of her voice but
                        was perfect, telling, memorable, not merely for Cairo but for any stage. So
                        quiet, so charming, knowing her world of mirth and sorrow, hunger and gaiety
                        80 well, no intent a listener, waiting on her lover's every word, so
                        pathetic in her resignation and sympathy at the last, surely she moved all
                        as she indeed moved some of us. The beauty of the 'addio' song, all its sad
                        knowledge, and hope -"addio sospetti!"-farewell doubt and trouble, farewell
                        sorrow, farewell all, seve pity and love.-she so well knew all love had
                        brought and yet would bring, of happiness or unhappiness, - and the wonder
                        of the death scene, were revealed as they seldom can be. </p>
                    <p>The rest of the performance was never, one must confess it. The conductor was
                        by no means at his best in the second act, and he missed one or two entries
                        of the singers badly. He can do far better than that, and we must hope it
                        will be the last occurrence of its kind. Signor Ventara was not at his best
                        until the very end : there he excelled, and his acting was fully worthy of
                        the situation. His make-up was most trying, and he should really pay more
                        attention there too. The general impression as to the others, was that they
                        could do far better; they were not at their ease, and consequently the
                        spirit and continuity of the performance was not maintained. The 'coat' song
                        was embarrassed and uncertain and hardly deserved the encore it obtained But
                        then one could not but contrast it with Signor Lucenti's masterly and
                        faultless rendering last year. </p>
                    <p>Still these were all minor defects in a memorable performance. Manon Lescaut
                        and LA Tosca are not at present being rehearsed. La Tosca should be
                        especially noteworthy. I hope to see the three chief parts taken by Signor
                        Coniglio, Sigtor Ventura, and Signor Challis That combination would ensure
                        the needs of most operas and above all of La Tosca.</p>

                    <p>The Clayton Company's steam launch No. 2 has arrived at Suez, ready for the
                        disinfection of steamers. </p>
                    <p>The Russian Pilgrim Steamer "Gregory Morch'' which was ashore off Jeddah, and
                        subsequently refloated by the Danish salvage steamer "Denmark", has now
                        entered the K. M. S.S. and Graving Dock Co. dry dock at Suez for repairs. </p>
                    <p>Owing to the heavy rains of late the railway line between Fayed and Nefiche
                        stations has been seriously interrupted, and the repairs will not be
                        completed before Friday. In the meantime, passenger trains leaving Suez for
                        Ismailis can only go up to the undamaged place, and on the other side the
                        Ismailia train awaits to which passengers have to walk. The goods trains
                        have been temporarily stopped both at Ismailis and Snez.</p>

                    <head>Aerated Water for Health</head>
                    <p>The importance of pure water, for drinking purposes cannot be overestimated
                        and overy precaution should be taken, such as redistillation, to insure
                        protection to health. </p>
                    <p>Many physicians advise drinking the ex. clusive use of carbonated or "fizz"
                        waters, because the process of oxygenating water under pressure destroys all
                        animate genus. </p>
                    <p>The robust health of the English and the consumption of more than 4,000,000
                        gallons of Aerated water in 1907 indicate the value of this method of
                        preventing epidemics. </p>
                    <p>"The London Lancet, a high medical authority, in commenting upon this
                        extensive use of effervescing beverages, stated that the effervescent
                        properties of a liquid promote digestion in two ways-first, by the carbonic
                        acid gas acting as a stimulant to the muscular movements of the stomach,
                        and, second, by assisting in the disintegration of its contents. What
                        interests most people, however, is not the scientific reasons for the
                        extensive use of sparkling wine, like champagne, or of pare, effervescent
                        water, like Tansan, but rather their availability and cost. "But we are
                        learning once more in regard to water the lesson that the world has learned
                        as to almost everything else we take into our systems; the count of purity
                        is less than the cost of doctors' bills or than the supreme cost of death.
                        The popular appreciation of this fact is in part reflected in the enactment
                        of the pure food law. It is shown also in the growing use of effervescent
                        water of assured purity and softness. A distinguished French physician says
                        that man is as old as his arteries. Hard water hardens the arteries, soft
                        water keeps them elastic and responsive to the pulse. Hence it is that the
                        Japanese attribute much of their vitality, prowess, and progress to the
                        generous use of their native sparkling water.”</p>

                        <p>"The strength of a nation depends upon the health of the people," said
                        Dr. Bedloe of Washington D.C. to an "Egyptian Gazette" representative at the
                        Khedivial last evening in speaking of the Pure Food Law now in force in
                        America. </p>
                    <p>"The American people, "continued Dr. Bedloe, "have now a Pare Food Law,
                        thanks to President Roosevelt and the American Congress, that protects the
                        public from the rapacity of compounders of cheap and injurious food products
                        that were formerly sold as genuine, thus obtaining money under false
                        pretences and committing a crime against humanity. </p>
                    <p>"The Pure Food Law of the United States is the result of a demand on the part
                        of the American people who now have protection similar to that in Great
                        Britain. </p>
                    <p>The bill was long delayed in Congress by the opposition of a powerful lobby
                        made up of a combination of compounders of spirituous liquors, such as
                        experts at Shoomakers in Washington pronounce a brand of "that's all bad
                        whiskey"; food adulteration; quack-medicine men and wicked beer-brewers; but
                        'vox populi prevailed. </p>
                    <p>"The law has been in forgoe a little more than a year and has already made a
                        profound change in American industries and an improvement in public health. </p>
                    <p>"The enforcement of the Pure Food Law depends chiefly on the Bureau of
                        Manufactures which is one of the bureaus of the department of commerce and
                        labor under the direction of Secretary Oscar Strauss the renowned
                        philanthropist of New York and former American Ambassador to Turkey. </p>
                    <p>"Major John M. Carson is the chief and executive head of the Bareau, an
                        intelligent, aggressive and capable official who, for many years, was the
                        Washington correspondent of The N.Y. Times and Philadelphia "Ledger." Chief
                        Carson has done good work in organizing and directing a staff of special
                        agents attached to his bureau for the purpose of investigating, exposing and
                        checking frauds in the manufacture of food products. He has driven ont of
                        the market such practices as using copper salts to color green-peas, string
                        beans, and spinach aniline dyes to color beets, tomatoes, tomato ketchup,
                        chili-sauce, cherries, ete: Salycilic acid and formalde-hyde to preserve
                        milk-compounds, fish, sausage and many albuminoids ; the mixing of colza
                        with olive oil; the substitution of bogus and sophisticated for genuine
                        wines : the mixing of cocoa and chocolate with brown-starch and clay; the
                        adulteration of spices with ground coconut-shell ; and the numberless other
                        practices by which unscrupulous greed thrives at the expense of public
                        health. </p>
                    <p>"This evil is not confined to the United States. The reports of European
                        chemists <cb n="3"/>and official investigators show that similar methods are obtained abroad. </p>
                    <p>Lloyds Now" of London, January 19th 1908 has this to say on the subject of
                        Adulteration of Food. </p>
                    <p>"The annual report of the operations ander the sale of Food and Drugs Act has
                        just been published, and it shows that adulteration is still regarded as a
                        fine art. Out of 60,000 samples of milk, butter, and choice which were
                        examined in 1906 it was found that over 11 percent of milk, 7 percent of
                        butter, and a comparatively small percentage of chewe were adulterated in
                        various ways. The difficulty arises principally in the areas of small local
                        authorities with limited resources. It is on record that in one district of
                        about 4,000 inhabitants margarine isi habitually substituted for water
                        because, owing to the incompetence of the only officer who can be employed
                        as a mpling official, the unitary authority is able to take proceedings. The
                        obvious deduction is that if the laws are to be put in force greater powers
                        must be given to the local authorities, and more stringent demand must be
                        made for the application of those powers without respect of persons </p>
                    <p>As an example of political morals: the French-law may be cited, which
                        prohibits the coloring of vegetables by copper for domestic , but permits it
                        for exportation ! </p>
                    <p>"In Germany the adulteration of wine and beer is prohibited for home
                        consumption but permitted for portation. It is an open secret that wine from
                        enna and beer from Munich are "doctored' for shipping to the United States. </p>
                    <p>"This price of "fixing," so called, for the American constimer, is practiced
                        by the bottlers of a mineral water, "made in Germany where the water is
                        salted" for exportation. </p>
                    <p>"Our European neighbours object to being poisoned themselves, but do not mind
                        turning an honest (1) ponny in poisoning us! </p>
                    <p>"Here is where Major Carson's Bureau of manufactures is invaluable to the
                        American consumer. From his special agents sent abroad from time to time to
                        various countries, the bureau obtains full information respecting the
                        fabrication of impure and unwholesome foods and thus enables our home
                        authorities to prevent their introduction into American markets. This
                        special service cannot be done by consuls or diplomats. </p>
                    <p>"Under international law they are regarded as the creatures of the nation
                        which sends them and the nation which receives them and the moment they make
                        themselves non grata, they have to be recalled or transfered. </p>
                    <p>"Suppose, for instance, a consul at Marseilles ascertained the &amp; merchant
                        there was exporting sardines which contained ptomaines, and reported the
                        fact at Washington. When the news got back to Marseilles, as it would in
                        sixty days, what would be that therchant's feelings toward the consul, and
                        how long would it be before he lodged a protest in Paris against this Yankee
                        interference with a Frenchman's rights t' </p>
                    <p>"How soon would the Marseilles press denounce the presumption and small
                        mindedness And arrogance of the American Consult </p>
                    <p>"How long before the French Government informed our own at Washington that
                        the Console was a persona non grata 1 Fortunately for us it is now different
                        with the Bureau of manufacturer </p>
                    <p>"The special ent now gathers all the facts at Marseilles out of trouble or
                        delay. These Agents of the Waren are experts and independent of all
                        political, legal, and sociare lations and ties, and, being the servants of a
                        Government Bureau at Washington, their personality abroad never enters into
                        the matter. </p>
                    <p>"The success of this important work, of course, depends on the personality of
                        the agents. They dedicated trained and traveled men. In many instances they
                        are college graduates, linguists, men with a knowledge of chemistry,
                        microscopy, foreign languages and commercial relations. </p>
                    <p>"To select such men demands talent, but it has been done by Chief Carson with
                        satisfactory results demonstrated in the reforms effected and vast increase
                        of American commerce."</p>

                        division, junior to those belonging to the regular course which covers a
                        period of four years. There are many pupils of five years old in the baby

                    <p>The Rev. R. MacInnes M.A. gave the first of a course of lectures on the
                        History of Egypt st Connaught House on Thursday, after noon, a fair audience
                        taking advantage of the coasion to add to their store of knowledge on the
                        interesting subject. 4x the course is only to include four lectures and the
                        subject is a very long one, it is not possible to dwell long on any one
                        period; but the Rev. MacInnes's introductory lecture was immensely
                        interesting and gave a good birds eye view of the earliest history of this
                        wonderful country. Unfortunately the illustrations to the lecture which were
                        to have been given by lantern slides were to be omitted, but they will
                        doubtless be seen at the next meeting on February 27. </p>
                    <p>Starting with the geological formation of Egypt, in the very far off days of
                        some fifty thousand years ago, the lecturer told how this land, the latest
                        of the earth's formation, was not one of the first to be inhabited. He
                        described the formation of the deep ravine between the bigh lande of t bar
                        East and West and the scouring of the mountain side as the torrential river
                        pushed through the deep cleft, carrying <cb n="5"/>the debris with it, which in later years formed the fertile valley and plains
                        of the delta For in the earliest days the sea undoubtedly stretched inland
                        as far as Cairo, and the climate was laden with moisture, so that the
                        heights on either side of the river, which we know. As arid desert, were
                        covered with rieb vegetation Animal life Shere may have been in the valley :
                        but the paleolithic human inhabitants must have lived in the heights ; and
                        the only remains which tell of their existence are the flint implements
                        found round about the Luxor hills, which from their discolouration must have
                        been chipped and carved and used not less than fifty thousand years ago.
                        Long centuries rolled between those days and the period belonging to what is
                        known as the prognostic inhabitants of Egypt. Remains of these are of
                        frequent occurrence; and from them many interesting facts have been deduced.
                        They evidently had some form of religion, and though they had no literature,
                        their sense of art was wonderful; and as time went on their weapons marked
                        the transition between the stone and metal ages. Their small holdings or
                        village encampments became tused into larger townships under one chief till
                        eventually the valley of the Nile was divided only into two kingdoms which
                        eventually were united under Menes, the first king of the first dynasty. For
                        the subsequent history of early Egypt we are indebted to the compilations of
                        Menethil, which though lacking in detail and accuracy have been enriched And
                        elaborated by the subsequent discoveries of Egyptologists. The lecturer
                        traced the evolution of these dynasties, tracing their rise and fall, their
                        various periods of renaissance and decadence : eliminating those which were
                        of no practical bearing on the evolution of the country, from the time of
                        Menes the first King of the first period to those wonderful empire makers
                        and empire builders of the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties who set their
                        boundaries where they would, and filled the country with those marvellous
                        mementos of their wealth and power.</p>

                    <p>KEARSLEY AND CUNNINGHAM'S WEEK REPORT </p>
                    <p>LIVERPOOL, 16 January </p>
                    <p>There has been very little doing in Egyptian cotton this week, prices however
                        remain firm and are to per lb dearer. </p>
                    <p>In Futures a moderate business has been done, and the following are the
                        latest values:Jan. 9.36 Apr. 9.84 July 9.84 9. 9.32 Peb. 9,35 May 9.34 Aug.
                        9.84 Nov. 9.81 Mar. 9.35 June 9.34 Sept. 9.333 </p>
                    <p>AMERICAN FUTURES. The Market this week has been more active, and although
                        there have been several fluctuations the tendency throughout has been
                        upwards, and today's closing values are 27 points higher for the current
                        month and January/February delivery: 981 26 points higher for the
                        intermediary solutions, and 171 @ 185 points higher for X Crops, than those
                        of last Thursday. The ad 200 has been chiefly due to smaller crop moments,
                        and to a strong Bull manipulation emanating from New York, and rumoured to
                        have influential people at the head of it. At the same time the smaller
                        receipts have again brought into prominence the smaller crop estimates,
                        notably Messrs. Neill Bros. who reiterate their previous estimate of
                        11,600,000, and at the same time estimate the consumption of American cotton
                        at 12,600,000. These figures would be very strong if one would be sure that
                        they would prove correct. The Bank rate has been reduced to 5 %, which is an
                        undoubted relief, and there are good hopes that the difficulties atween the
                        spinners and the operatives will be arranged. </p>

                    <head>BULLETIN DE LA BOURSE</head>
                    <p>Vendredi, 24 Janvier </p>
                    <p>La tenue d'aujourd'hui est tout l'opposé de celle d'hier. La baisse des taux
                        d'escompte tant à Londres qu'à Paris ayant contribué à ranimer les
                        espéranoes, plusieurs valeurs ont bénéficié d'une reprise appréciable. De
                        plus, des échanges effectifs ont eu lieu sur toute la cote. </p>
                    <p>En raison de la hausse de Londres, la National Bank aencore gagné environ une
                        demi-livre 22, mais les affaires ont été à peu près Dulles, faute de
                        vendeurs sur place. </p>
                    <p>L'Agricole est beaucoup plus ferme à 7 25/32, contre 7 11/16 hier.On a fait
                        beaucoup de bruit autour de ce titre surtout au moment de la cotation, dans
                        le bat évident de le faire coter plus haut. </p>
                    <p>Après avoir progressé de 1 17/32 &amp; 1 5/8, la Building Lands a fini
                        vendeurs à 1 1/2. Ce Albchissement est attribué aux réalisations hypothène
                        asser naturelle quand on so rappelle que le cours était récemment encore de
                        1 1/8. </p>
                    <p>L'Obligation Crédit Foncier a eu un mouvement assez anivi mais l'offre
                        prédominante a fait fléchir le prix de 295 &amp; 294 pour l'ancienne. Le
                        cours de la nouvelle demeure sans change ment. Là encore le recul peut
                        s'expliquer par les réalisations. </p>
                    <p>Il y a eu un réveil de la demande en Sidi Salem à 2 3/16. Des achats en Delta
                        Land ont également fait monter le cours de 11/8 à 1 5/32. </p>
                    <p>LA Delta Light, recherchée, progresse de 9 5/8 à 9 21/32, ainsi que
                        l'Alexandria Water de 10 3/8 à 10 1/2, la Béhéra de 20 &amp; 20 1/8, le
                        Comptoir de 2 5/16 à 2 3/8 et le Crédit Franco Egyptien de 4 1/8 4 4 5/32. </p>
                    <p>La hausse n'est cependant pas générale, puisque la Privilégiée Bière
                        d'Alexandrie rétrograde de 100 a 95, la Land Bank de 7 1/2 à 7 7/16,
                        l'Urbaine de 3 1/8 i 3, le Banco di Roma de 108 1/2 à 108 et la Port Said
                        Salt de 10/9 &amp; 10/6. </p>
                    <p>De 14/6 ls Salt &amp; Soda avance A 15/ </p>
                    <p>Il y a eu beaucoup d'affaires en Cassa di Sconto dont on annonce la prochaine
                        Assem blée pour entendre le Rapport des liquidateurs. Sur le bruit, que nous
                        reproduisons sous toute réserve, que sauf complications ultérieures, chaque
                        motion recevrait 100 francs à la répar tition, le titre passé de 52 1/2 à 58
                        franes, avec tendance à la hausse. </p>
                    <p>Bref, l'ensemble de marché est bon et la tendance favorable. Le Caire, qui
                        depuis assez longtemps nous inondait d'ordres de vente semble vouloir
                        réabsorber one partie de ses sorties. S'il se maintient dans de telles
                        dispositions, notre marché local ne pourra qo'y gagner Aveu d'aussi bonnes
                        nouvelles du dehors et de la capitala on ne peut qu'être confiant dans
                        l'avenir immédiat. La seule ombre au tableau ce sont les tentatives deja
                        inaugurées par l'incorrigible spéculation pour créer des mouvements fnetices

                        le dénoncer. </p>
                    <p>Les banques ont joué, un grand role dans la crise égyptienne en accordant
                        d'abord des crédits bien supérieurs ceux que méritaient les clients, puis en
                        resserrant tout à coup ces crédits de façon à entrainer des faillites </p>
                    <p>Un des exemples les plus suggestifs de cette conduite financière est celui
                        offert par la faillite Neggar Affit. Voici à ce sujet les chiffres que non
                        extrayona da rapport du syndio de pond au grefle Commercial do tribunal
                        mixte do Caire </p>
                    <p>Capital de la maison Neggar Affif au 31.12.06 P.T. 4.048 765,84 </p>
                    <p>Bilan idid. . 37.541.611,76 </p>
                    <p>Montant des créances des Banques inscrites au pasif de la faillite, ad
                        7.12.07 62.022.549 Pog </p>
                    <p>Créances irrecouvrables. 7.000.000 </p>
                    <p>Le rapprochement entre ces chiffres démontre qu'avec un capital relativement
                        modeste, la maison Naggar Affif pouvait faire des affaires très
                        considérables. Ce résultat était atteint : 1") par le crédit ouvert par les
                        Banques à la dite maison sans garantie ; 2) par le système des tirages à
                        trois mois renouvelés sans cesse ; 3) par le placement en gage près des
                        Banques des titres appartenant aux clients. </p>
                    <p>En examinant l'analyse de la situation de la faillite faite par le syndio on
                        trouve que, aux environs du mois de mai, toutes les banques ont commencé à
                        resserrer le crédit et à réclamer des couvertures &amp; MM. Naggar Afit. Au
                        mois de Juin, ce resserrement de crédit a déjà porté ses effets: les faillis
                        ne pouvant pas faire face aux exigences des banques, se trouvent mena cés de
                        recours on justice. La faillite prononcée au mois de décembre fixe la
                        suspension des payements au commencement d'aont. La succession de ces dates
                        est la pren ve éloquente, ceci soit dit sans aucune intention de justifier
                        les faillis, que la ruine de la maison NaggarAffif a été le resserrement du
                        crédit des Banques locales et étrangèreo. </p>
                    <p>Si d'un ooté on ne peut blamer les banqnes d'avoir ainsi quoique tardivement
                        asaini leur compte d'avances, on ne peut que s'étonner de leur complaisance
                        passée et se demander comment des établissements chargés de régler le crédit
                        ont pu sortir ainsi de leur rôle en favori sant la spéculation qu'elles ont
                        ensuite abandonnée au moment oritique.</p>

                    <p>PROCÉS DES VILLAGEOIS D'ARMANT CONTRE La Daira SANIER Co. LTD. ET CONSORTS </p>
                    <p>La 2e Chambre Civile da Tribunal Mixte du Caire présidée par Mr. Vasquez
                        &amp; prononcé hier matin son jugement dans cette importante affaire dont
                        les Avocats des parties étaient : Me Loutfi Ayrout Bey pour les villageois,
                        Me Cadéminos pour les acheteurs et Me Pe traochi pour la Daira. Tout le
                        monde applau. dira à la sagesse de ce jugement qui tranche une des questions
                        qui ont passionné l'opinion publique. </p>
                    <p>Voici les principaux motifs sur lequels s'est basé le tribunal dans son
                        jugement : </p>
                    <p>"Attendu que lorsque le Prince Moastapha Fazil eut venda ses propriétés en
                        1869 Ao Khé dive Ismail, il prit soin d'exclure de la vente 212 fed. et
                        fractions ad teftiche d'Armanta Kebalet El Mallaha parmi lesquels se
                        trouvaient 29 fed. et fractions occupés par l'Exbet de Wa. bourat Armant. </p>
                    <p>"Qu'en vertu de cette vente ni le Khedive Ismail ni la Daira Sanieh qui a
                        puses lieu et placen'étaient propriétaires de cette quantité de terrain ;
                        qu'ainsi la Société Egyptienne de la Daira Saniet qui a pris les lieu et
                        place de l'Administration du même nom n'avait pas le droit de céder la
                        propriété de cette Ezbeh ; que cette Société paraissait n'être pas bien sure
                        elle-même de son droit de propriété puisqu'elle a stipulé la clause de non
                        garantie dans l'acte de vente et a imposé aux acquéreurs l'obligation de
                        revendre les habitations aux occupants ;" '</p>
                    <p>Le tribunal, examinant les conséquences juridiques de l'exclusion de cette
                        parcelle de la vente faite par Moustapha Fazil à Ismail, déclaro que
                        l'intention da prince était à n'en pas douter de consacrer les habitations,
                        la mosquée, les routes, le cimetière et le marché de ce village a l'utilité
                        publique. </p>
                    <p>Il a ensuite examiné le point de savoir si le Khedive Ismail ou la Daira
                        Sanieh ont acquis la propriété de ces biens par la prescription de 15 ans ; </p>
                    <p>Il a dit à ce sujet qu'en admettant l'hypothese que le Khedive Ismail ait en
                        la possession soit de longue durée, soit arbitrairement, il est constant que
                        l'acquisition par cette possession ne pouvait être transférée à la Daira
                        Sanieh tant que ces biens n'étaient pas compris dans l'inscription
                        hypothécaire prise à la requête des créanciers de la Daira, qui forme le
                        seul titre de propriété de celle-ci ; </p>
                    <p>Qu'il est sans conteste que ces biens ne sont pas compris dans l'inscription
                        hypothécaire et que ni la Daira ni ses acquéreurs n'ont pa prouver la
                        possession par la prescription depuis la Loi de Liquidation; </p>
                    <p>Que les correspondances échangées entre les deux Dairas, les contrats de
                        location et l'inven taire produits par la Dairs ne constituent pas des
                        preuves suffisantes en faveur de la possession; </p>
                    <p>Par ces Motifs, </p>
                    <p>Le tribonal déboute la Daira et ses acquéreurs de leur demande
                        reconventionnelle tendant au déguerpissement des villageois de Fabet
                        Wabourat Armant. </p>

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. </p>
                    <p>Many people leave Egypt far too early in the year, for as a rule the weather
                        in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt is
                        Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list shewing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short ones are as
                        follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers of the P.&amp;O., the Egyptian Mail S.S,. Co., North German
                        Lloyd, Orient, and Messageries Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor,
                        British India, Bibby and Henderson Lines are also excellent, and their
                        steamers are largely patronised by travellers to Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said can now be made without change
                        in 4 ½ hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O. Brindisi express
                        from Port Said, by the Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., from Alexandria to Marseilles
                        and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe. The Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., have
                        also made arrangements whereby luggage can be collected and sent to any
                        address.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail<cb n="6"/> Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these
                        leaves Port Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian
                        mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. <hi rend="italic"
                            >Giardini</hi> is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to
                        Taormina is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the
                        town is much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                        restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of
                        Etna, and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic
                        remains that are found all over the island, are an endless sources of
                        pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a Greek city,
                        which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in
                        B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be seen. The cathedral
                        was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with about 300,000 inhabitants,
                        is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful climate. Much of
                        interest is to be found in this fine city. <hi rend="italic">The Palazzo
                            Reale</hi> is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of <hi
                            rend="italic">S. Giovannia degli Eremiti</hi> with its picturesque
                        cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal
                        Park are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                            bay—<hi rend="italic">Castellamare</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Sorrento</hi>. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento [you can
                        drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                            <hi rend="italic">City of Flowers</hi> and its surrounding country. In
                        Florence itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst
                        the local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. <hi rend="italic"
                            >The Cascine</hi> is the most attractive and fashionable promenade in
                        Florence, whilst the <hi rend="italic">Viale dei Colli</hi>, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to <hi rend="italic">Vallombrosa</hi>, with its <hi
                            rend="italic">Monastery</hi> 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is
                        made first by ordinary train from Florence to <hi rend="italic">St.
                            Ellero</hi>, thence by cog-wheel railway to <hi rend="italic"
                            >Saltino</hi>. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                        striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,

                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>

                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea. No hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi> you make the tour of the
                        beautiful Italian lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come <hi rend="italic"
                            >Tremezzo</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Cadenabbia</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Menaggio</hi> with the prettily-situated town of <hi rend="italic"
                            >Bellaggio</hi> opposite. The walk from <hi rend="italic">Tremezzo</hi>
                        along the shore of the lake to <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> is most
                        enjoyable. A steam tram runs from <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> to <hi
                            rend="italic">Porlezza</hi> on Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour,
                        then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M. de Caprino.and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town, situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>
