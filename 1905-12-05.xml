                            <p>The Propietors, jewelers, an ironmongers of Mousky, Clot Bey, and
                                Esbekieh quarters of Cairo have come into ine with the rest on the
                                subject of Sunday closing. Last Sunday was the first of the new
                                order of things and, as some slight disturbances had occurred on
                                previous Sunday, some mounted police were told off to see that order
                                was preserved. These precautionary measures gave rise to some
                                astonishing rumuors, the nature of which may be understood from the
                                following specimen:</p>
                            <p>Q. What are the shawishes doing here?</p>
                            <p>A. The Sultan has sent 500 mulluhs to preach a Jehad here against the
                                Christians and the police are looking for them.</p>
                            <p>We gather that Cairo has been less perturbed than Alexandria, which
                                has accepted (among other things) a massacre at Tantah, a religious
                                riot at Damietta- an echo this of the Samanoud affair,
                                megaphonically enlarged- and an anti Christian demonstration near
                                the Abassieh barracks- what a place to chose!- the news of which,
                                strangely enough, reached our commercial capital on Sunday, but had
                                not arrived at the Ministries on Monday afternoon. We must confess
                                to a certain disgust at hearing absurd stories of this circulating
                                among Europeans, particularly among our Greek fellow citizens. The
                                Greeks of Egypt have shown such financial enterprise and business
                                acumen that it comes as a shock to find men whom we were accustomed
                                to regard as level headed and intelligent betraying a nervousness
                                that can only be qualified as object, on the strength of some absurd
                                rumuors. </p>
                            <p>Meantime, Mustapha Pasha Kamal has spoken ex-cathedral. We are to
                                have no revolution, not a single broker is to suffer,-except those
                                who sold out at a loss on hearing that the berbereen were about to
                                sack Cairo. We knew this all along, but the Pasha’s statement will
                                no doubt reassure that more timid. As for the Egyptian Press, with
                                one or two exceptions, it has behaved with proper calm and dignity.
                                Amrica is too far for the scare headline to have reached us, and the
                                majority of the European population of Egypt possesses a sense of
                                humour. For the minority we have only the Homeric exhortation, ”Be
                                men, my friends, remember your dashing courage”.</p>

                        <p>FEAR OF CIVIL WAR</p>
                        <p>St.Petersburg, December 4.</p>
                        <p>Most elaborate precautions are being taken in view of a feared outbreak
                            of the troops. The Marine Infantry have been disarmed on account of
                            thieir sympathy with the revolution.Quick firers have been trained on
                            the Horse Guards barracks. All who can are leaving the country. Finance
                            and commerce are paralyzed.</p>
                        <p>The engine drivvers of St. Petersburg expresses bring the Russian news of
                            Reuter's Agent twice daily to the German frontier, whence it is
                            telegraphed. But an impending general railway strike threatens to cut
                            off this means of communication. Several Embasies have received the news
                            of militairy outbreaks in the Baltic provinces, particularly at Reval,
                            where the reservists are in open revolt. (Reuter)</p>
                        <p>London, December 4</p>
                        <p>Comminucation has been momentarily obtained with ccertain isolated parts
                            of Russia today, but was immediately broken again.</p>
                        <p>The mutinous conduct of the troops has led to disorders at Kharkoff and
                            at Kishinoff for the same cause as the disturbances at Kieff where there
                            were 70 killed and 300 wounded. Martial law has been proclaimed.</p>
                        <p>Saturday's despatches from St. Petersburg present a calamitous picture of
                            turmoil and public alarm. There is much talk of a military dictatorship,
                            but the loyalty of the troops is questioned, and an attempt to carry out
                            the project would probably end in civil war.</p>
                        <p>The suffering of families of strikers is daily becoming more intense.
                            Robberis in the streets in broad daylight ar ecommon. No letters have
                            been distributed since Tuesday. (Reuter)</p>

                        <p>Further heavy falls in Russian securities caused a collapse verging on a

                        <p>The cruisers have arrived and the riot is at an end, without casualties
                            amond the whites. (Reuter)</p>

                        <p>Paris, December 4</p>
                        <p>Questioned in the Chamber of Deputies regarding the words employed by the
                            Socialists on Friday, M Rouvier condemned the anti militarist
                            propaganda. He asserted that an immence majority of Frenchmen remained
                            faithful to Russian friendship and the alliance. His speech was greeted
                            with applause. (Havas)</p>

                            make much of a stand against the bowling of Messrs. Thurston and Byrne.

                                season on Saturday, and is brighter and more up to date than ever.
                                Our Cairo comtemporary has considerably increased its staff, and has
                                obtained the services of competent correspondant and reporters, who
                                will give full accountes every week of all that is taking place in
                                Egyppt which is likely to prove the interest to its subscribers. The
                                Sphinx intends to give special attention to the reporting of social
                                functions and other events of importance, and has made arrangements
                                to recaive weekly letters from London by a leading Society writer
                                giving an interesting record of the movemnts of Society at home. We

                            <p>Dr. Ruffer, CMG., President of the Quartantine Board, delivered a
                                most interesting and instructive lecture on the Desert of Sinai
                                yesterday evening under the auspices of the Alexandria, Literary,
                                Musical and Dramatic Society. The lecture, which was illustrated by
                                a series of excellent lantern slides, thrown on the screen by Mr.
                                Binder, was given in the large class room of St. Andrew's High
                                School, which proved far too small to contain the large number of
                                members and others who attended. Rear Admiral Sir Massie Bloomfield,
                                K.C.M.G., who presided, congratulated the society on having secured
                                the services of such an able lecturer, and Mr. E. B. Gould., I.S.O.,
                                at the conclusion, thanked Dr. Ruffer for his interesting account of
                                his travels in the Sinaitis Peninsula, and hoped he would again
                                favor the society with a lecture. We understand Dr. Ruffer aggreed
                                to repeat last night's lesson in Ramieh for the benefit of
                                Ramlehites at an early date. </p>

                                interior.</p>
                            <p>The tomb itself is a rectangular building about nine feet square
                                medalliiions, nine squares in each row, each square measureing about
                                a foot each way. Thesemeddallions have apperently containedd
                                portraites or pictures, but there are for the most part, now
                                undistinguishable. The plaster of the walls is also painted and
                                decorated, but much of this has suffered either from time or at the
                                hands of the quarrymen. </p>
                            <p>Members of Alexandria Archeological Society or athers interested in
                                such matters should lose no time n paying a visit to the tomb, as it
                                stands in such a position as to make it impossible to preserve it,
                                in view of the wors being carried out, and its removal is only a
                                question of a few days, during which it is hoped that steps will be
                                taken by MunicipalMuseum Committee to have an accurate drawing of

                            <p>Numerous rumours are afloat as to the causes of the retirement of the
                                Grand Cadi, Sheikh Yehis, from his post. According to the most wide
                                spread of the reports, the sheikh was unable to satisfy his Imperial
                                masteer as to the attitude he had adopted towards the affair of
                                marriage of Sheik Ali Youseff, Editor of the "Mosad"", with lady
                                Sofia, daughter of Sheikh el Saadat. The Cadi appears to have failed
                                to explain his action to the Sultan in a satisfactory manner, and
                                had no other recourse but to offer his resignation, which was
                                accepted. Another rumour states that the Grand Cadi arregated
                                himself to a position of influence in the Wakfs Administration which
                                were quite incompatible with those of H.H. the Khedive. We give both
                                stories for that they are worth. </p>

                                deferred, will be heard of again early next year. Meantime it is
                                noteworth that the Wiener Bankverein intends to start banking
                                operations in Egypt shortly.Early in January, we understand, two new

                            <p>In conformity with Article 21 of the Treaty of the Postal Union,
                                signed at Washing on 15th June, 1897, an arrangement has just been
                                concluded between the United Kingdom and Egypt by which letters from
                                Great Britain to Egypt and the Sudan will be prepaid one penny for
                                every half ounce and letters from egypt and the Sudan to the United
                                Kingdom will be prepaid 5 milliemes for every 15th inst. In
                                notifying the above arrangement to the International Bureau at
                                Berne, the Postnaster General of Egypt state that he authorized by
                                the Khedivve's government to enter into similar arrangements with
                                any other country that would be willing to offer reciprocity.</p>
                            <p>It will be interesting in this connection to note that the number of
                                letters sent to the United Kingdom from Egypt in the course of a
                                year is 800,000, while letters from the UK to Egypt number
                                1,000,000.</p>

                        <p> </p>
                        <p> On the initiation of the Hedjaz Railway scheme expressions of derision
                            and doubt arose from all quarters, and some of the serious papers of
                            Europe held that this colossal enterprise was doomed to failure. Their
                            view was based on the fact of the insolvency of the Turkish treasury,
                            and the unreliability of Turkish methods as illustrated in the results
                            of the past and existing maladministration. But these practical seers
                            failed to take into account, in their self-complacent predictions, an
                            element which is mightier than the sword or gold, for without it there
                            are so many pieces of inert matter, and it constitutes the soul thereof.
                            This element is religious Zealand solidarity controlled by a masterly
                            spirit. In every human breast this force, all the more mighty because
                            unseen, and untrammeled by the limitations of measurable matter, lies
                            latent, and he who can stir it into active life, and can weld its myriad
                            manifestations into one harmonious common action, is the man who makes
                            world-conquests, whether peaceful or warlike, and hands his name to
                            posterity as a hero.</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p> The great events of history were simply the outcome of a great idea
                            inspired into millions of hearts and materialized by united action.
                            Sultan Abdul Hamid, as the conceiver of the great Pan-Islamic idea and
                            the originator of the Hedjaz railway scheme, as a tangible expression of
                            the great idea, now claims a place among the great men of the world. It
                            was with nothing short of genius that he worked into the loose body of
                            Islam the leaven of the Pan-Islamic federation. Behold the scattered
                            millions of Moslems now rallying around the inevitable banner, more
                            potent than once the Green Flag. Indeed the Hamidieh-Hedjaz railway is
                            only a concrete manifestation of the power that the great idea brought
                            out into life, a determining cause for the union of Islam – a rallying
                            point of the gathering of its scattered legions.</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p> The Zaidis may continue their guerilla warfare, the Druses of Hanran may
                            renew it, and they may, indeed win a victory or so, but throne of Abdul
                            Hamid in Constantinople will stand and can alone be a fit representative
                            of Moslem power and sovereignty. The Arab is too essentially a nomad,
                            and too much out of the way, in an arid country hardly in touch with the
                            civilized world, while he is too ignorant of modern methods and the
                            diplomatic science, and far inferior to the Turk in that cosmopolitan
                            versatility which has played for centuries with European statesmanship,
                            to be able to take his stand with the Sovereigns of Europe and fitly and
                            worthily represent the vast empire of Islam in the international
                            councils of the world. And the more the Moslem gets educated the
                            stronger will be his sense of pride; he will be satisfied only with the
                            sovereign of a great dynasty, that can take, and has, indeed, taken
                            equal rank with the crowned rulers of Christendom.</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p> It would be idle to discuss the Hedjaz railway from an economic
                            standpoint. Save for the Caiffa Dara branch, which crosses the fertile
                            plain of Jazreel Marj Ion Amir – and part of the Jordan Valley – Bi Ghor
                            – the line traverses through a great part of its length arid tracts that
                            have not even commercial possibilities. Indeed it has never been
                            designed as a commercial line. The Imperial initiator meant it from the
                            beginning as an essentially Moslem undertaking to be realized in great
                            part by Moslem money freely given, inasmuch as it was to serve
                            eventually as a great iron link between the millions of Faithful from
                            distant realms, and a means of bringing them together to that spot for
                            which the soul of every Moslem longs- the centre form which Islam sprung
                            and conquered the world. The mainspring of the idea may have been
                            strategical, but it has been kept in the background so as, presumably,
                            not to mar the noble and inspiring idea of Moslem brotherhood by bloody
                            shadows of war.</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p> To get all the necessary funds the Sultan could not tax his subjects, as
                            the Christians in his Empire are not a small minority and they have
                            scarcely any interest in the under taking, altho’ he did impose a tax
                            destined for the Hamidieh Railway, but only to contribute partly to the
                            large funds needed. With his keen intelligence, however he could raise
                            vast sums in other ways, and this by appeal to which all of the Moslems
                            of the world could not but respond. Indeed the Sultan with masterly
                            touch struck the sensitive chord in the great heart of Islam, and like a
                            great psychologist, exploited the two great feelings that underlie human
                            action, and that lay at the root of the great movements of history, viz,
                            the religious instinct and worldly vanity. Those who could not respond
                            to the religious emotion he attracted by decorations, and from all the
                            corners of the world gold flowed into the coffers of the Imperial
                            Company, and with right royal munificence in many cases. India, China,
                            Egypt, Zanzibar, and wherever Moslems exists in Africa, Asia and Eastern
                            Europe – all countries offered their contributions as on sacred altar of
                            sacrifice.</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p> The Finance Department of the Hamidieb Heljaz Railway has just published
                            its balance sheet for the ending July 1903, and I extract the following
                            interesting figures. The total income of the Hamidieh Railway up to the
                            end of that year amounted to 208,928,914 pistres, at 100 pastres the
                            Turkish pound of about 23 francs. This in great part consisted of
                            donations. It comprises also the net proceeds of the sale of the skins
                            of sheep sacrificed in Ramadan on the sacred hill</p>
                        
                        <p>near Mecca, the new Hedjaz railway tax, appropriations from the
                            agricultural banks, and profits resulting from the exchange of silver
                            coinage</p>

                            <p>Yet another method of constructing sub aqueous work was a few years
                                ago applied in Egypt to the construction of two important weirs down
                                stream of the Delta barrage. Cement used in the form of grout, for
                                cementing together materials under water, had been successfully used
                                in various ways by different engineers, and notibly in the Hermitage
                                Break water, Jersey, by the late system attracted the attention of
                                the irrigation officials in Egypt and eventually led to its adoption
                                for the weirs. The core and footing walls up to the level of water
                                in the river, and also the foundations of the locks associated with
                                the weirs, were formed under water by the cement grout system. A
                                trench was first dredged across the river bed to the dimensions and
                                levels of the weir cross section. The two walls of the weir were

                                Protectorate for 1904-5, states that the fishing population of the
                                Vistoria Nyanza is rapidly becoming extinct from sleeping sickness.
                                No remedy had been found for the disease, which continued un-bated
                                during the year in the Lake regions of Uganda and Busoga. With the

                                confined itself to the Lake regions, a belt about ten miles in depth

                            <p>In Uganda Egyptian cotton does not appear to thrive as well as
                                American. Severale experiments have been commenced in the
                                protectorate with cotton, several varieties of which are undergoing
                                trial, and the results already obtained indicate that the American
                                Upland cotton will probably be found more suitable for cultivation
                                in Uganda than Egyptian varieties. Severl tons of Egyptian seed were
                                distributed to planters and natives for trial, but the American
                                Upland seems to do better than any of these and furnishes cotton of
                                longer staple than in its native country. Arrangements are in
                                progress to obtain trained pupils from the Indian Agricultural
                                Colleges to instruct the natives the proper methods of cotton

                            <p>The manipulations in the American cotton market are having a serious
                                effect upon Lancashire's staple industry. The present rates in the
                                raw material are higher than they have been for a considerable time
                                in the past, and the fear is expressed that they will be increased
                                still further by continued manipulation. Trade in American kinds has
                                been poor for some moments owing largely to the cotton situation,
                                but things have got to such a pass that already there is talk of
                                shutting down for a few weeks in the Oldham and South Lancashire
                                districts where cop twist is spun.</p>
                            <p>Last week a sub committee of the Federation met, and the question of
                                a lessened consuption of cotton to circumvent the bulls and to
                                lessen the output of yarn was mentioned. It is probable the another
                                meeting will be held in order to prepare a report for the general
                                committee of the Federation. The whole situation is looked upon as
                                serious. The New York market is now, it is said, fully controlled by
                                bulls, Mr. Theodore Price having joined them. We made a grave
                                statement that the Washington Bureau estimate, to be issued this
