                            by Mr. Edward Dicey in his recent book “The Egypt of the Future,”
                            namely, that the British authorities are working on wrong lines. To Mr.
                            Dicey’s suggestion that “the old laws, usages, customs, and habits
                            should remain as they were before the Protectorate existed,” Sir
                            Auckland Colvin replies : “What were these laws, usages, customs, and
                            habits? The old usage was the corvee, ‘the old custom was the kurbash,
                            the old laws were, in Lord Dufferin’s words, ‘a mockery,' ‘misery and
                            confusion’; the old habits were corruption, bribery, and speculation.
                            The prisons were foul dens. ‘No words could convey the impression of the
                            hopeless misery of the mass of the prisoners,’ wrote a Commission in.
                            1882, which had been appointed to look into them, ‘who live for months
                            like wild beasts, without change of clothing and half starved, ignorant
                            of the fate of their families, and bewailing their own.’ Are these the
                            laws, usages, customs, and habits which Mr. Dicey would wish to have
                            restored ? Does he seriously contend that it should be the role of the
                            British authorities in Egypt merely to maintain order and the defence of
                            Egypt, while the governing classes of the country administer it ? Are
                            the British to keep the ring, always facing scrupulously outwards, while
                            the kurbash and the corvee have full play within ? ” “The absolute
                            authority which Lord Cromer is said to wield,” writes Sir A. Colvin, “is
                            made a grave reproach to him in ‘The Future of Egypt.’ There can be no
                            manner of doubt that Lord Cromer’s influence in Egypt is on the whole
                            paramount In the first place—and this is of itself enough—he represents
                            his Majesty’s Government* which holds Egypt in the hollow of its hand He
                            has been for thirty years intimately connected, in one or other office,
                            with the administration of the country, and his knowledge of its affairs
                            is probably far greater than that of any other living man. He has
                            brought Egypt from the depths of distress and insolvency into the
                            sunshine of the most unheard-of prosperity. He enjoys the prestige of
                            unbroken success achieved among extraordinary difficulties. By personal
                            force of character, by patience and prudence, by tenacity, by fearless
                            and unswerving devotion to the interests committed to him, he has gained
                            universal respect and very general confidence. Such a man stands too
                            high and too conspicuous a figure to escape the slings and arrows of
                            misrepresentation. But to describe him as an ‘absolute autocrat’ is mere
                            misuse of language. . . . Not to he weary of well-doing is the first and
                            best lesson to be learned by the European reformer in the East He has
                            put his hand to the plough, and he cannot withdraw it Least of all can
                            he succumb to the atmosphere of the Orient and, whether from
                            complaisance or from lack of purpose or of courage, fall into a system
                            of laiseer aller. That would be to turn his back on the very influences
                            which have brought him there; to be a renegade to the civilisation of
                            which he is a pioneer, and of which the battle has been entrusted to his
                            hands.” </p>

                    <p>Yesterday a meeting of the members of the Alexandria Municipality was held in
                        order to send an official and collective expression of their regret at the
                        resignation of <persName>Lord Cromer</persName>. All the European members of
                        the Municipality were present except <persName>Mr. E. W. P.

                        present, and which has caused great * in terest throughout the city, as

                        made the following speach.</p>

                    <p>Comte de Cromer Quel que puisse etre l’ave-nir, son nom restera dans
                        l’histoire de l’Egypte, entoute de respect et de reconnaissance- Dans
                        l’impulsion qu’il a donnee au pays,il a apporte une intelligence, une
                        lucidite et une hauteur de vues, une nettete de, decision dont le re-sultat
                        a ete une veritable transformation du pays. Notre municipalite nee sous ses
                        auspices, s’est toujours ressentie de son action bienfaisante. Ma pensle se
                        reporte bien souvent vers l’epoque oil, dans one sphere modeste, j’avais
                        l’honneur de suivre aupres du major Baring et de son eminent collegue M. de
                        Blignieres, les premiers pas de la regeneration de l’Egypte. l'amenite et la
                        droiture de celui qui devait etre Lord Cromer lui avaient deja concilie les
                        sympathies de tous. Il etait difficile de l’approcher sans ressentir un
                        veritable atta-chement pour sa personne. Aujourd’hui qu’il nous quitte,
                        apres avoir realise comme der-nidre ceuvre cet accord qui permet a tous Une
                        voie parallele, il m’est bien permis de dire que ce sentiment s’est toujours
                        conserve intact a travers la. diversity des evene-ments. Je m’associe a la
                        proposition de notre President et je propose que la Municipality ouvre, a
                        son budget extraordinaire, le credit necessaire pour la realisation du

                    <p>After this speech a committee was chosen, a member from each nationality as
                        follows : <persName>Mr. Kingham</persName>, English, <persName>Yehia
                            Pasha</persName>, Egyptian,<persName> Mr. Feuderl</persName>, Austrian,

                            <persName>Mr. Salvago</persName>, Greek, and as chairman,
                            <persName>Schiess Pasha</persName>, Swiss</p>
                    <p>It was then discussed what was the best way of acting upon Dr. Schiess
                        Pasha’s resolution, which was carried unanimously, and it was finally
                        decided to erect a monument, though what form the monument shall take is as
                        yet undecided.</p>
                    <p>A telegram was then sent to Lord Cromer on behalf of the Municipal
                        Commission, expressing their sincere regret at his Lordship’s resignation
                        and the reason which had compelled him to so decide. |</p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer responded telegraphically to <persName/>Moustafa Pacha Ibadi,
                        President of the Commission, as follows:— Je prie Votre Excellence
                        d’accepter et de communiqner aux membres de la Municipalite l’expression de
                        mon appréciation la plus sincere de l’hommage insigne qu’ils me rendent, et
                        dont je suis infiniment touchy et tres flatty. </p>

                    <head>ALEXANDRIA HORSE SHOW</head>
                    <p>The Annual Horse Show was held at the Sporting Club grounds on Saturday. The
                        show may have been up to the standard of former years, but taking it as a
                        whole from an unbiassed spectator’s point of view, the least one can say is,
                        that it was far from a huge success. The attendance during the early part of
                        the day was meagre, although things brightened up a little after lunch, but
                        even then at their beat the numbers were not what one would have
                        anticipated. This was a pity as there was sufficient material in the number
                        of entries, and the goodly array of prizes, including some handsome cups, to
                        have ensured a most successful and enjoyable meeting. But interest in the
                        various events seemed to flag, on account perhaps of the monotony of the
                        judging, the long waits, and what we cannot but call the lax organisation in
                        allowing the non-competitors in particular classes to drive and ride all
                        over the course while others were being judged, so that one hardly knew
                        which event was taking place. The programme, too, might have been arranged
                        differently, in order to have finished earlier. As it was, darkness had
                        almost set in ere the last event was concluded: in fact it was at first
                        thought that two of the classes would have to be postponed. The result was
                        that very few people remained to the distribution of prizes which had to be
                        presented in the dark until someone came to the rescue with a small
                        lamp.</p>
                    <p>The most popular classes of the afternoon were the children’s hacks,and the
                        jumping competition ; one little fellow in the former shewing considerable
                        skill in managing his rather i fractious steed, and another caused some
                        amusement by absolutely refusing to be' driven or coaxed past the judges. In
                        the I latter, the jumping competition, the after-’ noon was marred by what
                        appeared at first a serious accident to <persName>Mr. D. S.
                            Alderson</persName>, one of the competitors. None of the horses took to
                        the jumps kindly, only one jumping at ' all cleanly and with style. Mr.
                        Alderson had, however negotiated the first two hurdles, but J at the third,
                        the hedge, his mount plunged into the side rails, threw its rider, who was
                        apparently unable to release his hold of the reins, and appeared to be badly
                        trampled. The doctor was immediately in attendance bat we were glad to learn
                        upon making enquiries that his injuries were not all all serious, although
                        he had of course received a severe shaking from which we trust he will
                        speedily recover. The band of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers played during the
                        day and lunch was catered for by the management of the New Victoria Hotel,

                    <head>KHEDIVAL OPERA HOUSE</head>
                    <p> “Paraltre” is not a profoundly interesting piece, it is rather detached,
                        meaningless, devoid of any great central feature. The thread of the story is
                        the love of JeanRaidzell for Christiane Marges, but with this are various
                        other casual side-issues—Germaine Laconderies’s story of blackmail and
                        collusion, and Eugene Raidzell’s financial gasconnades, not to mention Paul
                        Marges’ electoral compaigns: After all, perhaps, that isfairly life-like one
                        does not-find connected stories in four or five acts in real life, but one
                        does expect them on the stage, so M. Maurice Downay’s play is either a
                        failure or a piece of premature realism. M. de Feraudy as the worthy baron
                        and general adviser had little enough to do, but his fine command of detail
                        again told : every word, look, aud gesture was effective. Mile Van Daren was
                        admirable, but she is hardly a sympathetic actress of personality : She
                        incites analysis rather than fascination. MmeBressau as Christiane was
                        exceeding-ly good, and Mme Marie Laure surpassed herself in her scene with
                        Madame be Gringois (Mime Dunville). The men all had their good moments but
                        were inclined to exaggerate ; that, with de Feraudy on the stage, was fatal,
                        the contrast of method and result being too obvious. I must here rectify and
                        apologise for an error in “Les affaires sont les affaires.” I mentioned M.
                        Severin as Xavier Lechat,whereas that part was actually taken by M, Deniere.
                        M. Severin (in “Paraltre”) had plenty to do, but he did it well, but the has
                        a slight tendency to the conventional. To conclude, the acting was
                        distinctly better than the ’piece itself. Why should the author have tacked
                        on that absurd explanatory last act epilogue rather-with the pauvre petit
                        bonhomme ? It is unfair to his actors and unworthy of himself.</p>

                <div type="item">
                    <p>“LE JUIF POLONAIS.”</p>
                    <p> This is an old-fashioned, sensational drama: it is practically “The Bells”
                        and savours of a past generation. M. de Feraudy, as Mathis, was perhaps best
                        in the second act, and the third act is pure Surrey-side ranting. He was
                        impressive enough, but one would argue that the lines of the part were far
                        too clearly marked out to evoke any real unconventional acting. M Rodrigue,
                        as the “President” was unnecessarily noisy, and the hypnotist likewise
                        abandoned too soon his air of mystery and command. He was the Old Bailey
                        lawyer, shouting at the witness. The notable feature of this scene was the
                        staging, the darkened room, the shrouded: lamp the disposal of the whole was
                        telling, and presented most thoroughly the effect of dream and darkness,
                        mystery and terror. Mme Maine Faure excellent as Catherine, perhaps better
                        than in any of the parts she has hitherto played. It is not a great part,
                        but her presentment of it was fault- less. The rest were quite good, but a
                        piece so steeped in conventional melodrama is hardly calculated to call
                        forth any phenomenal originality. The test of their abilities will arise in
                        the more modern pieces which we may hope to see presented. </p>

                    <head>ZIZINIA THEATRE.</head>
                    <p>An amateur gala performance, such as that of last Saturday in aid of the
                        Jewish Hospital, is necessarily one where criticism would be misplaced. 1t
                        is a case for the journalist rather than the critic, and, as such, is liable
                        to carry (laudatory journalese to its utmost confines. To begin with there
                        was a prologue in verse daintilly ecited by Mme Antoniadis. Then came a
                        little two-scene pantomime entitled “Le Collier de Saphirs” by Catulle
                        Mendes with music by Gabriel Pierne. This afforded scope for Mr. Rodocanachi
                        to display his capacities as a tragi comic pierrot and it is not too much to
                        say that he succeeded in bringing out the salient features of his
                        compartively long role. Mrs. Downng made a very fasimating Pier rette with a
                        semi-dignified grace that became her admirably. Mr. C. Tamvaco appeared to
                        considerable advantage as a pedlar and Maste Benachi as a little black page
                        After an interval of over 35 minutes the orchestra, under Sig. de Marzi,
                        played Grieg’s Danae d’Anitra from the Peer Gynt suite ; but we regret to
                        say it was drowned by the incessant talking of the crowded audience. The
                        curtain then rose on Bayer’s “Puppengee,” in which the “whole strength of
                        the company appeared.” We have no hesitation in saying it proved a really
                        splendid performance and went without a hitch from start to finish. The
                        dresses were at once gorgeous and tasteful.</p>
                    <p>We have tried hard to give adequate and impartial praise to all who took part
                        in it but, long before our task was accomplishied, our stock of adjectives
                        ran short; so we must rely on its intepreters and their spectators to supply
                        the necessary approbation to suit her (or his) convenience and judgment.</p>
                    <p>We feel bound to observe, after making all allowances, that to commence an
                        entertainment at fully 3/4 hour after the advertised time is quite
                        inexcusable.</p>

                <p>There is no map with any pretensions to topographical exactitude of the country
                    between Alexandria and the Tripoli border. and there seems to be little chance
                    of the Survey Department undertaking any work in this part of Egypt for some
                    time to come, as the survey of the inhabited part of the country for cadastral
                    purposes will take years before it is complete, while the geological survey will
                    be confined for some time to the Eastern desert owing to its mineralical

                    expedition from Roseires, on the Blue Nile, southwards to the Sobat or Baro
                    River, and again in 1900-1 took a leading part in an expedition yielding
                    important geographical and cartographical results along the proposed
                    Sudan-Abyssinian frontier.</p>
                <p>This recognition of the excellent survey work that is being done in the Sudan is
                    well deserved. The work of the Sudan aucrey is proceeding rapidly. Lost year a

                <head>FRANCE AND EGYPTIAN COTTON.</head>
                <p>Le “ Temps ” draws attention to the fact that while French banks and mercantile
                    houses, are eager to speculate in cotton in Egypt, which is under British
                    protection, they will not stir to promote the growing of cotton in the French
                    Colonies. For centuries cotton has been grown in Indo-China, and the conditions
                    are very similar to those obtaining in Egypt, but huge stretches of land are
                    left uncultivated, for Chinese labour, which is so plentiful in Siam and Malaya,
                    cannot be got, although the French do their best to procure it. The reason given
                    is the want of money, but the factdiv remains that Consul-General Hardouin, who
                    is well-known to the Chinese, has failed to obtain the labour required. how the
                    French capitalists seem to fight shy of their own colonies, and will not invest
                    money in them, and we may, therefore, take it as a great compliment to our
                    administra-tion that they will do in Egypt what they refuse to do in
                    Indo-China.</p>

                <head>LORD CROMER'S RESIGNATION.</head>
                <p>EUROPEAN TRIBUTES. FRENCH AND GERMAN APPRECIATIONS. The French and German press
                    make most sympathetic comments on the retiral of Lord Cromer and express
                    confidence in the policy of this successor (Reuter) </p>
                <p> i 1 BERLIN, April 12. The newspapers speak with great admiration of Lord Cromer.
                    The “Koelnische Zeitung” says that everything the English have done in Egypt for
                    the last quarter of a century has been valuable, solid, and .durable. The “Lokal
                    Anzeiger” says that Lord Cromer is one of tfie most important statesmen of the
                    British Empire who has guided with great skill and success the important
                    interests of England in Egypt. The “Vossisehe Zeitung” states that Lord Cromer
                    during his 24 years of service in Egypt has not only forwarded British influence
                    in the land of the Pharaohs but has at. the same time considerably developed the
                    education of the country and its économie and moral condition. England is under
                    the greatest obligation to this statesman, and Sir E. Grey did not exaggerate in
                    the House of Commons when he said that Lord Cromer’s resignation was the
                    greatest loss which the British Government could sustain. The “Norddeutsehe
                    Allgemeine Zeitung” says that Sir E. Grey’s speech on I/ord Cromer’s retirai
                    shows in what high esteem this illustrious statesman is held in his own coun
                    tty. There is no doubt that Lord Cromer has acquired the greatest, merit in
                    establishing England’s position in Egypt ; but in foreign countries, and
                    especially in Germany, it is recognised that his work in Egypt from the point of
                    view of civilization has left durable witnesses of a fertile work in the domains
                    of legislation and administration. Lord Cromer has taken the leading part in the
                    financial amelioration of the country, in the improvement of communications and
                    in ( the irrigation of the Nile valley which has j extraordinarily developed the
                    fertility of the ! country as it appears from his last annual J report. I Lord
                    Cromer has falcen in hand important ' reforms the carrying out of which this
                    great j statesman has decided to leave to his successor. (Reuter) </p>

                <p>MORE QUESTIONS.</p>
                <p>RADICAL PERTINACITY.</p>
                <p>The following answers to questions on Egyptian subjects have of late been given
                    by j Sir Edward Grey :</p>

                <p>Dr. Rutherford —To ask the Secretary of. State for Foreign Affairs, whether,
                    notwithstanding that the war in the Sudan was concluded in 1899, several of the
                    Dervish emirs or commanders are still imprisoned at Damietta, in Egypt, under
                    severe disciplinary regulations; whether he will state the grounds for their
                    their continued incarceration; and whether, having regard to the present
                    peaceful condition of the Sudan, he will recommehd the authorities In Egypt to
                    grant their immediate liberation.</p>
                <p>I have no information, but will make en-quiries.</p>
                <p>MINISTRY OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION.</p>
                <p> Dr. Rutherford,— To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, what had
                    been the proportion of British subjects to Natives employed as teachers and
                    inspectors in Egyptian Government schools above the grade of kuttabs
                    (elementary) during the last five years.</p>
                <p>The whole subject is dealt with in Lord Cromer’s Report for last year, which will
                    shortly be presented to Parliament.</p>

                <p>TEACHERS’ PENSIONS.</p>
                <p>Dr. Rutherford,— To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, what are the
                    salaries and pensions payable to Native and European teachers respectively in
                    Egyptian Government Schools above the grade of kuttab (elementary school); when
                    were they fixed ; within what period, if at all, and by how much, have they been
                    augmented. I will make enquiries, and see whether the information desired by the
                    Hon. Member can be obtained.</p>
                <p>PELLAGRA IN EGYPT.</p>
                <p>Mr. John Robertson,—To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whether,
                    in view of the prevalence in Egypt of the disease pellagra, resulting from the
                    ingestion of bad maize, he will advise the Egyptian Government to take some such
                    measures of prevention as have been prescribed by the Italian law against
                    pellagra of the 21st July 1902. </p>
                <p>I have no information on the subject, but will make enquiries.</p>
                <p>CONSCRIPTION IN EGYPT.</p>
                <p> Mr. John Robertson —To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whether,
                    in view of the repeated official avowal that the present military conscription
                    in Egypt, with exemption by purchase from ballotage, is a bad one, which cannot
                    be defended on prin-ciple, as stated in Lord Cromer’s Reports for 1904, p. 43,
                    and 1905, p 68 ; and in view of the fact that numbers of poor Egyptians annually
                    sell their small possessions in order to purchase exemption, thus leaving the
                    Army to be constitted by unwilling recruits, he will advise the Egyption
                    Government to take into consideration the expediency of establishing a system of
                    paid military service such as exists in Britain. </p>
                <p>Lord Cromer, in the passages of his Reports cited by the Hon. Member, gives the
                    reasons which render the abolition of the present system difficult and
                    inexpedient. The condi-tions of thé country would make it impossible to
                    introduce with success a military system such as exists in the United Kingdom ;
                    but the subject, as may be seen from Lord Cromer’s Report, continues to engage
                    attention. Mr. Robertson asked whether this declaration —as to the impossibility
                    of a system such as that of Britain—is to be taken as final, and whether the
                    Foreign Secretary exercioes no control. Sir E. Grey answered by repeating the
                    final clause of the above answer. </p>
                <p>LESSONS IN ENGLISH</p>
                <p>Mr. John Robertson,—To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whether
                    his attention has been drawn to the fact that in the Government primary schools
                    of Egypt object lessons and geography are taught in English only ; that in the
                    Government secondary schools history, geography, arithmetic, geometry, algebra
                    and science are taught in English or in. French only ; and that in the technical
                    schools and professional colleges (with the exception of the school of law,
                    where French is still partly used), all instruction is imparted in English only,
                    and frequently by teachers who are quite unfamiliar with the vernacular ; and
                    whether, seeing that the employment of a foreign tongue as a medium of tuition
                    increases the difficulty of acquiring accurate knowledge of any subject, and is
                    regarded both by the parents of pupils and the pupils themselves as an
                    unnecessary hardship, he will advise the Egyptian Government to employ the
                    vernacular henceforth as the sole medium of tuition. </p>
                <p>The language question constitutes a very difficult problem for the Egyptian
                    Educational Department, chiefly owing to the dearth of teachers competent to
                    give the necessary instruction in Arabic, and the absenoe of scientific text
                    books in that language.</p>
                <p>In the circumstances, the Egyptian Govern-ment are frequently placed in the
                    dilemma of either giving instruction in a European language, or being content
                    with an inferior standard of teaching. And, in general, they have preferred the
                    former alternative. They are, however, fully alive to the objections referred to
                    by the Hon. Member, and are doing their best to remedy them by training
                    competent native teachers</p>
                <p>Mr. Robertson asked further, whether the lack of teachers competent to give
                    instruction in Arabic was not the result of the policy of the British Control in
                    Egypt, and whether down till some years ago such teachers were not
                    available.</p>

                <p>THE GRANDM0ULIN AFFAIR</p>
                <p>A LESSON FROM INDIA.</p>
                <p> Sir,—I was surprised to see in yesterday's issue of the “Egyptian Gazette” that
                    it was not improbable that no action would he taken by M. Grandmoulin against
                    the newspaper , which alluded to his accidental shooting of the boy in the terms
                    “guilty, as he is of assassination " It was hinted in the paragraph in question
                    that as M. Grandmoulin was an official, the Egyptian Governement was adverse to
                    his bringing an action for libel and that in consequence the Nationalists were
                    congratulating themselves that these feeble tactics were a proof that the
                    Government is afraid of the Nationalist party. If this vacillation on the part
                    of the Government is really the case, Mustapha Pasha Kamel has indeed reason to
                    declare that he has gained a signal victory and that, however false his
                    accusation may be, when a European official of the Egyptian Government is
                    concerned, he will be immune from legal consequences. Why cannot the Egyptian
                    Government follow the example of the Indian authorities in deal-ing with such
                    cases? Here is an example of how to deal with fanatical journalists, from the
                    “Daily Telegraph” : — </p>
                <p>"As to deliberate murders—unpremeditated, of course—of Indians by irate,
                    irascible officers, instances, though rare, are not wanting. Only the other day
                    two European officers of a district not very far from Lahore went out shooting
                    on horseback with a mountod orderly. Amongst the other denizens of the forest
                    which fell to their joint shots was a boar, a full grown, fat porker which the
                    pair of worthies laid much store by to furnish them with the pièces de
                    resistance of two or three heavenly feasts. As soon as the animal was despatched
                    they asked their mounted orderly to carry the carcase secured to his saddle, The
                    man, who was a follower of the Prophet, however, instead of complying with the
                    orders of the huzoors, refused point-blank to do their bidding, or even to touch
                    the unclean animal. For a second they stood aghast, petrified at his temerity,
                    but for a second only. The next moment the sahib recovered his wits, and saw it
                    was insubordination, or even worse, downright mutiny ! And what is the reward of
                    mutiny Î Short shrift and a swing into eternity.</p>
                <p>“No sooner thought of than this brilliant idea of the Imperial hunter was put
                    into practice. He aimed at the poor Indian (who cared more for the faith that
                    was in him, indeed, than even the favour of his official chief) and shot him
                    dead, without compunction or remorse. If anybody was ever guilty of murder that
                    identical sahib surely was. The British Indian Penal Code might perhaps call it
                    culpable homicide not amounting to murder, but it was nothing but murder in cold
                    blood. That murderer is at large to-day, enjoying the privileges of the dominant
                    race and the sweets of life like any innocent man, and yet we have reason to
                    believe the matter had soon reached the ears of higher authorities. The only
                    thing done in the case, however, was to get the gentler man transferred from the
                    district and a new man put in his place, with strict injunctions not to allow
                    the skeleton in the official cupboard to see the light of day, and Up to now it
                    has not seen the light of day.”</p>
                <p>So said the Punjabi, a Lahore native paper, a few months ago. The actual facts,
                    as brought out in court, are as follows : Seven years ago— not “the other day”—a
                    district superintendent of police, named Spencer, rode out to the house of a Mr.
                    Donald, near Wazirabad, to join him in an afternoon’s shooting. .Mr. Spencer
                    rode a horse belonging to a native deputy-inspector. The owner of the horse was
                    rather afraid of it and Mr. Spencer wanted to prove that beyond being restive it
                    was quite harmless. Mr. Donald asked Mr. Spencer to stay to dinner, and when he
                    agreed to do so he sent the horse hack to Wazirabad in charge of a constable
                    named Rafat Ali. Afterwards Messrs. Donald and Spencer went out with their guns,
                    but saw no game, and did not fire a single shot. Next morning it transpired that
                    that the horse had arrived at Wazirabad without Rafat Ali, and on the following
                    day the latter’s body was discovered forty yards from the Grand Trunk Road. His
                    injuries plainly showed that he had fallen from the horse on the back of his
                    head, and been dragged for some distance with his foot in the stirrup. There was
                    no mark of any bullet or shot wound. Two or three weeks later the widow of Rafat
                    Ali petitioned for a pension, on the ground that her husband died on duty.
                    Within three months a further petition was sent in, alleging that he had been
                    shot, but no mention was made of the suppositious pig. There was an official
                    inquiry, and the allegation was quickly disproved.</p>
                <p>For his share in publishing the murder story the proprietor of the Punjabi, who
                    was also printer and publisher, was sentenced to two years' rigorous
                    imprisonment(since reduced to six months’) and a fine of 1,000 rupees, and, in
                    default of payment of the fine, a further term of six months’ rigorous
                    imprisonment and a fine of 200 rupees, and, in default of payment of the fine, a
                    further term of three montlis’ imprisonment.</p>
