                    <head>THE INVASION OF ENGLAND.</head>
                    <p>If we may look to the more serious English magazines for indications of the
                        trend of policy and opinion, world-policies and ideas are indeed in the
                        melting-pot so far as England is concerned. The Anglo-French Agreement, the
                        Anglo-Japanese Alliance, and Anglo-German relations are treated to a variety
                        of interpretations that can hardly end in getting us much "forrader." The
                        conflict of opinion may be largely due to the instability of all policy,
                        caused, or, at least, aggravated, by the doubtful state of Russia. But it
                        must be also explained by the insidious disease of "drift," from which the
                        whole body politic has been suffering for so long.</p>
                    <p>In such circumstancces the alarmist is apt to be very alarming indeed, and
                        Mr. Arnold White, who writes on "The Invasion of England" in the "Monthly
                        Review," is the blackest pessimist in the world. But, conceding the
                        obsession of the Kaiser by the dream of such an event, and the willingness
                        of his subjects to support him in such a policy, Mr. White fails to convince
                        us that it could be, or would be carried out at all as he pictures it. The
                        alarmist thrills our blood in this awesome way: "On approaching the English
                        shore the German transports would have to anchor at a distance. The effort
                        would probably be made on a moonless, and, if possible, on a Saturday night.
                        When the boats of the flothilla approached within five hundred yards of the
                        beach the British fire should begin, but if it is not there the Germans
                        would land scathless....Well-timed shrapnel would, of course, play and havoc
                        with the boats, but, with every detail thought out beforehand by the
                        analytic German brain, there is no doubt that the plan of the invader would
                        have some chance of success." Moreover, there would be, he thinks, the
                        German sympathisers on the spot, who, if easily shot, would at least
                        distract attention from the landing. These would be, presumably, the army of
                        hairdressers and clerks who have been suspected of concealing Mausers under
                        their desks and bayonets in the guise of razors. </p>
                    <p>Not thus are we to be scared to death. MR. Arnold White himself is ready to
                        admit that "it is a good deal to take for granted that the German landing
                        would escape both naval attack and bad weather," and we should rub our eyes
                        before believing that an army corps, and its transport service, could be
                        quietly got ready without our hearing a word of it. His article is
                        excellent, if sensational, fiction. It will not scare us from slumber, nor
                        can it possibly embitter Anglo-German relations. </p>
                    <p>And yet- Mr. Arnold White is not the only, nor the most important, person who
                        believes in the possibility of a raid on ENgland's shores. He is not alone
                        in his despair at the apathy with regard to efficient preparation and sound
                        military defence. If only he had been more reasonable he would have led more
                        wisely to his peroration: "The English Volunteers are without equipment or
                        training; they are almost without guns; and they have had no practice in the
                        work of repelling invasion. The English Militia are 937 short in officers,
                        and 32,168 in men." These are facts. It is a fact, too, that a sense of
                        personal obligation, personal loss and suffering, would teach Englishmen to
                        know the meaning of the word "war," as others know it- an education which
                        might go further than diplomacy in hastening the millenium of peace.</p>

                    <p>St. Petersburg, November 13.</p>
                    <p>An official communique declares that the Government will no longer tolerate
                        the agitation in Poland, which its stigmatises as an impudent movement

                        the people are influenced by agitators, Poland will receive none of the
                        benefits conferred by the Tsar’s manifesto of the 18th August and that of
                        30th October. It is for this reason, also, that martial law was proclaimed.
                        M. Durnovo, assistant Minister of the Interior, is appointed Minister. The
                        Governor of Kronstadt has resigned.</p>

                    <p>An agitation is taking place in Cairo in favor of Sunday closing. The
                        majority of the most respectable establishments in the Capital have fallen
                        in with the movement, but there are one or two which are prevented from
                        doing so by the action of a native recalcitrant, who obstinately refuses. A
                        demonstration of employes took place in the Esbekieh quarter last Sunday,
                        but was not attended by any untoward incident, thanks to wise counsels
                        having prevailed. Mansfield Pasha, Commandant of the Cairo Police, himself
                        proceeded to the spot and asked the organisers to remain calm, promising to
                        do what be could to obtain the general closing of shops next Sunday.</p>

                    <head>ALEXANDRIA'S DRAINAGE. WORK OF COLLECTOR-GENERAL.</head>
                    <p>The question of the drainage of Alexandria has been discussed for years past,
                        and even up to a short time back there were still some who believed that the
                        new oollector-general would by no means perform all that it was to
                        undertake. But yesterday a very interesting visit was paid by Mr. Ambroise
                        Ralli,Vice-President, Mr. Chataway, Administrator, Dr. Gottsclicb, and of
                        her members of the administration of the Alexandria Municipality, to see the
                        results of the recent t severe test to which the collector-general has been
                        put.</p>
                    <p>During the last week the Alexandria Water Company has been cleaning out its
                        settling basins at the waterworks. This running off of a huge quantity of
                        water into the main drain (the eastern and the general collector) of the
                        city means that about 2,000 lota of mud collected since six months must have
                        passed through the drain. The question was whether the collector would be
                        able to take away this residue of mud or whether there would be a
                        considerable deposit. The test was acknowledged by capable engineering
                        specialists to be one of, the utmost severity to apply to a drain, but we
                        arc glad to announce that the collector stood the test excellently well, and
                        that the result of yesterday’s inspection was in every respect extremely
                        satisfactory. There was no siiting up of the drain by the mud, and the
                        current at the end of the main outlet was quite strong. As regards the fecal
                        matter, this, it would appear, becomes dissolved on its way through the
                        drain owing to the action of salt water.</p>
                    <p>It will probably be remembered that when the main drain in Sistera-street was
                        drained for the time being during the course of the recent work into the
                        Eastern Harbour there was a most noisome odour, and the water in the
                        neighborhood of the outlet was so polluted that it became quite a dark
                        colour. But now the outlet of the collector is at Silsileh and there is
                        practically no pollution nor disagreeable smell. This confirms the views of
                        Hobrecht, who held that the collector would act as a septic tank,owing to
                        there being such a large volume of sea water in the collector general. If
                        this continues when other drains are run into the collector general, the
                        faecal and other matter carried away will be automatically disinfected,and
                        the collector general will to of immense benefit to the city.</p>

                        the cargo when the ship was off the Portuguese coast. Smoke was issuing from
                        the ventilator, but the fire was kept under. The fire originated in No. 2

                        smoulder all the voyage.</p>

                    <p>To-day the action for damages brought by M. Pontrel against the Hon. A. Davey
                        was beard before the second Civil Chamber of the Cairo Mixed Courts. The
                        Hon. A. Davey was represented by Maitre Carton de Wiart and M. Poutrel by
                        Maitre Pangolo, late counsel for the Sucreries; Judge Hersbruch presided.
                        Maitre Pangalo opened the case for the plaintiff shortly before 11 a.m. with
                        a long speech which lasted over half-an-hour. His argument was that the
                        evidence went to prove that the Hon. A. J. Davey was in reality au courant
                        from the beginning with state of affairs, and that bis dismissal of M.
                        Poutrel was actuated by an unworthy desire to fix the responsibility for
                        what had occurred on others. In the course of bis pleading counsel for
                        plaintiff enlarged on the letter written by the Hon. A. J. Davey to his
                        colleague, and mentioning Sir Ernest Cassel, among others, which has already
                        been published.</p>
                    <p>Maitre Carton de Wiart prefaced his defence by a demand as to whether Maitre
                        Pangolo had seen the original letter, or a copy of the same, and after a
                        little passage of arms between counsel Maitre Carton de Wiart caused some
                        sensation by stating that the letter in question had either been stolen from
                        the Hon. A. J. Davey’s private copybook or burglariously abstracted from the
                        safe of the Sucreries Company. He then stated that M. Poutrel, in bringing
                        an action against the Hon. A. J. Davey for wrongful dismissal, did not
                        appear to realise that the latter had acted not in his private capacity, but
                        as one of the directors, after a meeting of the board of directors bad
                        authorised him to dismiss M. Poutrel or to accept bis resignation should he
                        offer it.</p>
                    <p>Maitre Pangolo objected that this part of Maitre Carton de Wiart's defence
                        had not been communicated to him, and therefore appealed to the Court for an
                        adjournment of the bearing for one week.</p>
                    <p>The appeal was granted, and the case will again come before the Court on the
                        21st inst</p>
                    <p>It is considered very probable that the hearing of the third report of the
                        experts, MM. Fourneron and Sampaolo, re the sugar factories, will have to be
                        postponed till about the 23rd inst, as the experts will be unable to

                    <p>Disons à propos des Sucreries, qu’il est regrettable qu’une partie de la
                        presse locale ait era devoir influencer l’opinion publique par des
                        commentaires déplacés et de prétendues revelations, qui, en tous cas,
                        auraient dû être réservées aux debats.</p>
                    <p>Lorsque la crise que traverse maintenant l’industrie sucriére aura ete
                        surmontee, on comprendra qu’il a ete pratique de confier les principaux
                        interets a une seule personne, afin de la mettre a meme de les concilier
                        dans une juste mesure.</p>

                    <p>We give below the text of a circular issued by the Ministry of the Interior
                        relative to the pilgrimage of 1905 6. This document states that the Ministry
                        would like to see every would-be pilgrim before leaving his moudirieh fully
                        aware of the name of the steamer by which he was going to sail from Suez to
                        Jeddah and the exact date of departure. As it is not certain whether this
                        certainty can be assured, it has been decided to try the experiment for this
                        season with pilgrims from the Kalioubieh and Assiont Moudirieha only.
                        Accordingly, the S.S. Keneh,which leaves Suez on the 4th January, will be
                        reserved exclusively for pilgrims from the Assiont Mondirieh, and the S. S.
                        Missir, on her voyage, commencing January 8, will similarly be reserved for
                        the Kalioubieh Hagis. Pilgrims are urged to delay for as short a time as
                        possible at Suez, and not to wait till the last moment before leaving their
                        moudiriahs.</p>
                    <p>The following steamers will be employed for the Egyptian pilgrim traffic this
                        season and will leave on the following dates:-</p>
                    <p>S.S. Gharbieh Dec. 2, 16, and 30, Jan. 11 and 23.</p>
                    <p>S.S. Rahmanieh Dec. 4 and 18, Jan. 1, 14, and 26. </p>
                    <p>S. S. Missir Dec. 11, Jan. 8.</p>
                    <p>S.S. Fayoum Dec. Hand 23, Jan. 6 and 19.</p>
                    <p>S.S. Mariout Dec. 21, Jan. 2, 15 and 27.</p>
                    <p>S.S. Neghileh Dec. 25, Jan. 22.</p>
                    <p>S.S. Minieh Dec. 28, Jan. 9 and 20.</p>
                    <p>S.S. Menzaleh Dec. 31, Jan. 13 and 25.</p>
                    <p>S.S. Keneh Jan. 4, 18 and 29.</p>
                    <p>There will thus be 31 sailings between and including December 2, 1905, and
                        January 29, 1906, and the steamers engaged will be able to transport a total
                        of 2 2,977 Hagis to the Holy Places of Islam in their various voyages.</p>

                    <head>THE FUNERAL OF ME. MOLTENI.</head>
                    <p>Yesterday afternoon the funeral of the late Me. Molteni took place at Cairo.
                        The funeral cortege left 19, Telephone-street, the house of M. Guido Moroni,
                        where Me. Molteni died, at 3 p.m., for St. Joseph’s Church, Ismailis, where
                        the funeral service took place. Many of the friends of the late Me. Molteni
                        were present at the sad ceremony, after which the coffin was removed to the
                        Bab el Hadid station for transportation to Italy.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday morning, during the audience before the Cairo Mixed Civil Court,
                        Me. Prunieres, the president of the Court, made a brief address to the
                        members of the Bar, in which be expressed his grief at the sadden death of
                        Me. Molteni, and eulogised the brilliant abilities and unflagging industry
                        of the deceased. Me. Carton de Wiart then thanked the president in the name
                        of the Bar, recalling the professional abilities of the deceased, and
                        pointing out that though as a member of the Contentienx Me. Molteni had
                        technically ceased to be reckoned among the members of the Egyptian Bar, the
                        latter body had always regarded the deceased and his colleagues as their
                        confreres. He also praised the professional merits of the deceased and
                        offered his widow the sincere sympathy of the whole judicial body. The
                        Tribunal then rose for a short time at the invitation of the president as a
                        testimony of its respect for the memory of Me. Molteni.</p>
                    <p>Nothing has yet been decided as to who will succeed the late Substitut du
                        Contentieux. Among the names of possible successors mentioned is that of M.
                        Emos, judge of the Cairo Native Tribunal. If this be confirmed, it is
                        possible that a substitut adjoint may be appointed from among the younger
                        members of the Cairo Bar.</p>

                        <p>Played on Saturday on the ground of the former, before a good torn-out of
                            Spectators. The game started promptly and the opening exchanges gave
                            promise of some good play by both sides. The visitors were early
                            aggressive, but Hopkins and Davis were quite equal to the attack. The
                            Saints transferred the play to the other end and from a pass by Cowie,
                            Lark heat Doyle, but off side was given and the point nullified. Later
                            Keen had a nice opening, but shot high over the bar. The visitors again
                            took up the running, and through a miskick by Hopkins, Daiai got in and
                            beat Mitchell with a low raking shot which gave the home custodian no
                            chance to save. From the kickoff the visitors again got away, and
                            Crosswell spoiled a good opening by shooting past The homesters were
                            soon again in the vicinity of Doyle and a miskick by one of the visiting
                            backs let MoCron well away, but Stannard intercepted. Lark got
                            possession and pat across to Tulloch, who shot over. Play was again
                            transferred, and from a corner kick, well placed by Maynard, Fowler
                            headed a beautiful goal, thus placing his side two up. Half-time arrived
                            with the score unchanged.</p>
                        <p>The Saints re-arranged their front line at the restart, Cowie going in
                            centre and McCron inside left. The change looked like having the desired
                            effect, for again the homesters pressed, but their efforts to score were
                            fruitless. Bright now came forward to partner Lark, and some good wing
                            play ensued, Lark in particular playing very prettily. The visitors’
                            backs had now got quite settled down and let little pan them, so that
                            Doyle was not very severely tested, although McCron looked well set for
                            getting through the defence when be unfortunately came a cropper,
                            McCormack clearing without difficulty. The visitors’ right now made
                            tracks toward Mitchell, and he was called upon to handle twice in rapid
                            succession, hat a proper clearance could not be effected, and Crosswell
                            scored number three from close in, Mitchell again having no chance to
                            save. The Saints tried hard to notch a point, hot the forwards failed at
                            goal. They don’t seem yet to have found their shooting boots. It has to
                            be aid though that they are now a much improved lot, and it was hard
                            luck that they did not at least get one point The visitors played
                            several of the "Dubs” in their team, their skipper having been unable to
                            get together a team composed exclusively of Berks. They played a steady
                            and gentlemanly game throughout and quite deserved the win. The

                        <head>BOULAC FOOTBALL.</head>
                        <p>The meeting of the home team and tbs Band of the Inniskilling Fusiliers
                            proved to be a big attraction at Boulac,and the huge number of
                            spectators present had the satisfaction of witnessing a fire exposition
                            of the game. Boulac won the toss and defended Embabeh end. From the
                            kick-off, Boulac took up the attacking, and but for the incidental
                            retaliations made by the visitors, kept it up all through the first
                            half. The first goal of the match was secured by Esan off a corner kick,
                            about 15 minutes from the start, but the visitors soon equalised by a
                            penalty goal, a few minutes after. At the change-over the score stood at
                            1-all. In the second half the dash and determination of both teams for
                            supremacy kept the crowd on the tip-toe of excitement When well into the
                            second half, Hayes registered the home team’s second goal from a
                            beautiful centre by Simmonds. The band tried bard to put matters. but
                            the home defence prevailed and were left the winners by 2 to 1. Mr.
                            Allport was referee.</p>

                    <p>EGYPT'S ASIATIC NEIGHBOURS UNDER THE EARLIER DYNASTIES.</p>
                    <p>The discoveries of recent years in Egyptian archeology have greatly increased
                        our knowledge of the geographical extent of Egyptian dominion and influence
                        in Western Asia under the earlier dynasties. This additional information has
                        chiefly been derived from the closer attentin paid to all remains of
                        hieroglyphical inscriptions in the Sinaitic peninsula, as well as from a
                        re-investigation of all known texts upon monuments papyri, referring to
                        lands or peoples east of Egypt proper.</p>
                    <p>The reliefs of the Pharohs Zosiri-Noutirkha and Sanakht of the First Dynasty,
                        near Sinai, carry back the date for Egyptian expeditions to that region far
                        anterior to the era of Senerferon and the "pyramid kings"; whilst the fact
                        that the Fifth Dynasty monarchs conducted campaigns in Syria is proved by
                        the inscription in the tomb of Anti at Sakkarah, and for the Sixth Dynasty,
                        by that of Ouni. He calls the Asiatics Amon and Hirashu, names they bore at
                        times through all Egyptian history.</p>
                    <p>The new discoveries, however, to be particularly alluded to concern 12th
                        dynasty inscriptions, one of them a memorial of a certain Khousovkou, found
                        by Mr. Garstang i 1900; and two others of persons named Ptah-ourou, and
                        Sinofrit, were discovered at Sarbout-el-Khadim in the Sinaitic district, and
                        which give further information of a hitherto unrecorded Asiatic expedition
                        under Usirtasen III; also of Egyptian officials being at the
                        Sarbout-el-Khadim mines under Amenemhat III..</p>
                    <p>But the new texts disclose a more interesting fact than these, and that is
                        that the Egyptians were well acquanted with three tribes mentioned in the
                        geographical and ethnographical list in Genesis 36. These are the Lotan, or
                        Latanu, the Horites, and the Aiah, and further, they connected them together
                        geographically and racially as doess the Old Testament.</p>
                    <p>The first of these important inscriptions records a war waged against the
                        country of the Sakimim, and the tribe, or people, of the Lotanu who were
                        encountered during an expedition to the land of Monitiou-Sati, which in
                        early Egyptian times signified near Asia, or rather South Syria. Immediately
                        the text was deciphered it confirmed the supposition of Professor Max Muller
                        that the people read as Tanou upon the celebrated Berlin papyrus of the XII.
                        dynasty, containing the travels, or adventures, of Saneha, should be read
                        Lotanu. </p>
                    <p>He speaks of two districts occupied bby them as Lotanu, simple, and Higher
                        (or Upper) Lotanu. The inscription of Senofrit mentions a chief, or sheikh,
                        named Khebta, or Khebtata, who, he says was brother to a king of the Lotan,
                        and this Sinaitic prince was evidently an ally, if not even an official, of
                        the Egyptians, for his name appears in several lists of their officers and
                        overseers. Whether he served as guide to their parties or was awarded a post
                        among the staff of the Egyptian colony at Sarbout-el-Khdim in order to
                        conciliate his countrymen, is unknown. It will be seen that these monumental
                        records and the Saneha papyrus all assign Lotan to the Sinaitic district in
                        "Middle Empire" times. It is very singular that in later times, for instance
                        under the reign of Thotmes III., upper and lowe Lotanu signified regions
                        away in Palestine and North Syria. But this corresponds to the frequent
                        enlargement, or projection rather, of the name for a neighbouring district
                        to a further district as the geographical knowledge of the nation using the
                        title, to denote a frontier teritory expands. As Palestine, Greece, and
                        Germany gradually embraced more extended boundaries so to the Egyptians.
                        Lotanu was at first close to their eastern frontier; as their conquests
                        extended further into Asia the name was applied to countries further away. </p>
                    <p>As M. Levy remarks, it is evident to us, now that we have more texts to guide
                        us, that primarily Lotanu was the part of the Sinaiticpeninsula bordering
                        upon the Pharaonic mining colonies, probably upon the Syrian or Palestine
                        side of these. In fact, the desert between Palestine and Egypt, with the
                        hills and the valleys of which Sarbout-el-Khadim was one, was situated
                        within its area.</p>
                    <p>In the time of Saneha, he, having penetrated further into the valleys and
                        oases in which the Lotanu lined, projected part of their domain to a more
                        distant position, and so writes of a higher Lotanu to the north towards
                        Palestine.</p>
                    <p>As time rollled on the Egyptians applied the name, perhaps merely for want of
                        knowing better,to other areas until under Thotmes III. it was at times used
                        as designation for southern and northern Syria, or as M. Levy further says ,
                        they first placed it at the fortress of the Semitic people on the threshold
                        of Asia away form the Mediterranean towards Sinai, and finally transferred
                        it to all the hinterland of the Palestine plateaus and central Syria. As
                        mentioned, these early monuments, in addition to the Lotanu, speak of the
                        Horu, or Horites, as contiguous to each other. This second race's district
                        at a later epoch was transferred to the Syrian shore, for the Golenischef
                        papyrus calls the Mediterranean near to Byblos, or Gebal, the sea of Hor.
                        This teaches us that Hor represented to the Egyptian at the greatest peiod
                        of their territorial agrandisement the Shephela of the Hebrews. In Egyptian
                        documents up to the 19th dynasty it also signified a district close to the
                        Egyptian frontier near the Sinaitic region.</p>
                    <p>For instance, Seti I. says that in proceeding from Zaru, a place near the
                        modern Imaeliyeh, to Kanana he passed through the Horite territory.
                        Therefore it was, at his epoch, the north-west angle ofthe Sinatic district
                        commencing at Zaru, the "gate of Egypt," and stretching by the time of
                        THotmes III. if not in that of Seti I. as far as Gaza. In fact about 2000
                        B.C., Horu and Lotanu were between South Palestine and Sinai, projecctingg
                        somewhat into each, and were not many days' journey from the Egyptian
                        Delta.</p>
                    <p>This agrees very well with Genesis 36, 20-30 where Lotan is labelled as
                        "first born of Seir," a people, or district, lying between south Palestine
                        and the Araba Gulf. Hori is son of this Lotan, and, like all nomadic
                        patriarchal people, pushed out from the Lotan area into further fields and
                        pastures, occupying according to Egyptian evidence the districts west of the
                        Sinaitic region, towards Gaza.</p>
                    <p>It is evident that the Egyptians have in their Sinaitic inscriptions
                        faithfully transcribbed the local tribal names, subsequently using these
                        ethnic titles as geographical ones. This is further confirmed by the fact
                        that Saneha mentions Aiah in the Bible, the nephew ofLotan, (see Genesis
                        36.24), and also either Qedem, or Adema-Edom: the correct reading of these
                        two names is still undecided: Saneha speaks of Aiah as an oasis famous for
                        its vineyards.</p>
                    <p>It is certainly remarkable that the two names of Asiatic neighbours to Egypt
                        previous to the new Empire should be found in Genesis 36, and that a little
                        later these under the 12th dynasty should be associated in a papyrus with a
                        third Biblical name; all these three being in the Old Testament records
                        placed in the regions between Palestine and Egypt, and the proof of this
                        should be forthcoming as soon as ever Egyptian texts situated in the proper
                        region beyond their frontier where they might be anticipated are
                        scientifically examined. Of course there are scores of the Biblical places
                        and peoples also mentioned upon other later Egyptian records. </p>
                    <p>As has been explained, the names of Horu and Lotanu were subsequently made to
                        embrace regions far distant from their original sites, the Horu being
                        carried away to part of Phoenicia and the Lotanu to Syria by the date of the
                        Decree of Canopus in Ptolemaic times.</p>

                    <head>PROGRESS OF THE CAPE-CAIRO RAILWAY.</head>
                    <p>Writing on the subject of the progress of the Cape to Cairo Railway, a
                        correspondent of the "Engineering Magazine" says: Quite recently I had the
                        opportunity of discussing the effect of the death of Mr. Cecil Rhodes upon
                        the Cape to Cairo Railway with Sir Charles Metcalfe, who, en parenthese, has
                        been the leading spirit of the railway all through. I told him that in some
                        quarters the impression still remained that the death of Mr. Rhodes had
                        adversely affected, and was still affecting, the great railway scheme. Now,
                        as Sir Charles Metcalfe is so closely associated with the project, it was
                        perhaps hardly fair to expect him to say very much either way, but he agreed
                        with me that, so far as he was aware, the railway scheme had not suffered to
                        any appreciable extent, if indeed at all, by the demise of his lamented
                        friend; and he added that if it were otherwise the line from the south would
                        scarcely be where it is to-day, namely, a good many miles beyond Kalomo,
                        which is about 100 miles north-east of Victoria Falls, and well on the way
                        to Rhodesia Broken Hill, the next great stage to the terminus of the
                        southern end of Lake Tanganyika. "It must be admitted," Sir Charles
                        proceeded, "that Providence has been very kind to us in regard to the
                        stretch north of Bulawayo, in that we have coalfields at Wankie to help us
                        along, and are now making straight for Broken Hill, which, as you are aware,
                        is a rich copper region." He further stated that some people seemed to think
                        that sentiment was at the bottom of Mr. Rhodes's plans respecting the
                        railway, whereas the latter had always regarded the matter from a hard and
                        fast business standpoint. </p>

                    <head>ADMIRAL'S APOLOGIA.</head>
                    <p>Admiral Nebogatoff and a party of his officers arrived last week at
                        Marseilles, and soon afterwards they proceeded on their journey to Russia by
                        way of Paris. In the course of an interview which he had with a
                        correspondent of the "Echo de Pareis" the unfortunate commander of a
                        squadron of Rodjestvensky's ill-fated fleet asked not to be styled
                        "admiral," as he was now a simple citizen. He declared that he had struck
                        his flag at the battle of Tsushima because further resistance was hopeless. </p>
                    <p>A sentiment of infinite pity for my men determined me to prefer the disgrace
                        of a necessary capitulation to the sacrifice of my 2,000 gallant sailors and
                        officers. I repeat, I am, perhaps, guilty in having done this. My conduct,
                        perhaps, deserves death. Then let them shoot me. I am ready to die. But in
                        what country has a combatant, however guilty he may be, not at least
                        obtained the favor of being tried by his peers before being shot? If the law
                        will that I ought to be shot, let it take its course. All that I ask is what
                        the most miserable murderer can solicit from the justice of men, namely,
                        trial before death."</p>

                    <head>PROBLEM OF COTTON SUPPLY.</head>
                    <p>The question of the prospective raw cotton supply for the season ending
                        August, 1906, is (says the "Times Commercial Supplement") engaging the
                        serious attention of all people directly connected with the trade. Several
                        more or less influential authorities have issued their opinions as to what
                        is likely to be grown in the United States, but the market is hardly willing
                        to accept any particular estimate. Views vary widely. Mr. Theodore Price,
                        whose name has loomed largely in the cotton world for some years past,
                        thinks that we may have an output of 11,250,000 bales, as a minimum. Mr.
                        A.J. Buston, a leading Liverpool importer, whose opinion has influenc, holds
                        that the yield will not be more than 10,250,000 bales. It is noteworthy that
                        Mr. Henry Neill, of New Orleans, and Messrs. Neill Brothers, of London,
                        cannot see their way to give out any estimate, owing chiefly to diverse
                        reports as to the condition of the growing crop in relation to frosts. All,
                        however, agree that, given open weather henceforward, the supply will be
                        larger than is at present expected by the bulls. The American cotton crop of
                        last season was 13,536,841 bales. These large figures followed five years of
                        comparative scarcity, the average crops for that period being about
                        10,300,000 bales per year. It is a rather striking thing that,
                        notwithstanding the "record crop" of last season, the stock in Liverpool is
                        only about 580,250 bales, as compared with 251,010 bales twelve months ago.
                        The consumption of cotton was never greater than at the present time. All
                        the mills in Great Britain are working at full stretch, and more factories
                        are running today than a year ago, owing to the starting of new mills in
                        Lancashire. Continental mills and the American factories are alse working
                        more. If the American crop this season proves to be a little ovver eleven
                        millions of bales there will, it is considered, be plenty to go round. </p>
                    <p>In respect to the Egyptian cotton crop, it is agreed by the most trustworthy
                        authorities that the output will be larger than that of last season. The
                        acreage under cultivation is more extensive, and the weather has been
                        generally favorable. The Brazilian crop is also doing welll, and here also a
                        larger supply is expected this season than last year. Then, in respect of
                        East Indian cotton, Bombay authorities consider that we shall have 300,000
                        bales more this year than last season. Lancashire uses scarcely any East
                        Indian cotton. It is a short staple and is chiefly used in China, Japan, and
                        the Continent, where coarse counts are spun. Summing up the position, we may
                        broadly state that the prospects of a total supply from all sources
                        sufficient for the requirements of the world are not discouaging, but in
                        regard to American descriptions it will largely depend on the weather
                        between now to Christmas as to whether the crop will be 10,500,000 bales or
                        11,500,000 bales. </p>

                    <head>AMERICAN COTTON DISTRIBUTION (1904-05)</head>
                    <p>At the last session of Congress a joint resolution was adopted authorising
                        the collection and compilation of statistics upon : - (1) cotton production
                        as returned by the ginners; (2) consumption of cotton in the United States;
                        (3) supply of cotton sold by manufacturers; (4) quantity of cotton exported.
                        This work is to be done yearly, and the first report, up to August 31 last,
                        covering the various questions involved, has just been issued. September 1
                        has been arbitrarily fixed as the beginning of the commercial year in
                        cotton. The only significance of this date is that it marks the time when
                        the general movement of cotton begins to include some considerable portion
                        of the new crop. As the mills do not discriminate strictly between old and
                        new cotton taken by them for spinning, the Census plan is to take as the
                        supply of the year, beginning September 1, all that has been ginned between
                        that date and August 31 of the following year, to which is added the stock
                        of cotton left over from the previous year. When this plan has thoroughly
                        adjusted itself to conditions, it is believed that it will furnish a much
                        needed check upon the statistics compiled by the Agricultural Department,
                        and that the two reports, while they will apparently disagree, each will
                        really be the complement of the other. </p>
                    <p>The following table issued in the report shows the supply and distribution of
                        American grown cotton in the United States for the year ended August 31,

                    <head>FRENCH-CANADIANS AND FEDERATION.</head>
                    <p>Mr. Francis W. Grey, in the "Empire Review," vouches for the loyalty of the
                        French Canadians, who constitute about 40 per cent. of the population, and
                        insists on the necessity of taking them into account in any scheme of
                        Imperial Federation. There is no bond in a common creed between the Irishmen
                        in Canada and the descendents of the French. The Irishmen dislike and
                        distrust the French Canadian Catholic more than they do the British
                        Protestant; and the French Canadians, not unnaturally, return the
                        compliment. On the other hand, the French Canadians are intensely loyal to
                        the Crown, which, as Lord Grey has said guarantees their rights and
                        privileges. "Any man who, in the province of Quebec, should preach
                        disloyalty to the Crown would be regarded as a madman or a fool." </p>
                    <p>Mr. Grey thus states Canadian Federationist ideas, as he conceives them:-</p>
                    <p>"What is wanted is a federation providing for the natural growth of colonies,
                        oversea dominions, into nations possessing in matters military, commercial
                        and relating to treaties, the fullest and most complete autonomy. It must be
                        a Federation linking these nations into one Empire, wherein each remains a
                        sovereign State, subject, not to an Imperial Parliament, but to the Monarch
                        alone. Such nations might, as Sir Wilfrid Laurier has suggested, be united
                        by treaties, commercial, military and others, drawn up by His Majesty's
                        Ministers for each State, and agreed to by all. Each State, in an Empire of
                        this making, while retaining full control of its military and naval forces,
                        as of the taxation necessary for defence, obigations, and the advice of His
                        Majesty's Ministers on the spot, should decide." </p>
