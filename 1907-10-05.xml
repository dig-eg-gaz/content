                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed
                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.

                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the

                    <head> GERMANY AND PRUSSIA </head>
                    <p> GERMANY AND PRUSSIA. Considerable interest has been aroused in Germany by an
                        article, which has lately appeared in an important German magazine
                        containing a criticism of the state of Germany with special reference to the
                        predominance of Prussia, Germany has nothing to fear from internal
                        dissensions. She is united and will remain united. But she has much to gain
                        from the free discussion of her own affairs and conditions, and has suffered
                        from the tendeney, which has long been marked, of ber writers and
                        instructors to busy themselves and their readers rather with the affairs of
                        other countries than with those of Germany. A sore point with some of the
                        Germans is the preeminence or predominance of Prussia, says the "Morning
                        Post" though it has arisen nator ally enough from the course of events by
                        which Germany became united. Prossin is not and never was a nation; the name
                        stands first for a province, then for a dynasty, and then for a State the
                        creation of that dynasty. But it is the dynasty and the State that united
                        Germany and has in that way won its place at her head. The Prussian
                        tradition has stamped itself on German history. But this same tradition isin
                        many respecta alien to Germany at large and by no means acceptable to the
                        people of an or parts of the Empire. The Prossian state was mad by the House
                        of Hohenzollern, who, starting as Margraves of Brandenburg, obtained a Pro
                        sian province and spent the time between the Reformation and the Revolution
                        in trying to raise their monarchy into a Great Power Frederic the Great
                        found himself as a young man left as an absolute monarch with a welldrilled
                        army, an obedient bureaucracy, aud his own ambition. He had a certain claim
                        to the province of Silesis, at that time in Austrian possession, and he took
                        his opportunity to invade and seize that province, which he was able to keep
                        during the series of wars into which its occupation led him. He managed also
                        to obtain a share of Poland, and bis successors of the revolutionary
                        erafwere mainly preoccupied with the effort to obtain more territory-at one
                        time in Poland, at another in Hanover-until in the struggle against Napoleon
                        Prussis was crushed and reduced to a small ares between the Elbe and the
                        Baltio. The Prussia of those days had prodaoed no great man except Frederio
                        the Great, but as the rest of Germany was under French protection the
                        patriots looked to Prussis whose Princes were very glad to enlist such
                        talents as they could into their service. The Steins, Scharnhorsts and other
                        great men who made the Prussia of 1818 were Germans but for the most part
                        not Prussians. Even Moltke, though a German, was not a Prussian by birth.
                        The country was despotically governed until 1848, when in the terror caused
                        by the Revoluion. Hence. The Germans, therefore, have no neer! to go abroad,
                        nor even outside of Prussia, for model of the qualities that all the world
                        loves There is, however, something more than the distinction between
                        Prussian hardness and South German softness at the bottom of the South
                        German dissatisfaction, Germany fifty years ago was democratic in spirit.
                        Prussia, except as regards a part of its urban population is dominated by
                        the spirit of aristocracy or caste. The domestio strife of Germany will for
                        a long time be between the tradition of the Prussian squires and that of the
                        Radicals of the South-West. It is not a geographical conflict, but the types
                        have local associations dating from the middle of the last century. The
                        feeling is widespread that the Empire under Prossian guidance is imbued with
                        more than a due share of the Prussian spirit, and that the Empire tends to
                        develop more than it should along the old automatio lines and fails to
                        assimilate what was best in the national democratic movement of sixty years
                        ago. Perhaps both elements are needed for a full development of German
                        national life. </p>

                    <p>"A gentleman who holds an official position in Egypt" recently made the
                        following state ment, says the "Daily Graphic": - </p>
                    <p> "The Egyptian soilis becoming impoverished. In olden days the land during
                        high Nile received that deposit of mud which gave it a new lease of life
                        rendering the application of of a fertiliser less necessary than at present.
                        Systems of irrigation and damming are alter ing all this. Summer crops are
                        grown. Acoordingly more is taken out of the land, wbile at the same time it
                        receives less. Egypt has no natural manure to give to the land. What manure
                        there is is used for fuel, for which purpose it is not only cheap, but its
                        peculiarproperties make it very suitable. Tbere is, however, a substance
                        which for ages has been used as a fertiliser. It is found in little heaps
                        and hills and is the residue of the clay and straw composition which the
                        Jews used in making bricks. This substance, known as confri, is exceedingly
                        rich in ammonia. In the past there seemed an almost unlimited supply of it,
                        but it is clear now that it is becoming exhausted. The best hills are being
                        used up, and the fellah has to go further afield for his supply. There is no
                        hope, therefore, that confri will provide the fertiliser for which soon
                        there will be a very great demand." </p>

                    <head>EGYPT'S STEEL IRRIGATION CANAL </head>
                    <p>A large area of land in Figypt, about midway between Assuan and Ecko, and
                        consisting of some 12.000 acres i mider preparation for irrigation and in
                        order to carry out the proat it has been necessary to construct a steel
                        canal of nearly a mile in length. The east bank of the Nile at Kom Ombo is
                        too low to allow of the land being irrigated at floodtide in the usual
                        manner, and in vier to obtain an adequate supply it was necessary to put
                        down sets of powerful and specially designed pumps. These pumps lift the
                        water throngh suction mains 64 tt, in diameter, and discharge it into
                        riveted steel rising mains of the same capacity, which in their turn deliver
                        the water into a service reservoir. A large steel canal starts from this
                        service reservoir, and delivers the water into distributing earth canals or
                        culverts, from which it flows on to the land. The lift of the pumps is from
                        16 to 22 yards, and the top of the reservoir wall is 115 yards above sea
                        level at Alexandria. The canal is composed of riveted steel, the plates
                        being 1/4 in. thick. It is nearly semi-circular in form, 6 1/2 yards in
                        diameter, with 20-in. straight sides; being. therefore, at the top, nearly
                        19ft. deep. It is subdivided into seventeen sections, averaging nearly 105
                        yard each. This was done in order to allow for expansion and contraction,
                        the sections being connected by masonry basins and packed expansion joints.
                        Timber cradles were placed about 30 ft. apart, to keep the bottom level, and
                        props to prevent the sides from dropping out of shape. Great difficulty was
                        experienced in preventing the sections from falling out of level, owing to
                        the sand forming the foundations being blown from underneath by the wind and
                        also much difficulty, due to the onequal expansion of the steel plates on
                        the sunny side. </p>

                    <head>THE SOLTAN'S MISRULE </head>
                    <p>LONDON, October 4. </p>
                    <p>Ahmed Djelall Eddin Pasha, former oonfidant of the Sultan now in Cairo, in a
                        letter to the Times" was the Porte that if the intolerable abuses under
                        which Turks as well as Christians in Turkey are suffering are not remedied
                        the Turks may have recourse to extreme violence </p>
                    <p> Ahmed Djelall Eddin declares that bitter experience shows that a second
                        reign like the Sultan's is an impossibility in Turkey. He refers to the
                        possibility of the proclamation of an Arab Empire in Mecor which wonld be
                        supported by the whole of Islam. (Renster) </p>
                    <p> General Ahmed Djelalleddin Pasha, the brother-in-law of Prince Omar Pasha
                        Toussoon and Prince Djemil Pasha Toussoun, has been a well-known figure in
                        Cairo for the past few years. His wife died a few years ago and was buried
                        in the Mosque of Nebi Daniel at Alex andris. Since her death her husband,
                        who for more than ten years was the most powerful and honorable of the
                        Sultan's advisers, has resided in Egypt and resisted all the blandishmerits
                        of the Sublime Porte to induce him to go back to Stambonl. </p>
                    <p>An Eaglishman, who knew the Pasha at Constantinople, thus describes him :. </p>
                    <p> Djellaleddin Pasha was for years foremost and prime favorite among all the
                        Sultan's subjects, and fully deserved the trust reposed in him as an
                        honorableand upright gentleman. His dow.all, therefore, camem a shock to all
                        who knew him, the greater, perhaps for that the re port added that he bad
                        been denounced by the Seerat Police of the Palace, a force which he himselt
                        created and organised, and of which, among many offices, he was been the
                        working chiet. A remarkable and singularly fascinating personality, Ahmed
                        Pasha's most alient quality was ever an absolutely whole hearted devotion to
                        his master and wheu at last the eneinies who ever dog the footsteps of Royal
                        favorites succeeded inalienating from him Abdul Hamid's confidence and
                        affection, the cir cumstance was received as indicating a further sinister
                        advance in the progress of that be setting "manie de la persécution" which
                        has for years haunted the gloomy potentate of Yildiz During his long term of
                        honored ser vice Ahmed Pasha enjoyed an absolutely unique position in the
                        Yildiz set. Privileges have been his which no other Turkish funer tionary
                        would have dared to solieit. Of late yerrs, for instance, social communion
                        between setting "manie de la persécution" which has for years haunted the
                        gloomy potentate of Yildiz During his long term of honored ser vice Ahmed
                        Pasha enjoyed an absolutely unique position in the Yildiz set. Privileges
                        have been his which no other Turkish fune tionary would have dared to
                        solicit. Of late years, for instance, social communion between Turks and
                        Europeans in the capital has been tacitly, and in some cases openly,
                        probibited. Yet Ahmed was a prominent member of the "English" elnb, and to
                        which practically all the English colony belongs in common with the chief
                        members of other Eeropean com monities. Almost every day, indeed, Fridays
                        excepted, during the many years I knew him, Ahmed Pasha took his place at
                        the Bridge table--for Bridge was popular in Constantinople long before it
                        was heard of in Europe, and it may be said that he is both a fine player and
                        a good loser. It has often been suggested that this licensed association
                        with Europeana was not wholly foreign to his functions as chiet of the
                        Secret Police. As to this, how ever, it may be said that all who have known
                        the Pasha were penetrated with the sense of his complete honorability. In
                        proof of this is the fact that when Abdnl Hamid sought to end his
                        differences with the chiefs in Paris of the "Young Turkey" party he employed
                        in vain one intermediary after another until it was intimated to bim that
                        the ses vices of Ahmed Djellaleddin as envity would procure the desired
                        result. The Pasha, there. fore, was sent to Paris and on his representa
                        tions the "Young Turkey" leaders complied </p>
                    <p>It is noteworthy in this cunnection that Ahmed's influence with his master
                        has sofficed to assure to them the immunity that he promised. It is within
                        my knowledge that on several nocasions he has been urged to diverge from
                        this line of conduct, and that at the risk of that loss of favor which has
                        now overtaken him be invariably refused to put bis hand to any unworthy
                        action. Oddly enough, until now this inflexibility has served rather than
                        injured him in his master's eyes : for the Sultan, though reely using spies
                        and traitors, has a wholesome contempt for such gentry. Covered with honors,
                        only before his fall from favor recentiy, indeed, the Sultan bestowed on him
                        the last and highest decoration in his gift. </p>

                    <p>A correspondent writes T50 very recently the French Governments action in
                        Morocco AS the object of the severest criticism in the Nationalist Press,
                        and more especially in the organ of the self-styled obief of the Nationalist
                        movement which made a point of exaggerating the damage done by the
                        bombardment of Casablanes, of criticising the attitude of the French
                        Government during the Algeciras conferer.ce and its Moroccan policy during
                        the last twelve month, and of quoting from every toreign journal which had
                        shown any hostility to France, stories which, as a correspondent of a London
                        paper recently remarked, were calculated to spread the belief that the
                        violation of women, the massacre of unoffending Jews and Moslems and the
                        pillage of the town were the work not of the tribes but of General Drude's
                        soldiers. Despite this hostility the French Press continued to publish the
                        effusions of the angrateful Kamel and certain Parisian organs, while
                        anxiously protesting that France had no intention of committing any action
                        that might be constructed by England as a breach of the Anglo Prench
                        Agreement of 1904, suggested that British statesmen might listen to the
                        pleadings of the "sportsman" of the Egyptian patriots. Now a rumour is going
                        round the Cairo cafés to the effect that the "Sllustrious Karamel" of M. G.
                        Vayssié, or the "sincere patriot" of Mme. Juliette Adam has obtained
                        financial support, not of course from the French Government, but from
                        individuals in France who conceive that their interests will thus be
                        furthered, though we fail to see how) by aiding the Pasha's journalistie
                        ventures. This assistance is said to have been given on the condition that
                        the Mustaphist organs should abandon their pro Moroccan Campaign. Such is
                        the story which in my opinion must be swallowed with more than one grain of
                        salt. But whatever the canse it is certainly A ouridus fact that the extreme
                        nationalists should have abandoned their co-religionists for whom they were
                        prepared to sbed their ink in torrents, without any explanation, and that

                        which are not yet finished, is built of the small, hard, red bricks wade at
                        Marseilles, relieved with cement stone dressings. The columns of the
                        areading are of blue and white marble from the Marmor Company's quarries in
                        Greece. The sanitary fittings are supplied by Doulton &amp; Co., the safe

                    <p>The late F. Du Pre Thornton's Elementary Arabic: a Grammar,' based upon
                        Wright's well-known grammar, and published in 1905, was so well received by
                        students that he at once set to work upon an Elementary Arabic First Reading
                        Book, and 30 nearly completed it before his death that its editor, Mr. R A.
                        Nicholson, had little more to do than to complete the glossary and revise
                        the proofs. It is now issued by the Cambridge University Press, printed for
                        the most part from Lane's Arabic type, which has the merits of cleatness and
                        compactness; and the little book appears to us well adapted to its purpose.
                        It is largely 8 reprint of Wright's 'Arabie Reading Book,' wbich has long
                        been out of print ; but Wright's text has been amended, partly by his own
                        corrections and partly by the critical revision of Prof. de Goeje and the
                        present editor. Some of the selections offer difficulties which seem rather
                        baffling to beginners, but there are not many which cannot be overcome by
                        the use of the careful glossary, which is a model of what A glossary should
                        be complete, coneixe, and accurate. The extracts from the Koran are perbaps
                        over short, and we should have liked to see some of the early impassioned
                        Mekks Surahs included, but the elaborate 'Gramma matical Analysis' occupying
                        77 pages, of the whole of the Koran extracts is an admirable feature, with
                        its full parsing and explanations and its precise references to the
                        Grammar.' The Preface repeats some useful advice to students previously
                        given in the "Grammar, but we cannot refrain from expressing our
                        satisfaction that Mr. Thornton did not extend bis activities to å treatise
                        on Boglish. The following is hardly a model of lucid style : "During one
                        among many instructive con versations, he told me in 1880 tbat Hebraists who
                        had incurred the like entanglement, invariably tried to set themselves free
                        on hearing the korin recited by Moslems (Mahometans); and through learning
                        to do likewise endeavour, more wily than in any other way, to prono once
                        distinctly and well the difficult consonants of Hebrew at well as of

                        13,800), while we remark Great Britain has sent along this commodity to the
                        extent of LE. 9. Turkey has ventored less, and the figure L.E. 1 covers

                        a slur on the Englishmen, who direct it. We may mention that the officials

                    <head>EGYPTS PROSPECTS</head>
                    <p>"La Revue des Deux Monde" says of the Egyptian financial trouble that it is
                        due largely to the speculative uses to which the money (too easily lent by
                        the banks) was put. At the beginning of this year (1907) any reflecting mind
                        could picture the approacning tempest. From January to June forty-four now
                        oompanies-nearly all English were fosted for working in Egypt. The total
                        most being subscribed in Egypt itself--of the capital was £9,250,000, not to
                        speak or the increases of some of the already existing companies during the
                        nume six months. The writer, however, does mot anticipate that the
                        depreciation in values will extend to wrhen lands throughout the country.
                        But he dreads the possible effect on the price of cotton, which material
                        make up 85 per cent of the exports and pags for the imports. Cotton governed
                        the situation, and the spinners inay see in the prem ituation a chance to
                        buy cheap. The prospects, both immediate and later of this commodity the
                        nothing less than brilliant, as far as produetion goes. The moral is that
                        Egypt must, like other countries have ita crises bet that its economie
                        situation is based on cotton, the present situation of which is excellent
                        and the future secures to production. An other view is that given by the
                        "Semaphore" of Marseilles, which foresees only prosperity for Bgypt, dne
                        principally to her power to buy becanse of her cotton crops. England takes
                        balf of her cotton and France takes thirty-six million francs' worth out of
                        the total of 411 millions, vaule of product. Germany share is thirty five
                        millions, and so on; and what has largely contributed to further develop
                        Egypt's production has been the marked disposition shown by the United
                        States to mone poliseootton and manipulate the markets. The other

                        <p>"There are signs that the "Times" is recovering its position as the great
                            pon-party jour nal of the nation," says the "British Weekly." "We do not
                            say by any means that it is moving towards the Government of Sir Henry
                            Campbell-Bannerman, but it has repentedly during the last week or two
                            done excellent service in exposing Conservative fallacies. </p>
                        <p>"It has, for one thing, reviewed the Australian tariff, and declared it
                            to be derisory. The general effect of the whole, it admits, is in a
                            direction which must be detrimental to our trade. Purther: 'We fear it
                            must be admitted, even by those who are most earnest in promoting the
                            commercial intercourse with the Commonwealth, that the course taken by
                            Anstralian statesmen is scarcely calculated to achieve that result.' </p>
                        <p>"With highly commendable boldness, it has pointed out in connection with
                            the Japanese quarrel in Canada that it is to the British Government and
                            the British excheqner that the Colonies must look for their protection.
                            It is high time that the true relation between the Mother Country and
                            the Colonies were frankly pointed out </p>
                        <p>"The "Times" has also spoken out on the action of the Archbishop and the
                            Bishops on the Decensed Wife's Sister Bill-therein echoing the general
                            feeling among laymen. It has also blown in the air the ridionlous talk
                            about the export of coal by pointing out how absoluttely necessary this
                            export is for British trade and commeree. </p>

                        <p>The popularity of King Elward VII. has brought about this miracle, that
                            it has rallied all the English without exception round the throne, and
                            has led Dernocrats, and Revolutionists to abandon the fetichism of the
                            Re publican doctrine and of manhood suffrage. Seeing that monarchical
                            Government prodaved good results, they have not dreamt of offering it

                        <p>We extract the following from the latest edition of "Orient and Occident" </p>
                        <p>Our readers will remember that in a previol number we published an
                            article under the bead of Healthy Homes." It was one of the last
                            articles which came from the pen of our be loved departed friend, Mr.
                            Thornton, who was greatly interested in the subject, and very much had
                            at heart the question of the housing shd tursing of children and
                            infants. We now Test that Dr. Abdul-Azit-Nazmi physician to the Public
                            Wakfs, has planned the formation of a society whose aim is the
                            protection of children from all the dangers which beset them physeally
                            and morally. The whole plan is explained in a booklet which Dr Nazmi has
                            recently pubHshed, and we hope that the pro ject will be greatly
                            appreciated by parents. The proportion of careless or ignorant inothers
                            is so high that, under the roof of thousands of houses, little infants
                            are to be seen neglected by their ignorant mothers and left to the
                            tender mereies of chance and environment Below is a precis of the plan
                            and ideals of the society </p>
                        <p>Article (1). The Cairo Society for the Protection of Children aims at the
                            following por poses : </p>
                        <p>(2) To protect infants from all the dangers that menace their health,
                            education, and future </p>
                        <p>(3) To advertise the hygienic law. by which the health of infants may be
                            protected and their mortality diminished and to acquaint parents with
                            the best means which would help them in bringing up their infants and
                            giving them a good moral and social training; </p>
                        <p>(4) To institute special cbaritable Homes for the poor children and to
                            provide for special schools for those of them who may be blind, deaf,
                            dumb, or sick, under the inspection of specialists and trustworthy
                            persons of wide knowledge and capacity; </p>
                        <p>(5) To defend infants in general against the neg act of their parents or
                            guardians, and the ill-treatment of all </p>
                        <p>(6) To institute societies, schools, and proper work shops for children
                            exposed to moral cor ruption, and to endeavour to ameliorate their
                            characters after leaving the Reformatory, by teaching them an honourable
                            draft which would help them to obtain an honest livelihood </p>
                        <p>(7) To protect orphan children, and those as good as orphaned, riz.,
                            those whose parents may be in prison, exile, etc; </p>
                        <p>(8) To protect little girls from the ricious men and women who trade with
                            women's honour and chastity. </p>
                        <p>Such is the outline of the aim of tlus society; and the means it desires
                            to adopt for the effecting of its purposes are </p>
                        <p>(1) By inquiring into the causes of intant diseases and mortality, and
                            nopting effective measures to abolish it:</p>
                        <p>(2) By endeavouring to instruct mothers in the principles of hygiene
                            which must be obsery ed in the nursing of their infants, and that by
                            publishing special books, pamphlets, articles, etc., and distributing
                            them to the public, free, or at a trifling price; </p>
                        <p>(3) By aiding poor mothers who are their own babies and have more than
                            two children, </p>
                        <p>(4) By granting material or moral subven tions to those who act according
                            to the principles of the society in bringing up their children and to
                            those who aid it in advertise ing its aims, whether by writing books ard
                            articles or by institutions, schools and societies for the same purpose </p>
                        <p>(5) By aiding all such schools, institutions, or asylums in Egypt, whose
                            purpose is to protect little children and teach mothers their duties
                            towards their infants </p>
                        <p>(6 and 7) By forming special committees for the inspection of children
                            who are exposed to sanitary, moral, or social dangers, especially those
                            in factories and work-shops.</p>
                        <p>We heartily hope that the project of Dr: Nazmi will be realized. The
                            subject is an im portant one, for the girls of the present are the
                            mothers of the future, and the boys of the day are the men of the
                            morrow; and we must bring them up after the principle of a sound mind in
                            a sound body </p>
                        <p>It has been remarked by an English writer that the object of wars in
                            general is to estab lish permanent pence. The war which must to day be
                            wage must be directed against those mothers who leave their children to
                            the mercy of circumstances. The war must go on unt permanent peace is
                            guaranteed. The pillars of our future civilization are our little
                            children, and in so far as we strengthen these pillars, in that measure
                            will civilization progress and increase in stability. When we consider
                            that the tide of babies, 80 to speak, is ever flowing, when we see the
                            distressing con dition of the infant death rate in this country when we
                            know that during the very moments of writing these lines scores of new
                            babies are entering the world to wage an enequal, horrible battle with
                            disease and death, to which many of them will miserably succumb: when
                            all this is clear, what proof do we need to convince ourselves of the
                            importance of this on use, and the critical position in which we stand
                            to-day! </p>
                        <p>The baby thrives in proportion as we look after it, and according to the
                            latent power of He with which it is endued. It is of the ut most
                            importance, therefore, that we should look after its food, clothes, and
                            its environment from the moment when it begins to live. Let is not
                            deceive ourselves by saying that the mother is the best judge of how her
                            baby is to be brought up. The great proportion of mothers totally ignore
                            the matter, and scarcely have an idea of the hygienic principles to
                            which they must conform in bringing up their children, </p>
                        <cb/>
                        <p>What better prof dors ed than the high rate of infant mortality to day ! </p>
                        <p>The subject is by no means an exhaustible one; it needs deep study and
                            delicate investigation, and Rep is in great needs of institutions on
                            which the future of its sons depende But it is to those of our Readers
                            who are parents that we address these few lines, for they are the best
                            intermediaires between us and the mothers of Egypt. May God hasten the
                            day when every woman shall be her own educator, and every mother shall
                            be able to be ber own doctor and counsellor. </p>
                        <p>We hope to return to this subject another day </p>

                            that should have been avoid ed. Statistiga that have recently been
                            pablished show that in England and Wales alone over 120,000 cbilden die
                            erety year onder twelve months of age. This is deplorable fact, and the

                            always possible to find a sapply of pure will, and the method of feeling
                            is often accompanied with a want of one that tells im mediately on the

                    <head>REVUE COMMERCIALE </head>
                    <p>Coton L'espace nous étant quelque peu mesuré au jourd'hui à cause de
                        l'abondance des matières, nous ne nous amuserons pas à ennayer nos lecteurs
                        par des considérations et des réflexions, comme il nous arrive de le faire
                        parfois : nous attaquerons donc d'emblée notre sujet. </p>
                    <p>Samedi, sans le moindre motit sérieux pour la justifier, la tenue de notre
                        marché a été ferme et la séance a fini ce jour-là en hausse de 1/8 de
                        tallari sur la veille. </p>
                    <p>Par contre, Lundi et Mardi, ont constitne deux journées marquées par une
                        faiblesse extrême qui nons ont fait recaler de 3/8 de tallari </p>
                    <p>Mercredi, à l'ouverture les choses s'annonçaient mal et les affaires avaient
                        commencé sur la base de 18 11/16, quand tout à coup las spéculation à la
                        baisse a changé d'avis et s'est mise à se racheter. Les pronostics de Price
                        pour un borene de 65 et le rapport de Miss Giles donnant le condition de la
                        plante comme étant de 65 1/2, venaient de l'impressionner et de l'induire à
                        se mettre à l'abri, sauf a revenir le lendemain a position primitive. La
                        circonstance, mise à profit par le parti haussier, noos avala le cours de 18
                        29/82, mais la baisse de Liverpool sur les américains vers les derniers
                        moments nous a fait revenir à 18 25/82. </p>
                    <p>Après la cloture, l'annonce que le Bureau était de 67 7/10 a fait prévaloir
                        l'opinion que la hausse était immanquable et cette opinion était tellement
                        générale que les plus ardents parmi les baissiers n'osaient pas prétendre
                        que le contraire pouvait être possible. Cependant tel a été le cas, car les
                        dépêches nous ont anponoé hier matin une chute de 92 points tant à New York
                        qu'New Orleans, mais il paralt que pour en arriver là il a fallu le
                        changement de position de Price qui de haurier est devenu baissier et qui
                        cherchait à justifier son action en se basant sur tontes sortes de calculs
                        de moontrant nne récolte de 13.500.000 et la possibilité de 15.000.000 de
                        balles avec des condi. tions climatériques propices. </p>
                    <p>L'effet de ces nouvelles a été de faire réac. tionner notre marché jusqu'à 18
                        5/8, mais ce matin la tendance a changé de nouvenu d'une façon complète, sur
                        les informations propagées que les dégits à la récolte étaient plus sérieux
                        qu'on ne le disait et que les Domaines de l'Etat même avaient accusé par la
                        bonche de leur président un déficit de 1500 dans leur première cueillette.
                        Inutile de dire que ces assertions, comme on le verra plus loin, étaient
                        controuvées, mais en attendant elles n'en on pas moins effrayé le découvert
                        en l'entrainant à se racheter, ce qui a eu pour conséquence de nous faire
                        monter à 19 7/32, con maximum de la journée. Sur les réalisations toutefois,
                        la cloture du soir a eu lieu à 19 1/32 </p>
                    <cb/>
                    <p>Nous avons dit ce que pensait Price dy mapport de Washington; no Ajonterons
                        qu'an jourd'hui il parle de prix des cents. Son opi nion vaut ce qu'elle
                        voudrs, mais ce qui est positif c'est que les 13.300.000 Balles semblent
                        etre le chiffre préféré de beaucoup de mai sons sérieuses, que la récolte ne
                        saurait etre meilleure en Floride, Georgie et les 2 Carolines, qu'elle est
                        très bonne partout ailleurs, sauf le centre et le sud du Texas, que les
                        cultivateurs sont plus ou moins anxieux de réaliser aux prix actuels et que
                        la file ture a l'air de persister pour le motuent dans son abstention,
                        prétérant vivre sur ses amples réserves, invisibles pour le public, mais que
                        l'on dit sans précédent comme importance réelle. La qualité semble tre aussi
                        bonne en Amérique. </p>

                    <p>Alexandrie, le 4 Octobre </p>
                    <p>Lundi notre marché, encouragé par l'excel lente allure des valeurs
                        égyptiennes à Londres, en particulier de la National Bank, débute ferme. Les
                        transactions ont lieu un peu sur toute la cote, mais elles n'ont de réelle
                        impor. tance qu'en National Bank, Delta Land et Comptoir. Ce regain
                        d'activité et de monye ment haussier persiste jusqu'à la fin de la séance ;
                        à ce moment une réaction se produit, qui ramène le calme et l'indécision
                        dans la corbeille, à l'exception toutefois de la National Bank qui maintient
                        sa remarquable avance de 2013/16 à 21 5/8. </p>
                    <p>Le lendemain la caractéristique de notre place est sensiblement la même. La
                        constante plus value des valeurs égyptiennes au Stock Exchange entraine
                        nessairement un mouvement local analogue, comme cela ressort da retour en
                        vogne des titres dirigeanta, tels que la National Bank, l'Agricole, la Daire
                        et la Del ta Light, tandis que les valeurs d'ordre inférieur, peu
                        d'exceptions pris, sont négligées. Il ne faudrait pas se figurer pourtant
                        que les transactions prennent une ampleur extraordinaire, ainsi que tendrait
                        à le faire croire l'animation plus ou moins bruyante qui se manifeste de
                        puis quelque temps dans la corbeille. Le volume des échanges, même en
                        National Bank, qui est la favorite du jour à cause de sa banse imprévue à
                        Londres, reste dans des litoites assez modestes. En un mot, l'allure de
                        notre marché montre bien qu'il n'a pas encore l'élar ticité suffisante pour
                        marcher te pair avec les cotes européennes </p>
                    <p>Mercredi la sitnation se résume en ben coup de tapage, peu d'affaires et
                        presqu'onanimité hauriere. Nous sommes toujours la remorque du Stock
                        Exchange pour nos valeurs dirigeantes, et cela se conçoit, la plus grande
                        partie des titras en question ayant pris cet été le chemin de londres. Même
                        sur les privilégiées du jour, National Bank et Nungovich Hotels, les
                        affaires sont très limitées. Ces derniers passent d'un coup de 14 3/4 à 16
                        1/2 pour finir 15 15/16, soit en plus-value de une livre un quart Plusieurs
                        critiquent vivement ce chauffage preinaturé, disant que si la saison des ton
                        ristes approche, en revanche les positions sont </p>
                    <cb/>
                    <p>excessivement surchargéer Une avance trop rapide ne pent que nous réserver
                        des réactions regrettables, comme nous l'a si bien appris la récente crise,
                        dont on mhle oublier un peu vite les durs enseignements. Il est vrai que
                        dans son ensemble la spaulation est en faveur de la hausse et serait prête à
                        se lancer sur les bonnes valeurs locales qui ne sont pas cotées sur les
                        places étrangeres, celles qui y sont cotées ayant déjà son avis atteint on
                        niveau soffisant, mais, comme nous avons déjà eu l'occasion de le dire, les
                        banques n' vancent pas sur titres; la plupart demandent même à leurs clients
                        des reinboursements ou des réductions de compte. De plus, l'intérêt a été
                        élevé à 8 et 9 % Autant de circonstances qui ne semblent pas devoir
                        favoriser une reprise </p>
                    <p>Londres a continué hier de servir de pompe aspirante nos valeurs dirigeantes
                        qui ne turellement en ont profité, tout en restant néanmoins au dessous des
                        prix cotés au Stock Exchange. Bien que le mouvement ait été moins précis que
                        la veille et se soit moins limité aux gros titres, ceux-ci n'en ont pas
                        moins continué à fournir le principal contingent des transactions, qui,
                        haton-nous de le dire, ont été clairsemées et moins importantes encore que
                        les jours passés. C'est vers la fin de la séance qu'on a surtout remarque de
                        la foi blesse, le début ayant été assez ferme et platot baussier. Avec un
                        horizon aussi restreint, on conçoit facilement qu'à part les actions cotées
                        en Europe, les autres n'aient donné lieu qu'à de très rares Anotuations
                        indiqnant en général pour les petites valeurs une légère moins value. </p>
                    <p>A part la Delta Light, nos valeurs dirigeantes ont été aujourd'hui négligées
                        et de ce fait ont subi une depreciation. Il suffi pour cela d'un léger
                        refroidissement de Stock Exchange. Quant l'infériorité des cours locaux en
                        com paraison avec ceux de Londres, elle provient de la perte subie sur le
                        change avec cette place. L'activité, qui a d'ailleurs été insigni fiante,
                        s'est limitée aux Levico, Lunghis et fondateurs Comptoir. On attribue la
                        reprise de Is Levico à ce que les acheteurs trouvent le prix actuel
                        avantageux relativement au bon fonctionnement de cette société. Des échanges
                        RANGE nombreux ont eu lien entre 16/82 et 17/89 et pour la Langhis 11/B2. On
                        s'attendait pins ou moins à la réaction d'aujourd'hui a la suite de la
                        hausse inente de ces jours derniers, d'autant plon qu'il faudrait à la spé
                        culation l'appui des banques pour maintenir l'avance acquise. A remarquer un
                        nouveau fléchissement des Nungovich qu'on avait trop poumis avant-hier. A ce
                        propos nous devons signaler un engouement général au Caire en favent des
                        titres de Vries et Boutigny. On voit par ce qui précédo que notre marché a
                        été presque nul et en bois No a peu près générale sur les titres abandés On
                        croit cependant que les valeurs dirigeanter et en particulier la National

                    <p>bientit leur mouvement ascensionnel. C'est un simple espoir que nous
                        enregistrons sans donner d'appréciation personnelle. Pour le moment, les
                        transactions font détant et l'ensemble est franchement vendeur. </p>
                    <p>Si maintenant l'on étudie le résultat de la hoitaine, on constate que sur une

                    <p>Les conditions atmosphériques en Septembre ont été moins favorables aux
                        cotonniers : dans la première quinzaine du mois, divers brouillards ont été
                        signalés et ont causé quel ques dégâts dans la plupart des provinces de la
                        Barse-Rrypte. Jusqu'ici le mal ne parait pas important, mais en somme la
                        récolte ne so présente plus so an aspect aussi brillant que le mois dernier </p>
                    <p>Par la suite ARI, la fraicheur de la tem. pérature a entravé on retardé
                        l'éclosion des noix ; toutefois, sur ce point, aussi bien que pour ce qui
                        concerne la troisième cueillette, nos correspondants sont unanimes dire que
                        la chaleur en Octobre pourrait remédier benu coup à cet état des choses </p>
                    <p>la première cueillette est désormais géné male ; mais dans certaines
                        provinces elle n'est pas encore assez avancée pour permettre une
                        appréciation complète de ses résultats, on les considere cependant comme
                        quantité supé rieurs à ceux de l'année dernière </p>
                    <p>On signale dans quelques localités de la Garbieh la présence des vers dans
                        les noix de la troisième cueillette. Le rendement à l'égrenage est de 1.2%
                        supérieur à celui de l'année passée à la même époque. Tout considéré et dans
                        l'ensemble, les pro babilités indiquent une récolte dépassant celle de
