                    <p>FRANCE AND NORTHERN AFRICA.</p>
                    <p>The spectacle offered by the economic and social crisis in South Africa,
                        where Chinese labour alone would seem to be capable of the "Times" Paris
                        correspondent writes, inspired that eminent author M. Paul Adam with a
                        brilliantly suggestive forecast of the future. Laying down the postulate
                        that the yellow man is the only one who is tropical climates can
                        satisfactorily de the necessary work, he asks whether it behaves Western
                        civilized Europe to surrender to him for explotation the Niger, Congo, and
                        Zambesi valleys, and his answer is, Yes. Thereupon, following in the wake of
                        M. Onèsime Reclus, whom he does not mentinon, he reminds his compatriots
                        that their navy is inadequate to protect the sea routes between the mother
                        country and French possessions in the Pacific and the Indian Ocean.</p>
                    <p>Indo-China will eventually, thinks this observer, be wrested from France. New
                        Caledonia and the New Hebrides will follow suit. Soon the French will be
                        able to ensure merely the passage between Marseilles and Tunis-Algeria-
                        Tangier, with the result that "the only exotic Empire of which France can
                        possibly assume the protection is that of Africa. Situated at our very
                        doors, it will become the outlet of our industrial overproduction that is to
                        say, the main source of French wages – when the free Chinaman or any other
                        workman shall have fertilized the soil, excavated the mines, planted the
                        cotton, and regulated the caoutchouc crop. Africa is our sons' kneading
                        through, and the only one that we can protect against the appetites of the
                        rival nations. Thus those politicians who declare that Morocco is not worth
                        a war reveal their ignorance. Our economic future depends upon our supremacy
                        over this Empire. If we let the Germans settle there, close against us the
                        land route to Timbuktu, harbor their cruisers in the bays of this Mussulman
                        coast we lose in advance the enterance of the Dark Continent. We surrender
                        the keys of Algeria and Tunis to our inventerate enimies, who, when all is
                        said, frankly hate us, as they have just proved by arousing this unjust
                        quarrel after our 30 years of loyal resignation.</p>
                    <p>"Far from yeilding on this point of the globe, it would be better worth while
                        to offer to the diplomatists of Algeciras to exchange all the rest of our
                        colonies scattered over the world against those of West Africa where France
                        would then see her sovereignty guarenteed by the Powers from Tangier to the
                        northern frontiers of the Cape settlements, from Dakar to the western
                        boundaries of the Nile Valley and the region of the great lakes, Thus the
                        Latins, who dislike establishments too far away, would possess at 48 hours
                        distance from Marseilles and Genoa and at two hours from Cadiz the Empire
                        indispensable for their home industry and the life of their working
                        classes."</p>
                    <p>M. Paul Adam would like to see this policy of reciprocal exchanged for the
                        creation of Imperial and Latin Africa – implying the close alliance of the
                        Italians, Spaniards, and French – immediately put into effect.</p>

                            Customs Administration for the past year. Formerly motorcars were
                            inolnded in the category of imports classified as "Machines à vapenr
                            fixes et demi fixes,” but in the report just issued they have a category
                            all to themselves. The total value of these imports last year amounted
                            to L.E. 27,886. Of this amount France's imports were L.E. 19,269 and
                            England’s L.E. 5,168. The other countries were very poorly represented,
                            the third àn the list being Belgium with L.E. 911, followed by America
                            with L.E. 877.</p>

                            crisis. It adds a hope that it may prove a warning to the Government in
                            its future dealings with the Transvaal and the Empire generally. The
                            Government’s notion has created a strong feeling throughout the

                            from Harrar, of which Ras Makonnen was the chief. The Emperor Menelik is
                            credited with the wish to appoint a personage belonging to his staff.
                            Several European countries are endeavouring to seoure privileges in '
                            Abyssinia, giving credibility to the report that certain Powers of

                    <p>We mentioned in a recent issue that the Coonoil of Ministers, at its last
                        meeting, had decided to forbid Government employés to undertake salaried
                        work elsewhere without a written authorisation from the Department to which
                        the functionary belongs, and that any infractions of this regulation would
                        be treated as breaches of official discipline. We understand that these
                        regulations have always been in force and that the decision of the Council
                        of Ministers to again pall attention to them has been in consequence of
                        representations made lately to the Government by brokers and others who
                        complained of certain employés of two different Ministries exercising the
                        calling of land brokers to their prejudice.</p>
                    <p>We ourselves some months back also called the attention of the authorities to
                        this anomaly and pointed ont that it was manifestly inconsistent and unfair
                        that salaried servants of the State should be allowed to compete in
                        oommercial matters with the general public and hoped that measures would
                        bave been taken to put a stop to such irregularities. The Government
                        apparently took no steps in the matter at the time judging by the fact that
                        now the Council of Ministers has thought fit to come to the decision of
                        formally prohibiting officials from undertaking other than the work the
                        State pays them for.</p>
                    <p>We quite agree with a Cairo confrèrethat one of the most effectual means of
                        putting a check to the complaints referred to would be to impose upon all
                        Government employés longer working hours, and make them attend office in the
                        afternoon instead of only in the morning as at present, and more so since it
                        bas been decided to raise their salaries to an appreciable extent.</p>

                        <p>ARRIVIAL IN CAIRO.</p>
                        <p>RECEPTION SPOILED BY WEATHER.</p>
                        <p>Heavy rain in the morning had cooled the air in Cairo yesterday alter
                            Wednesday’s oppressive khamaeen, and had also filled the streets with
                            quantities of the particularly tenacious Cairo mad diversified with
                            pools. The weather was clammy, the public, European and native, looked
                            unspeakably miserable in the morning hot cheered up when the olonds
                            lifted a little after midday and promised a slight improvement—a promise
                            which, by the way, was hardly kept. However, the Public Works Ministry
                            rose to the occasion in spite of the depressing infinences of the day,
                            and from noon onwards the streets, along the rente which the Prince and
                            Princess of Wales were to follow, were assiduously swept, cleaned,
                            scraped, and sanded. Qaite early in the afternoon the police began to
                            circulate and the crowd to colleot. The troops followed and began to
                            line the rente, and flags of every nationality (and some imaginary ones)
                            were hang from hotel and house fronts, balconies, and roofs all along
                            the route from the station to Abdeen.</p>
                        <p>By 4.45 p.m. the troops were in their places and shortly before 5 p.m.
                            the stream of carriages bearing those who were to meet the Prince and
                            Princess at the station ceassd to flow. The railway station square, Pont
                            Limoun, Sharia 'Nobar Pacha, Sharia Kamel, Opera- square, rue Abdio, and
                            Abdio-square were lined with British and Egyptian troops and police. All
                            traffic was suspended, balconies and terraces filled up rapidly, and all
                            wts in readiuess. The police arrangements were perfect, the public
                            seconded them admirably, and it was a very quiet and well-behaved—if
                            rather apathetic—crowd that thronged the pavements and side streets.</p>
                        <p>At 12.30 p.m. the Royal train left Suez preceded by a pilot engine.
                            Major1 L’Estrange Johnston was in charge, "supported by Capt.
                            Blakeney,Messrs. Trovithiok, Brin, Versohoyle Duke, Ponter and Tita The
                            baggage was in charge of Mr. Peter Balsam, platform inspector, and four
                            men. Major Watson, D.S.O., representing the Khedive, and Mr. M. de C.
                            Findlay, C.V.G, representing Lord Cromer, accompanied the Royal party
                            from nez. The journey was without incident, but a "inoident” inevitably
                            epella "accident" on these occasions there was nothing to deplore in
                            this and it was only to be regretted that the Royal party saw Egypt
                            under the most unfavourable conditions,— threatening rain and lowering
                            sky.</p>
                        <p>Cairo station was full by 5 p.m. The Khedive and Prince Mohamed Aly were
                            there and with them Ferik Ahmed Zeki Pacha, Grand Master of Ceremonies ;
                            Ferik Youssel Zia Paoba, Chief A.D.C. to H.H. the Khedive ; Lewa Hussein
                            Moharrrm Paoba, 1st A.D.C, to H.H. the Khedive ; the Ministers, the Earl

                            departments of the Egyptian Army, etc.</p>
                        <p>At 5.25 a m. the train steamed in and the guns of the 5th Battery E.A.
                            fired their sainte, while the guard of honour famished by the 1st Batt
                            K.R.R C. nnder Major Ribertson- Eustace paid the unusual honours. The
                            Prince and Princess were warmly welcomed by the Khedive and Prince
                            Mohamed Aly and by Lord and Lady Cromer as the train stopped. A few
                            minâtes for conservation, presentations and welcomes and the Royal party
                            and their snite were ready to enter the State carriages.</p>
                        <p>AS SEEN FROM SHEPHEARD’S.</p>
                        <p>Rain came down at 5.10 p m. and again at 5.20. and greatcoats and
                            umbrellas were in great evidence on Shepheard’s terrace. The public
                            here, as elsewhere, bad forgotten or, had not read the programme and the
                            voice of the pessimist exclaiming, "They were timed to arrive at five
                            o’olock and something dreadful must have happened" was heard in the
                            land, ill the thudding of the guns brought all who estrin the front row
                            on the terrace to their feet—to the horror and despair of those who sat
                            or stood behind them and were not of Brobdignagian proportions—and
                            filled all the baloonies and windows in the Sharia Kamel.
                            Illuminations—looking curiously pallid in the doll half-light—made their
                            appearance and flags that presented a woe-begone and draggled appearance
                            were shaken out, and presently the order to slope arms and a general
                            stiffening on the part of soldiers and police, followed By the
                            appearance of a Mounted Police detachment and Mr. Moberly—harbingers of
                            the procession—told us that the Khedive and his Royal guests were
                            coming. Then came ths procession headed by smart-looking troopers of the
                            Body Guard. The precession was formed as follows :—</p>

                        <p>Detachment Mounted Police.</p>
                        <p>Candour, alas ! compels me to declare that the public was rather
                            apathetic. True, the Oriental does not cheer, but the European does as a
                            role, especially the Englishman, and there was a certain thinness about
                            the popular welcome—though I must admit that the Princess was loudly
                            cheered, if not so loudly is some of us would have wished. But the day
                            was responsible,—it was cold and murky, all were wet, some were cold,
                            and a warm, bright day would hare been marked by greater euthusiasm. </p>
                        <p>(From our Last Correspondent.)</p>
                        <p>Never did Cairo weather play such a shabby trick as it did yesterday.
                            Never in the depths of winter have we had such a day of rain, nor have
                            the streets been in worse condition. Certainly the drop in the
                            temperature was a relief after the sultriness of the past few days, but
                            leaden skies at this time of ths year are almost unknown in this land of
                            sunshine, and but for the variegated orowds that filled the streets one
                            might easily have imagined oneself back in London. No better coin of
                            vantage for watching the afternoon’s proceedings could have been chosen
                            than the Continental Hotel, and at a very early hear people congregated
                            on the wide verandah or took their seats on the numerous balconies on
                            high which were gay with multi-coloured flags. There was much to pass
                            the tedium of the hours of waiting, far troupes of soldiers, both
                            British and Egyptian, were constantly passing and repassing, and the
                            native popolace were early also in taking their places on the pavements
                            and aboat the railings of the Eibekieh Gardens. Their various-hued
                            garments, turbans, and tarbooshes (the latter, by the way, mostly
                            covered from the rain with handkerchiefs) all helped to supply weloome
                            notes of colour, and the scarlet coats and white helmets of the
                            Inniskillinge who lined the road, were very welcome for the some
                            reason.</p>
                        <p>As time went on numerous sand-lodeu carts appeared upon the scene, their
                            contents being rapidly emptied on the sea of mad which had flown in all
                            directions beforetimes. However, well before five o'clock all was nice
                            and tidy, the tain which had endeavoured to damp people's feelings and
                            their clothes thought better of its ill-timed efforts, and everyone woe
                            at attention when H.H. the Khedive passed by in ample time to greet his
                            Royal visiters on their arrival at the station. After a short time of
                            waiting the boom of the sainte announced the foot that the journey to
                            Cairo had been safely accomplished, and again, other another short rims
                            of waiting, the sounds of a band ploying "Marching from Georgia” and
                            "Tie Swanee River” were heard approaching. A detachment of Mounted
                            Police dashed by followed by the Body Guard with their flattering laaoe
                            penous, and then is an open carriage drawn by four horses with coachman
                            and footman brave in scarlet and gold, appeared H.H. the Khedive with
                            his most illustrious guest, the Prince of Wales, in the seat of
                            honour.</p>
                        <p>There is no accounting far the ways of a cosmopolitan crowd like this in
                            Cairo, but the almost complete silence which reigned throughout the
                            precession struck one as singularly depressing after the usual feu de
                            joieof hnuths which characterize an English crowd under similar
                            conditions. Another Body Guard, and then a murmur of approbation did ron
                            down the lines, is our own gracious and beautiful Qaéeu eleot swept by
                            ia ths oompany of Prince Mohamed Aly Pacha. There was no time to notice
                            her toilette, though one gathered an impression of much luce about her
                            corsage, and a most becoming round toque of tulle or chiffon. But
                            sentiments of admiration were heard on every side, and indeed she looked

                        <p>One hears curious side-lights at times like this, and it is said that the

                    <head>EGYPT'S TRADE</head>
                    <p>The annual Customs returns for the trade of the past year have just made
                        their appearance. The statistics for 1905 are prefaced by some very useful
                        tabular statements of Egypt’- tradefor the past 22 years from 1884 to 1905
                        inclusive. The most valuable portion of these figures are those showing the
                        proportion of English trade with Egypt as compared with other countries, and
                        the plain unvarnished tale thus presented is that our share of the imports
                        and exports are steadily decreasing, for example, the maximum share of
                        imports from England was attained in 1887, when oat ot 1.000 for the total
                        England contributed 398. Last year England's share fell to 321, which is the
                        lowest proportion we have ever attained despite the foot that car political
                        influence was never so high. Germany, meanwhile, has more than octupuled her
                        share of ths imports, In 1887 her proportion to the total was 3: 1000. In
                        1897 she had increaaed her share nine rimes over, while in 1904 proportion
                        was 50 and last year 44.</p>
                    <p>The same tale is told in the figures far the export trade. Eagland is
                        constantly absorbing less and less and Germany more and more of Egypt’s
                        exports. For example, ia 1884 car share was 677:1000, while Germany did net
                        figure at all, not even shaving a one-thousandth tips,exports. But while we
                        had and fallen year by year to 585 1899, Germany had increased to 27. But
                        last year our share had fallen to 522 while Germany’s, was 85. There is no
                        juggling with figures here. The tabular statements are as simple as they can
                        be, each country’s, share representing what it bears proportional to the
                        total of a thousand, and the fact therefore remains that while our political
                        influencs increases our proportion of the trade decreases.</p>

                        contains many new features and improvements on last years’ edition. On
                        looking through the beginning, one finds a page, itself an innovation,
                        giving the principal alterations and changed which have taken place in the
                        service during the last year, followed by another on which the contents have
                        been grouped so that what is required can be found at once. Another most
                        useful addition is the table of the principal mails to and from Egypt, again
                        followed by another giving the approximate time taken for a letter- sent to
                        any of the principal towns of the world. The foreign Parcel Post tariff has
                        been thoroughly revised and all the necessary information regarding postage,
                        prohibited articles, etc., has all been brought on the same , table, instead
                        of the tariff being in one and prohibited articles, etc., in another part,
                        as formerly. Appendix XII., which gives the list of poet-offices, has been
                        modified and made clearer, and a great number of new offices and rural lines
                        established this year have been added. There is no doubt that it it a most
                        useful book of refereace and the public will greatly appreciate the above
                        innovations, which are most handy. It can now be obtained at any of the
                        principal post-offices throughout the country on payment of the small sum of

                        <p>HOPES OF EARLY SOLUTION.</p>
                        <p>We understand that the Turkish garrison at Akaba has recently been
                            reduced. This gives cause for hope that a satisfactory solution of the
                            frontier difficulty will be qaickly arrived at</p>
                        <p>The 'Daily Telegraph,"discussing the Akaba dispute, remarks :—</p>
                        <p>There it no reason for immediate alarm. On the other bend, there is a
                            possibility of complications of a character which is better understood
                            abroad than in England: Of course, hostility to England on the part of
                            Turkey is an isolated Power will not disturb anybody's rest. But Turksy
                            as a cats- paw may scratch unpleasantly. It is largely question of
                            railways and of the control of the high road to India. The plan of a
                            railway from Beyront through Damascus end the Hedjaz to Mecca recommends
                            itself to the Sultan as a means of enabling him to strengthen his rather
                            precarious position in Arabia, and of securing some kind of control over
                            the Red Sea. His zeal in this direction has been quickened by the
                            opening of Port Sudan and the railway connection with Khartoum by way of
                            Berber. By connecting Akaba with Mian, on the Dsmasoas-Mecca line, the
                            Sultan coaid concentrate troops on tbe:BedSeaoout Ths British Government
                            has naturally to watch these schemes with some keenness, not only in so
                            far as their development inight constitute a menace to Egypt, but; as
                            affecting the security of the Red Sea route to Ldio. For, at the same
                            time, the extension of the Bagdad Railway might, in certain
                            contingencies, menace our supremacy in the Persian Gulf. We are not much
                            alarmed by these possibilities, and least of alt by the rumoured project
                            to connect the Méditerranéen end the Red Sea by a new canal from Akaba.
                            But though there is no real ground for anxiety with regard to an
                            incident which is at present of microscopic proportions, and may not
                            develop into a crisis, there is need for watchfulness. The Saltan is a
                            very wily diplomatist, and nothing suits his game—which, to do him
                            jastice, he plays with rare skills better than to set the Powers at
                            loggerheads. Fortunately, the control of car foreign affairs is fat safe
                            hands, and Sir Edward Grey may be trusted to see that' British interests
                            on the various high roads to India are not jeopardised. It is; however,
                            well that the public should be reminded here Akaba, in the Red Sea, and
                            Koweit in the Persian Gulf, are strategic points as important as many
                            other places far more familiar to their ears.</p>

                        the Praes of Germany and Austria, and it laments Italy's inaptitude to

                        <p>The Ministry has confirmed the death sentences on the natives who
                            murdered the policemen. The executions were fixed for Friday, but Mr.
                            Winston Charchill telegraphed to suspend them pending consideration by
                            the Imperial Government. The Hon. C. J. Smythe Prime Minister, refused,
                            but the Governor, under a letter-patent, postponed the execution. The
                            Ministry has resigned.</p>
                        <p>The most intense indignation prevails here owing to the interfarensa of

                    <head>THE VITALITY OF ISLAM.</head>
                    <p>The Sudan United Mission asks “all Christians in Great Britain and Ireland”
                        to aid in checking the spread of Mohamedanism in the Protectorate of
                        Northern Nigeria. The negroes there number at least ten millions. Until late
                        years the territory was closed, and now, when it has become safe, under
                        British rule, Moslem traders and missionaries, full if energy and real for
                        the frith, are pressing in so fast that it seems likely they may convert the
                        whole population in no long time. Its devotees number a fifth part of the
                        human race, and they multiply fast. The proportion of Moslems in China was
                        imperceptible fifty years ago ; now they are seen in all parts. </p>
                    <p>A little incident during the war is not forgotten by those who concern
                        themselves with this matter. As the fleet of Admiral Rodjesvensky steamed
                        through the Straits of Malacca to its doom, the native passengers aboard a
                        British ship crowded to the side and spat at it. They would be Chinamen,
                        Malays, Javanese, Bugie, and so forth, Mohamedans, indeed, bnt men who would
                        not have dreamed of making each a demonstration a few years ago. The Moslems
                        not only increase in number but in seal. The charge is specially striking in
                        Malay lands. Sir Spencer St John noted the beginning of it in Sarawak. He
                        thought it was the activity of Christian missionaries which roused Moslem
                        fervour. “Before the arrival of the clergy,” he wrote in the fifties, "the
                        mosque was almost deserted ; now it is crowded. The same effect followed the
                        arrival of the Catholic priests at Brumei." Good men are not to be
                        discouraged on that account, nor even by their failure to convert any
                        followers of Islam. Sir Frank Swettenham asserts that “Missionaries of every
                        denomination have apparently abandoned hope of oonTerting the Malays.”
                        Palgrave spoke for Turkey and Syria: “All the temporal advantages offered by
                        European protection, not to mention direct persuasion and indirect sub
                        tidies, can scarcely—or, indeed more truly, not at all—procure a single
                        convert to any firm of Christianity, Greek, Armenian, Protestant, or
                        Catholic ; whilst on the other hand, the reverse process enrols yearly a
                        very sensible number from one or other or all other sects.” But though
                        Mohamedans so resolutely decline to change their faith, there are countless
                        multitudes of unsophisticated heathens in Africa and the Far Bast who
                        welcome the evangeliser, more or less.</p>
                    <p>Mohamedanism has a fascination for certain minds in Asia. Père Dan reported
                        in the first quarter of the seventeenth century that the Emperor of Morocco
                        had nearly 8,000 Christian renegades in his service,whilst a single Tarkish
                        renegade could scarcely be found in Christendom. As a rule, no doubt, the
                        motives of European men or women who abjure the Cross will not bear
                        examination ; but Moslems do not' abjare at all. In India the namber of
                        perverts is snoh that when the heads of the faith were solemnly debating
                        whether the land might, still be classed as Dard-Islam, Syed Ahmed Khan,
                        member of the Connoil, pointed out that “We make converts of Christians
                        here, and no one forbids or hinders us”—which settled the question. Even in
                        England there is at least one congregation, claiming four hundred ‘
                        communicants” ones Christian. Men and women English born are married at the
                        Mosque by a Mollah, who in private life is a solicitor from the Isle of Man.
                        We are told that London also will have a Mosque before the year is ont, one
                        worthy of the Prophet and the Khalif, who is finding the money.</p>

                        <p>The scheme for the coming co-operation of the merchant fleets in the
                            naval manœuvre: of Jaoe next is, as already announced in these notes,to
                            be covered by the enormous insurance of £10,000,000. Riakia not the only
                            thing that had to be considered by the Admiralty, for demurrage rates
                            run very high. However, the Admiralty has agreed on a general rate of 3s
                            9d. percent., which works out at the respectable premium of £18,760 Half
                            of this is to be laid at Lloyd’s and the other moiety will be
                            distributed amongst the larger Lon ion companies. The claims will be
                            decided by a small committee consisting of the Chairman of Lloyd's, the
                            Chairman of the Shipping Federation, and the Chairman of the Average
                            Adjusters' Society. During ten days of the mimic war, outward bound
                            ships will group at Falmouth or Milford Haven and then proceed to their
                            destinations under the protection of the squadrons which will be
                            detailed to escort them. Homeward bound ships will group at Gibraltar
                            for a similar purpose. Fast mail ships and passenger ships carrying
                            perishable goods will be exempt from the scheme and also from capture by
                            the "enemy."</p>

                    <head>FOREIGN INTERESTS IN TURKEY.</head>
                    <p>GERMAN PROGRESS.</p>
                    <p>In the latest report to the Foregin Office on the trade of Constinople and
                        district for last year, Mr. Consul Waugh, after giving an account of the
                        commercial condition of the country and of the principle articles of trade,
                        and French eyes, by no means the "quantité negligeable" which it seems to
                        have become in those of British investor. As we diminish our holdings in
                        Turkey they are eagerly snapped up by others; and it seems a serious
                        question whether we are not making a mistake in letting go all hold in the
                        country. Only last month the control of the small Mersina-Adana railway,
                        which has figured for years as a British line, was acquired by the Anatolian
                        Railway Co., which bought the majority of shares. The Germans are by year,
                        investing more money in this country. Mention has been made above of German
                        shipping enterprises in these waters. On January 31 appeared a notice of the
                        registration at the German Consulate General here of a Constantinople branch
                        of the Orient Bank of Berlin; capital, 800,000; object banking buisness of
                        all kinds, especially the furthering of trade relations between Germany and
                        the Orient. The German Haidar-Pacha Quay Company, which owns the
                        Constantiople terminus of the Anatolian railway, is about to extend its
                        quays and to build a new silo and elevator 7,500 tons of grain, for a
                        British export house, and two others warehouses, each to hold 20,000 tons of
                        grian. A German cable telegraph service was started last summer from
                        Constantinople to Constatanza, the Romanian port on the Black Sea. There is
                        apparently no difficulty in finding German money for enterprise in Turkey.
                        The only railway in Turkey left to-day in British hands is the
                        Smyrna-Aidin.</p>

                    <head>ALDERSHOT RAGGING CASE.</head>
                    <p>A young officer of a Guards Regiment, says the “Daily Mail,” is at present in
                        London under a doctor’s care suffering from complete nervous breakdown.</p>
                    <p>It appears that this officer, who is not very well off, had declared himself
                        unable to meet the usual subscriptions for regimental purposes. Instead,
                        therefore, of spending his leisure hours with his brother officers he kept
                        much to hit own room. This line of conduct was resented by several officers
                        in the regiment,and they expressed their objection, it is said, by foroibly
                        stripping the yonog fellow, smearing him with motor oil, feathering him, and
                        then plastering his hair with jam.</p>
                    <p>Eventually, however, the viotim escaped to his room, but he he followed, and
                        when his pursuers were smashing down his door he jumped from his window and
                        sucoeeded in reaching a hotel in the town.</p>
                    <p>The officers concerned in the ragging tried, but tailed to discover his where
                        boats. Next morning the subaltern went to London and saw a dootor. While at
                        Aldershot he was reported “absent without leave.” His doctor, however, sent
                        an explanatory telegram to the colonel reporting that the officer missing
                        was seriously ill. The matter has been reported to Mr. Haldane, who has
                        ordered an inquiry.</p>

                    <head>THE KHEDIVES TOUR.</head>
                    <p>INTERESTING JOURNEY.</p>
                    <p>The following details as to the Khedive's recent trip to the Libyan desert
                        have been sent by Reuer’s Agency to the London Prise : —</p>
                    <p>The Khedive left Alexandria for the oasis of Siwa on Feb. 11. He was
                        accompanied by the Vicomte d’Exerpery, Dr. Ritter, Mr. Fats (archecologist),
                        Dr. Kautsky (principal doctor to his Highness) one Egyptian secretary, and
                        one engineer. The Khedive’s escort consisted of 8 Egyptian officors, 88
                        soldiers, 1 coachman, 7 grooms, 8 cooks, 4 servants, 2 tent pitchers,</p>
                    <p>1 farrier, 5 camelmen, 10 camel-drivers, 4 guides, and 65 Bedouin camel
                        drivers. There were 44 horses, 32 dromedaries, and 25 carrels tor his
                        Highness’s personal service, and 246 camels supplied by Bedouins for
                        transport service.</p>
                    <p>On Feb. 11 the Khedive and suite went by his Highness’s private Mariont
                        railway from Alexandria to the terminus of the railway, 135 kilomètres
                        distant. From the terminus they proceeded in motorcars to Side-Abderrahim,
                        70 kilomètres from the Mariont Railway terminus, and from Side-Abderrahim in
                        a brake, with three horses, driven by the Khedive, to Ras-el-Karrais, 10
                        kilomètres, where they camped to the night. On the 12th the Khedive drove
                        the brake to Bir-el-Garowla, 40 kilomètres, where they camped for the night. </p>
                    <p>At Bir-el-Garowla the Khedive was met by a crowd of Bedonins with their
                        sheikhs, who enthusiastically acclaimed the Khedive. The next morning, the
                        13th, the Khedive droye the brake to Mersa el-Matrouh, twenty kilomètres,
                        accompanied by a crowd of Bedonins and Sikh who make a great fantasia in his
                        honour.</p>
                    <p>On the 14th the Khedive left Mersa-el- Matrouh for Siwa. The journey, abont
                        328 kilomètres, was accomplished in seven days. For four days there were
                        wells, but for the last three days there were no wells, water being
                        transported on camel back. On the evening of the 20th the Siwa oasis was
                        reached, and the camp was pitched at the foot of a mountain about five
                        kilometres from Siwa, where many sheikhs and notables welcomed the Khedive.
                        On the morning of the 21st the Khedive and suite entered the town of Siwa,
                        and held a reception in the square in front of the Mamourieh (Government
                        offices). The Khedive remained -five days in the camp near Siwa, and made a
                        careful inspection of the oasis from an agricultural point of view, in order
                        to consider what improvements can be made for the be ferment of cultivation.
                        The Khedive received the merchants and farmers of Siwa, and consulted with
                        them on the commercial and agricultural welfare of the oasis. The Khedive
                        also visited the scanty remains of the temple of Jupiter Ammon.</p>
                    <p>On the 26th the Khedive and suite, with his escort, left Siwa for
                        Mersa-el-Matrouh, which was reached in six days. On March 4 his Highness
                        left Merra el-Matrouh for Alexandria, where all arrived safe and sound on
                        March 6.</p>

                        Park obelisk from Alexandria, where it had lain since the time of the
                        Ptolemies who had removed it from Heliopolis. An American contemporary
                        remarks : “What a shame that we New Yoikers allowed the twenty-fifth
                        anniversary of the arrival of our Heliopolis obelisk to pass without a
                        kindly word of giatitode to old Thothmes III., to William H. Vanderbilt or
                        to Commander Gorringe, U S.N. The first man mentioned set op the granite
                        shaft ; the second obtained it from the Khedive, Ismail Pacha ; the third
                        brought it hither and placed it on the greensward in Central Park. The
                        obelisk was put on board the Dessong, a Hartlepool built tramp at
                        Alexandria. On arriving in America the monolith was taken from the steamship
                        at Staten Island, put aboard a barge and towed to the upper part of the city
                        and rolled laboriously across town to its site. It was set on its base on
                        January 22, 1881, and one month later the city received it. William H.
                        Vanderbilt, who paid all the expenses of its transportation,more than $100
                        000, was unable to attend the ceremonies because of illness.</p>

                    <p>A postcard at present exhibited in the shop windows says : “If whisky
                        interferes with your business, give up your business.” According to Dr.
                        Pinchvs. who lectured at University College lately on the Assyria-Babylon
                        antiquities in the British Museum, the ancients were less depraved than the
                        moderns to whom this advice is tiered. They were winbibber , and wanted to
                        be but even in those day- to get drunk was inconvenient, ard so certain
                        specifics were recommended with a view to enable men to drink liberally
                        without becoming incapable. According to Dr. Pinch the following is a
                        translation of an inscription on one of the monuments in the British Museum
                        : ’ The eggs of an owl, given fur three days in wine, bring on a drunkard’s

                    <p>M. LE BARGY.</p>
                    <p>M. Le Bargy and his colleagues gave their seventh and last peiformance on
                        Tuesday night. Le Reveil of Hervieu was the piece, and the acting was as
                        good as any yet seen. The play made soo e sensation in Paris. Prince
                        Grégoire and his son Jean are in France, awaiting the turn of the tide in
                        their native Sylvania which may put Jean on the throne. Jean falls in love
                        with Thérèse de Mégée, the danghter-in law of histjatfrer’s old friend, Mme
                        de Mégée. The motif-then is the strugg’e between love, that is Thérèse, and
                        patriotism and honour, as held out by, Prince Grégoire. The son chooses
                        love. The father is forions and contrives to have their rendezvous
                        surprised, Jean enticed out, and Thérèse told that her lover has been killed
                        ; she, mad with grief, is driven out of the house, picked fainting in the
                        Bois, and brought home : finds her daughter in a like state at the prospect
                        of her engagement to a young M. Farmont being broken off, and she has to
                        colleot her forces and help to arrange matters. Incidentally she finds how
                        greatly her own husband loves her : all this so strengthens her that she is
                        able to refuse Jean, brought to life again. He resigns himself to his regal
                        prospects, and is reconciled to his father.</p>
                    <p>Such is the play, full of passion, ambition, and sacrifices, rather a great
                        pley. M. Le Bargy and Mlle Baréty excelled almost all we have yet seen of
                        them. The others were good, but though M. Poumard did his bast as the old
                        prince, we could not but think of Monnet Sully, who did the part so superbly
                        in Paris. All the traces, however, of overacting and that shade of contempt
                        for the audience which had been noticeable before, disappeared this last
                        performance. It is a pity M. Le Bargy leaves us, as two or three of the
                        plays promised have not been given. But we have had the pleasure of seeing
                        acting of the best Frenoh sohool, in some of the most interesting modern
                        drama. At least that is some consolation after the arid and disappointing
                        programme of the theatrical season. Between the 2nd and 3rd acts a
                        collection was made for the unfortunate Coorrières miners, and LE 120 was
                        realized by the efforts et Mesdames Dauesmond and Bernou, who charmed
                        everyone, even in the bar, into paying at least once. M. Le Bargy thanked
                        the audience in a most eloquent and flattering speech. So ends the Cairo
                        theatrical season for 1905-1906.</p>

                    <p>To the Editor of the “Egyptian Gazette ” Sir, Will you kindly insert the
                        enclosed appeal for funds to assist the Itinerating Chaplaincy of Lower
                        Egypt? The object is a worthy one and the chaplainoy is an influence for
                        good, especially amongst those whose opportunities of attending Divine
                        Service are few and far between. I hope therefore the appeal will be
                        snccessful. and that sufficient annual subscriptions and donations may be
                        received to enable the chaplaincy to be placed on a permanent basis.</p>
                    <p>Subscriptions and donations, however small, will be gratefully received and
                        acknowledged.</p>
                    <p>— I am, etc., Fred. T. Murdoch.</p>
                    <p>Mansonrsh, March 28.</p>
                    <p>The following is the text of the circular referred to :—</p>
                    <p>Sir,—Believing you to be interested in the above, we beg to draw yonr
                        attention to the following facts ; The Chaplaincy was instituted by the
                        Society, for the Propagation of the Gospel in 1902, and a grant of £200 per
                        annum was sanctioned in the hope that the neoessary fonds woold be raised by
                        subscription locally, and the chaplainoy eventoally become self- supporting.
                        In 1904 the society’s grant was reduced to £100. In the meantime it had been
                        found necessary to raise the chaplain’s stipend to £250. The Rev. Canon F.
                        Utterton of Leatherhead, Surrey, kindly undertook to maka himself
                        responsible for the balance or part of it as could not be met locally. Only
                        £80 was forthcoming from the Delta and the Rov. Canon Utterton had to find
                        some £70. The rent and other expenses of the church rooms at Tantah and
                        Mansoniah (£18 and £25 respectively) and the chaplain’s travelling expemes
                        between the two places were paid out of offertories and local subscriptions
                        and donations. Tho furniture of the church rooms (more especially that at
                        Mansonrsh) was generously provided by Mr. G. B. Alderson, Bishop Byth, and
                        others.</p>
                    <p>The chaplain resides at Mansonrah in the same building as that in which the
                        church room is situated, renting the rest of the flat. Alternate morning and
                        evening services are held every Sunday at Mansonrsh and Tantah, and
                        occasional visits have been paid to Ksfrel Zayat, Damanborir, and
                        Constantinia. Even Assiout and Beni-Souef have been reached.</p>
                    <p>The Rev. Canon Utterton has been compelled to, withdraw his guarantee and,
                        under these circumstances, there is grave danger of the chaplaincy having to
                        be abandoned for lack of, sufficient funds to meet the expenses. It is felt,
                        however, that with a litte help from Alexandria and Cairo and other towns in
                        Egypt, this useful work might be carried on and the chaplaincy eventually
                        become permanent. We need barely point out that there is an ever increasing
                        number of Britishsubjects is resident in Egyptain villages remote from any
                        church or religous service of their own faith, and for their sake it is
                        important that this chaplaincy should not be allowed to fall through.</p>

                        <head>VICTORIA COLLEGE ATHLETIC SPORTS.</head>
                        <p>The annual athletic sports of Victoria College took place on Wednesday
                            last in the presence of some 2,000 spectators, including a large number
                            of parents and friends of the boys, who took the liveliest interest in
                            the proceedings. This, notwithstanding the fact that the afternoon was
                            as unpleasant as it could well be. A strong khamseen wind was blowing,
                            and the clouds of dust which repeatedly swept across the grounds
                            rendered it anything but enjoyable to be out. The weather, however, did
                            not affect the sports, the programme of which was carried through with
                            the greatest success, thanks to the perfect organisation of the
                            committee, which was composed of Messrs. A Morrison and E. A. Aubrey
                            (judges), A. Mustard (starter), F. G. Lowick (clerk of the course), and
                            A. G. Lias (timekeeper). The boys evinoed the greatest interest in the
                            varions events, and it was a pleasure to watch them acquitting
                            themselves so creditably. At the conclusion of the sports, Mrs. E. B.
                            Gould graciously distributed the prizes (which had been presented by
                            some frierds of the sohool) to the successful competitors. Mrs. A. S.
                            Preston made a beautiful bouquet, which was presented to Mrs. Gould by
                            the smallest prize winner, H. El Magri.</p>
                        <p>Mr. and Miss Lias were “at home” on the occasion of the sports and
                            received their guests with the utmost hospitality. A well-stocked buffet
                            had been erected under a marquee and here tea and light refreshments
                            were lavishly dispensed. Among Mr. and Miss Lias’ guests we noticed the
                            Earl and Countess of Meath, who spent the afternoon at the sohool before
                            leaving for Cairo.</p>
                        <p>The gronnds were beantifully decorated with flag kindly lent by
                            Rear-Admiral Sir Massie Blomfield Mr. A. S. Preston supplied the chairs.
                            The following is a list of the prizewinners :—</p>

                            stride. Frangi held on very pluckily for three laps and then fell away.

                            This is a pity, with such handsome prizes to be competed for.
                            Athletically the meeting should be a very fine one and the classic
                            event, the 109 yards, is a very open thing. For the jumps the entries
                            are good, and the polo jump names include the winner of the Cairo
                            Olympic Games at this branch of sport. He should win it as his most
                            dangerous opponent is untrained owing to injuries and is also penalized.

                    <p>Icilma Fluor Cream is the only cream that contains no grease nor oil.
                        Deliciously scented it cleanses the pores of the skin as nothing else can
                        do, makes it pearly white, gives life to the tissues, elasticity to the
                        muscles, and a deliciously cool feeling to the skin.</p>
                    <p>Its unique properties are due to Icilma Natural Water so that it may well be
                        called <hi>Nature’s Skin Food </hi> and the skin requires nothing else to
                        give it the necessary vitality, to preserve it from sunburn, heat, cold or
                        the effects of hard water, to prevent and cure the minor irritations due to
                        overheated blood, and to preserve the youthful fresh look to which hot
                        climates are so fatal.</p>

                        that the company is able to pay such a dividend as 4% for the first year of
                        its existence, and when only a portion of its property is developed. If all
                        continues to go well your beard hopes that for the carrent year a somewhat
                        increased dividend-may be possible. Of the vaine of your property there can
                        be only one opinion; if I might be allowed the comparison, its position in
                        the centre of the City of Alexandria is similar to that of the Bank of
                        England to London, and its possibilities are immense. It will be the objeot
                        of yonr Directors to develop these possibilities to the utmost. Although
                        speaking generally the public in Egypt is more disposed to speculative
                        investments, there is, nevertheless, a considerable body of prndent
                        investors to whom the security offered by the company's 4% First Mortgage
                        Debentures appeals. A small amount was placed prior to Slat Decern, but
                        since then considerable progress has been made, and your directors
                        anticipate no difficulty in placing the remainder ''an for et à mesure,” as
                        they are required for construction. The construction of the east blook is
                        well in hand, and your directors hope that it will be completed in eighteen
                        months time. This blook will consist of ground and four floors and will be
                        supplied with electric lifts and all modern conveniences.</p><p>Directors’

                            <p>"The Egyptian Gazette" Series is the most artistic collection to be

                        <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                        <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers
                            the accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by
                            which they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange
                            them as accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that
                            none of them are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home
                            there are several things to be considered. To begin with there is the
                            difference in climate between Egypt and the various points at which you
                            may arrive in Europe.</p>
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                            January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so
                            warm as Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more
                            uniformly warm than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt
                            far too early in the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is
                            perfect. The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                        <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent
                            at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on
                            each of the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of
                            Europe.</p>
                        <cb n="3"/>
                        <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                        <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth,
                            Southhampton, London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones
                            are as follows:—</p>

                        <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                            Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines
                            are also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by
                            travellers to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to
                            Alexandria, without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made
                            without change in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                        <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                            Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German
                            Levant line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                        <cb n="5"/>
                        <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by
                            P.&amp;O. Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd
                            Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
                        <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little
                            luggage is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several
                            good and responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed
                            charge to deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                        <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by
                            the fast Mail Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to Brindisi. One of these
                            leaves port Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the
                            Indian <cb n="6"/>mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                        <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                            attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats"
                            having been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to
                            Brindisi. If you are going straight through to England you will find the
                            train waiting at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without
                            changing. It has complete arrangements for sleeping and eating on board,
                            and you should arrive in London on the fifth day from leaving Port
                            Said.</p>

                        <head>SICILY.</head>
                        <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers
                            which leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to
                            TAORMENA, one of the most charming and popular places on the island.
                            Giardini is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina
                            is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the town is
                            much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                            restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent
                            of Etna and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and
                            Saracenic remains that are found all over the island, are an endless
                            sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a
                            Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by
                            the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be
                            seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                            about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                            delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city.
                            The Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of
                            S. Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The
                            Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also
                            worth a visit.</p>

                    <div type="article">
                        <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                        <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every
                            Wednesday during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3
                            days.</p>
                        <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino
                            Co.’s steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave
                            it without wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely
                            places on its bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that
                            takes you to Sorrento [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                        <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can
                            will devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and
                            interesting portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are
                            too well-known to need comment here.</p>
                        <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five
                            hours brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent
                            admiring the City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence
                            itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the
                            local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is
                            the most attractive and fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the
                            Viale dei Colli, one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago,
                            goes winding up through the hills a distance of four miles. The most
                            delightful excursion outside Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its
                            Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is made first by ordinary
                            train from Florence to St. Ellero, thence by cog-wheel railway to
                            Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                            striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                        <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a
                            fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night
                            should if possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile
                            at sunset.</p>
                        <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near
                            Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient
                            half-way house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable
                            and the air and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy,
                            with the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European
                            cities and a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and
                            deliciously cool breezes from the surrounding mountains and the
                            Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                        <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                            gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings,
                            are a constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn
                            in Genoa. Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches
                            containing exquisite marble columns and historical paintings, and the
                            incomparable Campo Santo filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                        <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                        <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                            Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful
                            windows illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and
                            the monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                        <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                            SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal
                            springs, change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are

                        <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                            delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                            vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage
                            or bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every
                            turn. The approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any
                            other sea port. The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of
                            the sea, no hills behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of
                            Campaniles appear above the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering
                            town rises like a fairy mirage out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                        <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                            lakes.</p>
                        <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in
                            one-and-a-quarter hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                        <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is
                            very beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                            enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo,
                            Cadenabbia, and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio
                            opposite. The walk from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio
                            is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake
                            Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in
                            two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                            is an excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated
                            above the town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings,
                            “Entombment," by Ciseri, and ‘Tho Flight into Egypt,” by Bramantion.</p>

                            scenery on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to
