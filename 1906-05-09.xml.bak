					<head>LORD'S CROMER REPORT</head>
					<p>We have already pointed out that however philanthropic the designs and dreams of Ismail may
						have been, his attempts to further and fulfil them were more successful in bringing the grim
						realities of oppression and poverty upon the country than the purely selfish and unimaginative
						oppression of any of the mere stupid tyrants who had previously injured the finances and
						prosperity of the country. Mohamed Aly, with all his faults, was a sagacious and vigorous
						ruler, and had not borrowed. The <cb n="2"/> fulfilment of Ismail’s schemes —a modern Cairo,
						Equatorial Empire, an Egyptian fleet, and the rest—was bound to throw a heavy burden on the
						country, even under an honest and painstaking administration. Under the circumstance
						bankruptcy was the inevitable end of corrupt management, and Ismail, with the best intentions,
						according to his defenders, achieved this end with a thoroughness denied to most spendthrift
						rulers. His deposition came too late in the day for much to be saved from the general wreck
						unless and until the whole system of administration should be reformed and committed to hands
						that were not only honest but strong. The rebellion of 1882 made this possible, and under Sir
						Evelyn Baring, as he then was, order began to be evolved from a financial and an
						administrative chaos. At first progress was desperately difficult, but progress there was, and
						the price of Egyptian securities began at last to rise from the depths to which they had sunk.
						To day they stand as high as or higher than those of any other national debt It might have
						been possible, as Sir Auckland Colvin and Lord Cromer have pointed out, to harry the process,
						but the policy of going cautiously met with its reward in the return of public confidence in
						the honesty of the Government. Taxation might not have been reduced to the same extent, but
						whether more imposing revenues would have balanced the moral effects of its diminution is
						doubtful. There is something highly impressive in the action of a Government that reduces
						taxation both to the investor and the fellah taxpayer. The former infers that the Government’s
						financial position is more than satisfactory, the latter is encouraged to throw every ounce of
						his energy into productive labour.</p>
					<p>Now that the cultivator enjoys the benefits of an honest and decidedly efficient
						Administration, runs little risk (thanks to the barrages) from a low Nile, and has lost to a
						large extent the fear of revealing the fact that he has money, which characterised him in
						Ismail’s days, and still characterises his Syrian or Mesopotamian brother under the beneficent
						rule of Yildiz Kiosque, he is beginning to draw on his hoard. For years millions of gold have
						been brought into the country to "lift” and pay for the crops which improved conditions have
						enabled the fellah to produce. These huge sums have accumulated, and the hole in the ground or
						the bag hidden in the wall—still the normal receptacle for the fellah’s savings:— are full to
						overflowing point. The fellah’s one investment of his savings is in land, and in land,
						accordingly, he invests at an ever-increasing ratio, with the natural results that the present
						peace of land is likely to be maintained, to say the least. The fellah knows enough of
						agriculture not to make a bad bargain in land buying. It may be said that he will occasionally
						give absurd prices for a few feddans; true, but in these cases it will generally be found that
						the purchaser is willing to pay a fancy price in order to "round off ’ his property. English
						land-owners follow his example often enough and no one declares that tha price of land or of
						any other commodity is ridiculously inflated because certain purchasers can and will afford to
						pay for their whims.</p>

						<p><persName>Sir E. Grey</persName> has given a detailed statement on the Turkish negotiations
							showing that <persName>Mukhtar Pacha</persName>, in an interview with the Khedive, demanded that the boundary line
							should run from El-Rafeh to Suez and thence to Akaba. The Khedive replied by suggesting that
							the demarcation should be on the basis of the Grand Vizier’s telegram of the 8th April, 1892,
							the line running from El-Rafeh to three miles to the west of Akaba. Turkey replied that the
							telegram only referred to the western side of the peninsula and its interpretation concerned
							only <placeName>Turkey</placeName>.</p>
						<p>The British Note of the 3rd May supported the Khedive’s proposals and asked for a
							favourable reply to be given within ten days.</p>
						<p>Sir E. Grey added that the extent of the Turkish demands and the tone and character of the
							Turkish communications with the Khedive made it impossible to defer the settlement
							indefinitely. To assent to the latest development of the Turkish demands would constitute a
							real danger in respect of the freedom of the Canal, the liberties of Egypt, and of the

						<p>The days go by, and the time limit given to the Sultan will soon be up. Both Great Britain
							and the Porte appear to be merely marking time at present, although active preparations in
							view of eventualities are being made as the probability of the Sultan refusing to give any
							satisfaction has to ba taken into account At the eleventh hour he may decide to give way
							unless he has received assurances that Great Britain’s policy may he opposed by one of the
							Great Powers.</p>
						<p>The “Morning Post” remarks: —</p>
						<p>Perhaps at the Porte the long drawn-out negotiations at Algeciras may have produced the
							impression of unstable equilibrium in Europe. At Algeciras Germany was determined to assert
							the principle that <placeName>Morocco</placeName> should not he handed over to the protectorate of any one Power. No
							Power was prepared for a conflict for the purpose of resisting that principle, and therefore.
							<placeName>Germany</placeName> had her way, taking care of course not to push anything more than the bare principle.
							The event did not test the lengths to which Germany was prepared to go for the assertion of
							her theme. Since the Conference the German Emperor has indicated in Bismarckian fashion the
							German view that a Power which supports Germany’s policy has earned <placeName>Germany</placeName>’s gratitude, a
							view of which the unexpressed converse is that Powers which have not supported Germany’s
							policy have earned something else. Bismarck never treated any international business on its
							merits. His idea was do ut des or if yon don’t help me to what I want I will lose no
							opportunity of making you uncomfortable. This was the doctrine which as Prussian
							representative at the old Diet of <placeName>Frankfurt</placeName> he unceasingly pressed upon his Government.
							Prussia was to bully every German State that did not vote on Prussia's side. The bullying had
							the result that in 1866 nearly every State in <placeName>Germany</placeName> fought against Prussia, but as Prussia
							had her forces in order, and the other States had neglected their forces, their resistance
							was in vain, and might proved right. The spirit of Bismarck still governs Prussia, and, what
							is more, it is the spirit which controls all Germany to-day. The moral is that any Powers
							which wish to be able to have a policy of their own in the Europe of the Twentieth Century
							must be strong enough to carry on that policy. Their forces must be as strong as the forces
							of Germany. That is at this moment the condition on which independent States can exist in
							Europe. It is not an ideal condition, not in all respects a happy condition, but it is
							there.</p>

						and that the Sinai conflict will not provoke bloodshed throughout Europe ; but should such
						happen and war break out between Germany and England—if there should finally be determined the

						such an advantageous international position that, standing aside from the struggle, she could
						eventually come forward in the role of peacemaker and with her casting vote incline the

						<p>It would be impossible to get a greater amount of misstatement in a smaller paragraph. In

						<head>RAFAH.</head>
						<p>Rafah, which has temporarily usurped the position of Tabah as the most talked of place on

							when Sargon of Assyria, having forced the Kingdom of Judea to pay him a large war
							contribution, encountered the army of Shabak, the Ethiopian Pharaoh of Egypt, and routed it
							completely. A few years later Sennacherib defeated the forces of Tirhakah the Ethiopian at El
							Takeh, in the same neighbourhood. The Assyrian and Egyptian armies carried on war­like
							operations in this district and a battle in the Ptolemaic epoch in which the forces of
							Seleucus of Syria were decisively beaten by the Egyptians. Far more recently a Mongol army
							threatening Egypt was defeated by Beybars at the Well of Goliath near Khan Younis, in an
							action which was decided, according to Gibbon, by the valour of nine thousand negroes armed
							with iron flails. The campaigns of Napoleon and Mohamed Aly in the same region bring us to

						<p>“Al Moayad” considers the English Press to be severe in dealing with the Sinai question,

							to excite the British public by referring to the ill-judged statements of some of the local

							These strictures, however, do not affect the original question. The Sublime Porte still

						<p>“Great Britain,” continues the Turcophile organ, “has no right to require Tabah in the name

						<p><persName>Nicholas Pavlovitch Ignatieff</persName> was born in 1832. He was the son of
							Count Paul Ignatieff, a captain of Infantry, who at the time of the military insurrection
							that occurred at <placeName>St. Petersburg</placeName> in consequence of the somewhat forcible accession of the
								<persName>Grand Duke Nicholas</persName> to the throne of Russia in 1825, was the first to
							pass over, with his company, to the side of the new Taar—a defection which it was his duty to
							make in this manner in opposing the defection of the rebels, and which ensured the triumph of
							the former, and gained for <persName>Captain Ignatieff</persName> and his family the powerful
							protection of <persName>Nicholas I</persName>. The late Count had at the very outset of his
							career the Emperor Alexander II. for his god-father. He was educated at home and in the Corps
							des Pages, and, according to custom, quitted that select establishment for young aristocrats
							to enter the Guard ; and in the Military Academy, after three years study, he was appointed
							as staff officer. At the beginning of the Crimean war he was ordered to be on the staff of
								<persName>General Berg</persName>. He occupied at Riga the post of Quarter Master-General of
							the Baltic corps. He then passed from the military to the diplomatic service, finding his
							point of transition in the military attacheship to the Embassy at <placeName>London</placeName>. His chief
							performance in this capacity was a report on England’s military position in <placeName>India</placeName>, which so
							pleased the Emperor that he summoned Captain Ignatieff to Warsaw for a personal interview. In
							1858 Ignatieff, now a colonel and aide-de-camp to the Emperor, was sent on a special mission
							to Khiva and Bokhara. He was afterwards made a major-general in the Imperial suite, and sent
							as a plenipotentiary to Peking, 1860, where he concluded a treaty by which the province of
							Ussuri was ceded by <placeName>China</placeName> to <placeName>Russia</placeName>. On his return to <placeName>Russia</placeName> he was made Director of the
							Asiatic Department in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 1864 he was ap­pointed Minister at
							Constantinople, where his legation was afterwards (1867) raised to the rank of an embassy.
							Apart from his rank as ambassador, he was a lieut.-general), and a general aide-de-camp to
							the Emperor. The object which <persName>General Ignatieff</persName> steadily pursued at
							Constantinople was to secure for Russia a powerful influence over Turkey. He completely
							reassured the late Sultan Abdul Aziz as to the intentions of the Government of St Petersburg,
							while on the other hand he gained the good-will of the Christian subjects of the Porte by his
							courteous behaviour and his simulated anxiety to protect them. In the negotiations between
							the various European Powers prior and subsequent to the war between Russia and Turkey,
								<persName>General Ignatieff</persName> took a very prominent part. He was recalled from the
							embassy at <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> <date when="1878-05-02">May 2, 1878</date>, when <persName>Prince Labanoff</persName> was sent
							there in his place. Afterwards he was appointed Minister of the Interior, from which post he
							was dismissed in June, 1882, owing to disagreements with the pacific M. Da Giers. He
							remained, however, a member of the Council of the Empire. He was a bitter enemy of the
							Nihilists.</p>

								forming the 13th Brigade R.H.A., the other, “T” Battery, being stationed at Umballa, Punjab.
								U Battery saw a lot of service in the South African War, under the command of Major P. B.
								Taylor. Its 9 pounders spoke out to some purpose round the kopjies of Paardeberg, and under
								a heavy shell and rifle fire did splendid work at Driefontein, and again in the capture of
								the hills round Bloemfontein, they supported the Royal Scots Greys. After the occupation of
								Bloemfontein U Battery was attached to Broadwood’s column, which met with a reverse at
								Sanna’s Post. It suffered badly in this action, being almost wiped out, but was rapidly
								filled up again, and on the trek. Down to the close it did good service as a battery. At
								that period a good many of the R. H. A. Batteries were converted in mounted Rifles for the
								pursuit of the mobile enemy. After the close of the war, U Battery came home, and was
								stationed at Manchester, from where it moved to Christ-church last year. The officers of the

					<head>EGYPT'S TRADE</head>
					<head>THE OPENING FOR BRITISHERS</head>
					<div type="item">
						<p><persName>Mr. Vice Consul Freeman,</persName> in his Report on the Trade and Commerce of
							Alexandria for the year 1905, remarks :—</p>
						<p>In making a report of this description perhaps the most difficult part is the treatment of
							the question of openings for British trade. If, for example, I refer to the fact that one
							cannot find an egg cap small enough for the Egyptian egg, there are still a thousand other
							articles which space and lack of expert knowledge prevent me from mentioning. I select,
							however, the following branches of trade as perhaps meriting the attention of home
							manufacture's</p>
						<p>The choice of British saddlery here is very limited, there being only one or two shops at
							which it can be bought. At one of these the minimum price for a saddle, bit and bridle is
							about 3l. 5s., at another 4l.</p>
						<p>I understand that a British watch retailed at from 1l. 10s. to 2l, would find a ready
							market amongst the natives—if it were properly advertised. One thing, however, is absolutely
							necessary, and this is that the article should bear an English stamp on it. The "fellah”
							understands the word “London”—to him in many cases London means England— and I would
							therefore suggest that the watches should be marked in this way. Where, however, this cannot
							be done the word ‘England” at least should form part of the stamping.</p>
						<p>The lowest price at which an ordinary sporting gun of British manufacture can be bought
							here is about 4l., and I believe there is scope for further enterprise in this direction. The
							foregoing remarks on the subject of stamping apply here with even greater force.</p>
						<p>It is, I believe, practically impossible to purchase good British rubber tyres for
							carriages in <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> ; those used here are mostly French, Austro-Hungarian or American.
							Rubber tyres are now in great demand for the carriages of the numerous wealthy residents,
							and, owing to the injurious effect of the sun, renewals must be comparatively frequent. It is
							admitted that British tyres are superior to those imported from other countries, and I
							imagine that they would sell well if properly introduced. The retail prices at present paid
							for foreign tyres are about 7s. per kilo. (2.21bs) and upwards. </p>
						<p>Whether the winter in this country is colder than in former years or whether fashion and
							luxury are responsible for the change modern houses are now frequently fitted with
							fireplaces. A good trade is done in portable stoves, the British ones being more or less
							conspicuous by their absence. There is also a handy and economical American cooking stove on
							the market.</p>
						<p>There might be an opening in glassware for tumblers and water jugs, so constructed that it
							would be possible to place ice in them without its coming into contact with the contents. It
							is true that very large jugs made in this way can be bought, but the idea does not appear to
							have been extended yet to glasses for drinking purposes and small water jogs.</p>

						<head>NILE MISSION PRESS.</head>
						<p>The annual meeting of subscribers to the Nile Mission Press was held last week at
							Exeter-hall, <placeName>London</placeName>. Mr. A. A. Hed presided. It was reported that the press had been
							established last year in Cairo in order to print and circulate Christian literature for the
							people of <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, the <placeName>Sudan</placeName>, Arabia, and adjacent lands. Representatives of the Church
							Missionary Society, the American Presbyterian Mission, the <placeName>Egypt</placeName> General Mission, and the
							British and Foreign Bible Society were serving on the committee in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>. Daring the year the
							society had been able to spend £1,200, owing chiefly to one donation of £1,000, bat an annual
							income of £800 was required. Mr. J. Martin Cleaver said that the Government and mission
							schools in Egypt were turning out hundreds of thousands of pupils, and among these there was
							a great demand for Christian literature, which should be supplied in competition with the
							pernicious literature supplied from other quarters. <persName>Mr. G. Patterson,</persName>
							chairman of the executive, <persName>Mr. P. K. Allen,</persName> honorary treasurer,
								<persName>Mr. J. L. Oliver,</persName> secretary, and the Rev. Tissington Tatlow also took

					<head>MUSSULMAN UNREST.</head>
					<p>For some time past there have been symptoms of grave and widespread unrest among the
						Mohamedan population of Africa. It is not only in Egypt, where some of the native papers
						afford evidence of a desire to support the Turkish Government in its aggression at Ta ah, in
						the Sinaitic peuinsula, that this disturbed state of mind is apparent ; but also in the French
						possessions all over the Continent of Africa. Morocco, of course, has led to a European
						Conference, and last year M. Coppolani, the French Commissioner, was murdered, it was said at
						the time by a fanatic. Shortly afterwards trouble broke out in the region of Zinder, and
						Lieutenant Tailleur was murdered in Djerma ; Lieutenant Karma was treacherously assassinated
						in the Niger, and three other officers and non commissioned officers in the French service met
						the same fate. Risings have occurred on the Niger, in our own possession of Sokoto, and also
						in Tripoli, while in Tunis itself attacks on Europeans have grown unpleasantly frequent. The
						French authorities are carefully watching several foreign officers who have entered Tunis
						without paying their respects to the General Commanding the French Force of Occupation, as is
						the custom, and whether these agents are authorised by their Governments or not, it is clear
						that they are contributing to the state of uneasiness which now pervades a large proportion of
						the Mohamedan population.</p>

						<head>COUNT BAVASTRO AND COUNT SACKEY.</head>
						<p>The doings of Count Bavastro de Cortazzi, who says he is of <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>, and of his friend
							Count Sackey, who also, we know, was recently here, are arousing great interest in <placeName>New York</placeName>,
							The following extracts from New York papers will give some idea of their exploits</p>
						<p>“Cattle Ranch in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>” a Myth.</p>
						<p>New York, April 5.—Miss Clare E. Page, a young woman stock trader here, appeared in the
							West Side Police Court yesterday as complainant agaiost Aribert Sackey who was arrested on a
							charge of larceny. Miss Page declared Sackey had posed as a count and that he had obtained
							from her sums aggregating $16,000 to establish a cattle trade with <placeName>Egypt</placeName>. The charge,
							however, against the man is that he pawned in St. Louis for $1.0 a Gobelin tapestry valoed at
							$1,500 which Miss Page had given him to sell. Sackey was held in $1,500 bail for a farther
							hearing. (<placeName>New York</placeName> '‘Evening News.”)</p>
						<p>Asks Khedive for $40. </p>
						<p>Magistrate Whitman, in the Tombs Court, paroled Count Bavastro de Cortazzi, arrested for
							failing to pay a board bill of $40. Count Cortazzi was a witness on Wednesday in the inquest
							into the death of <persName>Mrs. Blanche Turner Dennis,</persName> who died at the Hotel
							<placeName>Marseilles</placeName>. Cordazzi said he expeoted a cablegram from the Khedive of <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, who would pay
							his debts. (“<placeName>New York</placeName> American”).</p>
						<p>Baron’s Left Arm held as Hostage.</p>
						<p>Being now without any arms to speak of Baron <placeName>London</placeName> Bavastro de Cortazzi has to pay in
							advance at all the boarding houses and hotels to which he applies.</p>
						<p>His best left arm was taken away from him in West Forty-third street. It is there with his
							trunk. His heart is in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, where he would like to be, and through varions legal
							complications he has nearly lost his head. As matters stand now he declares that his neck has
							felt the heel of the oppressor and that he finds no more joy in living in the United
							States.</p>
						<p>His missing arm was literally talked away from him, for in an argument about a board bill
							alleged to be unpaid he became so distracted that he went away without it. The proprietor of
							the Graystone Hotel, at No. 208 West Forty-third street, still has it, and in addition to
							that he had the Baron arrested for trying to get it again.</p>
						<p>Probably no better left arm can be found in this country than the one which the Baron had.
							It is almost human, although it is made of papier maché, aluminium, steel and wax. Ever since
							he was obliged to part with it the Baron has been in difficulties. The hand of it could twirl
							a cigarette, write checks and carry a cane. One of the most skilled manufacturers of Egypt
							made it, and hardly had its owner been in this country a week before a man offered him $100
							more than it had originally cost. On account of the educated digits on the end, the Baron
							always used this arm for shaking hands, as his right member is not as strong as it might
							be.</p>
						<p>He appeared yesterday afternoon in the Tombs Police Court to answer to the charge made
							against him by an obdurate hotel keeper. He was almost in tears as he spoke of the hardness
							of heart which he bad found in this country, and he has told his woes to the Egyptian
							Consul.</p>
						<p>“Never,” said he. “have I heard that a man’s arm was part of his luggage. It is
							indispensable that I have it I find difficulty in going about from place to place and in
							making a creditable appearance.”</p>
						<p>Baron Cortazzi has of late been involved in a series of misfortunes. In addition to his own
							troubles he has had a large share of those of others. He was summoned as a witness before the
							Coroner in the inquest over <persName>Mrs. Dennis,</persName> Who died in a mysterious manner
							at the Hotel Marseilles.</p>
						<p>But to all these conditions the Baron says if they will give him his good left arm he will
							rise superior. His father has large estates near Alexandria and to him the Baron has cabled
							for a remittance. Meanwhile he has been paroled in the charge of his counsel, Charles B.
							Howe, on his promise to appear next Monday afternoon in the Centre Street Police Court. (“New
							York Herald”).</p>

						<head>THE SCARCITY OF EGYPTIAN COTTON</head>
						<p>The comparative scarcity of Egyptian and long-stapled American cotton seems, a contemporary
							remarks,to have a natural correspondence with the extraordinary activity among manufacturers
							in the United States who make fine goods. Both for plain and fancy fine makes there is a
							remarkably strong demand, and some mills are said to be sold for fifteen months ahead. The
							ordinary position of things seems to he reversed, and buyers are trying to persuade obdurate
							sellers to extend their engagements. Their reluctance, however, may be accounted for to some
							extent by the suggestion made by a New York authority that some buyers are acoustomed “to
							cancel orders if the trade weakens before deliveries are made.” We have heard very much the
							same kind of thing in connection with our own home trade, and it may be asked whether the
							present time, when sellers are in an unusually strong position, does not give an opportunity
							to bring about some reformation in ways of doing business. More stringent contracts in the
							home trade would do something to amend it, and it is certainly remarkable that some of those
							manufacturers who have lately neglected their home in favour of their shipping trade have
							expressed relief in the comparative freedom from slipslop ways.</p>

					<head>EGYPTAIN LABOUR MARKET.</head>
					<head>EUROPEANS v. NATIVES.</head>
					<p>( From Lord Cromer’s Report. )</p>
					<p>So active and progressive is the building trade that contractors find it impossible to
						secure an adequate supply of masons plasterers, carpenters, etc. It cannot be doubted that,
						before long, much will he done in the direction of improved sanitation, involving the
						employment of a large number of plumbers ; at present almost all the plumbing is done by
						Europeans. Electricity is coming into more extensive use ; at present all the electric fitters
						are Europeans. Educational advance foreshadows more work for the printer and the bookbinder.
						It is also to be observed that the European population is rapidly increasing. Provision has to
						he made for its special wants. Moreover, native Egyptians, in their dress and customs, are to
						a great extent adopting European fashions, with the result that European demands are steadily
						increasing. At present, almost all these wants are supplied by Europeans. It is difficult to
						find a native cobbler who can sole and heel a pair of boots fairly well, although boots have
						now become almost an article of native wear. Boot-mending, as well as boot-making, are almost
						entirely in the hands of Greeks and Armenians. The European provision trade is practically
						monopolized by Greeks ; the drapery trade by Jews, Syrians, and Europeans ; the tailoring
						trade by Jews.</p>
					<p>So far, the Egyptians have shown but little capacity to seize the new opportunities for
						profitable enterprise offered by these new developments This is more especially to be
						regretted, owing to the fact that the industries, in which the natives themselves have for
						centuries found employment, appear to a great extent to be in process of extinction. I alluded
						to this subject in my last Annual Report (p. 74) I may here add that the tramway is
						supplanting the Egyptian donkey, and that with the latter is disappearing its saddle-maker and
						the maker of its trappings. With the disuse of stone floors, the trade of the straw mat maker
						is tending to become obsolete. Modern pumping apparatus is displacing the rough-hewn
						waterwheel. The native tanner, lacking technical knowledge and guidance, is being ousted by
						his more skilled European competitor. The textile industries—with the exception of silk, in
						which there has recently been some revival—are in a declining state. The products of native
						looms are being supplanted by the steam-woven fabrics of Europe, and with them the ancillary
						art of dyeing is decaying. I am informed that even indigo dyeing has practically ceased; the
						calico, out of which the dress of the fellah is made, being now imported ready dyed by
						artificial indigo. The flowing robes of delicate shades and embroidered vests, fashioned by
						the native tailor, are abandoned for the ready-made clothing of continental slop-shops. The
						manufacture of red slippers has sunk to insignificant proportions. Frequently the red slippers
						of the Sheikhs —the 'most conservative of all classes — are not slippers at all, but
						European-made boots, of which the lower portion is an imitation of the native pointed red
						slipper, and the uppers are cunningly formed of coloured web to imitate socks. The
						upholsterer, who could cover a divan to meet the needs of the last generation, finds himself
						unequal to the new demand for Louis XV brocaded chairs and couches. In furniture, clothing,
						and all necessities, the upper classes are now supplied almost entirely with European goods,
						and the tendency is working downwards.</p>

					<head>FAYOUM S.P.C.A</head>
					<p>(From our Correspondent.)</p>
					<p>Fayoum, Tuesday.</p>
					<p>A general meeting of the Feyoum branch of the S.P.C.A. was held at the Moudirieh under the
						presidency of H. E. the Moudir. A large number of members were present, including Major
						Elgood.</p>
					<p>The Moudir read the report on the past year’s work of the society, pointing out that in the
						six months of 1905 during which the society had been in operation the results achieved
						compared very favourably with a whole year’s work of other provincial branches, despite the
						fact that it was handicapped by want of funds. A supplementary report also showed that from
						January 10 to April 24 the society had dealt with 109 donkeys, 9 mules, 6 horses, and 1 camel,
						or a total from January 10, 1905 to April 24, 1906, of 301 donkeys, 25 mules, 51 horses, and 6
						camels.</p>
					<p>After the meeting had approved of the report various suggestions were made for improving the
						financial condition of the society, and for extending the scope of its operations to the
						different districts. It was finally agreed that a committee should be formed in every markaz,
						with the mamour as president.</p>
					<p>The general committee consists of Ibrahim Bey Neghib, Ahmed Bey Hassan, Aly Bey Ahdullal, M.
						Stamati, Mr. R. Way (hon. secretary), and the Moudir as president.</p>
					<p>It was decided to proceed as soon as possible with the construction of the new stables.</p>
					<p>The Moudir proposed a vote of thanks to Mr. Way. the hon. secretary, for his unremitting
						attention to the business of the society and stated that much of its success was due to his
						efforts. After expressing its gratitude to the Moudir and Major Elgood for the help they had
						given to the society the meeting broke up.</p>

					<head>LORD CROMER'S REFORM PROPOSALS.</head>
					<div type="article">
						<head>FRENCH VIEW</head>
						<p>Discussing the reforms in Egyptian jurisdiction proposed by Lord Cromer, the “Temps” makes
							the following statement of the French view of the subject:</p>
						<p>“While Consular jurisdiction, although very restricted in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, may lead to certain abuses
							there the mixed tribunals do not deserve the criticisms Lord Cromer applies to them. We
							consider it our duty, however, to point out from the outset that the scheme he puts forward
							has not only the disadvantage of putting in question the most express rights of the Powers
							and of impairing the moral and material position they occupy in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, it also involves the
							risk of substituting the unknown for a régime which has stood the test and h is had an
							opportunity of showing its virtues in practice. We do not think, of course, of contesting the
							political preponderance which pertains to Great Britain in the Khediviate ; but it is hard to
							see how the existence of the mixed tribunals; precious to the foreign colonies, can he a
							cause of danger and inconvenience to Great Britain.”</p>
						<p>The “Journal des Débats” in commenting on the Earl of Cromer’s report upon the repeal of
							the international régime in Egypt asks, “Have we to resist a reform of this nature, to refuse
							it our assent, which is as necessary as that of any of the thirteen Powers signatory to the
							Convention of 1876?” Answering the question, it says : “Nothing in the internal situation
							calls upon ns to do so,” and adds : “At the moment when the British are pushing the
							advantages which accrue to them from the agreement of 1904 they ought to desire to give us
							the satisfaction of settling the questions which may still arise. There are, perhaps, some
							latent questions regarding Liberia. There are some open questions relating to the New
							Hebrides and Ethiopia, where a very clear agreement between the Governments of Paris and
							London would be the best check upon the financial intrigues which have multiplied around the
							internationalisation of the railway from Djibouti to Addis Abeba. There we have a situation
							which at the time when Lord Cromer’s project calls for new negotiations on the basis of the
							understanding of 1904 ought not to escape M. Léon Bourgeois.”</p>

					<head>STRANDING OF THE EGYPTIAN PRINCE</head>
					<p>The following is the finding of the court of enquiry held at <placeName>Malta</placeName> into the recent stranding
						of the S.S Egyptian Prince :—</p>
					<p>The British steamship Egyptian Prince O. N. 114,422 of 2010 register tonnage, and with a
						crew of 33 men all told besides eight passengers, was approaching <placeName>Malta</placeName> on the 21st April
						1906, coming from <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>. The ship had to call at <placeName>Malta</placeName> for coal. At about 7.30 p.m.,
						Marsascirocco Lighthouse bearing No. 75’ W (true) when the steamer was on a N. 64° W. coarse
						The sky was clouded and it was hazy over the land. At about 8.10 p.m. a fixed bright light was
						observed on land which those on board took for the St. Elmo light. The master of the Egyptian
						Prince, Armstrong Dawns, was on the bridge and from that time onward he caused his vessel to
						swing outside so as ultimately to steer North. The ship then stranded at 8.30 p.m. on the
						Munxiar Rocks, a reef the master had calculated to be passing clear off at least a mile. It
						was subsequently ascertained that the bright light mistaken by the master of the ship for that
						of St. Elmo lighthouse was the cupola of the Military Gymnasium in Cottonera illuminated by
						electricity. That Cupola bore to the reef on which the ship had stranded N. W. by W. by
						compass, equivalent to N. 62 W. true. St. Elmo’s light would have the same cross-bearing with
						Delimara lighthouse only that the same cross-bearings of the lighted cupola would bring the
						ship’s navigation one mile to the S. W. from the safe course.</p>
					<p>The Nautical Assessors think that Captain Downs’ mistake is an error to which Master
						Mariners are liable without any sense of neglect being attached to their seamanship. The
						bright light was made out in the midst of the loom of the lights of a modern town on a bearing
						that represented a safe course of approach and therefore under conditions that would have
						induced any careful navigator to shape his course accordingly without any anxiety as to the
						safety of his vessel.</p>
					<p>The Court therefore comes to the conclusion that the stranding of the Egyptian Prince on the
						21st April 1906 was not due to any neglect or want of careful navigation on the part of
						Captain Armstrong Downs, who at the time was in charge of the ship.</p>
					<p>He is therefore acquitted.</p>

							Moslem population and of their Press, who are in favour of the resumption of Turkish
							authority over Egypt. This state of feeling is not concealed, and is indeed one of the most
							serious symptoms in the present crisis. It is therefore very significant of the prejudices
							prevailing among some ignorant Europeans that a correspondent of the “Egyptian Gezette”
							should have ventured to declare in yesterday’s issue that it would be strange if the
							Egyptians were not either neutral or friendly to the British Occupation “for it is
							inconceivable that after enjoying many years of freedom from tyranny and experiencing
							ever-growing prosperity they would wish to go back to the old misrule—or worse.” This point
							of view could only be maintained by a person who is totally ignorant of the Moslem and his
							views, and who has the most superficial acquaintance with the Oriental in general. The idea
							that the Egyptian should be grateful to the English because they have freed him from tyranny
							is childishly absurd, for tyranny is the only form of government that an Oriental can
							understand. Thousands of Moslems in Bosnia and The saly have left those countries since they
							came under Christian domination in order to live under the rule of the Sultan, because the
							autocratic and theocratic rule of the Caliph in their eyes far outweighed all the discomforts
							and expense of leaving the country, wherein they had lived for generations, when it was
							handed over to European rule. I confess I sympathise with them. I only live in Egypt "because
							I am forced to do so, but I would far rather go back to <placeName>England</placeName> it I could, and face the
							awful weather, the exactions of the Income Tax, the enormous rates and all the other burthens
							of London life although I know that under the Khedivial Government I am far better off than I
							would be in England. Blood is thicker than water, and Islam as a religion has ties far closer
							than even those of race and family to the European. It is absurd to think therefore that the
							Egyptian should cast aside such associations out of gratitude to us for having bestowed on
							him the blessings of an alien civilisation which he does not want and should rally to the
							side of England against the Caliph. Why should the Egyptian be grateful to us for having
							foisted on him the cheap European stook-in-trade, which is comprehensively labelled
							“Progress” ? I have lived in Egy pt for many years and, the more I see of the native, the
							more convinced I am that in his heart of hearts he is becoming more and more bored with the
							so-called blessings of civilisation, which we deal out to him with such a liberal hand, and
							would by no means object to seeing a change.</p>
						<p>Of course this point of view is quite incomprehensible to the majority of Englishmen in
							Egypt or at home, but, it is clear enough to everyone one who is not a prey to Podsnappery,
							which is endemic among so many of my countrymen in Egypt. Personally, of course, I am sorry
							that the native cannot he brought to appreciate Progress (with a capital P) and is so
							perverse as to prefer the rule of the Caliph, bat at the same time I am not at all sure that,
							if I were a native, I would not feel rather weary of the great pace with which Egypt is being
							hurried along the path of Progress and sigh for a change to the “good old times.” Such is the
							attitude of many Egyptians, and really when we come to think of it there is as much to be
							said on behalf of their point of view as of ours.—I am, etc.,</p>

						<head>BATHING AT ALEXANDRIA.</head>
						<p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
						<p>Sir,—Alexandrians do not know how to ap­preciate the good gifts which a bounteous nature
							has so liberally bestowed upon them.</p>
						<p>Especially is this observation true respecting their sea-bathing. Off the shores of their
							noble city is a magnificent expanse of sea, and to encourage them to make fall use of it a
							kindly Providence—their Titular Deity—sends them persuasive khamseens to urge them into its
							waves. It is not that they have any objection to accepting the hint—rather they avail
							themselves of the opportunity whenever it arises. Bat between rudely plunging into the sea
							and bathing in the right sense of the term there is a great gulf fixed ; and I am sorry to
							say that Alexandrians stand on the wrong side of that gulf. The fact is that they do not know
							how to bathe. Like with everything else, sea-bathing is a fine art, and as such it is
							considered in Turkey, a country which one is accustomed to regard as lacking in the
							refinements of advanced civilization. In this respect, however, Turkey can give the
							Alexandrians points. First of all, instead of a row of ungainly cabins, the barbarian Turk
							erects upon the sea a quadrangular building of lath upon piles which can be easily removed on
							the first approach of winter. A sheltered bay or creek, with a good sandy bottom, is selected
							for the site, but out of strict observance of the laws of the Koran, mixed bathing is
							forbidden, and in obedience to this precept the bathhouses for either sex along the shores of
							the Bosphorus and Marmora are separated by the intervals which decency and religion appoint.
							Moreover, the women must not swim out, or expose themselves, and so rigid is the regulation
							thereto respecting that an ample circumvallation of wooden hoarding completely conceals from
							the <cb n="5"/>inquisitive view the interior of the building and the faintest vestige of the
							charms of its inmates. Every physical comfort is studied and attended to. Thus the square of
							sea enclosed by the bath house is sufficiently shaded from the sun by a wooden roof, without,
							however, entirely shutting out the rays. The cabins are built, like in any ordinary swimming
							bath, opening on to the platform ; but with this difference, that the doors cover only half
							the cabin and so the bather while drying or dressing can watch the sport of the others in the
							water. As in ancient Rome, the Turkish bath-house to-day, whether on land or sea, is the
							meeting place of all ; in fact, on the Bosphorus bathing is a social function ; there is none
							of that stiffness and cold shoulder so noticeable in Anglo-Saxon natatory circles. Common
							immersion induces among the Turks and their fellow-citizens a feeling of kinship one for the
							other—high or low—which is lacking elsewhere ; humanity under such circumstances is placed on
							an equal footing by a return to Adamaic simplicity.</p>
						<p>Coffee and simids are served as soon as the bather has dried himself, and clad in the
							gaudy-colored bournous, and basking in the beautiful sunlight, he can either indulge in the
							luxury of a sunbath, or enjoy the pleasure of genial conversation and the gentle exercise of
							a peripatetic in company with his fellows, pleasures which recall the Academic Groves. In
							this wise, philosophically, sheltered from the sun, fanned by the sea-breezes, the hours
							glide down the golden flood of time; thus only is true enjoyment found, unalloyed with the
							disturbing elements of a false civilization. Compared with these joys what have the
							Alexandrians ? A few dog kennels jumbled along the shore ; no coffee, no simids, no shade,
							and worse of all, a mixed bathing which enforces the conventions of the drawing room and the
							etiquette of fashion into the depths of the sea. —I am, etc.,</p>

					<head>NOTES ET CRITIQUES</head>
					<dateline>Le Caire, mardi 8 Mai.</dateline>
					<p>A Londres, le Consolidé anglais a encore éprouvé, hier, une baisse de 3/8 de livre à 89 3/8.
						Cette dépression doit avoir été, assuré ment, déterminée par de nouvelles ventes opérées par
						les Compagnies d’assurances pour faire face aux paiements qu’elles ont à effectuer par suite
						du désastre de San-Francisco. L’Unifiée, la National Bank, l’Agricole, la Daïra et la Delta
						Light sont restées invariées à leurs cours précédents.</p>
					<p>A Paris, l’action Crédit Fonoier Egyptien a olôturé en reprise de 2 francs à 775. La Banque
						d’Athènes a réactionné de 1 franc à 150.</p>
					<p>Nous avons eu, ce matin, un marohé aussi inanimé que celui d’hier, avec un léger tasse­ment
						dans les cours, à deux ou trois exceptions près.</p>
					<p>La National Bank a perdu environ 1/ 6 à 26 5/16. L’Agricole s’est maintenue à 9 15/16-
						31/32. Le Comptoir Financier a fait 7 1/4 ; l’action nouvelle a été traitée à 6 1/4. La Banque
						d’Orient a fléchi un moment jusqu’à 135 pour revenir à 137-138.</p>
					<p>Renseignée en nouvelle reprise à Paris, l’action Crédit Foncier est remontée à 780.
						L’obligation à lots 1886 a progressé à 323-324 ; la nouvelle est restée à 269-270.</p>
					<p>La Delta Light a faibli à 12 1/16. La Wardan Estate a été cotée 6 1/2 ; la part de fondateur
						8 5/8. L’action Immobilière est revenue à 368 ; la part de fondateur Agricole du Nil à 8 1/2 ;
						l’action Entreprises Immobilières et Travaux à 4 1/4 ; la part de fondateur à 78.</p>
					<p>L’action Héliopolis a été ramenée à 300.</p>
					<p>La part de dividende Brasserie des Pyramides a perdu 3 francs à 65 ; les Ciments, 1 franc à
						74.</p>
					<p>L’action privilégiée Tramways d’Alexandrie a reculé à 185. L’action ordinaire Khédivial Mail
						a baissé de 35 sh. 6 à 32.</p>
					<p>Les Omnibus du Caire ont été encore demandés à 29 1/2-3/4. L’action Allotment a fléchi à 3
						9/16 pour clôturer à 3 5/8 ; la part de fondateur est remontée à 160.</p>
					<p>Dans le groupe des Hôtels, les Nungovich ont été offerts à 17 5/16 Par contre, les Baehler
						ont avancé à 4 15/16-5.</p>
					<p>Parmi les petites valeurs, les Delta Land ont faibli à 4 1/4 et les New Egyptian à 29
						sh.</p>
					<p> Le '‘Journal Officiel” a publié, dans un de ses derniers numéros, le texte anglais de
						l'arrangement intervenu le 23 Avril dernier entre l’Etat et l’Agricultural Bank of Egypt.</p>
					<p>Aux termes de cette convention, l’Agricultural Bank est autorisée, conformément à ses
						Statuts, à émettre des obligations portant un intérêt annuel de 3 1/2 pour cent pour une somme
						totale de £ 6,570,000.</p>
					<p>Les obligations déjà existantes seront présentées pour leur conversion en obligations du
						type nouveau dans les conditions déterminées par l’arrangement.</p>
					<p>Les obligations nouvelles seront contre signées par un délégué de l’Etat, et le service de
						l’émission sera confié à la National Bank of Egypt.</p>
					<p>Nous détachons d’une lettre de Londres, en date du 1er Mai, les lignes suivantes relatives à
						la situation monétaire :</p>
					<p>“Suivant toutes les apparences, le resserrement monétaire n’a pas encore dit son dernier mot
						et l’on s’attend à ce que le taux de l’escompte libre atteigne bientôt 3 7/8 sinon 4 pour
						cent. Il ne faut pas, en effet, perdre de vue que notre marché a encore de grands besoins, et
						qu'il ne sera pas à l’aise avant longtemps. La catastrophe de San-Francisco occasionne
						toujours un drainage de capitaux considérable et force les Compagnies d’asaurances, qui ont de
						gros paiements à faire en Amérique, à réaliser ce qu’elles ont de fonds d’Etat en
						portefeuille. Aussi prévoit-on de nouvelles baisses sur le Consolidé, ce qui ne saurait
						précisément améliorer la tenue générale du Stock Exchange. Les optimistes se basent toutefois
						sur la situation relativement forte de la Banque d’Angleterre pour espérer qu’une augmentation
						du taux officiel de l’escompte pourra être évitée malgré des recrudescences possibles
						d’exportations d’or vers New-York Par contre, les pessimistes font, en plus, entrer en jeu le
						différend avec la Sublime Porte qui, sans être inquiétant pour l’instant, pourrait bien, tout
						de même, réserver des surprises. Le fait est que l’emploi éventuel de moyens coercitifs contre
						le Divan pourrait aisément amener les partis mécontents à Constantinople à tenter quelque coup
						de main audacieux, ce qui ouvrirait la porte à des complications."</p>
					<p>L’assemblée générale ordinaire de la Société des Eaux de Tantah aura lieu le jeudi 31 du
						courant, à 4 h. p. m., au siège social au Caire.</p>
					<p>A l’ordre du jour : rapport du conseil d’administration, présentation des comptes de
						l’exercice 1995, fixation da dividende, nomina­tions statutaires, etc.</p>
					<p>On annonce de Bruxelles que les dividendes de la société Belge Egyptienne de l’Esbékieh pour
						l’exercice 1905 ont été fixés comme suit :</p>
					<p>Frs. 31,25 par action privilégiée des Nos 1 à 6,000, et Frs. 15,62 1/2 par id. des Nos 6,001
						à 8,000.</p>

					<p>( Aujourd'hui à midi et demie}</p>
					<p>Le marché continue à fléchir, quoique légèrement. L’incertitude au sujet du conflit d’Akaba
						et la hausse du taux d’escompte en sont les principaux motifs.</p>
					<p>L’Agricole est offerte à 9 15/16 et la Delta Light à 12 3/16, tandis qu’à Londres ces deux
						valeurs cotent respectivement 10 1/8 et 12 3/8, montrant ainsi une fermeté extraordinaire.</p>
					<p>Il y a une amélioration pour la Banque d’Athènes à 149, pour la Salt and Soda à 22/9</p>
					<p>Par contre, la Delta Land recule encore jusqu'à 4 5/32, l’Investment 1 5/16, le Comptoir 6
						3/16, etc.</p>
					<p>Quant aux autres titres, qui n’ont pas été traités, ils subissent une réaction
						proportionnelle.</p>
					<p>Il se pourrait qu’après avoir ainsi baissé par crainte des événements, on reprit à l’annonce
						des événements memes. Cela s’est vu plusieurs fois.</p>

					<p>Messrs. Barker and Co., Egyptian Agents for the Royal Insurance Company of Liverpool, hereby

						Francisco disaster has created in the minds of the public generally, the Directors of the
						Royal Insurance Company have made the following official announcement:—</p>
					<p>“ The Royal Insurance Company has</p>
					<p>" learnt by cablegram from its Manager at</p>
					<p>“ San Francisco that the area of the recent</p>
					<p>" disaster involves a possible liability of</p>
					<p>" £1,350,000 (6,750,000dols.). Having regard</p>
					<p>" however to the large balance at the credit</p>
					<p>“ of Profit and Loss at the end of 1904, and</p>
					<p>“ the profitable results of last year’s opera-</p>
					<p>“ tious, the payments which will have to be</p>
					<p>“ made in connection with this liability will</p>
					<p>“ not necessitate any reduction in the Fire</p>
					<p>“ and Reserve Funds of the Company.” </p>
					<p>It is anticipated that when the Manager of the Company at San Francisco has been able to
						look closely into the position it will transpire thatthe Company’s losses will be appreciably
						less than the figure mentioned. </p>
