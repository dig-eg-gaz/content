                    <p>MESSAGERIES MARITIMES</p>

                    <p>EXERCICE 1905</p>

                    <p>Les recettes d'exploitation réaliséss en 1905 par les Messageries Maritimes
                        ont atteint le chiffre le plus élevé constaté dans les comptes de la
                        Compagnie: 81,337.024 frs. pour 953,202 lieues marines parcourues avec
                        200,163 passa- gers transportés.</p>
                    <p>Malgré cette brillante situation, les corn missaires des comptes conseillent
                        de conso- lider le présent par le renforcement des réser- ves, par
                        l'extinction des charger financières et de préparer l'avenir par la
                        construction de navires neufs de grand tonnage, et cela en raison de la
                        crise ouvrière, de la concurrence étrangère et des avantages stipulés par la
                        nou- velle loi sur la marine marchande. Aussi ap- prouvent-ils pleinement le
                        principe d’une aug- mentation éventuelle du capital social de la
                        Compagnie.</p>
                    <p>Les-produitsdes lignes ont atteint 61,812,345 frs. en augmentation de
                        11,647,165 frs. Les primes à la navigation ont rapporté 3 935 170 fr. soit
                        près de 2 millions en plus qu'en 1904</p>

                    <p>Il va de soi que les dépenses ont augmenté par suite de cet accroissement de
                        trafic : 17,744,908 fr. de charbon contre 15,882,004 en 1904, 4,784.096 frs.
                        de droits de transit du Canal de Suez contre 3,826,955 en 1904, et 5,396,644
                        fr. de droits de ports et frais de route contre 4,231,797 en 1904.</p>

                    <p>Enfiu, en raison des charges financières spé- ciales, les intérêts sur
                        capitaux qui figuraient en recettes pour 221,161fr. dans les comptes de
                        1904, sont portés en dépenses pour 207,842 fr. dans ceux de 1905.</p>

                    <p>L'exoédent des recettes sur les dépenses qui était de 7,997,993 fr. l'année
                        dernière, attei- gnaitau 30 novembre dernier 11,169,05m fr., dégageant ainsi
                        une plus-value de 3,171,065 fr. en laveur du présent exercise. Déduction
                        faite des intérêts des obligations, il reste donc une somme disponible de
                        8,709,813.</p>

                    <p>Sur ce total, il sera prélevé d’abord 1 million en faveur du fonds
                        d’assurance et 5,288,000 fr. destinés aux amortissements du matériel naval.
                        Ces répartitions opérées, ainsi que celles ayant trait à l’amortissement des
                        frais d’émission, au compte supplémentaire do prix des obligations et à la
                        caisse de prévoyance des employés, il reste une somme suffisante pour donner
                        á tou- tes les actions un dividende de 12. fr. 50. soit 5% du capital
                        nominal et le solde à reporter est de 45,285</p>

                    <p>Parmi les petites valeurs il y a eu de nom- breuses transactions en Delta

                        26 sh. 3.</p>

                    <p>Les Salt and Soda sont restés à 21 sh. P, malgré une rumeur suivant laquelle
                        la Société aurait obtenu la prolongation pour une période de 20 ans de son
                        contrat avec le gouvernement concernant l’exploitation des salines de
                        l’Etat</p>

                    <p>Les Sucreries ont passé de 14 à 16 franos.</p>



                    <p>Un journal du Caire a annoncé hier que ‘l'Association des courtiers a refusé
                        d’ad- mettre à la cote de la Bourse Khédiviale du Caire les titres de la
                        Gharbieh Land, des Excelsior Hotels et de l'Express Nile Steamers." Ainsi
                        présentée, l’information est inexacte et passablement tendancieuse.</p>

                    <p>Relativement à la Gharbieh Land, l’assemblée extraordinaire de l'Association
                        a simplement réservé sa décision jusqu’au résultat du pre- mier exercice, en
                        attendant un complément de rapport.</p>

                    <p>Pour ce qui est de l'Excelsior Hotels et de la Nile Express Steamers,
                        l'allégation du journal en question ost absolument erronée. L’assemblée n'a
                        pris et ne pouvait prendre aucune décision pour la bonne raison que le
                        Comité n’a pas encore présenté son rapport concernant ces deux Sociétés.</p>



                    <p>Le Comité de la Corporation des agents de change a décidé de fixer
                        provisoirement les heures de séance de la Boarse Khédiviale du Caire de 10
                        h. à midi.</p>

                    <p>Il n'est pas impossible que les actionnaires de l’Anglo Belgian aient l’heur
                        d’être fixés sur la valeur tout au moins nominale de leur titre.</p>

                    <p>On annonce, en effet, de Londres que la Compagnie a fait les démarches
                        nécessaires dans la vue d’obtenir la cote au Stock Ex- change pour 70,000
                        actions entièrement ou partiellement libérées.</p>

                    <p>On sait que le capital nominal de la Socié té est de £ 1,000,000, divisé en
                        200,000 ac- tions de £ 5 chacine. Or, 100,000 actions avaient été offertes
                        en souscription, dont 70,000 avaient été “garanties", d’après le prospectus,
                        en d’autres termes placées avant l’émission publique.</p>

                    <p>Seraitce à dire que l’admission à la cote est demandée pour ces 70.000
                        actions, qui deviendraient seules négociables.</p>

                    <p>La 28èms assemblée générale ordinairo de l’Alexandria Water Co. aura lieu au
                        siège social à Alexandrie le lundi 11 Juin prochain, à 4 heures et demie,
                        p.m.</p>

                    <p>A l’ordre du jour: rapport da conseil, pré- sentation des comptes et bilan de
                        l’exercice écoulé, fixation du dividende, etc.</p>
