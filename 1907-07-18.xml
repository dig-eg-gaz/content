                    <p> Commenting on the forthcoming tour of the American fleet through the waters
                        of the world, the "New York Herald" says : - President Roosevelt has by no
                        means given final sanction to the plan of sending the battleship fleet to
                        the Pacific viên the Straits of Magellan. On the contrary, the President is
                        quite as strongly in favor of sending the ships by the Suez route, bring
                        them home by Magellan, as of sending them viâ Magellan and bringing them
                        home by the Mediterranean. Mr. Roosevelt will decide whether the ships go by
                        Suez or not. </p>
                    <p> It is understood that the chances are about even that Philippine and Asiatic
                        waters will see Uncle Sam's superb sea-fighters long before they file
                        through the Golden Gate. The President is very much impressed with the idea
                        of sending these battleships clear around the world. It is expected that
                        when the entire fleet is ready to move it will consist of twenty ships. The
                        spectacle of this magnificent fleet, of greater tonnage and gun-power than
                        the German high-sea fleet, or the famous Channel squadron, carrying the
                        American flag clear around the world on practically a single practice
                        cruise, will be the most remarkable episode in the history of any navy in
                        the world in time of peace. </p>
                    <p> Much resentment has been expressed by officials regarding the efforts of
                        various newspapers to make it appear that send ing the fleet into the
                        Pacific is a menace to Japan, or meant for baiting the Empire of the Mikado.
                        Mr. Roosevelt, of all the prominent statesmen in the world, has been
                        foremost in expressing friendship for Jepan and in standing up for the
                        rights of the Japanese in this country against the misguided acts of his own
                        countrymen. It is said he is willing to go to greater lengths than
                        heretofore in defending the Japanese and seeing that their rights are not
                        trampled upon. As showing the good feeling existing between the Prosident
                        and the Japanese Ambassador, a luncheon will be given at Oyster Bay by the
                        President on Friday, when Viscount Aoki, accompanied by a distinguished
                        Japanese Staff officier, will be entertained at Sagamore Hill. </p>
                    <p> The criticism has been made that war vese sels should not go to American
                        ports in the Pacific, as this might be distasteful to Japan. It is
                        understood that Mr. Roosevelt will take very strong grounds, if any
                        objection be made by any nation to the visit of American bat. tleships to
                        any American port. The President's main reason that the feet should proceed
                        to the Pacific now, in a time of profound peace, is to learn how to go there
                        should the exigencies of war require it to go quickly: The fleet is to coal

                        <p>The fire which broke out at midday on Tuesday last, in Sharia Mohamed Ali
                            near Darb el Nahabli, was extinguished shortly before 4 o'clock owing to
                            the prompt attendance of four fire engines. Fortunately no lives were
                            lost, but several families are now homeless and are dependant ipon the
                            kindness and charity of their neighbours. Over L.E. 4,000 of damage was
                            done to property, which was not covered by insurance. The conflagration
                            is believed to have originated in a carpenter's shop, owing to the
                            overturning of a spirit lamp at which he was heating some glue. The big
                            outbreak in the Sharia Mohamed Aly on Tuesday quite eclipsed the three
                            other smaller outbreaks, the larger of which was that in Khalifa
                            Khatatbah (Citadel Quarter). Four rooms of the ground floor in a native
                            house caught fire in the quarter mentioned owing to fire being
                            communicated from a confectioner's oven. On the arrival of the brigade,
                            immediately after the call, the fire had already'obtained a good hold,
                            but owing to active efforts the Hames were suppressed and all danger
                            averted within three quarters of an hour.</p>

                    <head>THE FINANCIAL CRISIS.</head>
                    <p>CAIRO'S TROUBLES.</p>
                    <p>COTTON INTERESTS UNCONCERNED.</p>
                    <p>LONDON, Thursday. The number of firms of repute in Cairo, whose suspension of
                        payment has just been announced here, has aroused fresh interest in the
                        financial crisis at present raging in Egypt I have good grounds for
                        believing that the commercial and financial difficulties that have thereby
                        arisen with Manchester and London are likely to be tided over. It has been
                        decided that the liquidation that will ensue will be conducted privately.
                        The management of these liquidations will be entrusted to a trustee
                        belonging to a well-known firm at Manchester.</p>
                    <p>Various estates of the firms concerned have been saved for the creditors. It
                        is understood that the Banks and the trade creditors will act together.
                        General satisfaction is felt at the policy that is to be pursued by the
                        London and Manchester banks, which is considered very sensible.</p>
                    <p>The liabilities of the concerns compromised by these failures in no way
                        concern the important cotton interests of Lancashire.</p>
                    <p>Regarding the failures reported in our issue of yesterday our Cairo
                        correspondent writes :</p>
                    <p>The figures as stated by your contemporaries were not quite exact. As a
                        matter of fact the assets in the case of all the houses involved
                        considerably exceed the liabilities, in some instances as much as much as
                        150%. It has been very fairly demonstrated that a gradual liquidation is in
                        the interest of all parties, and the principal ground for complaint and the
                        cause of the critical state of affairs is due to shyness of banks in London,
                        Manchester and other quarters, owing to the discredit thrown on the Egyptian
                        market, by the existing state of affairs. From the quarter in which I
                        obtained my information I gathered that there was not any question of
                        insolvability of any of the firms in question, it being to the general
                        interest to obviate this unhappy event. The holding of ready money by the
                        conservative | action of several parties has brought the situation to a head
                        and caused a regrettable situation which might have been avoided, had there
                        not been somewhat of a rush for the realisation of Stocks and Shares, and as
                        already mentioned</p>
                    <p>the stoppage of time drafts. The firms in ques. |tion were entirely
                        unprepared for the heavy demand on their resources, brought about by the
                        suppression of London and Manchester credits, and not having ready cash to
                        meet their obligations, and in addition, a large amount of capital
                        outstanding in various directions, they were naturally extremely hardly
                        pressed, and their only recourse was to take the step which has been
                        recorded in the Press. Remarks have been made in a paper, which it is
                        needless to name, in regard to the AngloEgyptian Bank. It has been
                        definitely asserted that the Anglo-Egyptian Bank is not involved to the
                        extent of more than L.E. 20,000, and the reflections made in this connection
                        prove to be imfomded. | It is regrettable to notice that owing to the |
                        present crisis a very large number of employés have been dismissed from
                        their employment, and in many cases without any consideration for having
                        lost their positions without notice. In addition to this there has been a
                        large influx of seekers after employment in this country, and the result is
                        that the labour market is now overcharged, and, as remarked by one of our
                        contemporaries, there is more possibility of a strike of the unemployed than
                        of a financial crisis. At the same time it is worthy of note that in certain
                        quarters there is a pretty firm opinion that the failures already recorded
                        will very possibly be followed by others, and it seems evident that the
                        desire should be distinctly manifested to re-establish the system of three
                        months drafts in connection with commercial houses in their dealing with
                        England. It is to be hoped that the | British Banks will in their turn come
                        to the aid of the Egyptian banks in such a manner as to prevent the complete
                        dislocation of Egyptian commercial relations with England, which would be
                        extremely detrimental to the present and future interest of the country.</p>

                    <byline>(From OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT.)</byline>
                    <dateline>Glasgow, July 11.</dateline>
                    <p> Severe thunderstorms broke over the coun| try yesterday afternoon, and a
                        watery sunset did not augur well for the following day. However, the gods
                        proved kinder than was anticipated and the good steamship "Cairo" was
                        successfully launched a few hours ago in | fine weather, although the
                        temperature for the time of year was somewhat below normal..</p>
                    <p>The Countess of Cromer, who had kindly consented to perform the naming
                        ceremony, arrived at the railway station this morning accompanied by her
                        brother-in-law and sister, Sir Hugh and Lady Octavia Shaw-Stewart, where
                        they were met by the Chairman and Directors of the Egyptian Mail Steamship
                        Company. Carriages were in waiting and the party at once drove to the
                        Fairfield Ship| building and Engineering Co.'s Works, Govan, where a large
                        and distinguished gathering had already assembled. Amongst others present
                        were Major and Lady Victoria Villiers, Lord Armstrong, H.E. Boghos Pasha
                        Nubar, Mr. and Mrs. G. T. Symons, Mr. and Mrs. Carton de Wiart, Mr. Alfred
                        Curphey, Mr. Arthur Capel, Mr. George Armstrong, Monsieur Cadean, Admiral
                        Sir Digby Morant, Colonel Paget Mosley, Mr. and Mrs. R. R. Bevis, Mr.
                        Alexander Gracie, Mr. A W. Sampson, Mr. and Mrs. F. Formby Back, Mr. George
                        Strachan, | Prof. Bjles, Mr. R. Whitehead, Mr. and Mrs.</p>
                    <p>H. C. Walrond, Monsieur l'Hermite, Captain Wilson-Barker, Mr. F. J. Debenham,
                        Mr. P. C. Burton, Mr. and Mrs. W. C. Donaldson, Mr. and Mrs. Chas.
                        Donaldson, Mr. J. J. Barrie, Mr. C. C. Barrie, Mr. A. F. Donaldson, Mr.
                        Graham Findlay, Mr. J. P. Maclay, Mr. Robert Headrick, Dr. and Mrs. C.
                        Burland, Mr. Frank Collinson (Architect), etc., etc. Everything now being
                        ready for the launch of the second of the new liners, the visitors repaired
                        to the raised dais, which had been erected under the bows of the "Cairo." In
                        the centre of the dais a table had been placed, on which was fixed an
                        electrical arrangement enabling the hydraulic machinery to be put in,
                        motion, and the great liner to be released from her stays. Punctually at one
                        o'clock, the hour fixed for the launching ceremony, Lady Cromer approached
                        the table and, with a blow from a bright steel axe, set in motion the
                        electrical machinery, and at the same time, in a clear voice, naming the
                        huge steel mass in front of her "Cairo", and bidding it "God Speed."
                        Immediately the enormous hull began to glide, and slowly and gracefully took
                        the water in a little under one minute, amid the ringing cheers from all
                        present, the launch being accomplished without the slightest hitch.</p>
                    <p>The Company then repaired to the Model Room in the Fairfield Co's Works,
                        where a most elegant luncheon had been provided by the Directors. The Chair
                        was occupied by Mr. Alexander Gracie, the Managing Director of the Fairfield
                        Company, Lady Cromer being seated on his right. After the toasts of His
                        Majesty the King, The Queen, and the Royal Family, had been proposed by the
                        Chairman, and loyally responded to, Mr. Gracie proposed success to the
                        steamship "Cairo", and prosperity to the Egyptian Mail Steamship Company, to
                        which Lord Armstrong, as Chairman of the Steamship Company, replied. He said
                        it was | a great pleasure to him to express his great satisfaction at seeing
                        the "Cairo", the second of their great Egyptian Liners, so successfully take
                        the water. Everyone must regret the absence of Lord Cromer, who had played
                        so noble a part in the building up of modern Egypt, and the thanks of the
                        Company were due to Lady Cromer for taking part that day in helping to build
                        up the new Egyptian line, which, he felt sure, would be second to none in
                        the Mediterranean, and would be the most rapid and comfortable means of
                        transit between Europe and Egypt. These magnificient steamers had been built
                        with the greatest care, and would not only be the largest and fastest boats
                        in the Mediterranean, but would reduce the voyage by 1. days. Lord Armstrong
                        pointed out the remarkable increase of visitors to Egypt, the numbers having
                        doubled in the last five years, the total in 1906 being 107,000, not
                        including 15,000 more who had disembarked at Suez.</p>
                    <p>His Excellency Boghos Pasha Nubar also retumed thanks on behalf of the
                        Company. Speaking in most excellent English, he said :My Lords, Ladies &amp;
                        Gentlemen.</p>
                    <p>I hope you will allow me to appeal to your kind indulgence as my knowledge
                        of</p>
                    <p>I hope you will allow me to appeal to our kind indulgence, as my knowledge of
                        our language is, unfortunately for me, so mperfect, that I would never have
                        dared co address you in English, if I had not been asked to do so.</p>
                    <p>It is in my capacity as an Egyptian memper of the Company's board that I have
                        he honour of speaking to day. I shall, thereore, confine my remarks to
                        bringing out he Egyptian point of view of our underaking.</p>
                    <p>In this connection I would recall a statement made by the late Khedive,
                        Ismail Pasha, many years ago, in a speech which has remained familiar in
                        Egypt. Alluding to che political importance already acquired by Egypt and to
                        the high degree of civilisation co which she had attained, His Highness
                        Cemarked: "My country no longer forms part of Africa, it is now-a-days part
                        of Europe."</p>
                    <p>Thirty years håve nearly past since, and Che country has made constant
                        progress durng this interval, and has greatly developed morally, so that to
                        day, with even greater accuracy and truth, one can say that Egypt is no
                        longer part of Africa, but part of Europe.</p>
                    <p>But, if this statement may be considered as exact, when you take into account
                        the <cb n="4"/> progress made by our rich and fertile country, all those,
                        who, like me, have to make the journey .yearly, must confess that the above
                        statements must be taken figuratively, and that too prolonged crossings by
                        sea separate is still from that Europe to which we have the legitimate
                        ambition to belong.</p>
                    <p>It is in order to obviate this and to shorten materially the duration of the
                        crossing, that The Egyptian Mail Steamship Coy. has been founded.</p>
                    <p>Now that our two immense steamers are afloat, it only remains to express the
                        hope that they will answer the reasonable demands of the pnblic by giving
                        them the rapidity of transit and the comfort.which they are justified in
                        expecting</p>
                    <p>Under such circumstances there can be no doubt as to the success of our
                        Company, which will bring Europe into more rapid communica|tion with such a
                        rich and a prosperous country as Egypt.</p>
                    <p>People who are not acquainted with the real situation of Egypt may, perhaps,
                        be astonished at hearing me allude to the prosper|ity of Egypt at the very
                        moment when she is passing though a financial crisis, but, I think, the trne
                        nature of the crisis is imperfectly understood in Europe, and as I have been
                        asked to give my views on the subject, I will do it in a few words. In my
                        opinion, it is solely due to the reckless speculation on the shares of the
                        too numerous companies, which have been promoted lately and launched with
                        disregard of common prudence and without | adequate necessity, and also to
                        speculation on | the building land in the towns, the prices of which have
                        been forced up to exaggerated values. A reaction was inevitable and took
                        place, as might have been expected, suddenly.</p>
                    <p>But it would be a mistake to think that the crisis affects the whole country,
                        and, I am glad to say, it has not, in any way, affected the chief source of
                        the wealth of Egypt, which consists of the cultivable land, whose marvellous
                        fertility is displayed in the production of all crops and especially of
                        cotton. You find the best illustration of this in the fact that the prices
                        of cultivable land are not only maintained, but have attained higher values
                        than they ever reached before.</p>
                    <p>To revert to our ship and to the future for our enterprise, allow me to add,
                        that the presence of the Countess of Cromer, as sponsor of the "Cairo" is a
                        happy angury for success. Her name is too well known to require any eulogy
                        on my part, save to express the hope, that her eminent and distinguished
                        husband, whose absence I personally regret, shall shortly be restored to
                        health and will resume the | active career, in which he has done so much |
                        for his country and for Egypt.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion I would express the wish, that Lord and Lady Cromer will soon
                        take a passage by the "Cairo" and pay us a long visit in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Admiral Sir Digby Moran then proposed the health of Lady Cromer, and voiced
                        the feelings of the Company present when sincerely regretting the absence of
                        Lord Cromer, and the serious indisposition which had compelled him to
                        refrain from taking part in any public | functions for the present.</p>
                    <p>Sir Hugh Stewart, Lady Cromer's brother in-law, returned thanks for her
                        ladyship, and after the success of the Fairfield Co. had been proposed in
                        felicitous terms by Major Villiers and replied to by Colonel Mosley, the
                        guests separated. | Before leaving the luncheon room Admiral</p>
                    <p>Sir Digby Morant presented Lady Cromer with a beautiful silvered axe, the
                        blade of which had been forged from a piece of the steel of which the
                        "Cairo" had been built. This axe, with which the ceremony of launching had
                        been performed, was inounted on a beautiful ivory handle with gold setting,
                        and wil for ever remain as an interesting memento of the kind offices which
                        she had undertaken to-day in naming the S.S. "Cairo.'</p>
                    <p>Several of the guests afterwards paid a visit to the "Heliopolis" which is
                        fast approaching completion, and which it is hoped will be ready to commence
                        running in November next.</p>

                    <p>Mr. W. Redmond asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in the House
                        of Commons on Tuesday week how many of the Denishwai prisoners had been
                        released.</p>
                    <p>Sir E. Grey (Foreign Secretary): The sen tences of imprisonment originally
                        passed or two of the prisoners have now expired. I under stand that a
                        petition to the Khedive praying for the release of the prisoners is being
                        cir culated for signature in Egypt by the Nation alist paper "El Lewa." I

                    <head>ALEXANDRIA'S NEW THEATRE.</head>
                    <p>YESTERDAY'S INAUGURATION.</p>
                    <p>The inaug ration of the New Alhambra theatre, which took place last night,
                        was an immense success, and both the management of the theatre and the
                        Lombardo troupe, to whom the inauguration was entrusted, must be greatly
                        pleased with the evening's results. We can only bestow unstinted praise upon
                        Mr. Conegliano, who has provided Alexandria with a theatre constructed on
                        modern lines, and equipped with all the accessories to which one is
                        accustomed in the theatrical centres of Europe. The seating capacity of the
                        theatre is 1,500, and every precaution has been taken for the safe exit of a
                        crowded house in case of fire. Both sides of the theatre contain half a
                        dozen or more doors, and the only criticism we would pass in this respect is
                        upon the main entrance, the doors of which open inwards instead of outwards.
                        The stage is also provided with a water curtain which, should a fire occur,
                        would be let down immediately and would automatically flood the anditorium.
                        The theatre is also artistically decorated and equipped generally, the floor
                        slopes so that a good view of the stage is obtained from every seat, and the
                        boxes, which number 56 in all, are spacious and airy. | For last night's
                        performance of the "Geisha"</p>
                    <p>the house was almost filled, at least 1,200 people being present, and the
                        company was heartily applauded at every pause. We refrain from commenting
                        upon the performance as, doubtless owing to it being a "first night" and a
                        strange stage, many faults were to be found, and the company was obviously
                        not at its best. Mr. E Urbano, however, deserves special mention. This year,
                        as last year, he is the life and soul of the company, and has proved himself
                        to be a born actor. The play was admirably staged and every thing went off
                        without a hitch, but great improvement is necessary in the limelight, which
                        sheds a minimum of light on the stage and a maximum of light on the upper
                        boxes and roof of the theatre. The orchestra, under the bâton of Mr.
                        Domenico Lombardo, is exceptionally excellent, but at times drowned the |
                        voices of the singers.</p>

                    <head>FARID BEY IN PARIS.</head>
                    <p>A REMARKABLE INTERVIEW</p>
                    <p>Kamel's aide-de-camp, Farid Bey, who is now in Paris, has been giving his
                        opinions to the "Eclair." After criticising Lord Cromer's policy and
                        declaring that his successor had been instructed to win over the Egyptians,
                        the Bey said that the best meang to attain such an end would be the pardon
                        of the Denishwai "victims." But he argued that the national party - would
                        not be content with trilling reforms "more illusory i than useal." Its chief
                        requirements were epmpulsory and free prima ary instruction in Arabios the
                        English for the French language, or both being added to the course,
                        gratuitons education in at least thirty per cent of the secondary schools,
                        and the restoration of the 'Egyptian mission in Europe," which used to send
                        quite torty, pupils yearly to England, France, and Germany.</p>
                    <p>Asked for his opinion of the financial crisis, Farid Bey answered that it was
                        only superficial, and that landowners were scarsely affected by it. - It was
                        the shares of the many companies with which the Egyptian market was
                        literally inundated which had suffered. Farid Bey, indeed, calmly declared
                        that the general idea was that the crisis, such as it was, had been caused
                        by the English bankers at Lord Cromer's instigation to prove that this panic
                        had been occasioned by his departure. But the Egyptiar. bankers had combined
                        to resist the downward movement and to 'avert a crash. "The market is
                        beginning to recover, and it is hoped that this crisis will pass off without
                        making any victims," Farid Bey added, concluding with the gratuitous remark
                        that the English Press had been trying to discredit the Egyptians in the
                        estimation of European capihalists.</p>

                        marché a montré ce matin, comme tous ces jours passés, une tendance
                        persistante à la faiblesse. Les débâcles d'importantes mai sons du Caire ont
                        produit un accroissement de la gêne monétaire qui s'est transformée pour la
                        corbeille des valeurs en une augmentation des offres de vente. Malgré
                        cependant la bonne volonté des vendeurs, ceux-ci ne trouvent plus de
                        contre-partie pour la plupart des titres cotés. Sont seuls négociés, ou peu
                        près, les valeurs de tout repos, telles que l'Obligation Crédit Foncier, et
                        quelques autres. </p>
                    <p>C'est ce qui explique l'état stationnaire du plus grand nombre des titres et
                        la baisse de ceux précisément qui devraient offrir le plus de résistance. On
                        ne sait pas encore où ce mou vement de recul s'arrêtera. </p>

                        réellement nouvean. Toutes les difficultés avec lesquelles la finance et le
                        commerce se trouvent actuellement aux prises sont, en effet, les suites
                        naturelles d'une situation prévue qui a été pleinement escomp tée en Bourse
                        il y à plus d'un mois déjà Ce qui persiste malheureusement, c'est la disette
                        monétaire. Aussi bien les offres continuent à se produire dans la majeure
                        partie des groupes, spécialement sur les meilleurs titres Ces offres ne sont
                        point justifiées ; elles s'expliquent par des besoins d'argent immédiats
                        plutôt que par le manque de confiance en l'avenir. </p>

                    <p>" La situation monétaire n'a pas éprouvé des modifications importantes. Le
                        taux de l'escompte sur le marché libre a haussé aujour d'hui de <hi

                        le faire descendre de son niveau actuel de 4 %. Il est vraisemblable, en
                        effet, que, sans parler d'autres sorties, il y aura de grosses sommes &amp;

                    <p>" The Economist " est optimiste. Cet im portant organe financier dit que le
                        numéraire mis en circulation dans l'intérieur ces temps derniers ne tardera
                        pas à rentrer à la Banque d'Angleterre et que la situation monétaire promet
                        de s'améliorer rapidement." </p>
                    <p>Le dernier numéro de la Cote hebdomadaire Le Grelle et Cie (Anvers, Bruxelles
                        et Paris) publie un long article fort intéressant sur la crise financière en
                        Egypte. Nous extrayons de cette étude remarquable basée sur des chiffres,
                        les passages suivants : </p>
                    <p>" Le remarquable développement de l'E gypte, dû aux effets constants d'une
                        adminis tration sage et intelligente, risque-t-il d'être entravé par le fait
                        d'une spéculation exagérée, cause principale de la situation critique ac
                        tuelle ? Les capitaux européens doivent-ils désormais considérer les
                        entreprises égyptien nes comme speculativés, aléatoires et dange reuses ?
                        Pour répondre à ces questions il faut étudier la situation économique du
                        pays, ses ressources et aussi les causes de la crise ac tuelle. </p>
                    <p>" Lord Cromer, dans son rapport pour l'an née 1905, terminait par cette
                        conclusion une étude consacrée aux conditions économiques du pays : "
                        L'examen le plus attentif que je " pnisse faire à ce sujet mène à la
                        conclusion " qu'encore qu'il soit possible que de temps " en temps un'orage
                        puisse venir secouer les " cours du marché au Caire et à Alexandrie, " et
                        que la culture du coton soit entourée de " quelques risques, dont la
                        plupart, espère-t " on, pourront être écartés par des procédés "
                        perfectionnés d'agriculture, toujours est-il " que la prospérité matérielle
                        de ce pays re " pose sur une base d'exceptionnelle solidité." </p>
                    <p>" Que l'observateur superficiel ne s'imagine pas que la hausse rapide et
                        presque stupé fiante des terrains de culture et aussi de cons traction a été
                        le fait de la seule spéculation ; au contraire, le fond en est solide et
                        dans cette augmentation énorme et rapide de la fortune immobilière il y a
                        autre chose qu'une inflation de prix : il y a l'augmentation constante de la
                        valeur intrinsèque et la progression en quantité et en valeur de la
                        production du sol... </p>
                    <p>... En résumé, le nombre des personnes atteintes par cette crise de
                        croissance est très restreint et la partie de la fortune publique entamée
                        est peu importante. Le remède à apporter à la situation ne réside certes pas
                        dans les mesures restrictives prises dans m moment d'affollement par les
                        comités des Bourses égyptiennes. Le remède, c'est le retom de la confiance
                        du public, confiance que l'on obtiendra par une bonne organisation de la
                        Bourse et plus particulièrement du marché à terme, de façon à empêcher les
                        excès et à permettre à l'acheteur de reporter son papier à des conditions
                        normales et avec toutes les facilités compatibles avec la sécurité des capi
                        taux utilisés pour les reports. L'Egypte porte aussi en elle-même un élément
                        puissant qui viendrait efficacement à l'appui du remède indiqué : la récolte
                        actuelle fera bientôt en trer dans les caisses une somme dépassant
                        700,000,000 de francs, et à ce moment la situation sera déjà améliorée
                        grandement par la force même des choses. Il ne restera plus alors de la
                        crise actuelle que le souvenir d'un moment difficile qui aura peut-être eu
                        d'ail leurs cette henreuse conséquence d'assagir un peu le marché et de
                        prévenir de nouvelles erreurs. Aussi avons-nous confiance dans l'a venir de
                        ce riche pays; la prospérité de l'E gypte, apris les affres passées,
                        reprendra plus brillante que jamais. </p>

                    <p>The Money Market, .</p>
                    <p> The market had no difficulty in repaying the Bank of England the £4,000,000
                        recently borrowed in the shape of loans, and the supply of loanable capital
                        has continued plentiful throughout the week. There was some hardening of the
                        discount market on Wednesday, in consequence of the announcement that a
                        certain small banking firm was in difficulties, and two months' drafts were
                        quoted 31 to 3 per cent. Yesterday the tone was easier, but the higher rates
                        ruling the previous day, were maintained. Three months' bills fetched 38,
                        although a small amount of business was done at 3, 9, 16. There was only a
                        moderate demand for money, and day accomodation was obtained at 2 to 2) per
                        cent. the quotation for a week being 21 per cent. . </p>
                    <p> The return this week shows a further strengthening of the Bank's position,
                        the reserve having risen £732,000 to £24,413,429. The imports from abroad
                        amounted to £736,000, and the movement of £384,000 in coin into circulation
                        was balanced by the reflux of £380,000 in notes. On the week the proportion
                        of reserve to liabilities shows a rise of 58 per cent. to 43 per cent. In
                        the corresponding week last year the reserve stood at £25,413,429, and the
                        proportion at 48.45 per cent. </p>
                    <p>The arrivals of bar gold from the Cape and India amounted to about
                        half-a-million, of which the Bank of England secured the greater part. The
                        quotation for bar gold is now 77/94. Silver.</p>
                    <p>The silver market is steady and quiet. The quotation shows no change at 31
                        1/16. The Stock Markets,</p>
                    <p>The account concluded this week shows a much improved condition of things on
                        the Stock Exchange. True, the amount of business transacted has been by no
                        means heavy, but it is conclusively shown that there has been an appreciable
                        amount of investment buying. which has had the effect of raising the level
                        of prices of the best class of securities. The most important feature of the
                        account has, however, been the elimitation of some of the disturbing
                        elements which have caused so much trouble during the past few weeks. Among
                        these the most important has been the Egyptian trouble, and the account will
                        be memorable in that it has seen the turning point in that crisis. The
                        settlement of the difficulties of the Cassa di Sconto e di Risparmio has
                        been productive of a feeling of greater confidence in all sections of the
                        "house," and with the commencement of a new account it is confidently
                        anticipated that the improvement in both Egyptian and general securities
                        will make considerable progress.</p>
                    <p>The unrest in our Indian dependency is still causing some anxiety, but there
                        is good reason to anticipate that the firm attitude taken up by the British
                        Government will have the effect of repressing the agitation before very
                        long. With regard to the dispute between America and Japan, this gives
                        little cause for anxiety, as the Governments of both countries are too
                        wide-awake to be influenced by the scaremongers.</p>
                    <p>This week members of the Stock Exchange have been largely occupied with the
                        details connected with the settlement, and business has been quiet. The tone
                        has been quite cheerful, however, and prices are in many cases higher. Gilt
                        edged stocks continue heavy, but this appears to be due in the main to the
                        number of new issues now being brought forward. Consols.</p>
                    <p>A feature of the gilt edged market has been the weakness of the Indian
                        issues, which have been affected by the statement of Mr. Morley regarding
                        the disturbed state of the Punjab, and the impending issue of nearly two
                        millions of East India Railway Threeand-a-Half per Cent. stock at 95,
                        bearing a guaranteeofthe Indian Government. Yesterday India Threes dropped
                        to 85, and several other stocks gave way . Consols lost } to 84.). To-day
                        Consols have been former and show advances of } for cash and 1/16 for the
                        account, to 84 3/16 and 841. Indian stocks have again been weak. Foreign
                        Bonds.</p>
                    <p>The irresponsible reports published with regard to the alleged friction
                        between America and Japan affected Japanese issues in the early part of the
                        week, and caused them to be sold rather heavily. There was less nervousness
                        yesterday, however, and the Fives recovered of the previous loss, closing at
                        1014.</p>
                    <p> There has been no change in Japanese to-day. </p>
                    <p>It is stated that the Russian Government have completed arrangements for
                        another large loan, which, it is understood, will be issued on the Continent
                        at an early date. This announcement has had no effect upon the bonds, which
                        have been firm. Yesterday the Fives advanced f to 83, and the Fours 3 to=74.
                        They close to-night without further change. Home Rails,</p>
                    <p> The action of the directors of the Underground lines in increasing their
                        fares has in several cases been attended with very satisfactory results, the
                        Metropolitan for instance reporting an increase in traffics for the past
                        week of £1,000. This result has brought a strong demand for Underground
                        stocks, which have had a substantial rise. Yester| day Metropolitan Consols
                        were up to 48, Metropolitan District to 12}, and City and South London to
                        50. </p>

                    <p>The market for Egyptian shares has been quiet this week, but the tone has
                        been very satisfactory, prices having for the most part maintained the
                        higher levels recently touched. </p>
                    <p>The feature of interest has, of course, been the publication of the Egyptian
                        Estates, which was issued yesterday. After placing £15,000 to credit of
                        special reserve for dividends, a net credit balance of £94,500, or £27,300
                        more than the previous year, is shown, in addition to 5,400 brought forward.
                        The in terim dividend of 5 per cent. actual involved a distribution of
                        £23,300, and the balance of £76,600 is carried to the current account. The
                        £63,700 received as premium on the balance of share capital issued has been
                        added to reserve, less £2,800 expended on the issue of further Debenture and
                        share warrants, so that in two years the reserve has been in creased to
                        £163,000, which is very satisfactory. </p>
                    <p>On the publication of the report prices showed scarcely iny alteration, the
                        general impression being that the showing is good, and that the policy of
                        not declaring a dividend in the present circumstances is a sound one.
                        Consequently it is not anticipated that prices will go any lower. Egyptian

                    <p>THE NEW SCHEME. </p>
                    <p>The question of the new Pension Law is still under study, and no definite
                        decision has been arrived at as the actuarial invest<hi rend="underline"
                            >ig</hi>ation is still proceeding. The compilation of the numerous data
                        necessary for a satisfactory conclusion is a highly complex matter, and it
                        may be some time yet before the Government is in a position to deal in a
                        liberal spirit with the provisions of a new Pension Law. </p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer's remarks on this subject in his last Report deserve
                        reproduction. His Lordship said :- . </p>
                    <p>The arrangements under which pensions are granted to officials retiring from
                        the Egyptian Government service, and to their heirs in case of death, are of
                        a somewhat complicated nature. They have been repeatedly modified owing to
                        financial and other considerations; but on each occasion that a change has
                        been made, the rights secured to existing officials under pre vious
                        arrangements have been left intact, with the result that at the present
                        moment different individuals in the Government service enjoy widely
                        differing privileges in respect to pension. A civil servant may derive his
                        rights from the Pension Law of Said Pasha, promulgated in 1854, from that of
                        Ismail Pasha of 1871, or from that of Tewfik Pasha, the most recent of all,
                        which dates from 1887. Without discussing in detail the respective merits of
                        these Laws, it may be mentioned that the Law of Said Pasha was undoubtedly
                        the most liberal of the three. The Law of Ismail Pasha, although on the
                        whole less liberal in its provisions than that of Tewfik Pasha, offered
                        certain specific advantages which induced many Government officials to elect
                        to remain under it rather than to exercise the option which was given to
                        them, at the time when the Law of Tewfik Pasha was introduced, of being
                        ruled by the latter.Civil servants entered from 1887 onwards come under the
                        Law of Tewfik Pasha, which, in default of further change, will eventually,
                        as the pensions under the older Laws lapse, govern the pensions of the
                        entire staff of civil servants. </p>
                    <p>Experience has, however, shown that the Law of Tewfik Pasha, no less than its
                        pre decessors, calls for modification. Nunierous difficulties and anomalies
                        in its provisions have been brought to light during the twenty years of its
                        operation, and it is probable that nothing short of its complete
                        readjustment on an equitable and scientific basis will suffice to eliminate
                        them. Whether, at the same time that this readjustment is carried out, it
                        will be found possible to make provision for pensions on a more liberal
                        scale is a different question, and one which is attended by no little
                        difficulty. It is connected, on the one hand, with the general question of
                        the improvement of the position of Government officials, and, on the other,
                        with the capacity of the financial resources of the State to meet an
                        increased charge in this respect. A few figures on the subject will bring
                        out the latter point more clearly. The Civil and Military Pen sion List for
                        1907 absorbs L.E. 480,000 out of a total budgetary expenditure of L.E.
                        14,240,000. The sum of L.E. 80,000 is retained out of salaries towards
                        pensions. 'The difference, viz., L.E. 400,000 consti tutes, therefore, the
                        net charge on the State. This amount, as already explained, comprises
                        pensions granted under more liberal conditions than those at presentin
                        force, and is, therefore, subject to diminution as they lapse. It will also
                        be diminished in course of time by the extinction of pensions granted to
                        offi cials of the Daira Sanieh and other defunct Administrations. On the
                        other hand, it has to be borne in mind that a large number of pensions have
                        been commuted of recent years, no less a sum than L.E.527,000 having been
                        expended for this purpose since 1900. More over, the considerable additions
                        that have been made latterly to the ranks of the Go vernment servants will
                        inevitably tend to increase the pension charge in the future. </p>
