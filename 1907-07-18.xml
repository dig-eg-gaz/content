                    <p>Icilma Fluor Cream is the only cream that contains no grease nor oil.
                        Deliciously scented it cleanses the pores of the skin as nothing else can
                        do, makes it pearly white, gives life to the tissues, elasticity to the
                        muscles, and a deliciously cool feeling to the skin.</p>
                    <p>Its unique properties are due to Icilma Natural Water so that it may well be
                        called <hi>Nature’s Skin Food </hi> and the skin requires nothing else to
                        give it the necessary vitality, to preserve it from sunburn, heat, cold or
                        the effects of hard water, to prevent and cure the minor irritations due to
                        overheated blood, and to preserve the youthful fresh look to which hot
                        climates are so fatal.</p>

                        <p>“ Whither have gone the majority of our English championships ? Where are
                            those proofs of prowess which it should be Eng land’s proud boast that
                            she is able to retain I —a boast, alas ! she can no longer with fairness
                            maintain. The cup of bitterness, for those who ever aver that in the
                            world of sport England still stands first, must during the past few
                            weeks have been full to overflowing, the culminating point being arrived
                            at in the week that has just passed, when the foreigners triumphed in
                            nearly everything tor which they competed, ” so bewails the “ Daily
                            Telegraph. " ,</p>
                        <p>“ Briefly, a number of English championships may be located as follows
                            :</p>
                        <p>Golf in France.</p>
                        <p>Tennis in America.</p>
                        <p>Lawn Tennis in Australasia and America. Sculling (professional) in
                            Australia. Rowing in Belgium.</p>
                        <p>Yachting in America and Germany. Pole-jumping in Sweden.</p>
                        <p>Swimming in America and Australia.</p>
                        <p>Thus it is that the pupil has in many instances become more efficient
                            than his master, and England, after imparting her knowledge to those
                            abroad, is hoist with her own petard, and now has to stand quietly by
                            whilst English championships one by one leave their native shores, some
                            for the first time. To the mind at once recurs the question, “Are we
                            deteriorating physically 1 "</p>
                        <p>A writer who signs himself “ Emeritus " frames the following indictment
                            against our youth on the evidence of the last few weeks : “ What is the
                            matter with our young men ? It is a question which is in everyone’s
                            mouth, and which no one seems able to answer. ‘ Slackness,’ as a generic
                            term for nerveless ness, want of tone, absence of ardour, of keenness,
                            of‘go,’ has, I believe, been practically invented by our gilded
                            youth—and they are the best examples of it themselves. What do they do
                            with their time ? They do not study harder than they used to do—that
                            much can assuredly be taken for granted. They have not become more
                            serious, more thoughtful, more sedentary in their occupations. They do
                            not cultivate the simple life. It would be useless to find in them
                            brilliant examples of the Non-conformist eon science, either at its best
                            or its worst They are supposed to be athletic, to have no other thoughts
                            but for outdoor exercise or sport. It they are inclined to vaunt
                            themselves on any-things, it is on the fact that they love an existence
                            in the open air, and can do most thing with ease which involve the use
                            of hands and legs. And the melancholy fact is that not even in their
                            chosen pastimes are they beyond a fair second-class level. They are too
                            slack to take pains. Most things are ‘above.’ Sceptical of things that
                            move the world, sceptical of thought, sceptical of sentiment, sceptical
                            of themselves. They have nof the energy to take in their own darling
                            pursuits, in which, more and more every year, they are being beaten by
                            ‘the foreigner.’</p>
                        <p>The “Pall Mall’’ discusses the same subject under the heading, “Are we
                            Degenerate f’ and says: “On the whole it may well be doubted whether the
                            British athlete, either amateur or professional, is a worse man than his
                            father before him ; and for our part, we see no shame in being fairly
                            beaten by men whom we only despised in the past because we never thought
                            they would put us to the proof. To our mind it is neither very British
                            nor very sportsmanlike to howl over our national degeneracy merely
                            because other nations can hold their own against us in the sports which
                            we ourselves have taught them."</p>

                    <p>Cairo Fires.</p>
                    <p>The fire which broke out at midday on Tuesday last, in Sharia Mohamed Ali
                        near Darb el Nahabli, was extinguished shortly before 4 o'clock owing to the
                        prompt attendance of four fire engines. Fortunately no lives were lost, but
                        several families are now homeless and are dependant ipon the kindness and
                        charity of their neighbours. Over L.E. 4,000 of damage was done to property,
                        which was not covered by insurance. The conflagration is believed to have
                        originated in a carpenter's shop, owing to the overturning of a spirit lamp
                        at which he was heating some glue. The big outbreak in the Sharia Mohamed
                        Aly on Tuesday quite eclipsed the three other smaller outbreaks, the larger
                        of which was that in Khalifa Khatatbah (Citadel Quarter). Four rooms of the
                        ground floor in a native house caught fire in the quarter mentioned owing to
                        fire being communicated from a confectioner's oven. On the arrival of the
                        brigade, immediately after the call, the fire had already'obtained a good
                        hold, but owing to active efforts the Hames were suppressed and all danger
                        averted within three quarters of an hour.</p>

                <p>THE FINANCIAL CRISIS.</p>
                <p>CAIRO'S TROUBLES.</p>
                <p>COTTON INTERESTS UNCONCERNED.</p>
                <p>LONDON, Thursday. The number of firms of repute in Cairo, whose suspension of
                    payment has just been announced here, has aroused fresh interest in the
                    financial crisis at present raging in Egypt I have good grounds for believing
                    that the commercial and financial difficulties that have thereby arisen with
                    Manchester and London are likely to be tided over. It has been decided that the
                    liquidation that will ensue will be conducted privately. The management of these
                    liquidations will be entrusted to a trustee belonging to a well-known firm at
                    Manchester.</p>
                <p>Various estates of the firms concerned have been saved for the creditors. It is
                    understood that the Banks and the trade creditors will act together. General
                    satisfaction is felt at the policy that is to be pursued by the London and
                    Manchester banks, which is considered very sensible.</p>
                <p>The liabilities of the concerns compromised by these failures in no way concern
                    the important cotton interests of Lancashire.</p>
                <p>Regarding the failures reported in our issue of yesterday our Cairo correspondent
                    writes :</p>
                <p>The figures as stated by your contemporaries were not quite exact. As a matter of
                    fact the assets in the case of all the houses involved considerably exceed the
                    liabilities, in some instances as much as much as 150%. It has been very fairly
                    demonstrated that a gradual liquidation is in the interest of all parties, and
                    the principal ground for complaint and the cause of the critical state of
                    affairs is due to shyness of banks in London, Manchester and other quarters,
                    owing to the discredit thrown on the Egyptian market, by the existing state of
                    affairs. From the quarter in which I obtained my information I gathered that
                    there was not any question of insolvability of any of the firms in question, it
                    being to the general interest to obviate this unhappy event. The holding of
                    ready money by the conservative | action of several parties has brought the
                    situation to a head and caused a regrettable situation which might have been
                    avoided, had there not been somewhat of a rush for the realisation of Stocks and
                    Shares, and as already mentioned</p>
                <p>the stoppage of time drafts. The firms in ques. |tion were entirely unprepared
                    for the heavy demand on their resources, brought about by the suppression of
                    London and Manchester credits, and not having ready cash to meet their
                    obligations, and in addition, a large amount of capital outstanding in various
                    directions, they were naturally extremely hardly pressed, and their only
                    recourse was to take the step which has been recorded in the Press. Remarks have
                    been made in a paper, which it is needless to name, in regard to the
                    AngloEgyptian Bank. It has been definitely asserted that the Anglo-Egyptian Bank
                    is not involved to the extent of more than L.E. 20,000, and the reflections made
                    in this connection prove to be imfomded. | It is regrettable to notice that
                    owing to the | present crisis a very large number of employés have been
                    dismissed from their employment, and in many cases without any consideration for
                    having lost their positions without notice. In addition to this there has been a
                    large influx of seekers after employment in this country, and the result is that
                    the labour market is now overcharged, and, as remarked by one of our
                    contemporaries, there is more possibility of a strike of the unemployed than of
                    a financial crisis. At the same time it is worthy of note that in certain
                    quarters there is a pretty firm opinion that the failures already recorded will
                    very possibly be followed by others, and it seems evident that the desire should
                    be distinctly manifested to re-establish the system of three months drafts in
                    connection with commercial houses in their dealing with England. It is to be
                    hoped that the | British Banks will in their turn come to the aid of the
                    Egyptian banks in such a manner as to prevent the complete dislocation of
                    Egyptian commercial relations with England, which would be extremely detrimental
                    to the present and future interest of the country.</p>
                <p>We are informed that the number of unemployed in Alexandria, consisting almost
                    entirely of clerks, is no less thần 540. EI. E.G</p>

                <p>LAUNCH OF THE “CAIRO."</p>
                <p>A FASHIONABLE GATHERING:</p>
                <p>(From OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT.)</p>
                <p>Glasgow, July 11. Severe thunderstorms broke over the coun| try yesterday
                    afternoon, and a watery sunset did not augur well for the following day.
                    However, the gods proved kinder than was anticipated and the good steamship
                    "Cairo" was successfully launched a few hours ago in | fine weather, although
                    the temperature for the time of year was somewhat below normal..</p>
                <p>The Countess of Cromer, who had kindly consented to perform the naming ceremony,
                    arrived at the railway station this morning accompanied by her brother-in-law
                    and sister, Sir Hugh and Lady Octavia Shaw-Stewart, where they were met by the
                    Chairman and Directors of the Egyptian Mail Steamship Company. Carriages were in
                    waiting and the party at once drove to the Fairfield Ship| building and
                    Engineering Co.'s Works, Govan, where a large and distinguished gathering had
                    already assembled. Amongst others present were Major and Lady Victoria Villiers,
                    Lord Armstrong, H.E. Boghos Pasha Nubar, Mr. and Mrs. G. T. Symons, Mr. and Mrs.
                    Carton de Wiart, Mr. Alfred Curphey, Mr. Arthur Capel, Mr. George Armstrong,
                    Monsieur Cadean, Admiral Sir Digby Morant, Colonel Paget Mosley, Mr. and Mrs. R.
                    R. Bevis, Mr. Alexander Gracie, Mr. A W. Sampson, Mr. and Mrs. F. Formby Back,
                    Mr. George Strachan, | Prof. Bjles, Mr. R. Whitehead, Mr. and Mrs.</p>
                <p>H. C. Walrond, Monsieur l'Hermite, Captain Wilson-Barker, Mr. F. J. Debenham, Mr.
                    P. C. Burton, Mr. and Mrs. W. C. Donaldson, Mr. and Mrs. Chas. Donaldson, Mr. J.
                    J. Barrie, Mr. C. C. Barrie, Mr. A. F. Donaldson, Mr. Graham Findlay, Mr. J. P.
                    Maclay, Mr. Robert Headrick, Dr. and Mrs. C. Burland, Mr. Frank Collinson
                    (Architect), etc., etc. Everything now being ready for the launch of the second
                    of the new liners, the visitors repaired to the raised dais, which had been
                    erected under the bows of the "Cairo." In the centre of the dais a table had
                    been placed, on which was fixed an electrical arrangement enabling the hydraulic
                    machinery to be put in, motion, and the great liner to be released from her
                    stays. Punctually at one o'clock, the hour fixed for the launching ceremony,
                    Lady Cromer approached the table and, with a blow from a bright steel axe, set
                    in motion the electrical machinery, and at the same time, in a clear voice,
                    naming the huge steel mass in front of her "Cairo”, and bidding it "God Speed."
                    Immediately the enormous hull began to glide, and slowly and gracefully took the
                    water in a little under one minute, amid the ringing cheers from all present,
                    the launch being accomplished without the slightest hitch.</p>
                <p>The Company then repaired to the Model Room in the Fairfield Co's Works, where a
                    most elegant luncheon had been provided by the Directors. The Chair was occupied
                    by Mr. Alexander Gracie, the Managing Director of the Fairfield Company, Lady
                    Cromer being seated on his right. After the toasts of His Majesty the King, The
                    Queen, and the Royal Family, had been proposed by the Chairman, and loyally
                    responded to, Mr. Gracie proposed success to the steamship “Cairo”, and
                    prosperity to the Egyptian Mail Steamship Company, to which Lord Armstrong, as
                    Chairman of the Steamship Company, replied. He said it was | a great pleasure to
                    him to express his great satisfaction at seeing the “Cairo”, the second of their
                    great Egyptian Liners, so successfully take the water. Everyone must regret the
                    absence of Lord Cromer, who had played so noble a part in the building up of
                    modern Egypt, and the thanks of the Company were due to Lady Cromer for taking
                    part that day in helping to build up the new Egyptian line, which, he felt sure,
                    would be second to none in the Mediterranean, and would be the most rapid and
                    comfortable means of transit between Europe and Egypt. These magnificient
                    steamers had been built with the greatest care, and would not only be the
                    largest and fastest boats in the Mediterranean, but would reduce the voyage by
                    1. days. Lord Armstrong pointed out the remarkable increase of visitors to
                    Egypt, the numbers having doubled in the last five years, the total in 1906
                    being 107,000, not including 15,000 more who had disembarked at Suez.</p>
                <p>His Excellency Boghos Pasha Nubar also retumed thanks on behalf of the Company.
                    Speaking in most excellent English, he said :My Lords, Ladies &amp;
                    Gentlemen.</p>
                <p>I hope you will allow me to appeal to your kind indulgence as my knowledge of</p>
                <p>I hope you will allow me to appeal to our kind indulgence, as my knowledge of our
                    language is, unfortunately for me, so mperfect, that I would never have dared co
                    address you in English, if I had not been asked to do so.</p>
                <p>It is in my capacity as an Egyptian memper of the Company's board that I have he
                    honour of speaking to day. I shall, thereore, confine my remarks to bringing out
                    he Egyptian point of view of our underaking.</p>
                <p>In this connection I would recall a statement made by the late Khedive, Ismail
                    Pasha, many years ago, in a speech which has remained familiar in Egypt.
                    Alluding to che political importance already acquired by Egypt and to the high
                    degree of civilisation co which she had attained, His Highness Cemarked: "My
                    country no longer forms part of Africa, it is now-a-days part of Europe."</p>
                <p>Thirty years håve nearly past since, and Che country has made constant progress
                    durng this interval, and has greatly developed morally, so that to day, with
                    even greater accuracy and truth, one can say that Egypt is no longer part of
                    Africa, but part of Europe.</p>
                <p>But, if this statement may be considered as exact, when you take into account
                    the</p>
                <cb n="4"/>
                <p>progress made by our rich and fertile country, all those, who, like me, have to
                    make the journey .yearly, must confess that the above statements must be taken
                    figuratively, and that too prolonged crossings by sea separate is still from
                    that Europe to which we have the legitimate ambition to belong.</p>
                <p>It is in order to obviate this and to shorten materially the duration of the
                    crossing, that The Egyptian Mail Steamship Coy. has been founded.</p>
                <p>Now that our two immense steamers are afloat, it only remains to express the hope
                    that they will answer the reasonable demands of the pnblic by giving them the
                    rapidity of transit and the comfort.which they are justified in expecting</p>
                <p>Under such circumstances there can be no doubt as to the success of our Company,
                    which will bring Europe into more rapid communica|tion with such a rich and a
                    prosperous country as Egypt.</p>
                <p>People who are not acquainted with the real situation of Egypt may, perhaps, be
                    astonished at hearing me allude to the prosper|ity of Egypt at the very moment
                    when she is passing though a financial crisis, but, I think, the trne nature of
                    the crisis is imperfectly understood in Europe, and as I have been asked to give
                    my views on the subject, I will do it in a few words. In my opinion, it is
                    solely due to the reckless speculation on the shares of the too numerous
                    companies, which have been promoted lately and launched with disregard of common
                    prudence and without | adequate necessity, and also to speculation on | the
                    building land in the towns, the prices of which have been forced up to
                    exaggerated values. A reaction was inevitable and took place, as might have been
                    expected, suddenly.</p>
                <p>But it would be a mistake to think that the crisis affects the whole country,
                    and, I am glad to say, it has not, in any way, affected the chief source of the
                    wealth of Egypt, which consists of the cultivable land, whose marvellous
                    fertility is displayed in the production of all crops and especially of cotton.
                    You find the best illustration of this in the fact that the prices of cultivable
                    land are not only maintained, but have attained higher values than they ever
                    reached before.</p>
                <p>To revert to our ship and to the future for our enterprise, allow me to add, that
                    the presence of the Countess of Cromer, as sponsor of the “Cairo" is a happy
                    angury for success. Her name is too well known to require any eulogy on my part,
                    save to express the hope, that her eminent and distinguished husband, whose
                    absence I personally regret, shall shortly be restored to health and will resume
                    the | active career, in which he has done so much | for his country and for
                    Egypt.</p>
                <p>In conclusion I would express the wish, that Lord and Lady Cromer will soon take
                    a passage by the “Cairo” and pay us a long visit in Egypt.</p>
                <p>Admiral Sir Digby Moran then proposed the health of Lady Cromer, and voiced the
                    feelings of the Company present when sincerely regretting the absence of Lord
                    Cromer, and the serious indisposition which had compelled him to refrain from
                    taking part in any public | functions for the present.</p>
                <p>Sir Hugh Stewart, Lady Cromer's brother in-law, returned thanks for her ladyship,
                    and after the success of the Fairfield Co. had been proposed in felicitous terms
                    by Major Villiers and replied to by Colonel Mosley, the guests separated. |
                    Before leaving the luncheon room Admiral</p>
                <p>Sir Digby Morant presented Lady Cromer with a beautiful silvered axe, the blade
                    of which had been forged from a piece of the steel of which the "Cairo" had been
                    built. This axe, with which the ceremony of launching had been performed, was
                    inounted on a beautiful ivory handle with gold setting, and wil for ever remain
                    as an interesting memento of the kind offices which she had undertaken to-day in
                    naming the S.S. "Cairo.'</p>
                <p>Several of the guests afterwards paid a visit to the “Heliopolis” which is fast
                    approaching completion, and which it is hoped will be ready to commence running
                    in November next</p>

                <p>The Earl of Cromer's many friends in Egypt, writes a London correspondent, will
                    regret to learn that his Lordship's health still prohibits him from receiving
                    any but the most intimate friends. Lord and Lady Cromer are going</p>

                    at Ardgowan near Greenock. During the first part of their visit to Scotland they
                    will be the guests of Mr Thomas Baring at Castle Leod, Rossshire, and will spend

                <p>THE DENSHAWI PRISONERS.</p>
                <p>Mr. W. Redmond asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in the House of
                    Commons on Tuesday week how many of the Denishwai prisoners had been
                    released.</p>
                <p>Sir E. Grey (Foreign Secretary): The sen tences of imprisonment originally passed
                    or two of the prisoners have now expired. I under stand that a petition to the
                    Khedive praying for the release of the prisoners is being cir culated for
                    signature in Egypt by the Nation alist paper “El Lewa.” I have no other in
                    formation on the subject. | Mr. Redmond : Does not the right hon gentle man
                    think that the time has come when these sentences might be revised ? | Sir E.
                    Grey : I cannot give any further ans wer at the present moment.</p>
                <p>Mr. Redmond : Then, on the proposed vote | to Lord Cromer I will call attention
                    to thei continued imprisonment.</p>
                <p>Mr. J. M. Robertson (L-Tyneside): Is i not a fact that an important petition has
                    been presented to the Khedive recently with regard to the release of the
                    prisoners ?</p>
                <p>Sir E. Grey : I presume that is the petition to which I referred. My information
                    was tha the paper "El Lewa” was getting up a petition</p>
                <p>THE GRANT TO LORD CROMER. Mr. W. Redmond asked the Prime Minis ter on Thursday if

                <p>event of such a proposal being made in re | ference to Lord Cromer, ample notice
                    woul be given before any resolution was made i the House.</p>
                <p>Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman : Yes, ther | have been cases varying in amount. accord
                    ing to the circumstances. With regard to the second part of the question, ample
                    no | tice in such an event will, no doubt, b given.</p>

                <p>Mr. Redmond : Can the right hon, gen | tleman refer me to the precedents which h
                    says there are ? . Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman : I. can giv one important
                    precedent, which is reall analogous in every respect. I will commu nicate with
                    the hon. member the date an circumstances. · DEFENOE OF NATIONAL PRISONERS</p>
                <p>Mr. McNeill has asked Sir E. Grey whe ther he is aware that members of the Ba
                    practising before the Native Courts in Egyr are compelled to defend prisoners
                    gratuit ously, and whether, upon failure to appear fo | the defence after
                    selection by the Court, fine of £50 may be inflicted upon them.</p>
                <p>Sir Edward Grey has replied that he is no aware of the system which obtains in
                    regar to the point; but he does not see that h can advantageously interfere in a
                    matte which concerns the Egyptian Government.</p>
                <p>ALEXANDRIA'S NEW THEATRE.</p>
                <p>YESTERDAY'S INAUGURATION.</p>
                <p>The inaug ration of the New Alhambra theatre, which took place last night, was an
                    immense success, and both the management of the theatre and the Lombardo troupe,
                    to whom the inauguration was entrusted, must be greatly pleased with the
                    evening's results. We can only bestow unstinted praise upon Mr. Conegliano, who
                    has provided Alexandria with a theatre constructed on modern lines, and equipped
                    with all the accessories to which one is accustomed in the theatrical centres of
                    Europe. The seating capacity of the theatre is 1,500, and every precaution has
                    been taken for the safe exit of a crowded house in case of fire. Both sides of
                    the theatre contain half a dozen or more doors, and the only criticism we would
                    pass in this respect is upon the main entrance, the doors of which open inwards
                    instead of outwards. The stage is also provided with a water curtain which,
                    should a fire occur, would be let down immediately and would automatically flood
                    the anditorium. The theatre is also artistically decorated and equipped
                    generally, the floor slopes so that a good view of the stage is obtained from
                    every seat, and the boxes, which number 56 in all, are spacious and airy. | For
                    last night's performance of the “Geisha"</p>
                <p>the house was almost filled, at least 1,200 people being present, and the company
                    was heartily applauded at every pause. We refrain from commenting upon the
                    performance as, doubtless owing to it being a "first night" and a strange stage,
                    many faults were to be found, and the company was obviously not at its best. Mr.
                    E Urbano, however, deserves special mention. This year, as last year, he is the
                    life and soul of the company, and has proved himself to be a born actor. The
                    play was admirably staged and every thing went off without a hitch, but great
                    improvement is necessary in the limelight, which sheds a minimum of light on the
                    stage and a maximum of light on the upper boxes and roof of the theatre. The
                    orchestra, under the bâton of Mr. Domenico Lombardo, is exceptionally excellent,
                    but at times drowned the | voices of the singers.</p>

                <p>FARID BEY IN PARIS.</p>
                <p>A REMARKABLE INTERVIEW</p>
                <p>Kamel's aide-de-camp, Farid Bey, who is now in Paris, has been giving his
                    opinions to the "Eclair.” After criticising Lord Cromer's policy and declaring
                    that his successor had been instructed to win over the Egyptians, the Bey said
                    that the best meang to attain such an end would be the pardon of the Denishwai
                    "victims.” But he argued that the national party - would not be content with
                    trilling reforms "more illusory i than useal." Its chief requirements were
                    epmpulsory and free prima ary instruction in Arabios the English for the French
                    language, or both being added to the course, gratuitons education in at least
                    thirty per cent of the secondary schools, and the restoration of the 'Egyptian
                    mission in Europe,” which used to send quite torty, pupils yearly to England,
                    France, and Germany.</p>
                <p>Asked for his opinion of the financial crisis, Farid Bey answered that it was
                    only superficial, and that landowners were scarsely affected by it. - It was the
                    shares of the many companies with which the Egyptian market was literally
                    inundated which had suffered. Farid Bey, indeed, calmly declared that the
                    general idea was that the crisis, such as it was, had been caused by the English
                    bankers at Lord Cromer's instigation to prove that this panic had been
                    occasioned by his departure. But the Egyptiar. bankers had combined to resist
                    the downward movement and to 'avert a crash. "The market is beginning to
                    recover, and it is hoped that this crisis will pass off without making any
                    victims," Farid Bey added, concluding with the gratuitous remark that the
                    English Press had been trying to discredit the Egyptians in the estimation of
                    European capihalists.</p>

                <p>Comme d'ordinaire tous les lundis, nous avons en, ce matin, un marché flasque,
                    indécis et tant soit peu lourd, dans l'attente du vent qui soufflera cette

                <p>Nous détachons de notre correspondance de Londres, en date du 8 Juillet,
                    l'intéressant passage suivant :</p>
                <p>“ Il s'est produit en fin de semaine, au Stock Exchange, de bonnes demandes en
                    valeurs égyptiennes, . spécialement en National Bank, qui a atteint 20, et en
                    Agricole, qui se maintient ferme à 8. Ces achats ont été faits en grande partie
                    pour le continent et pour l'Ecosse. On commence, décidément, à se rendre un
                    compte plus exact de l'excellence des conditions économiques générales de la
                    vallée du Nil de l'abondante récolte du coton et du haut prix qu'on en tirera,
                    ce qui ramènera l'or en masse dans le pays. Certes, la crise que les marchés do
                    Caire et d'Alexandrie viennent de traverser aura des effets pendant quelques
                    mois encore, ainsi que sa répercussion sur les autres branches de l'activité
                    sociale. Mais c'est pousser le pessimisme à outrance que de prétendre que la
                    contrée est ruinée pour une lon</p>

                <p> gue série d'années </p>
                <p> "Une haute personnalité financière d'ici, dont le nom a été souvent cité ces
                    temps derniers à propos des embarras du marché égyptien, a eu l'occasion de
                    déclarer que l'Egypte est appelée, malgré tout, à donner lieu à des surprises
                    encore plus agréables que celles que nous ont déjà values ses vingt premières
                    années de développement et de prospérité. </p>
                <p> " La conversation portait sur l'avenir des terrains, ainsi que des Sociétés qui
                    s'en occupent. L'éminent financier dont il est question a bien reconnu que la
                    spéculation avait imprimé, en dernier lieu, à la plus-value un essor
                    imprudemment rapide ; mais il s'est élevé, avec raison, contre l'opinion suivant
                    laquelle le prix du terrain en général serait appelé à suivre à l'avenir une
                    marche décroissante. “ On perd de vue, a-t-il fait remarquer en dernier ressort,
                    que la population de l’Egypte est composée, pour plus de neuf dixièmes, d'in|
                    digènes dont beaucoup s'enrichissent à vue </p>
                <p>d'ail et placent leurs disponibilités uniquement en terrains, en terrains de
                    culture aussi bien qu'en terrains de construction. L'avenir des Sociétés
                    foncières et immobilières en Egypte n'est donc pas aussi compromis qu'on se
                    plaît à le prétendre.”</p>

                    <p>THE TYRANNY OF LONDON.</p>
                    <p>"People who write from London about London for the provinces very frequently
                        speak of 'London opinion,' saying that the 'London opinion' on such-and-such
                        is so-and-so; but they rarely state in what way they get ‘London opinion,'”
                        says the "Edinburgh Evening News,"</p>
                    <p>"An entertaining and suggestive article on 'The Tyranny of London' is
                        contributed to the "Referee” by Mr. Sydney Brooks, a jonrnalist from
                        America...... He remarks that London is not only the biggest capital in the
                        world, bnt the most comprehensive. 'London,' writes Mr. Brooks, 'not only
                        dominates England, but overpowers it-in a measure devitalises it.' He adds
                        that no other capital, with the doubtfal exception of Paris, absorbs so much
                        of the national life around it. Berlin is not to Germany, Rome is not to
                        Italy, Vienna is not to Austria, still less is Madrid to Spain, all that
                        London is to England-by which, presumably, Mr. Brooks means Great
                        Britain.</p>
                    <p>"While admitting the extent to which London dominates the rest of the land,
                        Mr. Brooks says that there is one sphere beyond the influence of its
                        absorbent magnetism, the sphere of politics. 'Except,' he writes; ‘at brief
                        moments of intense national excitement, London has never had the same
                        political power as Paris. For one thing, provincial and local life and
                        government are far too highly developed among us to permit of the
                        centralised ascendancy of anyone city. For another, London is altogether too
                        languid, too social, and too sociable to be a keen politician. There is no
                        city in which it is so hard to start a 'movement.' Its political opinions
                        nine times out of ten are the opinions of clubland and the West End,</p>
                    <p>“No doubt there is much truth in this—and the great political movements of
                        recent years did not have their origin here. At the same time innumerable
                        movements have begun here, as Mr. Brooks may be willing to admit. Take such
                        movements as Æstheticism, Anti-Vaccination, Votes for Women,
                        Bernard-Shawism, Rodinism, Archeritis, the Society of Twelve, and Tubes-all
                        these things had their birth in London, and of some of them London is very
                        proud indeed. ... Mr. Brooks proceeds that the city is at once too big and
                        too much de. pendent on society to have either the concentration or the
                        energy necessary for political leadership, adding that even to its own
                        affairs it is magnificently indifferent. 'It has no civic consciousness' he
                        says, for sense of a corporate life or local pride'. ...</p>
                    <p>"Mr. Brook expresses wonder as to whether or not it is a good thing for a
                        country to be ruled by so overwhelming a capital as we. possess in London.
                        He wants to know if the domination of a Paris or a London is a real or only
                        a seeming advantage. He asks :</p>
                    <p>Does a nation fare better or worse when it escapes the toll which such huge
                        agglomerations exact on the social health, the intellectual alertness, and
                        the politicat virility of the people? : . . Washington is a capital by
                        prenatal malice aforethought; it was to be the capital that it was called
                        into existence. And within the last year or two history has repeated itself
                        in the Antipodes with curious carefulness. The same fears and jealousies
                        that moved Americans over a century ago to fix the seat of the Federal
                        Government on a stretch of marshy woodland, far away from the real life of
                        the nation, have all been stirring the Australian democracy; and the
                        rivalries of the States, and especially of the big cities like Melbourne and
                        Sydney, have finally cast the Australian capital of the future into the
                        outer solitudes.</p>
                    <p>"Having so delivered himself, Mr. Brooks has a statement that will not easily
                        pass muster without range of Bow Bells, which is that the talents of the
                        kingdom are so concentrated on London that England (meaning Britain, no
                        doubt, Mr. Brooks ?) as a whole is left comparatively depleted and
                        stagnant.'”</p>

                        about the mew Governor of the Lebanon:</p>
                    <p>We have much pleasure in announcing that H.E. Youssouf Bey Coussa. “Chef de
                        Cabinet" of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, has been named Governor of the
                        Lebanon in succession to the late Marshal Muzzafer Pasha. His Excellency has
                        at the same time been promoted to the rank of Vizier which bears with it the
                        title of Pasha.</p>

                    <p>Youssouf Pasha Franco is the son of the late Franco Pasha, who was also at
                        one time Governor of the Lebanon. He was born in Constantinople in 1856 and
                        entered the service of the Imperial Government at the age of 17. He was
                        first attached to the secretariat of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and
                        obtained rapid promotion in that Department. In 1900 he was named “Chef de
                        Cabinet” of the Minister. He acted as secretary to the Ottoman Delegation at
                        the first Peace Conference. | Youssouf Pasha Franco has throughout | his

                    <p>EXHIBITION AT KING'S COLLEGE.</p>
                    <p>The exhibition of the results of the season's work by the Egypt Exploration
                        Fund, which opened last week at King's College, is one of more than usual
                        interest. It represents the finish of one of the greatest works of archæolo
                        gical exploration ever undertaken by an English society. More than fourteen
                        years ago the fund commenced its work of clearing the great temple on the
                        face of the cliffs at Deir el Bahari, near Thebes. This immense edifice, |
                        built by the great Queen Hatshepsu, was one of the wonders of Egypt,
                        differing in style from all other temples, and, especially from the |
                        temples of Thebes. The work entailed not merely the exploration of the
                        temple, but also, as far as possible, a restoration of the edifice by
                        restoring the fallen or broken pieces to their positions, and the removal of
                        Coptic and other buildings which had been built within the temple.</p>
                    <p>All visitors to Egypt are familiar with this beautiful edifice, rising as it
                        does terrace above terrace from the plain to the face of the cliff. The
                        festival hall, the curious birth chamber, the corridor with sculptures
                        representing the naval expedition to the incense land of Persil, now called
                        Somaliland, have all been cleared and restored as far as possible. This work
                        occupied about ten years, and was carried out by Professor Neville, assisted
                        by Mr. Howard Carter. The large temple belonged to the eighteenth dynasty,
                        B.C. 1800. In clearing away the apparent rubbish heaps on the south side of
                        the enclosure, an astonishing find was made of a beautiful funeral temple of
                        Mentuhetys, of the eleventh dynasty. Four Seasons have been devoted to the
                        exploration of this beautiful temple, and the work is now complete, having
                        occupied about fourteen years at an average expenditure of about £1,000 a
                        year. It is from this temple that the objects now exhibited come.</p>
                    <p>THE TOMB OF THE KING. The whole of the edifice was grouped round a central
                        pyramid which marked the tomb of the King. The chief object of this year's
                        work was to find this tomb. After much labour a sloping passage, 600ft.
                        long, was found under the platform, but it was impossible to enter the
                        chamber this way as the huge blocks of sandstone forming the roof had
                        fallen. It was then resolved to dig a side passage into the tomb chamber,
                        and at last entrance was obtained. But tomb robbers had been there before.
                        There are here exhibited many objects of interest-funeral boats, little
                        models of groups of servants, bows, arrows, and staffs of office, which had
                        been in many cases stripped. of their gold plating. One very fine boat with
                        a double line of oars is exhibited. In the centre of the tomb was a great
                        shrine, over 12ft. high and 10ft. wide, constructed of translucent
                        alabaster, but it was too heavy to move.</p>
                    <p>By far the most attractive portion of this exhibition will be the beautiful
                        painted sculptures in a style peculiar to the period, and probably the work
                        of Mertisen, who was the Court artist and sculptor of that day, The
                        portraits of the King and his queens, especially the Queen Aashait, exhited
                        on Table B, have a delicacy of workmanship that is most astonishing. The
                        coloured hieroglyphics are really miniature works of art. The procession of
                        princesses is a beautiful piece of drawing. Especially t be noticed are the
                        painted scenes</p>
                    <p>from the Chapel of the Princess Kemsit, pro- bably a negress. This work of
                        art and the mummy of the lady will be fouud later in the British Museum.
                        Students of art should notice the hunting scenes and the fine drawing of
                        birds. There is only one warlike scene, and that appears to represent a war
                        against the people of Sinai.</p>
                    <p>THE SMALLER EXHIBITS. In the clearing up many sinall objects of great
                        interest were found, such as workmen's tools, hammers, nails, chisels, and
                        paint brushes. The display of the beautiful blue glazed ware, used
                        especially as votive offerings to Hathor, the goddess of the turquoise land,
                        is very fine. The textile work is also good, including painted pieces of
                        linen with figures of a whole family, and especially rare are the pieces of
                        linen with beads interwoven, not sewn on. Mention of some curious pilgrim
                        "ex votos" must be made. These are tracings 1 of men's sandals, with their
                        names scratched l in the middle. If the exhibition is somewhat mixed, it
                        represents the completion of a great work. Next season the fund will
                        undertake Tavtensive work at Abydos. En</p>
