                            <p>The Bishop of Llandaff is dead. (Reuter.)</p>
                            <p>The Right Rev. Richard Lewis, D.D., Bishop of Llandatf, born in 1821,
                                was educated at Worcester College, Oxford (B.A., 1843; M.A., 1846).
                                He was instituted to the rectory of Lampeter-Velfry, Narberth,
                                Pembrokeshire, in 1851, and was appointed Archdeacon of St. David's
                                in 1875. In 1883 he was appointed Bishop of Llandaff in succession
                                to Dr. Ollivant, and was consecrated to that Bee by the Archbishop
                                of Canterbury in St. Paul's Cathedral, on April 25 of that year.</p>

                    <head>THE MAHMAL THEFT.</head>
                    <p>OFFICIAL VERSION.</p>
                    <p>I regard to the theft from the Mahmal's escort, we may state that the
                        allegation in to-day's issue of a Cairo morning newspaper, that the case
                        containing L.E. 8,000 in gold had after all been left in the Finance
                        Ministry at Cairo, is quite untrue.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the theft, the following is the official version of the
                        facts:</p>
                    <p>The money sent with the Mahmal was packed in twenty-two cases, three of which
                        contained gold, the remainder silver coin. The packets were duly numbered
                        and sealed at the Finance Ministry, and handed to over the "saraaf' of the
                        Mahmal caravan, who counted them, found them correct, and gave the receipt
                        for them. They were then taken down to Abbassieh under guard, and put in a
                        waggon belonging to the baggage train of the Mahmal, which started overnight
                        for Suez. In a carriage next to the waggon containing the money travelled an
                        escort of two officers and 6 men. The waggon had been duly locked and
                        sealed, as soon as the money had been placed in it at Abbas-sieh, and at
                        each station at which the train stopped the escort got down and formed up on
                        each side of it. On reaching Genife station, just before Suez, the escort
                        found one of the seals broken, and investigation at Suez revealed the fact
                        that a case containing L.E. 8,000 in gold had disappeared.</p>
                    <p>How the money was removed from the train is a mystery. There was no
                        foot-board, by which an agile thief could have reached the waggon while in
                        motion, and the weight of the case being over 50 okes appears to preclude
                        the possibility of only one thief having been concerned. It is also
                        remarkable that the thieves were able to select one of the three cases
                        containing gold. Of course, this may be a case of fortune having favored the
                        enterprise.</p>
                    <p>Investigations are being made by the police and the Parquet into the matter,
                        and we hear that Morice Bey is actively engaged on the spot. The whole case
                        presents very extraordinary features, and the theft appears to bo the work
                        of at least two very ingenious criminals.</p>

                    <p>The Church Council have issued an abstract of the accounts of the English
                        Church at Tantah since the beginning of the movement there to 31st December,
                        1904. The local fund shows a credit balance of a little over £8, and the
                        S.P.G.. fund of something like £16. The council, however, make an appeal for
                        sub scriptions in aid of the local fund. The objects of the latter are (l)
                        to cover the rent of Church House. (This the local com-munity in Tantah will
                        meet, but extra help is asked for the land and building referred to in next
                        item) ; (II) purchase of land on which to build a small Church House, the
                        church to be on ground floor and chaplain's residence above it. Payment of
                        rent will then cease and the whole of the money now going on item No. I will
                        be available for No. Ill ; (III) subscrip-tion to S, P G (Society for the
                        Propagation of the Gospel) to help their grant for chaplain's stipend.</p>
                    <p>What is principally wanted is land on which to build a Church House, and
                        that, we believe, would cost from £120 and £150. Wo shall be glad to receive
                        and acknowledge subscriptions for this deserving objeot, or they may be sent

                    <p>The latest "Pall Mall Gazette" to hand remarks :—</p>
                    <p>The Cairo season this year will present some exceptional features. Next week
                        the Duke of Connaught will put in an appearance, on his way up to Khartoum,
                        and will, doubtless, be reminded of the first time he was there — the day
                        after Tel-el-Kebir. Lord Wolseley, who is cruising in Levantine waters, may
                        not impossibly look in. There is a certain bridge he will hardly cross
                        without reminiscence of the "Good morning" ho gave Hamley there. Hamley
                        thought he had earned something more than that, and Lord Wolseley has learnt
                        since what it feels like when the powers that be do not behave quite well to
                        you.</p>
                    <p>Then, his Grace of Devonshire, and his neighbour at Newmarket, Sir Ernest
                        Cassel, are due to arrive in Egypt in time to welcome the Inspector-General
                        of the Army. Sir Ernest has "been there," before ; his Grace not quite so
                        often. Monte Carlo has been mostly the limit of his search for sunshine. One
                        can imagine him contemplating the Sphinx without any particular appreciation
                        of its reason to be, and the Pyramids from a Whig's point of view of
                        Pharaoh, tempered with a constitutional wonder that any fellow should have
                        taken such a lot of trouble</p>

                        newly built it Abbassieh are to be vacated and made ' over to the Egyptian

                    <head>ALEXANDRIA AND PORT SAID. NOVEL SUGGESTION.</head>
                    <p>A well-known member of the German oolony at Alexandria sends us the following
                        communication:—</p>
                    <p>There are a good many people, and I belong to them, who think that Port Said
                        means a danger to the future of Alexandria. The new ' full gauge railway to
                        Port Said and the various * harbour improvements planned there are so many
                        blows dealt at the further development ' of our city. Alexandrians ought to
                        bestir themselves and devise means bow to meet and possibly obviate the
                        threatening danger. While still in time I venture to throw out an idea in
                        his direction. Why not bring the Suez Capal ' to the doors of Alexandria By
                        straightening, widening and deepening the Mahmoudioh Canal, ' continuing it
                        across the Rosetta and Damietta branches of the Nile, and making it join the
                        Suez Canal somewhere near Ismailia or at the Bitter Lakes, a second waterway
                        for the shipping trade to and from the East could bo created, by which
                        Alexandria ' would bo bene-fitted in the same way as Port Said now is by the
                        Lesseps canal.</p>
                    <p>There ought to be no more technical diffi-mlties concerning the execution of
                        such an undertaking across cultivated country, than there were in the case
                        of the Manchester ship canal or the canal that unites the Baltio and North
                        seas. </p>
                    <p>In case of the existence of a monopoly in favour-of the 8uez Canal it ought
                        not to be forgotten that after some 60 years the present ( Suez Canal
                        becomes the property of the Egyptian State.</p>

                        fait à la Municipalité, se décidaient enfin à remplacer le système actuel

                        resterait pour le senrioe de la ville un excédent de recettes d'au moins

                        pires scandales n'arrivent pas à émouvoir la population.</p>
                    <p>Qu'on an juge. En 1890, la commission d'é-dilité oédait la plaça à la
                        Municipalité en laissant à œlleci un reliquat da 80,000 livrée. Dette somme,
                        au lieu de rentrer dans la eaiats oommuna, fut aooaparée par le comité daa
                        exportateur», soi-disant pour être placée à intérêt ou profit da la ville. H
                        y a quinze ans du cela et avec l'intérêt que rapporte l'argent en Egypte
                        cette somme a pu être plus que doublée dans oe laps de tempe. Ce n'est dono
                        plus 80.000 mais 60,000 livra* sa moins dont le comité des exportateurs a
                        désormais à rendre compte.</p>
                    <p>Va-t-il se décider à restituer cette ou préférera-t-il verser un intérêt
                        proportionné. JL* résistance qu'il a constamment opposée à chaque
                        réclamation qui lui a été adressée à oe propos n'est pas faite pour calmer
                        les inquiétudes : c'eut, eu effet, sur les instanoes réitérées de plusieurs
                        membres de la Commission que le comité des exportateurs fut obligé dan« les
                        commencements de s'inscrira pour 600 livres au budget idnnicipaL Cela
                        continua pendant quelques année*. Plus tard, M. AchiUoponlo, ayant soulevé
                        de nouveau la question des 30.000 livres, se heurta à un mauvais vouloir si
                        manifeste qu'il crut de sa dignité de donner sa démission de conseiller.</p>
                    <p>Le 26 décembre 1908, M. Zouro fait remarquer que l'allocation de LE 600
                        ordinairement payée par le oommeroe d'exportation ne figure pas au budget de
                        1904. Il en demande le motif. Cette allocation devrait, ajoute-t-il, être
                        plus importante, car elle représente lee intérêts de la somme de L.B. 30,000
                        qui restait en caisse lors do la création de la Municipalité. La
                        Municipalité dépense bien plus que le montant de cette allocation pour
                        l'entretien da quartier de Minet-el-Bassal et il est jnate qu'elle profite
                        du produit intégral dee fonds payés par les contribuables pour les travaux
                        d'édilité.</p>
                    <p>On lui répond que, cette année, le oommeroe d'exportation a fiait face à die
                        grosses dépenses pour l'achat d'nne pompe automobile et de tuyaux ainsi qne
                        poor dss réparations A la pompe flottante. Les intérêts et pins ont été
                        consacrés à ces frais ; s'il y a des intérêts disponibles ils seront à la
                        disposition de la Municipalité.</p>
                    <p>N'est-ce pas exquis t On fait remarquer an détenteur illicite d'une somme que
                        s'il ne veut pas la restituer il ait du moins à en servir lee intérêts au
                        créancier et il répond que s'il lui reste quelque chose après avoir fiait
                        ses petites fredaines, U y songera et l'affaire en est restée là.</p>
                    <p>Cette année, le oomité des exportateur* s'est inscrit pour 800 livres, alors
                        que la somme qu'il détient, capitalisée depuis 15 ans, doit représenter un
                        intérêt supérieur à 3,000 livres.</p>
                    <p>Il serait temps, croyons-nous, de s'expliquer. Que le oomité rende oompte de
                        sa gestion et fasse oonnaltre le montant actuel du capital qu'il s'est
                        chargé lui-même d'exploiter. La situation actuelle peut d'autant moins
                        s'éterniser que l'entretien des rues de Minet-el-Bsssal, auquel la dite
                        somme était destinée, est tombée entièrement à la charge de la Municipalité,
                        du jour où MM. les exportateurs s'en sont emparés, ne voulant ni entretenir
                        les rues en question ni affecter à oet entretien les intérêt* du oapital
                        qu'ils détiennent St que les producteurs de ooton avaient destinés à oet
                        ussge.</p>
                    <p>Si oe Messieurs s'obstinent à garder le secret sur leurs bénéfices, fl y a
                        .un moyen bien simple pour la Municipalité de le* contraindre à parler,
                        c'est de cesser d'entretenir les ruos de Minehel-BassoL Comme elles servent
                        à peu près exclusivement au commerce et principalement au oommeroe
                        d'exportetioo, celui-ci devra bien y pourvoir dans son propre intérêt. Et
                        lorsque le comité réolamera à la Municipalité, oe sera au tour de oelle-ci
