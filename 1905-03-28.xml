                    <p>declare the final severance of that ancient and</p>
                    <p>irksome bond, as it would at once raise up the</p>

                    <p>Greece objected to the extension of Bulgaria in</p>
                    <p>the Balkans unless &amp;quot;compensation" were given</p>
                    <p>to her, and at the time the Powers replied that</p>
                    <p>they did not admit that the principle of</p>
                    <p>compensation existed or could be applied in</p>
                    <p>dealing with territorial arrangements in the Neat</p>
                    <p>East. But, however this may be, it is most</p>
                    <p>unlikely that Bulgaria and. Servia— for whom</p>
                    <p>the rivalry of Greece in Macedonia is a pressing</p>
                    <p>reality—would see so great au extension of</p>
                    <p>Greek territory and power without demanding</p>
                    <p>&amp;quot;compensation.&amp;quot; Of course, such compensation</p>
                    <p>could only be given at the expense of Turkey ;</p>
                    <p>but we have yet to learn that the Powers are</p>
                    <p>so convinced of the efficiency of Bulgarian or</p>
                    <p>Servia rule as to be willing to partition Turkey in</p>
                    <p>order to satisfy their ideas of their own dignity.</p>
                    <p>On these grounds it is unlikely that the Towers</p>
                    <p>would consent to a union of Crete with Greece,</p>
                    <p>even though it were the solution desired oy a</p>
                    <p>great majority of the Greek population.</p>
                    <p>If the alternative of preserving the exiting</p>
                    <p>arrangement with Prince George has been</p>

                    <p>Canes, the only solution is to appoint some</p>
                    <p>other person as Governor. It has been</p>
                    <p>suggested that some high official from a neutral</p>
                    <p>country such as Switzerland or Belgium should</p>
                    <p>be appointed to succeed Prince George. We</p>
                    <p>have not the least doubt that many efficient</p>
                    <p>administrators could be found in those</p>
                    <p>countries, but it seems fairly obvious that</p>
                    <p>nobody should be appointed whom not intimate</p>
                    <p>with the peculiarities of the Greek character</p>
                    <p>and with the general conditions of Levantine life</p>
                    <p>and administration, There must be on the</p>
                    <p>Board of Foreign Control in Athens several</p>
                    <p>officials who have this experience and among</p>
                    <p>the financial representatives— past or</p>
                    <p>present—of the Powers in Constantinople there</p>
                    <p>are doubtless many experienced and skillful</p>
                    <p>men. The Consular Service of Great Britain,</p>
                    <p>Trance, and Italy are filled with men who have</p>
                    <p>seen life in the Levant, and, indeed, the</p>
                    <p>difficulty must lie, not in the lack of men, but in</p>
                    <p>the danger of fixing on an officer whose</p>
                    <p>appointment may give rise to international jealousy.</p>

                                the hospital. The whole affair was an elaborate conspiracy on the

                    <head>DEUTSCHER SPORTVEREIN.</head>
                    <p>The annual theatrical performance of the German Sporting Club came off on
                        Saturday night at the Eden Theatre, which had been profusely decorated for
                        the occasion. The curtain rose for the comedy "English Spoken," in which
                        Miss von Tschudi interpreted the runaway young lady exceedingly well, Mr.
                        Sick providing a clever character study of the rich father. Among the minor
                        parts which were held by Messrs. Frey, Quelle, Loucke, and Liudemann, we
                        must specially mention the latter, who greatly amused the audience as
                        interpreter. The next items, "The Siamese Triplets" and the imitation of
                        Fregoli, caused roars of laughter, but the last item, the "Kalam Arabi," was
                        universally considered as the "clou" of the evening. The authors of this
                        farce, Messrs. Lindemann and Mors, are to be congratulated on their
                        excellent rendering of Alexandrian kitchen life and kitchen Arabic. All the
                        parts of the five servants and the lady were held by members of the club,
                        undoubtedly the best being Mr.Cohnitz's Vienna cook, a type ertainly
                        well-known to the numerous ladies present in the audience. Last, but not
                        least, we have to mntion the International Art Convention, where Mr.Binder,
                        our well-known Alexandrian Artist, had exhbited some 30 oil and water-color
                        sketches painted in the most hypermodern and eccentric style. The exhibition
                        room was crowded during the entr'actes and the general appreciation of the
                        objects exhibited is best proved by the fact that al the pictures were sold
                        off before midnight, a result which might make many a member of the Royal
                        Academy feel jealous. Danoing was indulged in until 2am, when a most
                        enjoyable evening was brought to a close. </p>

                    <p>On St Mark's Day, April 25, 1855, Samuel Gobat, D.D., then Bishop of the
                        United Church of England and Ireland in Jerusalem, oonse-crated St. Mark's
                        Church at Alexandria. The church had been founded on August 22, 1838, at a
                        meeting held in the house of Colonel Patrick Campbell (Agent and
                        Consul-General in Egypt 1838-1839), and the foundation stone was laid,by
                        Col. Campbell on December 14, 1839. The first chaplain, the Rev. Edmund
                        Winder, M.A, R.N., was nominated by the Lord Bishop of London on August 10,
                        1840. It is proposed, we understand, to observe the 50th anniversary of the
                        consecration, which falls on April 25 next On the evening of that day an
                        augmented choir will render in the church a sacred cantata entitled "The
                        Holy City," composed by A.R. Gaul, Mus. Bac. Camb., organist of St
                        Augustine's Church, Edgbaston.</p>

                    <head>BISHOP BLYTH'S VISIT.</head>
                    <p>On Saturday last (the festival of the Annunciation) Bishop Blyth celebrated
                        the Holy Communion at St. Mark's Church at 8 a.m., assisted by the Rev. R.
                        F. Rynd, B. A. This festival of the Annunciation was the 18th anniversary of
                        his lordship's consecration as Anglican Bishop in Jerusalem and the East. In
                        the afternoon, at 5.15 o'clock, the Chaplain, assisted by the Rev. R. F.
                        Rynd, administered holy baptism to five adult candidates for confirmation.
                        At 6.15 p.m, there was evensong, the confirmation service, and address by
                        the Bishop. The clergy present were the Chaplain, the two assistant
                        chaplains, and the Rev. F. B. N. Norman-Lee, M.A., senior chaplain to the
                        forces in Egypt. The prayers were taken by the R.F. Rynd, the lessons by the
                        Rev. F.B.N. Norman-Lee, S.C.F., and the preface was read by the chaplain.
                        The Rev. R. Wormell, M.A., acted as the Bishop's chaplain and carried the
                        staff. Twelve candidates were confirmed and a large congregation assembled
                        to witness the administration of the rite. The service was choral, and
                        thoroughly bright and hearty. On Sunday, the Bishop, assisted by the
                        chaplain, celebrated the Holy Communion at 8 a.m. in St. Mark's, and
                        preached at 11 a.m. and in All Saints', Ramleh, in the evening. The
                        collections throughout the day were given to Jerusalem and the East Mission.
                        At St Mark's P.T. 661 and at All Saints' P.T. 819 were the amounts given at
                        the collections. The Bishop, in the course of his sermon, pointed out that
                        of £8,000 raised by Jerusalem and the Eat Mission, nearly £1,000 was spent
                        in Egypt. The needs of Tantah were also brought forward. On Monday, the
                        Bishop paid several visits, including one to Victoria College, where the
                        headmaster, Mr. C.R. Lias, M. A., conducted his lordship, who was
                        accompanied by Canon and Mrs. Ward, through the various classrooms. The
                        Bishop was particularly struck by the bright and happy faces of the boys,
                        and the spirit of friendliness and kindness which everywhere prevailed. At
                        noon Dr. Blyth and the Chaplain proceeded to the Deaconesses' Hospital to
                        administer the rite of Confirmation to a can didate who through illness was
                        unable to be presented on Saturday evening. At 5.45 p.m. the Bishop,
                        attended by the Chaplain, dedicated the marble portrait recently erected in
                        St. Mark's Church in memory of the late Rev. Canon Davis, for 40 years the
                        chaplain of this church. The Bishop left to-day at noon for Cairo. On Friday
                        next his lordship expects to leave Port Said by the Messageries Maritimes
                        steamer for Beyrout. </p>

                    <p>CAPITAL INCREASE AGREED TO.</p>
                    <p>An extraordinary general mooting of the Um Rus Gold Mines of Egypt, Limited,
                        was held on the 20th inst, at the Cannon-street Hotel, London, E. C, for the
                        purpose of proposing the following resolution: "That the capital of the
                        company be increased to 180,000 by the creation of 40,000 new shares of 1
                        each, ranking for dividend and in all other respects part pass with the
                        existing shares of the company.'' Mr. J. Harvey (chairman of the company)
                        presided.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman, in moving the resolution, said: The circular which we sent you
                        a few days ago gives you the reason for our inviting you to attend here
                        today, and the report which accompanied it, and which was not in our hands
                        for more than two days previous to its issue, being the annual report of the
                        mine, will give any shareholder who has taken the trouble to read it full
                        details of the enormous amount of work which has been done at. Um Rus, and
                        must satisfy him that the proposal that we now make is necessary in the
                        interests of the company. With reference so that circular, I should like to
                        say that some share­holders have suggested that a application and somewhat
                        too much ; we have therefore agreed to reduce that to 2a 6d.on application
                        and on allotment, and postpone the last call for a further three months. In
                        1904—in February—the prospects this company was issued, and practically
                        within twelve months we have started crashing. It would be a pertinent
                        question for any shareholder to get up and nay: "Why, with two cells unpaid,
                        do you now ask ns for farther capital I" That question .is easily answered.
                        We have forestalled those calls, and the money lies been used for the
                        erection of machinery. We were enabled to do this through the good offices
                        of the parent company, the Mysore Reefs, who will guarantee 20,000 shares,
                        on condition that they have a call on the shares remaining unalloted for a
                        period at one-eighth premium. My attention has been Called to an article
                        which appeared in a weekly paper last week, upon the Egyptian and Mines.
                        This article was written by their special mining commissioner—a gentleman
                        who does not, as a role, err on the side of optimism, as I think you will
                        all agree. It says : "A very big ores of country, consisting of Upper Egypt
                        and the Northern Sudan, or, rather, such parts of them as lie between the
                        Nile and the Rod Sea, has recently been divided up into Government mining
                        concessions, and is now in process of being explor­ed and prospected. As yet
                        relatively little exploratory work lias been done, and no startling
                        discoveries have been made. It is fair to say, however, that there is
                        evidence already shown of the existence of metals, especially of gold, in a
                        number of places, and there is every reason to justify the spending of a
                        large amount of money in further explora­tion and development I wish this
                        could be done without in the meantime falling back to too great an extent on
                        the Stock Exchange and the gambling mania which radiates there­from. As you
                        there is no reason for "booming" any of the Egyptian or Sudan mine or eon-
                        cessions, and an incipient outburst of gambling bringing the usual losses
                        and reaction in its train, may Dolly prejudice the interests of the held at
                        a later stages, when it will no more in need of working capital than it is
                        just now. I hope there may be no ambiguity aa to my meaning Under this
                        heading! 1 say that the evidences of the existence of gut in Egypt and the
                        Sudan are strong enough to warrant the spending of a lot of money in
                        exploratory work, and there is no reason why several millions should not be
                        laid out in inch work with reasonable hope of getting a return. But T see
                        nothing aa yet to justify big of watered capital being given aa high value
                        on the marker, nor is there reason for the shares of the different concerns,
                        on discoveries to date, being dealt in at any premium. There is no reason
                        why this should tot become in time a successful goldfield, but that
                        much-to-be- desired result will not be brought appreciably nearer by
                        gambling.</p>
                    <p>I am glad to see the commissioner considers that the results already obtained
                        warrant the expenditure of considerable sums on development work, aid I
                        would point out to you that one of the objects of the present increase of
                        capital of this company is enable the deve­lopment work to no pushed ahead
                        with vigor.</p>
                    <p>I do not think any accusation of "watered capital" can be levelled against
                        this company. Our working capital will now be nearly one </p>
                    <p>half of the total capital, and as a justification for the original purchase
                        price I would remind you that nearly £50,000 in hard cash bad already been
                        spent by the vendors. The article proceeds as follows: "A characteristic of
                        the principal mines opened up so far is the narrow ne-s of the reef. 'His
                        value is usually above the average—it is something over it—but the width of
                        the reefs is most disappointing. At the Nile Valley the average width is
                        placed at 2 ft At the Um Rus it is about 1 ft-, and at Urn Nabardi, the must
                        developed mine in the Sudan, 1 judged it as being even less than this. Of
                        this is not conclusive of the roofs in this field is a whole , but it is not
                        a good feature I hat the three mines at present moat advanced in development
                        show such narrowness. You can't do very much with a mine able to run only
                        five or 10 stamps, even if it yields over 1 it. to the ton — that is to say,
                        unless it has a commensurately small capital. You will observe the average
                        value is stated to be something over Iol 1 have before told you that we had
                        reason to hope that our average assay value will be nearly 1 ol : but I want
                        to point out to you that we do not expect to get this return out of the
                        mill, A certain proportion of the gold will be left in the tailings, and we
                        propose shortly to erect a suitable plant for the purpose of extracting
                        this. In the meantime the tailings are, of course, being stored. With regard
                        to die average width of the reef! 1 notice this is* given aa 1 ft. ; but 1
                        hope the commissioner will allow me to point out that, taking the whole of
                        the avenges of the various workings given in Mr. Suelus's report, of which
                        there are 37, the avenge works out at exactly I ft- 7 6/37 in. The remark
                        that you can do much with U) stomps is true, although with our enormous
                        facilities our custs must obviously be much lower than in other parts of
                        Egypt; but undoubtedly we should make much larger profits with, say, 20 thou
                        with 10 stomp?. It is obvious that the profit per ton will increase much
                        more than proportionately with the increase of stamps which we are proposing
                        ultimately to erect. With regard to the length of the pay shute, this has
                        only been proved a distance over 400 ft. With funds for vigorous
                        development, we shall be enabled to extend the various levels for
                        considerable distances under the old workings which are seen on surface.</p>

                    <p>The shares of the Egyptian Options Syndicate, Limited, have gone up 3-16
                        today. That is sig­nificant of the interest which is being manifested
                        latterly in Egyptians, and particularly when anything promising can be
                        picked ap. The Egyptian Options Syndicate have secured options on several
                        properties, which are, apparently, highly thought of, and in this
                        connec­tion it may be mentioned - that Egyptian notables, who should be able
                        to -discriminate, have boon eager to get is. The syndicate has a capital of
                        £50,WO, of which not a penny piece goes to the promoters, the whole of it
                        being available for working purposes. Already there is a prospect of the
                        early flutation of unsubsidiary to work one of the syndicate's properties.
                        The syndicate's shares now stand at 1 1/2. They are being talked op to
                        £4.</p>

                    <p>Yesterday. Major General John R. Slade. C.U , commanding the troops in Egypt,
                        was placed on retired pay under the age rules. Major-General Slade was a
                        very capable and unostentatious officer, who was quite content with knowing
                        that his work was appreciated in the proper quarter. His gallantry at
                        Maiwand in so largely assisting in bringing off the guns hardly received the
                        recognition it deserved. Many an officer got the V.C. for much lets, yet the
                        gallant gunner never made it a grievance. The good wishes of his many
                        friends at home and abroad will follow him and his good lady into private
                        life after his eventful career of 44 yean under the Crown.</p>

                        the Egyptian Army.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant G. IL Martin, 1st Battalion King's Royal Rifle Corps, Egypt, has
                        just been promoted captain. He obtained his first com­mission in October,
                        1893, and was with the 1st Battalion at the opening action of the Boer
                        War—Talana Hill—where the Rifles gave a good account of themselves. Captain
                        Martin was severely wounded and after his convalesces he was employed as
                        military secret­ary to the Governor of Pretoria (medal with two clasps).</p>

                    <p>MINIATURE RIFLE PRACTICE IN</p>
                    <p>HELOUAN.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Aquilina, the enterprising manager of the Tewfik Palace Hotel, has
                        provided a new and interesting amusement for the entertain­ment of his
                        guests. Early in the season a miniature rifle range was ordered from Bag-
                        land, but owing to various delays it boa only recently been put np. Practice
                        com­menced last Saturday under disadvantageous weather. The range is that
                        introduced by the Society of Miniature Rifle Clubs, which has already Joi n
                        so much to make rifle shooting popular in England among classes who have no
                        opportunity of firing at long ranges. It consists of the Ian Hamilton
                        miniature range, which gives opportunity for practice at stationary,
                        disappearing, and moving targets, and there is an ingenious contrivance for
                        renewing the targets and bringing them to the firing points, thereby
                        avoiding the necessity of any one going up to the targets during practice.
                        Winchester magazine rifle 220 bore capable of holding 14 rounds are used.
                        Combined with this range are the Luard dissapearing targets, which give
                        opportunity for practice at moving figures representing cavalry and infantry
                        soldiers.</p>
                    <p>It is proposed to hold a ''Miniature" Rifle Mooting on Thursday, 30th inst,
                        at which visitors from Cairo may attend to compete and inspect this
                        ingenious apparatus. The range is in the paddock of the race-stand of the
                        Helouan Sporting Club, which has taken over the apparatus for Mr. Aquilina.
                        The range is open for all visitors for practice in the forenoon and
                        afternoon daily.</p>
