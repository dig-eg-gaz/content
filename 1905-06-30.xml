<head>REIGN OF TERROR.</head>
<head>300 RIOTERS KILLED</head>
<head>HOSPITALS OVERFLOWING.</head>
<p>London, June 29.
The ”Standard" learns from Odessa that
revolutionary mobs yesterday evening set fire
to the quarantine station, the warehouses and
other buildings of the harbour, and prevented
the firemen from extinguishing the Hemes.
The troops are terrorised by the guns of the
“Potemkin,” which late last night fired a
shell at a Cossack piquet, killing and wound-
ing 24. A torpedo-boat accompanying the
"Potemkin" entered the harbour and seized a
Russian steamer with a cargo of 2,000 tons of
coal.
The Governor has telegraphed to Sevastopol
for the fleet, but it is feared that the mutiny
will spread, as all the crews are disaffected,
and it is even reported that four battleships
have already mutinied, of which two are on
their way to Odessa. Grave anxiety is felt at
Lloyd’s, as there are many British ships in the
harbour.	(Reuter.)</p>

<p>London, June 29.
The latest news from Odessa shows that
serious riots have taken place. Hundreds ol
people have been shot and the port is partially

claimed.	(Reuter.)</p>

<p?Odessa, June 29.
It is confirmed that all the officers of the
“Potemkin” were murdered except three.
The sailors were prominent in yesterday's
street fighting.
A battleship and a cruiser left Sevastopol in
all haste for Odessa. Before burning the ware-
houses the mob carried off the goods. The
loss is estimated at 1,000,000 roubles. The
city is enveloped in smoke. All the shops are
shat and traffic is suspended. The troops hold
the main streets and the hospitals are over-
flowing.
There are not sufficient doctors to attend to
the wounded. Many inhabitants are leaving
the city. In several instances yesterday the
troops, who are mostly reservists, refused to
fire on the mob	(Reuter.)</p>

<p>Gardner-Brown Bioscope and Variety Co.
—This popular combination gave their opening
performance at the Mustapha Garrison Theatre
last night to a house packed to its utmost
capacity, and soured an unqualified success,
the audience showing their appreciation by
repeated calls for encores. Miss Annie Russell,
a dainty young soubrette, opened the show and
pleased every one by her clever rendering of a
couple of songs in lighter vein. Mr. Geo.
Gulliver, who followed, proved an excellent
ventriloquist, and caused roars of laughter with
the funny sayings and antics of his figures,
whioh so pleased the delighted audience that he
was compelled to respond to an encore. Miss
Lottie Walton, who next appeared, possesses a
very sweet and sympathetic voice, and her
rendering of the descriptive ballads was greatly
enjoyed, A series of animated pictures by the
Gardner Brown Bioscope followed ; these were
very clear and steady, snd were enthusiastically
received, especially the scene depicting an
incident at the Battle of the Yale. The Sisters
Romaine were very warmly received, their
singing and dancing, in addition to their youth
and graceful appearance, making them general
favorites. Mr. Leo. Montague, an exceptionally
clever comedian, hugely delighted the audience
with his songs with topical allusions, and had
to respond to an enthusiastic encore. Illustrated
songs by Mrs. Gardner Brown, and a wonderful
bioscopic production entitled The Poachers,”
brought to a conclusion a most bright and
sparkling entertainment during which there
was not a single doll moment The company

<head>RAILWAY COLLISION AT ASSIOUT.</head>
<p>(Prom our Correspondent).
Tahta, Wednesday.
The mail arrived yesterday five hours behind
time. The delay is due, I am informed by a
passenger from Assiout, to the negligence of
the pointsman there. The two up and down
trains that start regularly from Asaiout at 6
o’clock in the morning were maneuvering pre
vious to departure when the two engines col-
lided. The locomotives were not attached to
the carriages of the trains, and the drivers, see-
ing the danger they were in, jumped off and
thus save 1 their lives. The engines met with a
terrific impact and were both derailed, one
falling on the left of the line and the other on
the right. As the drivers had tailed to shut
off steam in their haste to save themselves, the
engines were still in motion and ploughed into
the ground. It was with great difficulty that
the drivers were eventually able to stop the
machinery.
Traffic was thus interrupted and the up and
down passengers had to be transferred from
one train to another until, 10 hours afterwards,
the line was cleared.</p>

At 7 p.m. the Court returned and the pro

<head>TRADE OF EGYPT.</head>
<head>MAY CUSTOMS RETURNS.</head>
<p>The Customs Administration has published
its returns for the month of May. The value
of the imports to the fire ports of Egypt
(Alexandria, Port-Said, Suez, Damietta and
Kosseir) amounts to L.E. 1,533,679, against
LE. 1,451,949 in the corresponding month
of 1904, while the total for the first five months
of the year shows an advance of LE 722,072
on last year’s figures.
The export statistics for the past month
show a certain falling-off, the difference being
LE. 72,840 in favor of May 1904. The same
decrease is to be noticed in the figures for the
period January 1-May 31, 190^, the total
value of the goods exported daring that period
reaching LB. 8,293,341, as against LB.
10,057,661 in the corresponding period last
year.
British imports in May, 1905, amounted to
LE 506,385 and to LB. 2,653,06* for the first
five months of the year, against LB. 504,501
and LE 2,467,478 for the corresponding
periods last year. Exports to Great Britain
amounted to LE 617,439 in May, 1905,
against LE 581,581 in May, 1904, and
the first five months of the present year
show a total of LE. 4,244,697, against LR
4,989,264 in the corresponding period in 1904.
For the past month Turkey comes second to
Groat Britain among the importing countries.
Comparing the export statistics for May
1906, with those for May, 1804. we notice a
decrease in cotton exports representing a sum
of LE 232,674 and a slight (and very natural)
decrease in hides. The most remarkable
increase comes under the beading of rice
and amounts to LB. 87,999. Onion exports
(+86,909) and cane sugar (+40,112) also
show a gratifying increase, not for the past
month only, as in the case of rice, bat for the
five months. Among the imports the largest
increase comes under the beading of floor
(+49,700 for May and +122,789 for the first
five months of the year). Cotton goods and
iron articles also show an increase for the
latter period.</p>

<head>A GREAT CAIRO SCANDAL</head>
<p>We would call the attention of the police
authorities to a grave public scandal that has
been allowed to exist for too long, and which is
a blot to the Capital that should no longer be
tolerated. We allude to the European houses
of ill-fame that are to be seen on all sides at
the very entrance to the city, at the commence-
ment of the Rue Kamel and within a stone's
throw of Cook's office and Shepbeard'a, one of
the most frequented parts of the metropolis.
Some three or four year ago, on the com
plaint of the management of the above hotel
and several of its prominent visitors, a stop
was put to the assembling nightly during the
winter season, on the pavements round about
this loyalty, of numbers of women from the
adjacent houses of bad repute, and it should
not therefore be difficult for the local police to
have the occupants of these houses removed to
a spot where they would not be such a public
scandal</p>

whole of the advance has been maintained,
but today's closing values are @ <8 points

“Ball" manipulation in the 8 merino markets,
based upon the scarcity of good grades, which
hare bean heavily sold for forward deli very, to
continued unsatisfactory reports of the condi-
tion of the Crop, which is aggravated by its
unusual lateness. It is possible that these
