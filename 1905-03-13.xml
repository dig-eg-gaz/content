                    <p>For nearly a fortnight the world at large has watched, with ever-growing
                        interest, the pro­gress of a battle stretched over a frontage estimated to
                        cover ninety miles between it*<cb n="6"/>extremities. At a moderate
                        calculation, three-quarters of a million of armed men must have-been engaged
                        in this titanic struggle, and the fighting necessarily took the character of
                        a number of more or less isolated encounters on a line almost as long as the
                        distance from Alexandria to Benha. But these several engage­ments, have been
                        connected by a common purpose. Marshal Oyama strove to compel the Russians
                        to fall back from Mukden on Tieling for Harbin, and at the same time to cut
                        off some portion of the retiring force by flanking movements. General
                        Kuropatkin, on the other hand, held on tenaciously to his strong
                        entrenchments south of the ancient Manchu capital, occasionally developing
                        some counter-attack at what seemed to present a weak point in the Japanese
                        order of battle. On both sides the troops fought with splendid courage, and
                        it would be difficult to determine between the attack and the defence from
                        that standpoint. The Japanese soldier has distinguished himself throughout
                        the cam­paign by ignoring losses and repulses, how­ever severe; he always
                        "comes again;" and Marshal Oyama, knowing this national trait, does not
                        hesitate to humour it by repeating his efforts to force a way either through
                        the Russian centre or round one of the enemy’s flanks. General Kuropatkin,
                        on the other hand, trusts to the stubbornness of his troops, both
                        individually and collectively, to beat back these attempts at penetration,
                        and it is greatly to the credit of their morale, after such an uninterrupted
                        succession of heavy defeats and the loss of Port Arthur, that their
                        staunchness held out for so long.</p>
                    <p>Now, however, beaten at every point, and finding his position absolutely
                        untenable, Ge­neral Kuropatkin has been obliged to beat a hasty retreat to
                        the North, with the Japanese victors in hot pursuit. The latter are hanging
                        on both flanks of the Russian army and pour­ing shells among the disordered
                        masses, inflict­ing severe loss. The retreat, it is evident, has been
                        extremely trying,and as Reuter reports to­day, all further details increase
                        the extent of the Russian disaster. An official report puts the Russian
                        losses up to Thursday morning at 65,000 men, while Oyama estimates that the
                        number of prisoners exceeds 30,000. A Havas telegram tells us that "judging
                        by the aspect of the retreat the Russians will oppose a further advance of
                        the enemy." This would indicate that Kuropatkin had decided on fighting
                        another of those rear-guard actions at which he is an adept, while falling
                        back on Tieling. He had arranged to do that after his crushing defeat at
                        Liao-yang, but the failure of General Kuroki’s flanking march completely
                        disconcerted the Japanese plan of campaign. Now, however, that the large
                        forces lately besieging Port Arthur have gone to the front, Marshal Oyama is
                        able to renew surroundiug tactics, with a much better chance of success. On
                        the other hand, the Russians must gain greatly by exchanging their
                        relatively weak lines south of Mukden for the strongly entrenched position
                        at Tieling. For the last six months they have strained. every effort to
                        render it impregnable, ceaselessly construct­ing formidable fortifications
                        and mounting them with guns of position. But both flanks are liable to be
                        turned by wide sweeping operations, and should that happen, either east or
                        west, General Kuropatkin will have nothing for it but to continue
                        retreating, to Harbin. As matters stand at the present moment, the
                        im­mediate issue of the campaign clearly depends on the ability of the
                        Russian commander to protect both flanks of his retiring force while
                        defending his centre by stubborn rear-guard fighting.</p>

                            <p>Mr. W. A. Coote, secretary of the London Vigilance Society, whose
                                arrival in Egypt we notifie&lt;l a fortnight ago, was, last year,
                                deputed by the International Conference which assembles every year,
                                to visit this country to enquire iuto the truth of the
                                representations made as to the necessity for vigorous action at
                                Egyptian ports, for the repression of what is generally known as the
                                white slave trntlic. As a result of his inves­tigations a meeting
                                was held at the French Consulate at Alexandria on Saturday last,
                                under the presidency Of M. Girard, the doyen of the Consular body,
                                at which were present the British, Italian, German, Austro-
                                Hungarian, Swedish and Norwegian, Danish, Russian, Greek,
                                Portuguese, and Spanish .Consuls, Mr. Freeman (British Vice-Consul),
                                'Mr. Jas. Hewat (American Consular Agent), Rev. Canon Ward, Rev. P.
                                Rudolph, Major Hopkinson, and many others interested in the
                                question.</p>
                            <p>M. Girard briefly. introduced Mr. Coote to the meeting, and in
                                opening the latter said:—I need notremind youof the terrible nature
                                oftbecrime referred to as the White* Slave Traffic. You know the
                                horrors inflicted upon innocent young women, of all nationalities,
                                who, through fraud on the part of these traffickers, are, under
                                false preteuces, induced to leave their homes and country. In
                                considering this question we must be careful to remember that these
                                traffickers are not confined to one country or to one nationality.
                                These white slave traders are men of all nationalities and all
                                countries. As official representatives you are familiar with the
                                nature of this terrible evil. 1 know, too, that you are not only
                                keenly alive to the awful nature of this business, but have
                                ctrenuously and energetically set your­selves to work to suppress
                                this scaudal an Alexandria. Apart altogether from your action, it is
                                well-known in England, that in the person of Major Hopkinson, the
                                Chief of the Police, wo have a man who is a friend of humanity, and
                                who is most anxious to do everything possible to suppress this evil,
                                and ready to work in the iullest harmony with the In­ternational
                                Committees of Europe. I waut therefore to assure you all, consuls
                                and officials of every grade, and of every nation, that 1 have not
                                been sent to Alexandria to find fault with what you have done or
                                left undone, but to lay before you a plan for the formation of an
                                International Committee to assist the authorities in every way to
                                more etfeotuauy deal with this question, and to work in full
                                co-operation with the international Com­mittees at present existing
                                in Europe. Let me remind you that the committees in Europe have
                                received the approval of the various Governments and the heads of
                                the nations. The Tsar and Tsaritza took a great interest in the
                                formation of the Russian com­mittee, and appointed H.l.H. the
                                Princess Eugenie of Wurtemburg aud H.R.H. Princess Helen of
                                Saxe-Altenburg as the first presidents. The acting chairman of the
                                committee is M. Sabouroff, a Minister of State, who attends all the
                                conferences. In Germany the Empress was instrumental in iormiug the
                                committee and appointed Count Keller, the Court Cham berlain, and
                                Herr von Diercksen, as its presidents. •- In Italy the committee was
                                also inaugurated by the King, and his Excellency the Marquis
                                Visconti Venosta was present at the first meeting as representing
                                the Govern ment. In Spain the committee was lorrned a* a result of a
                                special order issued by the King, and Princess Isabella is the
                                leading member ol it. In Bavaria, the Princess Ferdinand von Bayern
                                is the president of the Bavarian com­mittee, which is a branch of
                                the German com­mittee. In Austri vH'ingury the committee is both
                                strong and active, and doing good work- I need not tell you of the
                                sympathy of the ' English Government, for the movement originated
                                there. The heads of the International Bureau are the Right Hon. the
                                Earl of Aberdeen, the Right Hon. the Earl of Stam­ford, the Right
                                Rev. the Archbishop ot Westminster (Catholic),the Right Rev. the
                                Lord Bishop of London, the Right Rev. the Lord Bishop ofRochester,
                                Mr. Percy W. Busting,M.A., Dr. H. Adler, Chief Rabbi, and the
                                Dowager Duchess of Newcastle. To France the whole of Europe is
                                indebted for the splendid way in which the Government and the
                                International Committee have co-operated, and have succeed­ed in
                                putting this movement on a firm foundation. The president of the
                                French Committee is M. Berenger, Senator,-and Gus­tav Denis,
                                Senator, M. Louis Lepiue, Prefect of Paris Police, M. Georges Picot,
                                the Comtesse de Biron, etc.; take part in the work. The French
                                Government in 1902 called an Interna­tional Conference, at which 16
                                countries were represented by 36 delegates. At that confe­rence
                                certain articles were agreed upon, dealing with this crime from an
                                international point ot view. Previous to this conference it was
                                imposri- ble to deal with these traffickers owing to the following
                                difficulty. The crime was commenced is one country and completed in
                                another. As the crime bad not been begun and completed iu one
                                country, no action could be taken by the police. In order to meet
                                this difficulty those assembled at the Conference agreed upon
                                Article 2, which says : “Every person should be liable to pun
                                ishment who, to satisfy the passions of others, procures,
                                persuades,or induces by force.tbreats, abuse of authority, or any
                                other mode of constraint, any woman or girl of full age for the
                                purposes of prostitution (debauch) even if the acts constituting the
                                necessary element of the offence are committed in different
                                States.’’ Article 3 binds the high contracting parties to prnjiose
                                to their respective legislatures the men Kures necessary to punish
                                such offences, if not already existing in the national laws. Already
                                France, Germany, Russia, Italy, Spain, 8weden and Norway, have
                                passed new laws dealing with this crime, so that now in Europe it is

                                4. These articles make it the duty of each country to appoint agents
                                to*await the arrival ot Iniats and of trains, with the view of
                                notify­ing to the authorities a person who may be bri: 0ing

                                European countries the Inter­national Committees have provided
                                agents, men and women, to meet the boats aud the incoming trains at
                                the ports aud railway stations, to co-operate with the police in
                                every way, and always to act under them. In this way we have been
                                able to save • thousands of iunocent young women from falling into
                                the hands of souteneur*. The Work has been most successful in
                                Europe, aud the European com­mittees are anxious that in Alexandria
                                there should be a corresponding International Com­mittee, working in
                                the same way, and with the same object as those in Europe. I have,
                                there fore, been sent to youtoask you to form an In­ternational
                                Committeeonthefcllowing basis :— You should appoint a Supieme
                                Council, com­posed of the ladies and gentlemen of influence iu
                                Alexandria, with power to add to their number. From this Council
                                there should be formed an Executive Committee, who would be
                                responsible to the Council for the active pro­pagation of the work,
                                and for the general conduct'of all the business. This Executive
                                Committee should meet once a month, and should report to the
                                Counoil, who would meet every three months. The duty of the
                                committee would be to (i) Appoint a sub­committee of ladies to
                                attend to the Home, and, as far as possible, assist the matron ;
                                (ii) appoint an honorary secretary of the com­mittee ; (iii) collect
                                subscriptions to meat the expenses connected with the Home, and
                                other expenses connected with the work; (iv) to, engage two
                                agents—one a woman and the other a man. These agents would attend
                                to' the passengers on board the boats arriving from every country,
                                not with the view of inter­fering with them, but for the purpose of
                                rendering them whatever assistance they can. To be present at the
                                arrival and departure of the principal trains; (v) to issue printed
                                placards in several languages, telling'young women in trouble where
                                they can give informa­tion and find help; (vi) the committee should
                                send all information in to the authorities only after it has been
                                carelully investigated. Before sending in any report it must be
                                submitted to the committee, and if approved by them signed by the
                                secretary on behalf of the com­mittee.</p>
                            <p>These were the suggestions which Mr. Coote submitted for
                                consideration, stating that this was the method adopted in England
                                and other countries. For Alexandria they oould be modified dir added
                                to as the committee thought fit. *</p>
                            <p>Mr. Coote further said that he had had several interviews with Baron
                                Jacques de Menasce, who was confined to his house through illness,
                                or he would have been pre­sent at the meeting, and he had
                                authoris'-d him to say that he was in hearty sympathy with the
                                movement, that he would join the committee,and do everything b®
                                could to assist in putting a stop to this evil. Mr. Coote also
                                stated that he had seen M. M. Cattaui, in Cairo, and he had
                                expressed his readiuess to join the committee here.</p>
                            <p>He appealed earnestly to all present in the name ot our oommon
                                humanity, to beopme connected with the committee, .that this great
                                evil might be suppressed.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Cooto’s speech, which was delivered in Euglish, was repeated in
                                French by the chair­man, after which M. Stchelkoumouff, Russian
                                Consul, spoke relative to work done at the port of Odessa, aud
                                stated that he had received instructions from his Government to do
                                all in his power to assist the movement.</p>
                            <p>M. Sootidis, Greek Consul-General, spoke to the same effect, after
                                which Major Hopkinson stated some of the difficulties that lay in
                                the way of successfully proving the culpability aud bringing about
                                the punishment of the agents engaged in this traffic.</p>
                            <p>The following resolution was proposed by Mr. E. B. Gould, British
                                Consul-General, seconded by Baron Acton, Italian Consul- General and
                                unanimously carried :—</p>

                            <p>The Governor of Alexandria, .Mahmoud l’a-ha. Sidky, who was unable
                                from indisposition to attend the meeting, but sent a message
                                ex­pressive of hearty sympathy with its object, and his wish to do
                                all he could in aid, was appointed president of the committee, Baron

                            <p>IMPORTANT CRIMINAL TRIAL.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday.the Assiout Court tried a very im­portant criminal case.
                                The four accused, to­gether with a number of others, planned to rob
                                with violence Mr. Bashra Hanna of his money, which they thought he
                                was in the habit of sending to Cairo every week. They carried out
                                their plans in January last; but on attackingMr. Hanna’s carriage,
                                they found to their astonish­ment that instead of its containing
                                money bags, the carriage was filled with soldiers having loaded
                                rifles. The police had heard of their . intention and had
                                accordingly taken pro; cautions. One of the brigands was captured,
                                the rest escaped. He refused to mention the names of his associates,
                                but three others were subsequently discovered.</p>
                            <p>The case was brought before the Court yes­terday, Mr. Russell
                                Inspector of the Interior, and the Wekil of the Moudirieh attending.
                                The pleadings continued from nine ■ in the morning till hall-past
                                seven in the evening, when judgment was pronounced, condemning the
                                accused to seven years’ penal servitude.</p>

                                <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its
                                    subscribers the accompanying description of some of the many
                                    interesting routes by which they may travel homewards. Great
                                    care has been taken to arrange them as accurately and concisely
                                    as possible, and it will be found that none of them are fraught
                                    with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                                    things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference
                                    in climate between Egypt and the various points at which you may
                                    arrive in Europe.This depends partly upon the month in which you
                                    leave Egypt, for Cairo in January may be a little warmer than
                                    the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as Sicily, but in March it
                                    will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm than many
                                    other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                                    the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect.
                                    The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt are Sicily and
                                    Southern Spain. Venice and the district (although they have many
                                    attractions) are not uniformly warm until much later. Florence
                                    is very beautiful and full of interest, but sometimes there are
                                    cold winds in the early spring.</p>
                                <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to
                                    be spent at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the
                                    time occupied on each of the various routes between Egypt and
                                    the Continent of Europe.</p>
                                <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                                <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth,
                                    Southhampton, London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The
                                    short ones are as follows:—</p>

                                <p>The steamers, of the North German Lloyd, P &amp; O., Orient and
                                    Messageries Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British
                                    India, and Bibby Lines are also excellent, and their steamers
                                    are largely patronised by travellers to Egypt.</p>
                                <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to
                                    Alexandria, without change (3 1/2 hours). That to Port Said, can
                                    now be made without change in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                                <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni,
                                    Prince, and Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to
                                    Liverpool. The German Levant line has also good steamers from
                                    Alexandria to Hamburg. The most expensive but quickest through
                                    Continental routes are by P.&amp;O. Brindisi express from Port
                                    Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from
                                    Alexandria.</p>
                                <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very
                                    little luggage is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but
                                    there are several good and responsible forwarding agents in
                                    Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to deliver packages to any
                                    address in Europe.</p>
                                <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is
                                    undoubtedly by the fast Mail Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to
                                    Brindisi. One of these leaves port Said every week, as soon as
                                    possible after receiving the Indian mails from the great liner
                                    arrived from Bombay. These small but comfortable ships have
                                    enormously powerful engines, and attain a very high rate of
                                    speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having been specially
                                    built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi. If
                                    you are going straight through to England you will find the
                                    train waiting at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without
                                    changing. It has complete arrangements for sleeping and eating
                                    on board, and you should arrive in London on the fifth day from
                                    leaving Port Said.</p>

                                <p>The express goes north via Ancona, on the East coast, so that if
                                    you elect to go to Naples and Rome you may possibly have to wait
                                    at Brindisi some time for your train. At Brindisi there is
                                    nothing to see except the place which is supposed to have been
                                    the termination of the Appian way from Rome. </p>
                                <p>From Brindisi to Naples is a journey of 11 hours, but it can be
                                    broken at Taranto, two hours run from Brindisi.</p>
                                <p>Tarentum, founded in the 8th century B.C. by Spartans, was the
                                    first city of Great Greece. It has had a varied and exciting
                                    history, and remains of fine buildings - theatre, temple, circus
                                    and aqueduct - tell of its importance. Its situation is the most
                                    picturesque. The bay is the only secure port on the gulf, the
                                    entrance being so narrow that is it spanned by a bridge of a
                                    seven arches.</p>
                                <p>Salerno lies on the coast and is one of the most beautiful places
                                    in Southern Italy. On a height 905 feet above the sea stand the
                                    ruins of its Norman castle, giving a most imposing appearance to
                                    the place. The cathedral contains some very fine marble, and an
                                    11th century Byzantine bronze door. Salerno was at one time a
                                    seat of learning, its medical school being famous ; the
                                    university was closed in 1817. You must visit Pastum's wonderful
                                    Greek temples, which are second only to those at Athens. The
                                    travertine walls, the gates, the Temples of Neptune and Ceres,
                                    and the Basilica are of surpassing interest and the place is a
                                    happy hunting ground for the sketcher.</p>
                                <p>Naples is reached in an hour and a half. Thence you must proceed
                                    to Rome, whence you may go by Florence and Bologna to Milan and
                                    the Italian Lakes; then by the St. Gothard line to Lucerne,
                                    Basle and Calais. Or ou may go by the coast, by Civita Vecchia
                                    and Pisu to Genoa and home by Turing and the Mont Cenis
                                    route.</p>

                                <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio Rubattino Co.’s
                                    steamers which leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA. </p>
                                <p>From Messina the railway runs along the north coast of Sicily to
                                    Palermo and down the east coast to Syracuse via Taormina and
                                    Catania. TAORMINA is one of the most charming and popular places
                                    on the island. Giardini is the station at which to alight, and
                                    the drive up to Taormina is most delightful, occupying about one
                                    hour. The road goes winding up the hill in zig-zag fashion, and
                                    charming views - more beautiful the higher one gets - are
                                    unfolded to view. In and around the town is much to interest and
                                    visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restores under the
                                    Roamns. Catania is the starting place for the ascent of Etna,
                                    beyond that there is little of interest to the visitor. The
                                    Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over the
                                    island, are an endless source of pleasure. The finest are at
                                    Syracuse and Girgenti on the south-west coast, and both places
                                    are well worth visiting. SYRACUSE has an interesting history,
                                    having been a Greek city, which was besieged by Demosthenes in
                                    B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes
                                    was slain - his tomb is to be seen. The cathedral was once an
                                    ancient pagan temple. There is a fine theatre, alaso an
                                    amphitheatre and a temple to Diana, and the ruins of the great
                                    temple dedicated to the Olympian Jove. Girgenti stands on a hill
                                    900 feet high and commands a magnificent view. The ancient ruins
                                    of Agrigentum are most interesting - of the timeple to juno
                                    there are still many columns stnading. There are also the
                                    remains of temples to Castor and Pollux, Theron, and the
                                    enormous pillars of the temple to Jupiter Olympus. PALERMO, with
                                    about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and
                                    enjoys a delightful climate Much of interest is to be found in
                                    this fine city. The Palazzo Reale of Saracenic origin and close
                                    to it the church of S. Giovannia degli Eremiti with its
                                    picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens,
                                    Villa Guilia and and Royal Park are also worth a visit.
                                    Excursions from Palermo should be made to Monreale to see the
                                    beautiful Cloisters, and to Solunto, Cefalu, not forgetting also
                                    the Temples of Segesta and Selinunte. With its lovely scenery
                                    and delightful climate, its antiquities and beautiful
                                    vegetation, Sicily is certainly the most sttractive island in
                                    the Mediterranean.</p>

                                <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio
                                    Rubattino Co.’s steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach
                                    Naples or leave it without wishing to explore some of its
                                    islands, besides the lovely places on its bay — Castellamare and
                                    Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento [or you
                                    can drive] will take you on to Capri. This rocky little island
                                    is full of beautiful sea caves and grottoes, the exploring of
                                    which on a fine day, in a small boat, is a most fascinating
                                    occupation. The colour of the water is a perpetual joy, and the
                                    caves seem to be a veritable trap for sunshine. Of flowers and
                                    ferns there are plenty. Ischia and Procida can be visited in
                                    another little three or four days' trip from Naples. The
                                    steamers start from Immacolatella. The views of the coast, of
                                    Posilipo, Pozzuoli and Capo Miseno, are very fine. The little
                                    volcanic island of Procida is chiefly inhabited by sailors. The
                                    island of Ischia comes next, a charming resort, with mineral
                                    waters. The little harbour of Ischia, protected by its castle on
                                    a promontorv, is a volcanic crater. Casamieciola is the place at
                                    which you will stay, and from which you will make the ascent of
                                    Mount Epomeus for a glorious view.</p>
                                <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who
                                    can will devote at least one week to visiting the many
                                    historical and interesting portions of the Eternal City, whose
                                    charms and beauties are too well-known to need comment here.</p>
                                <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of
                                    five hours brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well
                                    be spent admiring the City of Flowers and its surrounding
                                    country. In Florence itself the churches and galleries are of
                                    absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and excursions
                                    should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                                    fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli,
                                    one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes
                                    winding up through the hills a distance of four miles. The most
                                    delightful excursion outside Florence is that to Vallombrosa,
                                    with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is made
                                    first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero, thence by
                                    cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                                    takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to
                                    view.</p>

                                    of Modern Art, Villa Borghese, Doria, Colonna, and Lateran

                                <p>The run down to Pisa from Florence can be made two ways; either
                                    by Pistoja and Lucca or by Empoli. Lucea is one of the old
                                    fortified towns of Italy, with an imposing wall built round it,
                                    and massive gates leading into the town. Here is also the fine
                                    old Cathedral of St. Martino. In Pisa there is a fine Cathedral
                                    and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                                    possible be made, in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile
                                    at sunset. From Pisa there are good trains to Leghorn, where you
                                    can take boat to Genoa and thence to the Riviera or Milan and
                                    The Lakes.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba). -The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest deathaverages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature —warm in winter and | deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and his-torical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>Genoa is the principal port on the Mediter-­ranean, and the first commercial
                        and shipping point of the Littoral, besides being the junction for the
                        arrival and departure for all the principal cities of Europe, the Orient,
                        and the United States, the Hamburg American, and North-German-Lloyd steamers
                        from New York, and the Continent of Europe en route to China and Japan, stop
                        at Genoa. The trains-de-luxe, and regular express trains from Paris and
                        other large Continental cities make connections at Genoa en route to the
                        Italian and French Rivieras, so that travellers to Rome, Naples, Alassio,
                        San Remo, Nice. Mentone, Monte Carlo, etc., can arrange to spend a few davs
                        in Genoa at one of its fine modern hotels. Genoa is built on steep hills
                        rising abruptly from the Mediterranean, and the gorgeous panoramic views
                        afforded from almost any terrace, street or building, must be seen to be
                        appreciated Electric trams traverse every part, and tend to add the
                        combination of the modern with all that is most ancient and in-teresting to
                        the American tourist, who is doubly interested in seeing the birthplace of
                        Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before: making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of of the Bible. The public gardens and the
                        monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hour journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most,
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is un-like that of any other seaport.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>From Venice you can go to Bologna via Padua; and then to Ravenna, one of the
                        most ancient towns in Italy. Between Bologna and Milan and only an
                        hour-and-a-half from Milan is SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on
                        account of its thermal springs, change trains at Borgo San-Donino, and in
                        half-an-hour you are at Salsomaggiore.</p>
                    <p>TYROL, INNSBRUCK, one of the finest and prettiest towns in the German
                        Austrian Mountains, is 600 metres above sea level, and has many interesting
                        features, both ancient and modern. It is admirably suited for spring and
                        summer residence, and is a good centre for excursions in the summer months.
                        There are three good railway services, via. Germany, Switzerland and Italy.
                        Electric tramcars run constantly to many places of local interest. The
                        Hotels are good, as also several Pensions, all being equipped with modern
                        requirements. Full particulars and information can be obtained from any of
                        Cook’s offices.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza; also by tramway in two-and-a-half hours. The
                        cathedral, entirely of marble, is one of the finest in N. Italy—1426-1526
                        a.d.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Caddenubbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellagio opposite. These
                        four latter towns are in about the centre of the lake, and very close
                        together, and the walk from. Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to
                        Menaggio is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on
                        Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in
                        two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>
                    <p>Lake Maggiore is 37 miles long and varies in width from one-and-a-half miles
                        to three miles, and though the banks are not generally so mountainous as
                        those of the Lake of Como, the scenery is pretty and there are many
                        in-teresting spots-at which to stay.</p>
                    <p>Pallanza, opposite the Borromean Isles, is well situated for a fine view over
                        the Lake and the Alps. It is an interesting town and a good centre for
                        making a tour round the Lake. Steamers are very frequent to all other towns
                        up or down the Lake. Taking the steamer from Pallanza for Stresa, you call
                        at Baveno, a pretty little spot where Queen Victoria stayed in 1879. Then
                        you come to the most charming feature of this part of the Lake, the
                        Borromean Islands. Isola Superiore is only a fishing hamlet, but Isola Bella
                        is a picture. The castle was built in the 17th century and is worth visiting
                        as well as the grounds. Stresa, the next stopping place by the steamer, is
                        cooler and has a better air than places on the opposite side of the Lake, so
                        that for the summer months it is a more preferable spot at which to
                        stay.</p>

                    <head>Route III. Switzerland</head>
                    <p>Switzerland, the heart of Europe, has been described as "A cluster of
                        delights and granduers." The country has an area of only 15,720 square
                        miles, and borders on France, Germany, Austria and Italy. It also has the
                        proud distinction of being the source of three of Europe's biggest waterways
                        - the rivers Rhine, Danube and Rhone. Mountains and lakes occupy almost the
                        whole of Switzerland, there being practically no flat land or plains. The
                        mountains or Alps are divided into three groups, the Pennine Alps, Helvetic
                        Alps, and the Rhoetic Alps. The principal lakes are Constance, Geneva,
                        Zurich, Lucerne and Neuchatel, then the lakes of Bienne, Thun, Brienz and
                        Zug. The glaciers of Switzerland occupy about one-eighteenth of the space,
                        and are about 400 in number, the principal of which is the Aletsch Glacier.
                        There are also waterfalls of importance, such as the Rhine at Schaffhausen,
                        the Aar at Handeck, Staubbach and Pletschbach at Lauterbrunnen, etc.,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>Certain points are renowned for the view and may be selected as follows: -
                        Col de la Faucille, near M. Reculets and M. Dole, above St. Cergue near
                        Geneva, Chaumont above Neuchatel, Macolin above Bienne, the Hauen-steing
                        above Olten, Albis between Zurich and Zug, Rigi between Zug and Lucerne,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>It depends very much on the point at which Switzerland is first entered which
                        is to be the first stopping place; also whether the tour is on bicycle or
                        foot, as naturally the cyclist wishes to be ever going from place to place
                        and never turning back along the same road. But as centres for seeing the
                        beauties and charms of each certain district the following may be helpful to
                        visitors:- LAUSANNE as centre for Montreux, Vevey, Neuchatel, St. Maurice,
                        Martigny, Aigle, Bex. etc. INTERLAKEN for the Bernese Oberland, Grindelwald,
                        Murren, Lake Brienz, Thun, etc. CHUR for the Engadine, St. Mortiz, Davos
                        Platz, Pontresina, Klosters, Ragatz, etc. ZURICH, Dolder, Schaffhausen.</p>
                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M, de Caprino and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>The Piazza Giardino, with its promenade and fountains, is close to the
                        landing stage. A broad quay, the favorite promenade, extends the whole
                        length of the town along the shores of the lake. In the Santa Maria degli
                        Angiolo is a fresco of the Passion, the finest work of Bernardino Luini
                        (1529). There are many interesting excursions to be made into the
                        surrounding neighbourhood. MONTE GENEROSO, about 5,600 feet, is reached by
                        taking steamer or train from Lugano to Capolago, then the mountain railway,
                        which runs to the summit. The view is magnificent, being one of the finest
                        in the Lombard Alps. Monte Salvatore is ascended by railway from Lugano
                        Paradiso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from Bel-inzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate, and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna de Sasso, situated above the
                        town is worth a visit, as it contains interst-ing paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and "The Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>
                    <p>LUCERNE. - A striking picture on the Lake of Lucerne is surrounded by walls
                        with nine watch towers facing the Rigi and Pilatus and the snow-clad Alps.
                        Seven bridges cross the Reuss, but the two old ones, the Kapell Brucke and
                        Muhlen Brucke are of interest. Both have roofs, the former painted with
                        scenes from the letter with a Dance of Death. The old water tower near the
                        Kapell Brucke used to be a lighthouse or "Lucerna," giving its name to the
                        town. In and around the town the walks are charming, and the excursions to
                        be made from Lucerne by boat, rail, etc., are very numerous. Places of
                        interest in the town are the Hof Kirche, dating from the 16th Century, the
                        Lion of Lucerne Monument, near which is also an interesting garden,
                        containing signs of glacier-worn rocks of a remote ice period. In the
                        Bathaus is a Museum (War and Peace Museum) should also be visited.</p>
                    <p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful excursions, those to the Rigi,
                        Pilatus, Burgent stock and Sonnenberg, needing a special visit each. Other
                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>The Rigi is a famous ridge between the Lakes Lucerne and Zug. The view is
                        unsur-passed for extent and magnificence, including the view of 13 lakes,
                        the Oberland, and many of the distant Alps. The sunset view is much finer
                        than sunrise, and is best seen from the Roth-stock. Sunrise from Kulum.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of
                        Lucerne, commands magnificent views of the lake and mountain scenery. Along
                        the Lake of Uri from Brunnen to Fluelen runs the famous Axenstrasse.</p>
                    <p>SEELISBERG is on the opposite shore to Brunnen, and with the Sanitorium of
                        Sonnen-berg forms one of the famous health resorts of the Lake of
                        Lucerne</p>
                    <p>THE BURGENSTOCK may be reached in two ways; either by steamer from Lucerne to
                        Kehrsiten, then the cable railway to the crest of Burgenstock; or the other
                        way is to go to Stannstad by boat, and then drive up the fine new road. From
                        Stannstad it is about 1 hour 40 minutes by electric railway to ENGLEBERG.
                        The ascent of Titlis is made from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps
                        is grand, extending from Monte Rosa to the Black Forest, and from the Santis
                        to the Matterhorn.</p>
                    <p>ZURICH, capital of Canton Zurich, is beautifully situated in a mountain
                        valley 1,300 ft above the sea. As a commercial tewn t is perhaps the most
                        important in Switzer-land, having extensive manufactures in silk, cotton,
                        and machinery. The old town is still picturesque, but is gradually being
                        replaced by modern private dwellings and public buildings, amongst which is
                        the Federal Polytechnic School and University. An interesting excur-sion is
                        that to the Zurichberg 2,000 ft. above the sea, from which a fine sunset
                        view can be obtained. Another favourite place is the Uttli-berg, about 6
                        miles south-west of Zurich.</p>

                        Maurice, and the come to Martigny.</p>
                    <p>AIGLE, 20 minutes from Montreux is the starting point to the health resorts
                        of Leysin, Diablerets, Chateau d'Oex (for its bracing mountain air cures);
                        Villars (for milk cures, and lovely scenery); Chesieres and Bex (noted for
                        its strong saline waters and grape cures). Near Bex is Les Plans for
                        climatic cure, 3,600 ft., and a centre for mountain excursions.</p>
                    <p>Martigny is the starting place for the Tete Noir and Col-de-Balme routes to
                        Chamonix, one of the most popular Alpine resorts, on account of being within
                        easy reach of the famous Mer-de-Glace Clacier des Bossons. The ascent of

                        last plce is a very important mountaineering centre, whence the ascent of
                        Monte Rosa, the Matter-horn, Dome, Dent Blanche and the Breithorn can be
                        made. The view of the snow-covered Alps and glaciers obtained from the
                        railway to Gornergrat is really magnificent.</p>
                    <p>Eggshorn is a high mountain resort on the Brigue-Rhone Glacier road, whence
                        the ascent of the Jungfrau is made quite easily. There are also numerous

                    <head>Route IV. Greece and the Ionian Isles. Constantinople</head>
                    <p>Many people visit Greece after wintering in Egypt, as it is so easily reached
                        from Alex-andria; the climate in April is charming. Steamers run frequently
                        both to Putras, and the Piraeus - which is the port for Athens. The
                        advantage of disembarking at the latter place is that it is but five miles
                        from Athens, which may be reached in twenty minutes by train; while the
                        railway journey from Patras takes about 7 1/2 hours. The best steamers are
                        those of the Khedival Mail Co. Greece is also very easily reached from
                        either Smyrna or Constan-tinople; and there are frequent sailings by
                        excellent steamers.</p>
                    <p>The first and most important sit to visit in ATHENS is, of course, the
                        Acropolis - a rocky platform upon which were built some of the most famous
                        buildings of classic times. Ascend-ing the great staircase, 70 ft. wide, and
                        passing throuhg the Gateway built of marble from Pentelicus the Parthenon is
                        reached - dedicated to Pa'las Athene by Pericles cir. 444 B.C., and adorned
                        with priceless sculptures, many of which are now in the British Museum.
                        There is the Erechtheion with its celebrated Caryatides; the Theseion and
                        the beautiful little Temple of the Wingless Vistory. Close to the Acropolis
                        lies Mars Hill, celebrated as the site where St. Paul preached to the
                        Athenians, and where the Athenians held their public cCourt. On the Pnyx
                        immediatley behind they assembled their meetings. On the south and
                        south-east sides of the Acropolis are the beautiful columns of the Temple of
                        Jupiter Olympus and the triumphal arch of Hadrian, the Temple of Aesculapius
                        and the two ancient theatres - the Odeum, and the Theatre of Dionysus which
                        is well preserved. These are but a few of the interesting buildings of
                        ancient Athens.</p>
                    <p>If possible tourists should arrange to be in Athens for the Orthodox Easter
                        in order to witness the Good Friday and Easter Eve ceremonies, and to be
                        present at the dancing on the Easter Tuesday festival held at Megara, for
                        which a special train is run from Athens.</p>
                    <p>A charming trip can be made to Corinth by train (3 hours) through lovely
                        scenery, and on to Mycenae, where can be seen the celebrated Tomb of Atreus
                        and the Gate of Lions at the entrnce to Agamemmnons's Palace. From here it
                        is quite possible to drive via Argos to Nauplia in the day. This is an
                        interesting town, and the surrounding scenery is lovely. A pleasant
                        afternoon's drive can be made to Tiryns with its Cyclopoean masonry, and to
                        Argos with fine amphitheatre cut in the natural rock, and Acropolis 1,000
                        ft. above sea level. Epidaurus with its Temple of Aesculapius and very
                        perfect amphitheatre is well worth the day's driving excursion. From Nauplia
                        you can get to Olympia by rail via Pyrgos - the scenery is most picturesque.
                        It is here that the celebrated Olympic games were help from B.C. 776 to A.D.
                        394 - the stadium is very perfect. The ruins of the Temple of Jupiter are
                        quite splendid. The famous statue of Hermes is here. Patras is reached from
                        Pyrgos by rail in ofur hours, from which port steamers to all parts of
                        Europe run frequently. A charming trip can be made among the Ionian islands,
                        Zanta, Cephalonia, etc. It is worth while to spend a few days in CORFU on
                        account of the beauty of the scenery. There is also good snipe and quail
                        shooting to be had.</p>
                    <p>You will get at Alexandria vessels belonging to different lines that will
                        take you by various routes to Constantinople. The Khedivial stea-mers go by
                        Piraeus for visiting Athens.</p>
                    <p>It is a great advantage to see Constantinople for the first time from the
                        sea, the view of the city fom the Golden Horn being magnificent</p>
                    <p>The chief things to see in Constantinople are the Mosque of San Sophia, the
                        Golden Horn and the Valley of Sweet Waters.</p>
                    <p>Smyrna is a thriving commercial port, at which many steamers call. Many
                        charming excursions can be made from it; to the Cyclo-poean Cities of
                        Nymphaeum and Sipylus and the rock-cut City of Niobe near Magnesia; the
                        Baths of Diana and Agamemnon; and the Meles Valley, where may be seen the
                        Chair and Cave of Homer and a fire double-arched acqueduct.</p>
                    <p>there is a railway to Ephesus where there is a good Hotel and Restaurant kept
                        by an Englishman. The ruins of the Great Temple of Diana are about
                        three-quarters of a mile distant. Of the "Seven churches of Asia." five are
                        ac-cessible by tain from Smyrna. Laodicea can be reached from Alascheir
                        which is 50 miles distant by rail and is the site of Philadelphus.</p>
                    <p>This is a beautiful old City at the foot of Mt. Tmolus; it was built in B.C.
                        160 by Attalus Philadelphus, last King of Pergamos.</p>

                    <head>Palestine and Syria</head>
                    <p>The nearest port from Egypt in Jaffa, the ancient Joppa. You can take steamer
                        from Alexandria or Port Said to Jaffa or any of the Syrian ports. Probably
                        the largest steamers on route are those of the Messageries Maritimes. There
                        are Austrian Lloyd, and Khedivial steamers, and also occasional Moss, and
                        Price line steamers. You must on no account forget to obtain a special
                        passport for Palestine before leaving Egypt, or you will find much
                        difficulty at the ports.</p>
                    <p>The landing at Jaffa is most exciting. As there is no harbour, the steamer
                        drops anchor as near as she safely can to the shore, and large row boats
                        come out to take off the passengers. A great reef through which there is
                        only one small opening protects the coast, and the interesting moment is the
                        passing through this opening in the row boat. There is not much to detain
                        you at Jaffa, though there are two excellent hotels outside the town. There
                        is a railway to Jerusalem, also an excellent carriage road, the drive
                        occupying about eight hours.</p>
                    <p>The trip from Jerusalem to Jericho can be made by carriage or by riding. The
                        drive is very fine, the views of the steep ravine of the Wady Kelt (the Book
                        Cherith) with the monastery clinging to its side, and of the Dead Sea and
                        Jordan Valley being very fine.</p>
                    <p>Fom Jerusalem to Damascus by land, is a camping tour of about a fortnight.
                        The route is by Nablous - the ancient Samaritan Shechem - Jenin, Haifa,
                        (Mount Carmel), Nazareth, Tiberias, Tell Hum (Capernaum), Safed and Banias
                        (Caesarea Philippi). There are other camping expeditions possible from
                        Jerusalem, as, from Jerusalem via Nazareth and Haifa, Tyre and Sidon to
                        Beyrout, whence there is a rail to Damascus.</p>
