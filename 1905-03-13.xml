                        <head>The Russian Retreat</head>
                        <p>For nearly a fortnight the world at large has watched, with ever-growing
                            interest, the pro­gress of a battle stretched over a frontage estimated
                            to cover ninety miles between it*<cb n="6"/>extremities. At a moderate
                            calculation, three-quarters of a million of armed men must have-been
                            engaged in this titanic struggle, and the fighting necessarily took the
                            character of a number of more or less isolated encounters on a line
                            almost as long as the distance from Alexandria to Benha. But these
                            several engage­ments, have been connected by a common purpose. Marshal
                            Oyama strove to compel the Russians to fall back from Mukden on Tieling
                            for Harbin, and at the same time to cut off some portion of the retiring
                            force by flanking movements. General Kuropatkin, on the other hand, held
                            on tenaciously to his strong entrenchments south of the ancient Manchu
                            capital, occasionally developing some counter-attack at what seemed to
                            present a weak point in the Japanese order of battle. On both sides the
                            troops fought with splendid courage, and it would be difficult to
                            determine between the attack and the defence from that standpoint. The
                            Japanese soldier has distinguished himself throughout the cam­paign by
                            ignoring losses and repulses, how­ever severe; he always "comes again;"
                            and Marshal Oyama, knowing this national trait, does not hesitate to
                            humour it by repeating his efforts to force a way either through the
                            Russian centre or round one of the enemy's flanks. General Kuropatkin,
                            on the other hand, trusts to the stubbornness of his troops, both
                            individually and collectively, to beat back these attempts at
                            penetration, and it is greatly to the credit of their morale, after such
                            an uninterrupted succession of heavy defeats and the loss of Port
                            Arthur, that their staunchness held out for so long.</p>
                        <p>Now, however, beaten at every point, and finding his position absolutely
                            untenable, Ge­neral Kuropatkin has been obliged to beat a hasty retreat
                            to the North, with the Japanese victors in hot pursuit. The latter are
                            hanging on both flanks of the Russian army and pour­ing shells among the
                            disordered masses, inflict­ing severe loss. The retreat, it is evident,
                            has been extremely trying,and as Reuter reports to­day, all further
                            details increase the extent of the Russian disaster. An official report
                            puts the Russian losses up to Thursday morning at 65,000 men, while
                            Oyama estimates that the number of prisoners exceeds 30,000. A Havas
                            telegram tells us that "judging by the aspect of the retreat the
                            Russians will oppose a further advance of the enemy." This would
                            indicate that Kuropatkin had decided on fighting another of those
                            rear-guard actions at which he is an adept, while falling back on
                            Tieling. He had arranged to do that after his crushing defeat at
                            Liao-yang, but the failure of General Kuroki's flanking march completely
                            disconcerted the Japanese plan of campaign. Now, however, that the large
                            forces lately besieging Port Arthur have gone to the front, Marshal
                            Oyama is able to renew surroundiug tactics, with a much better chance of
                            success. On the other hand, the Russians must gain greatly by exchanging
                            their relatively weak lines south of Mukden for the strongly entrenched
                            position at Tieling. For the last six months they have strained. every
                            effort to render it impregnable, ceaselessly construct­ing formidable
                            fortifications and mounting them with guns of position. But both flanks
                            are liable to be turned by wide sweeping operations, and should that
                            happen, either east or west, General Kuropatkin will have nothing for it
                            but to continue retreating, to Harbin. As matters stand at the present
                            moment, the im­mediate issue of the campaign clearly depends on the
                            ability of the Russian commander to protect both flanks of his retiring
                            force while defending his centre by stubborn rear-guard fighting.</p>

                            <p> Oyama estimates that the number of Russian prisoners exceeds

                            <p>The Japanese casualties amount to 41,000. The Japanese captured a
                                retreating Russian column at Pa-Ho yesterday.</p>
                            <p>(Later). In his report Marshal Oyama says that the number of Russian
                                prisoners totals 40,000 and is increasing every moment. The Russian
                                casualties are estimated at 90,000. The Russians left 26,500 dead on
                                the field.</p>

                                are now in touch. All further details increase the extent of the

                            from diplomatic sources, learns that Russia has intimated to France her
                            readiness to entertain negotiations for peace, provided a reasonable
                            basis of discussion can be arranged. Communications on the subject of
                            mediation are passing between London and Paris. Great Britain will
                            communicate the Russian overtures to Japan at an early date, if this has
                            not already been done. It is understood that Russia's action is largely
                            due to the difficulties she has experienced regarding the loan
                            negotiations in Paris.</p>

                    <p> A report has been going about referring to &amp; violation of Egyptian
                        frontier by Turkish troops from Tripoli. We are authorised to give the
                        correcct version of what has actually oocurred. </p>
                    <p> A Turkish frontier post stationed near the Gulf of Solum has recently been
                        strengthened, and a strong blockhouse established within a few yards of the
                        frontier, which runs, according to the Egyptian contention, along a ridge
                        lying parallel with the west side of the Bay of Solum. Ground be tween this
                        ridge and the sea has now been occupied by the Turks, who have built
                        storehouses there and warned off the Egyptian Coast Guards. </p>
                    <p> The numbers of the Turkish force have been much exaggerated; they total 4
                        officers and 100 men. </p>
                    <p> The matter is at present the subject of a diplomatic correspondence between
                        the Egyptian and the Ottoman Government, and it is biped a satisfactory
                        solution will shortly be found. | Bedouin troubles in the same region are
                        also engaging the attention of both Governments. It appears that the Sherat
                        Bedouins were recently attacked by Sheikh Abdul Kader el Kuzza. A dozen of
                        them were killed and the remainder took refuge among the Aulad Ali on the
                        Egyptian side of the frontier. Shortly afterwards the Aulad Ali, crossing
                        for pasture into Turkish territory, were raided by this sheikh and lost 85
                        camels. In consequence or this attack, the Aulad Ali tribe planned
                        reprisals, threatening amongst other things to stop the sending of cattle by
                        land from Tripoli to Alexandria. 1 The Government has taken measures to
                        secnre the return of cattle and camels that have been stolen and has urged
                        the chiefs of the | Aulad Ali to keep their people quiet. </p>
                    <p> It is noticeable that the number of cattle coming into Alexandria has
                        greatly diminishel this spring. </p>

                        Italian actor. His interpretation was a veritable triumph and brought forth

                        name of the whole Egyptian Bar, to testify to our profound grief before the
                        body of one who, for twenty years, was one of our most appreciated
                        confrères, and constantly engaged in our chief legal contests.Death is
                        always imposing and terrible, but how much more so when its victim is torn
                        from us in the plenitude of his power, and when it seemed certain that he
                        would survive for many years, and was still engaged in a struggle whose
                        issue promised to be victorious! | And death is most terrible in the case
                        where he whom we mourn has succumbed to the consequences of a tragic
                        accident which will perhaps never be explained, but the dreadful issue of
                        which weshall never forget.Achille Albrecht had just completed his
                        forty-second year, and half his life had been passed at the Cairo Bar. From
                        his debut at Radusa he showed himself the indefatigable worker that we knew.
                        A lover of bis profession,always in the breech, he carried bis interest in
                        his profession into those social functions where he was so popular. His
                        extraordinary activity was shown in all his undertakings. At the sittings
                        where he practised till his last year, his painstaķing talent in his
                        relations with the principal administrations of the State or with the
                        financial world with the consulates, the heads of the religious world, and
                        of charitable societies, wherever his professional duties, varied as they
                        are in Egyptian legal practice, called him, his honesty, his professional
                        capabilities, his knowledge of business, his tact and diplomacy, and his
                        pleasant manner, were widely known and admired. This is no more than a
                        memory which we shall long respect. But this memory of the dead is the most
                        precious heritage lest to those loved ones whom he has left behind, to his
                        brave and devoted wife, and to his children, for. whom he was proud to
                        assure a more brilliant future every day. Death, alas I has broken the bond
                        that united his family, or rather, as we hope and believe, has transformed
                        and spiritualised it. In a few moments we shall leave you, dear confrère and
                        friend. You possessed many virtues, and two above all-devotion to your
                        family and love of your work. This we shall all remember, and I feel that I

                        speak for them, but in the name of the judges, many of whom I see here, and
                        in the name of all who are present and all who have known our dead friend,

                    <head> ANGLO-AMERICAN COMPANY. </head>
                    <p> The extraordinarily brilliant season this year has had a great effect on the
                        receipts of all businesses connected with the tourist traffio in Egypt, and
                        among the leading companies is the Anglo-American Nile Steamer and Hotel
                        Company. The receipts of this company up to date have been fully thirty per
                        cent. higher than for the corresponding period last year. It must be borne
                        in mind that last year was not a very brilliant season, and yet the compány
                        managed to pay a dividend of six por cent. and to put a satisfactory amount
                        in the reserve fund. </p>
                    <p> The directors, we hear, contemplate the increase of their fleet, as well as
                        additions to the hotel on Elephantine Island, as they have had to refuse
                        hundreds of passengers since January. The company's freight service to
                        Alexandria, despite great competition, has held its own most successfully,
                        and it is intended shortly to increase the number of their steam barges. </p>
                    <p> *At present the company is making all the arrangements in Egypt and the
                        Sudan for the great American tourist agency of Clark, and are taking at the
                        present moment no less than 350 passengers to Luxor and Assouan in dif.
                        ferent sections, either by rail or steamer. The company's steamers
                        "Victoria" and "May. flower" have been specially chartered to that effect. </p>
                    <p> Persons, who may be thinking of investing in this company's stock, will be
                        interested to learn that, since January, the company has carried 500 more
                        Nile tourists on its steamers than during the whole of the season last year.

                    <head>White Slave Trade Action in Alexandria</head>
                    <p>Mr. W. A. Coote, secretary of the London Vigilance Society, whose arrival in
                        Egypt we notifie&lt;l a fortnight ago, was, last year, deputed by the
                        International Conference which assembles every year, to visit this country
                        to enquire iuto the truth of the representations made as to the necessity
                        for vigorous action at Egyptian ports, for the repression of what is
                        generally known as the white slave trntlic. As a result of his
                        inves­tigations a meeting was held at the French Consulate at Alexandria on
                        Saturday last, under the presidency Of M. Girard, the doyen of the Consular
                        body, at which were present the British, Italian, German, Austro- Hungarian,
                        Swedish and Norwegian, Danish, Russian, Greek, Portuguese, and Spanish
                        .Consuls, Mr. Freeman (British Vice-Consul), 'Mr. Jas. Hewat (American
                        Consular Agent), Rev. Canon Ward, Rev. P. Rudolph, Major Hopkinson, and many
                        others interested in the question.</p>
                    <p>M. Girard briefly. introduced Mr. Coote to the meeting, and in opening the
                        latter said:—I need notremind youof the terrible nature oftbecrime referred
                        to as the White* Slave Traffic. You know the horrors inflicted upon innocent
                        young women, of all nationalities, who, through fraud on the part of these
                        traffickers, are, under false preteuces, induced to leave their homes and
                        country. In considering this question we must be careful to remember that
                        these traffickers are not confined to one country or to one nationality.
                        These white slave traders are men of all nationalities and all countries. As
                        official representatives you are familiar with the nature of this terrible
                        evil. 1 know, too, that you are not only keenly alive to the awful nature of
                        this business, but have ctrenuously and energetically set your­selves to
                        work to suppress this scaudal an Alexandria. Apart altogether from your
                        action, it is well-known in England, that in the person of Major Hopkinson,
                        the Chief of the Police, wo have a man who is a friend of humanity, and who
                        is most anxious to do everything possible to suppress this evil, and ready
                        to work in the iullest harmony with the In­ternational Committees of Europe.
                        I waut therefore to assure you all, consuls and officials of every grade,
                        and of every nation, that 1 have not been sent to Alexandria to find fault
                        with what you have done or left undone, but to lay before you a plan for the
                        formation of an International Committee to assist the authorities in every
                        way to more etfeotuauy deal with this question, and to work in full
                        co-operation with the international Com­mittees at present existing in
                        Europe. Let me remind you that the committees in Europe have received the
                        approval of the various Governments and the heads of the nations. The Tsar
                        and Tsaritza took a great interest in the formation of the Russian
                        com­mittee, and appointed H.l.H. the Princess Eugenie of Wurtemburg aud
                        H.R.H. Princess Helen of Saxe-Altenburg as the first presidents. The acting
                        chairman of the committee is M. Sabouroff, a Minister of State, who attends
                        all the conferences. In Germany the Empress was instrumental in iormiug the
                        committee and appointed Count Keller, the Court Cham berlain, and Herr von
                        Diercksen, as its presidents. •- In Italy the committee was also inaugurated
                        by the King, and his Excellency the Marquis Visconti Venosta was present at
                        the first meeting as representing the Govern ment. In Spain the committee
                        was lorrned a* a result of a special order issued by the King, and Princess
                        Isabella is the leading member ol it. In Bavaria, the Princess Ferdinand von
                        Bayern is the president of the Bavarian com­mittee, which is a branch of the
                        German com­mittee. In Austri vH'ingury the committee is both strong and
                        active, and doing good work- I need not tell you of the sympathy of the '
                        English Government, for the movement originated there. The heads of the
                        International Bureau are the Right Hon. the Earl of Aberdeen, the Right Hon.
                        the Earl of Stam­ford, the Right Rev. the Archbishop ot Westminster
                        (Catholic),the Right Rev. the Lord Bishop of London, the Right Rev. the Lord
                        Bishop ofRochester, Mr. Percy W. Busting,M.A., Dr. H. Adler, Chief Rabbi,
                        and the Dowager Duchess of Newcastle. To France the whole of Europe is
                        indebted for the splendid way in which the Government and the International
                        Committee have co-operated, and have succeed­ed in putting this movement on
                        a firm foundation. The president of the French Committee is M. Berenger,
                        Senator,-and Gus­tav Denis, Senator, M. Louis Lepiue, Prefect of Paris
                        Police, M. Georges Picot, the Comtesse de Biron, etc.; take part in the
                        work. The French Government in 1902 called an Interna­tional Conference, at
                        which 16 countries were represented by 36 delegates. At that confe­rence
                        certain articles were agreed upon, dealing with this crime from an
                        international point ot view. Previous to this conference it was imposri- ble
                        to deal with these traffickers owing to the following difficulty. The crime
                        was commenced is one country and completed in another. As the crime bad not
                        been begun and completed iu one country, no action could be taken by the
                        police. In order to meet this difficulty those assembled at the Conference
                        agreed upon Article 2, which says : "Every person should be liable to pun
                        ishment who, to satisfy the passions of others, procures, persuades,or
                        induces by force.tbreats, abuse of authority, or any other mode of
                        constraint, any woman or girl of full age for the purposes of prostitution
                        (debauch) even if the acts constituting the necessary element of the offence
                        are committed in different States.'' Article 3 binds the high contracting
                        parties to prnjiose to their respective legislatures the men Kures necessary
                        to punish such offences, if not already existing in the national laws.
                        Already France, Germany, Russia, Italy, Spain, 8weden and Norway, have
                        passed new laws dealing with this crime, so that now in Europe it is easy

                        the Proto­col the Governments agree, inArticles 2,8 and 4. These articles
                        make it the duty of each country to appoint agents to*await the arrival ot
                        Iniats and of trains, with the view of notify­ing to the authorities a

                        investigations are being made concerning her: In England and other European
                        countries the Inter­national Committees have provided agents, men and women,
                        to meet the boats aud the incoming trains at the ports aud railway stations,
                        to co-operate with the police in every way, and always to act under them. In
                        this way we have been able to save • thousands of iunocent young women from
                        falling into the hands of souteneur*. The Work has been most successful in
                        Europe, aud the European com­mittees are anxious that in Alexandria there
                        should be a corresponding International Com­mittee, working in the same way,
                        and with the same object as those in Europe. I have, there fore, been sent
                        to youtoask you to form an In­ternational Committeeonthefcllowing basis :—
                        You should appoint a Supieme Council, com­posed of the ladies and gentlemen
                        of influence iu Alexandria, with power to add to their number. From this
                        Council there should be formed an Executive Committee, who would be
                        responsible to the Council for the active pro­pagation of the work, and for
                        the general conduct'of all the business. This Executive Committee should
                        meet once a month, and should report to the Counoil, who would meet every
                        three months. The duty of the committee would be to (i) Appoint a
                        sub­committee of ladies to attend to the Home, and, as far as possible,
                        assist the matron ; (ii) appoint an honorary secretary of the com­mittee ;
                        (iii) collect subscriptions to meat the expenses connected with the Home,
                        and other expenses connected with the work; (iv) to, engage two agents—one a
                        woman and the other a man. These agents would attend to' the passengers on
                        board the boats arriving from every country, not with the view of
                        inter­fering with them, but for the purpose of rendering them whatever
                        assistance they can. To be present at the arrival and departure of the
                        principal trains; (v) to issue printed placards in several languages,
                        telling'young women in trouble where they can give informa­tion and find
                        help; (vi) the committee should send all information in to the authorities
                        only after it has been carelully investigated. Before sending in any report
                        it must be submitted to the committee, and if approved by them signed by the
                        secretary on behalf of the com­mittee.</p>
                    <p>These were the suggestions which Mr. Coote submitted for consideration,
                        stating that this was the method adopted in England and other countries. For
                        Alexandria they oould be modified dir added to as the committee thought fit.
                        *</p>
                    <p>Mr. Coote further said that he had had several interviews with Baron Jacques
                        de Menasce, who was confined to his house through illness, or he would have
                        been pre­sent at the meeting, and he had authoris'-d him to say that he was
                        in hearty sympathy with the movement, that he would join the committee,and
                        do everything b® could to assist in putting a stop to this evil. Mr. Coote
                        also stated that he had seen M. M. Cattaui, in Cairo, and he had expressed
                        his readiuess to join the committee here.</p>
                    <p>He appealed earnestly to all present in the name ot our oommon humanity, to
                        beopme connected with the committee, .that this great evil might be
                        suppressed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cooto's speech, which was delivered in Euglish, was repeated in French by
                        the chair­man, after which M. Stchelkoumouff, Russian Consul, spoke relative
                        to work done at the port of Odessa, aud stated that he had received
                        instructions from his Government to do all in his power to assist the
                        movement.</p>
                    <p>M. Sootidis, Greek Consul-General, spoke to the same effect, after which
                        Major Hopkinson stated some of the difficulties that lay in the way of
                        successfully proving the culpability aud bringing about the punishment of
                        the agents engaged in this traffic.</p>
                    <p>The following resolution was proposed by Mr. E. B. Gould, British
                        Consul-General, seconded by Baron Acton, Italian Consul- General and
                        unanimously carried :—</p>
                    <p>" That an International Committee for</p>

                        the day before yesterday, coming from Luxor on his way to Cairo. He spent

                    <p>Yesterday.the Assiout Court tried a very im­portant criminal case. The four
                        accused, to­gether with a number of others, planned to rob with violence Mr.
                        Bashra Hanna of his money, which they thought he was in the habit of sending
                        to Cairo every week. They carried out their plans in January last; but on
                        attackingMr. Hanna's carriage, they found to their astonish­ment that
                        instead of its containing money bags, the carriage was filled with soldiers
                        having loaded rifles. The police had heard of their . intention and had
                        accordingly taken pro; cautions. One of the brigands was captured, the rest
                        escaped. He refused to mention the names of his associates, but three others
                        were subsequently discovered.</p>

                        the Interior, and the Wekil of the Moudirieh attending. The pleadings

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.This
                        depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in January
                        may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as Sicily,
                        but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm than many
                        other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in the year,
                        for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to
                        go to on leaving Egypt are Sicily and Southern Spain. Venice and the
                        district (although they have many attractions) are not uniformly warm until
                        much later. Florence is very beautiful and full of interest, but sometimes
                        there are cold winds in the early spring.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short ones are as
                        follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the North German Lloyd, P &amp; O., Orient and Messageries
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 1/2 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without
                        change in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg. The most expensive
                        but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O. Brindisi express
                        from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from
                        Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian mails from
                        the great liner arrived from Bombay. These small but comfortable ships have
                        enormously powerful engines, and attain a very high rate of speed. They are
                        called the "Ferry Boats" having been specially built to carry the British
                        mail from Port Said to Brindisi. If you are going straight through to
                        England you will find the train waiting at Brindisi which will take you to
                        Calais without changing. It has complete arrangements for sleeping and
                        eating on board, and you should arrive in London on the fifth day from
                        leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>Southern Italy</head>
                    <p>The express goes north via Ancona, on the East coast, so that if you elect to
                        go to Naples and Rome you may possibly have to wait at Brindisi some time
                        for your train. At Brindisi there is nothing to see except the place which
                        is supposed to have been the termination of the Appian way from Rome. </p>
                    <p>From Brindisi to Naples is a journey of 11 hours, but it can be broken at
                        Taranto, two hours run from Brindisi.</p>
                    <p>Tarentum, founded in the 8th century B.C. by Spartans, was the first city of
                        Great Greece. It has had a varied and exciting history, and remains of fine
                        buildings - theatre, temple, circus and aqueduct - tell of its importance.
                        Its situation is the most picturesque. The bay is the only secure port on
                        the gulf, the entrance being so narrow that is it spanned by a bridge of a
                        seven arches.</p>
                    <p>Salerno lies on the coast and is one of the most beautiful places in Southern
                        Italy. On a height 905 feet above the sea stand the ruins of its Norman
                        castle, giving a most imposing appearance to the place. The cathedral
                        contains some very fine marble, and an 11th century Byzantine bronze door.
                        Salerno was at one time a seat of learning, its medical school being famous
                        ; the university was closed in 1817. You must visit Pastum's wonderful Greek
                        temples, which are second only to those at Athens. The travertine walls, the
                        gates, the Temples of Neptune and Ceres, and the Basilica are of surpassing
                        interest and the place is a happy hunting ground for the sketcher.</p>
                    <p>Naples is reached in an hour and a half. Thence you must proceed to Rome,
                        whence you may go by Florence and Bologna to Milan and the Italian Lakes;
                        then by the St. Gothard line to Lucerne, Basle and Calais. Or ou may go by
                        the coast, by Civita Vecchia and Pisu to Genoa and home by Turing and the
                        Mont Cenis route.</p>

                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA. </p>
                    <p>From Messina the railway runs along the north coast of Sicily to Palermo and
                        down the east coast to Syracuse via Taormina and Catania. TAORMINA is one of
                        the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the station
                        at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. The road goes winding up the hill in zig-zag
                        fashion, and charming views - more beautiful the higher one gets - are
                        unfolded to view. In and around the town is much to interest and visitor.
                        The theatre is of Greek origin, but restores under the Roamns. Catania is
                        the starting place for the ascent of Etna, beyond that there is little of
                        interest to the visitor. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are
                        found all over the island, are an endless source of pleasure. The finest are
                        at Syracuse and Girgenti on the south-west coast, and both places are well
                        worth visiting. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a Greek
                        city, which was besieged by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans
                        in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain - his tomb is to be seen. The
                        cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. There is a fine theatre, alaso
                        an amphitheatre and a temple to Diana, and the ruins of the great temple
                        dedicated to the Olympian Jove. Girgenti stands on a hill 900 feet high and
                        commands a magnificent view. The ancient ruins of Agrigentum are most
                        interesting - of the timeple to juno there are still many columns stnading.
                        There are also the remains of temples to Castor and Pollux, Theron, and the
                        enormous pillars of the temple to Jupiter Olympus. PALERMO, with about
                        300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful
                        climate Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The Palazzo Reale
                        of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S. Giovannia degli Eremiti
                        with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens,
                        Villa Guilia and and Royal Park are also worth a visit. Excursions from
                        Palermo should be made to Monreale to see the beautiful Cloisters, and to
                        Solunto, Cefalu, not forgetting also the Temples of Segesta and Selinunte.
                        With its lovely scenery and delightful climate, its antiquities and
                        beautiful vegetation, Sicily is certainly the most sttractive island in the
                        Mediterranean.</p>

                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its bay
                        — Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [or you can drive] will take you on to Capri. This rocky little island is
                        full of beautiful sea caves and grottoes, the exploring of which on a fine
                        day, in a small boat, is a most fascinating occupation. The colour of the
                        water is a perpetual joy, and the caves seem to be a veritable trap for
                        sunshine. Of flowers and ferns there are plenty. Ischia and Procida can be
                        visited in another little three or four days' trip from Naples. The steamers
                        start from Immacolatella. The views of the coast, of Posilipo, Pozzuoli and
                        Capo Miseno, are very fine. The little volcanic island of Procida is chiefly
                        inhabited by sailors. The island of Ischia comes next, a charming resort,
                        with mineral waters. The little harbour of Ischia, protected by its castle
                        on a promontorv, is a volcanic crater. Casamieciola is the place at which
                        you will stay, and from which you will make the ascent of Mount Epomeus for
                        a glorious view.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but a few hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting

                        of place : - St. Peter's, the Vatican, Capitol and National Museums, Gallery
                        of Modern Art, Villa Borghese, Doria, Colonna, and Lateran Palaces, Castle
                        of St. Angelo, and the Pagan Antiquities, consisting of the Colosseum, Roman
                        Forum, etc. </p>

                        churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local
                        promenades and excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most
                        attractive and fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei
                        Colli, one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding
                        up through the hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion
                        outside Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with the Monastery 3,300 feet above
                        the sea level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St.
                        Ellero, thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of
                        oaks takes about an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to
                        view.</p>
                    <p>The run down to Pisa from Florence can be made two ways; either by Pistoja
                        and Lucca or by Empoli. Lucea is one of the old fortified towns of Italy,
                        with an imposing wall built round it, and massive gates leading into the
                        town. Here is also the fine old Cathedral of St. Martino. In Pisa there is a
                        fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made, in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at sunset.
                        From Pisa there are good trains to Leghorn, where you can take boat to Genoa
                        and thence to the Riviera or Milan and The Lakes.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba). -The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest deathaverages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature —warm in winter and | deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and his-torical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>Genoa is the principal port on the Mediter-­ranean, and the first commercial
                        and shipping point of the Littoral, besides being the junction for the
                        arrival and departure for all the principal cities of Europe, the Orient,
                        and the United States, the Hamburg American, and North-German-Lloyd steamers
                        from New York, and the Continent of Europe en route to China and Japan, stop
                        at Genoa. The trains-de-luxe, and regular express trains from Paris and
                        other large Continental cities make connections at Genoa en route to the
                        Italian and French Rivieras, so that travellers to Rome, Naples, Alassio,
                        San Remo, Nice. Mentone, Monte Carlo, etc., can arrange to spend a few davs
                        in Genoa at one of its fine modern hotels. Genoa is built on steep hills
                        rising abruptly from the Mediterranean, and the gorgeous panoramic views
                        afforded from almost any terrace, street or building, must be seen to be
                        appreciated Electric trams traverse every part, and tend to add the
                        combination of the modern with all that is most ancient and in-teresting to
                        the American tourist, who is doubly interested in seeing the birthplace of
                        Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before: making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of of the Bible. The public gardens and the
                        monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hour journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most,
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is un-like that of any other seaport.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>From Venice you can go to Bologna via Padua; and then to Ravenna, one of the
                        most ancient towns in Italy. Between Bologna and Milan and only an
                        hour-and-a-half from Milan is SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on
                        account of its thermal springs, change trains at Borgo San-Donino, and in
                        half-an-hour you are at Salsomaggiore.</p>
                    <p>TYROL, INNSBRUCK, one of the finest and prettiest towns in the German
                        Austrian Mountains, is 600 metres above sea level, and has many interesting
                        features, both ancient and modern. It is admirably suited for spring and
                        summer residence, and is a good centre for excursions in the summer months.
                        There are three good railway services, via. Germany, Switzerland and Italy.
                        Electric tramcars run constantly to many places of local interest. The
                        Hotels are good, as also several Pensions, all being equipped with modern
                        requirements. Full particulars and information can be obtained from any of
                        Cook's offices.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza; also by tramway in two-and-a-half hours. The
                        cathedral, entirely of marble, is one of the finest in N. Italy—1426-1526
                        a.d.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Caddenubbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellagio opposite. These
                        four latter towns are in about the centre of the lake, and very close
                        together, and the walk from. Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to
                        Menaggio is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on
                        Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in
                        two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>
                    <p>Lake Maggiore is 37 miles long and varies in width from one-and-a-half miles
                        to three miles, and though the banks are not generally so mountainous as
                        those of the Lake of Como, the scenery is pretty and there are many
                        in-teresting spots-at which to stay.</p>
                    <p>Pallanza, opposite the Borromean Isles, is well situated for a fine view over
                        the Lake and the Alps. It is an interesting town and a good centre for
                        making a tour round the Lake. Steamers are very frequent to all other towns
                        up or down the Lake. Taking the steamer from Pallanza for Stresa, you call
                        at Baveno, a pretty little spot where Queen Victoria stayed in 1879. Then
                        you come to the most charming feature of this part of the Lake, the
                        Borromean Islands. Isola Superiore is only a fishing hamlet, but Isola Bella
                        is a picture. The castle was built in the 17th century and is worth visiting
                        as well as the grounds. Stresa, the next stopping place by the steamer, is
                        cooler and has a better air than places on the opposite side of the Lake, so
                        that for the summer months it is a more preferable spot at which to
                        stay.</p>

                    <head>Route III. Switzerland</head>
                    <p>Switzerland, the heart of Europe, has been described as "A cluster of
                        delights and granduers." The country has an area of only 15,720 square
                        miles, and borders on France, Germany, Austria and Italy. It also has the
                        proud distinction of being the source of three of Europe's biggest waterways
                        - the rivers Rhine, Danube and Rhone. Mountains and lakes occupy almost the
                        whole of Switzerland, there being practically no flat land or plains. The
                        mountains or Alps are divided into three groups, the Pennine Alps, Helvetic
                        Alps, and the Rhoetic Alps. The principal lakes are Constance, Geneva,
                        Zurich, Lucerne and Neuchatel, then the lakes of Bienne, Thun, Brienz and
                        Zug. The glaciers of Switzerland occupy about one-eighteenth of the space,
                        and are about 400 in number, the principal of which is the Aletsch Glacier.
                        There are also waterfalls of importance, such as the Rhine at Schaffhausen,
                        the Aar at Handeck, Staubbach and Pletschbach at Lauterbrunnen, etc.,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>Certain points are renowned for the view and may be selected as follows: -
                        Col de la Faucille, near M. Reculets and M. Dole, above St. Cergue near
                        Geneva, Chaumont above Neuchatel, Macolin above Bienne, the Hauen-steing
                        above Olten, Albis between Zurich and Zug, Rigi between Zug and Lucerne,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>It depends very much on the point at which Switzerland is first entered which
                        is to be the first stopping place; also whether the tour is on bicycle or
                        foot, as naturally the cyclist wishes to be ever going from place to place
                        and never turning back along the same road. But as centres for seeing the
                        beauties and charms of each certain district the following may be helpful to
                        visitors:- LAUSANNE as centre for Montreux, Vevey, Neuchatel, St. Maurice,
                        Martigny, Aigle, Bex. etc. INTERLAKEN for the Bernese Oberland, Grindelwald,
                        Murren, Lake Brienz, Thun, etc. CHUR for the Engadine, St. Mortiz, Davos
                        Platz, Pontresina, Klosters, Ragatz, etc. ZURICH, Dolder, Schaffhausen.</p>
                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M, de Caprino and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>The Piazza Giardino, with its promenade and fountains, is close to the
                        landing stage. A broad quay, the favorite promenade, extends the whole
                        length of the town along the shores of the lake. In the Santa Maria degli
                        Angiolo is a fresco of the Passion, the finest work of Bernardino Luini
                        (1529). There are many interesting excursions to be made into the
                        surrounding neighbourhood. MONTE GENEROSO, about 5,600 feet, is reached by
                        taking steamer or train from Lugano to Capolago, then the mountain railway,
                        which runs to the summit. The view is magnificent, being one of the finest
                        in the Lombard Alps. Monte Salvatore is ascended by railway from Lugano
                        Paradiso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from Bel-inzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate, and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna de Sasso, situated above the
                        town is worth a visit, as it contains interst-ing paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and "The Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>
                    <p>LUCERNE. - A striking picture on the Lake of Lucerne is surrounded by walls
                        with nine watch towers facing the Rigi and Pilatus and the snow-clad Alps.
                        Seven bridges cross the Reuss, but the two old ones, the Kapell Brucke and
                        Muhlen Brucke are of interest. Both have roofs, the former painted with
                        scenes from the letter with a Dance of Death. The old water tower near the
                        Kapell Brucke used to be a lighthouse or "Lucerna," giving its name to the
                        town. In and around the town the walks are charming, and the excursions to
                        be made from Lucerne by boat, rail, etc., are very numerous. Places of
                        interest in the town are the Hof Kirche, dating from the 16th Century, the
                        Lion of Lucerne Monument, near which is also an interesting garden,
                        containing signs of glacier-worn rocks of a remote ice period. In the
                        Bathaus is a Museum (War and Peace Museum) should also be visited.</p>
                    <p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful excursions, those to the Rigi,
                        Pilatus, Burgent stock and Sonnenberg, needing a special visit each. Other
                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>The Rigi is a famous ridge between the Lakes Lucerne and Zug. The view is
                        unsur-passed for extent and magnificence, including the view of 13 lakes,
                        the Oberland, and many of the distant Alps. The sunset view is much finer
                        than sunrise, and is best seen from the Roth-stock. Sunrise from Kulum.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of
                        Lucerne, commands magnificent views of the lake and mountain scenery. Along
                        the Lake of Uri from Brunnen to Fluelen runs the famous Axenstrasse.</p>
                    <p>SEELISBERG is on the opposite shore to Brunnen, and with the Sanitorium of
                        Sonnen-berg forms one of the famous health resorts of the Lake of
                        Lucerne</p>
                    <p>THE BURGENSTOCK may be reached in two ways; either by steamer from Lucerne to
                        Kehrsiten, then the cable railway to the crest of Burgenstock; or the other
                        way is to go to Stannstad by boat, and then drive up the fine new road. From
                        Stannstad it is about 1 hour 40 minutes by electric railway to ENGLEBERG.
                        The ascent of Titlis is made from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps
                        is grand, extending from Monte Rosa to the Black Forest, and from the Santis
                        to the Matterhorn.</p>
                    <p>ZURICH, capital of Canton Zurich, is beautifully situated in a mountain
                        valley 1,300 ft above the sea. As a commercial tewn t is perhaps the most
                        important in Switzer-land, having extensive manufactures in silk, cotton,
                        and machinery. The old town is still picturesque, but is gradually being
                        replaced by modern private dwellings and public buildings, amongst which is
                        the Federal Polytechnic School and University. An interesting excur-sion is
                        that to the Zurichberg 2,000 ft. above the sea, from which a fine sunset
                        view can be obtained. Another favourite place is the Uttli-berg, about 6
                        miles south-west of Zurich.</p>

                        made. The view of the snow-covered Alps and glaciers obtained from the
                        railway to Gornergrat is really magnificent.</p>
                    <p>Eggshorn is a high mountain resort on the Brigue-Rhone Glacier road, whence
                        the ascent of the Jungfrau is made quite easily. There are also numerous

                    <p>Many people visit Greece after wintering in Egypt, as it is so easily reached
                        from Alex-andria; the climate in April is charming. Steamers run frequently
                        both to Putras, and the Piraeus - which is the port for Athens. The
                        advantage of disembarking at the latter place is that it is but five miles
                        from Athens, which may be reached in twenty minutes by train; while the
                        railway journey from Patras takes about 7 1/2 hours. The best steamers are
                        those of the Khedival Mail Co. Greece is also very easily reached from
                        either Smyrna or Constan-tinople; and there are frequent sailings by
                        excellent steamers.</p>
                    <p>The first and most important sit to visit in ATHENS is, of course, the
                        Acropolis - a rocky platform upon which were built some of the most famous
                        buildings of classic times. Ascend-ing the great staircase, 70 ft. wide, and
                        passing throuhg the Gateway built of marble from Pentelicus the Parthenon is
                        reached - dedicated to Pa'las Athene by Pericles cir. 444 B.C., and adorned
                        with priceless sculptures, many of which are now in the British Museum.
                        There is the Erechtheion with its celebrated Caryatides; the Theseion and
                        the beautiful little Temple of the Wingless Vistory. Close to the Acropolis
                        lies Mars Hill, celebrated as the site where St. Paul preached to the
                        Athenians, and where the Athenians held their public cCourt. On the Pnyx
                        immediatley behind they assembled their meetings. On the south and
                        south-east sides of the Acropolis are the beautiful columns of the Temple of
                        Jupiter Olympus and the triumphal arch of Hadrian, the Temple of Aesculapius
                        and the two ancient theatres - the Odeum, and the Theatre of Dionysus which
                        is well preserved. These are but a few of the interesting buildings of
                        ancient Athens.</p>
                    <p>If possible tourists should arrange to be in Athens for the Orthodox Easter
                        in order to witness the Good Friday and Easter Eve ceremonies, and to be
                        present at the dancing on the Easter Tuesday festival held at Megara, for
                        which a special train is run from Athens.</p>
                    <p>A charming trip can be made to Corinth by train (3 hours) through lovely
                        scenery, and on to Mycenae, where can be seen the celebrated Tomb of Atreus
                        and the Gate of Lions at the entrnce to Agamemmnons's Palace. From here it
                        is quite possible to drive via Argos to Nauplia in the day. This is an
                        interesting town, and the surrounding scenery is lovely. A pleasant
                        afternoon's drive can be made to Tiryns with its Cyclopoean masonry, and to
                        Argos with fine amphitheatre cut in the natural rock, and Acropolis 1,000
                        ft. above sea level. Epidaurus with its Temple of Aesculapius and very
                        perfect amphitheatre is well worth the day's driving excursion. From Nauplia
                        you can get to Olympia by rail via Pyrgos - the scenery is most picturesque.
                        It is here that the celebrated Olympic games were help from B.C. 776 to A.D.
                        394 - the stadium is very perfect. The ruins of the Temple of Jupiter are
                        quite splendid. The famous statue of Hermes is here. Patras is reached from
                        Pyrgos by rail in ofur hours, from which port steamers to all parts of
                        Europe run frequently. A charming trip can be made among the Ionian islands,
                        Zanta, Cephalonia, etc. It is worth while to spend a few days in CORFU on
                        account of the beauty of the scenery. There is also good snipe and quail
                        shooting to be had.</p>
                    <p>You will get at Alexandria vessels belonging to different lines that will
                        take you by various routes to Constantinople. The Khedivial stea-mers go by
                        Piraeus for visiting Athens.</p>
                    <p>It is a great advantage to see Constantinople for the first time from the
                        sea, the view of the city fom the Golden Horn being magnificent</p>
                    <p>The chief things to see in Constantinople are the Mosque of San Sophia, the
                        Golden Horn and the Valley of Sweet Waters.</p>
                    <p>Smyrna is a thriving commercial port, at which many steamers call. Many
                        charming excursions can be made from it; to the Cyclo-poean Cities of
                        Nymphaeum and Sipylus and the rock-cut City of Niobe near Magnesia; the
                        Baths of Diana and Agamemnon; and the Meles Valley, where may be seen the
                        Chair and Cave of Homer and a fire double-arched acqueduct.</p>
                    <p>there is a railway to Ephesus where there is a good Hotel and Restaurant kept
                        by an Englishman. The ruins of the Great Temple of Diana are about
                        three-quarters of a mile distant. Of the "Seven churches of Asia." five are
                        ac-cessible by tain from Smyrna. Laodicea can be reached from Alascheir
                        which is 50 miles distant by rail and is the site of Philadelphus.</p>
                    <p>This is a beautiful old City at the foot of Mt. Tmolus; it was built in B.C.
                        160 by Attalus Philadelphus, last King of Pergamos.</p>

                    <head>Palestine and Syria</head>
                    <p>The nearest port from Egypt in Jaffa, the ancient Joppa. You can take steamer
                        from Alexandria or Port Said to Jaffa or any of the Syrian ports. Probably
                        the largest steamers on route are those of the Messageries Maritimes. There
                        are Austrian Lloyd, and Khedivial steamers, and also occasional Moss, and
                        Price line steamers. You must on no account forget to obtain a special
                        passport for Palestine before leaving Egypt, or you will find much
                        difficulty at the ports.</p>
                    <p>The landing at Jaffa is most exciting. As there is no harbour, the steamer
                        drops anchor as near as she safely can to the shore, and large row boats
                        come out to take off the passengers. A great reef through which there is
                        only one small opening protects the coast, and the interesting moment is the
                        passing through this opening in the row boat. There is not much to detain
                        you at Jaffa, though there are two excellent hotels outside the town. There
                        is a railway to Jerusalem, also an excellent carriage road, the drive
                        occupying about eight hours.</p>
                    <p>The trip from Jerusalem to Jericho can be made by carriage or by riding. The
                        drive is very fine, the views of the steep ravine of the Wady Kelt (the Book
                        Cherith) with the monastery clinging to its side, and of the Dead Sea and
                        Jordan Valley being very fine.</p>
                    <p>Fom Jerusalem to Damascus by land, is a camping tour of about a fortnight.
                        The route is by Nablous - the ancient Samaritan Shechem - Jenin, Haifa,
                        (Mount Carmel), Nazareth, Tiberias, Tell Hum (Capernaum), Safed and Banias
                        (Caesarea Philippi). There are other camping expeditions possible from
                        Jerusalem, as, from Jerusalem via Nazareth and Haifa, Tyre and Sidon to
                        Beyrout, whence there is a rail to Damascus.</p>
