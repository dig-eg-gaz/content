                        country might be proud, and upon whose judgment the public has been in the
                        habit of placing absolute and unquestioning reliance. To the initiative and
                        capacity of this department we owe the conception and accomplishment of one
                        of the grandest engineering feats which the modern world has witnessed. But
                        it may reasonably be asked whether the preservation of the river's depth at
                        its normal and requisite level, the maintenance of its banks in an efficient
                        state of repair, and the counteracting of its dangerous and impeding
                        currents between Assouan and Alexandria, is not a duty which, though far
                        more modest and less imposing than the erection of dams and reservoirs, is
                        equally essential of fulfilment Can it be that we have been sleeping the
                        sleep of the seven sleepers all this while, only to be rudely awakened by
                        the clarion tones of Sir William's perturbing though timely warning? Has the
                        idol that we have so long venerated nothing but feet of clay, which his
                        well-directed blows have shattered to atoms? Englishmen, to whatever class
                        they belong, are, as a rule, slow to condemn. Their inborn and unquenchable
                        love of justice and fair-play operates as an effective curb upon their
                        impulses. Their strong sense of gratitude likewise makes them prone to look
                        with leniency upon the shortcomings of those who have rendered faithful
                        service to the public. It is, on the other hand, hard to believe that Sir
                        William Preece has been guilty of mere wanton fault finding, and it is still
                        harder to conceive that he should allow himself to give utterance to a hasty
                        censure. Regard for his own professional reputation would, presumably, have
                        restrained him from hazarding opinions formed without a due and accurate
                        knowledge of all the facts. Taking all these circumstances into account, it
                        is but natural that his strictures should hate evoked a feeling of anxiety.
                        Nothing will allay the uneasiness of the public but a clear and conclusive
                        refutation of his charges of neglect, pronounced by experts of equal
                        eminence and independence, and to this end a committee of investigation
                        should be forthwith appointed whose standing and impartiality could not
                        reasonably be challenged.</p>

                        <p>We are authorised by the Postmaster-General to con tradict the statement
                            made by a Cairo newspaper to the effect that some irregularities had
                            been discovered at the Cairo Post Office in regard to the theft of
                            stamps from envelopes. The person, who has been found to have
                            perpetrated these thefts, is not an official in the Postal
                            Administration, but a public letter-writer whose station is in front of
                            the Abbassieh barracks. Thanks to the Post Office officials, who
                            detected the fraud, the man has been arrested.. Whenever the
                            letter-writer was entrusted with letters to post, which in the course of
                            his duties was of frequent occurrence, he used to steal the stamps and
                            'destroy the letters. Many complaints have been made to the G.P.O. on
                            the subject and great inconvenience has resulted trom this form of
                            pilfering.</p>

                            night, before a very large au dience. The chair was taken by the Rev. H.
                            P. Reid. Miss MunGavin charmed her audience with her pretty songs: her
                            rendering of "Sing me to sleep" left nothing to be desired.
                            Mr.Sarjeant's songs were well chosen and richly deserved the encores he
                            received; he aleo played a pianoforte solo, "The Festal March," which
                            did great credit to the composer, his sister (M. A Dandridge) Mr.
                            Purvis's songs were uproar iously encored, and the deep bass voice of
                            Mr. P. Smith was much admired. The Rev. Wormell contributed to the
                            programme by singing and playing a banjo solo, and Mr. Manning also
                            played a banjo selection accom panied by Mr. Wood. Mrs. Roberts' singing
                            and her accompaniment of most of the songs were greatly appreciated. The
                            singing of a duet by Miss MunGavin and Mrs. Roberts brought to a close a

                        obvious at all the race meetings, the second day of the K.S.C.'s Third
                        Winter Meeting was a decided success. There was a large number of visitors
                        and residents present, among them H.R.H. Prince Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden
                        and Norway, Mr. M. de C. Findlay, C.M.G., Sir Ernest Cassel, Azzet Pasha,

                        the end of the</p>
                    <p>races.</p>
                    <p>The racing was decidedly interesting. The first and second races gave the
                        best finishes, but the fourth was perhaps the most impor tant of the day,
                        terminating in a good win for Farban II. The struggle for third place was
                        desperately close, Kashid and Roi de l'Air being very little behind Moofid.
                        In the sixth race Latiff added another to his long list of victories, Saber,
                        who was fancied for a place,, failing to stay against London, while Plevna,
                        carrying lowest weight, was a rather unexpected second. The Steeplechase was
                        spoiled by the small field, only three horses running, of which Soudfi was a

                    <byline>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT).</byline>
                    <dateline>Helouan, Friday.</dateline>
                    <p>A very interesting lecture was given to-day at the Tewfik Palace Hotel by the
                        Hon. Auberon Herbert, on curious stones found in the neighbourhood. A large
                        number of visitors were present. Mr. Herbert is evidently an authority on
                        the subject. He showed some very strange figures in stone representing the
                        heads of various people. In some of them the outline of the face and
                        headgear of different types of persons could very clearly be traced. Of
                        course, one must have, to a certain extent, an educated eye to distinguish
                        between the head of a fighting man and that of a holy man. Some of the
                        stones were very strongly marked, whilst others required a great deal of
                        imagination to make anything out of them. Mr. Herbert, who is no doubt a
                        most able speaker, made the subject very attractive. One could have listened
                        to him for a much longer time. However, we hope this will not be the last
                        time we shall have the pleasure of hearing him and seeing more of his
                        curious specimens.</p>

                        parts of the opera with storms of applause. Signore Bellincioni and Svicher

                    <p>The Anglo-American Company's beautiful hotel at Assouan has been crowded with
                        distinguished visitors throughout the season; indeed, never before has the
                        hotel been so fall. Among the prominent visitors at present there are the
                        Earl and Countess Howe, Lady Sarah Wilson, Mrs. Cassel, Sir Edward and Lady
                        Colebrooke, Hon. J. Ward, Sir Gerald Fitzgerald, Hon. W. G. Calthorpe, Hon.

                    <p>Lady Howe has been improving greatly in health since her arrival in Egypt,
                        and her stay at Assouan is doing her an immense amount of good. As most of
                        us know, she was Lady Georgina Spencer-Churchill, and is an aunt of the
                        present Duke of Marlborough. For many years she was known in London as Lady
                        "Georgie" Curzon, and has been one of the most notable figures of the waning
                        years of the nineteenth century. In the strictest sense of the word, Lady
                        Howe did "yeoman" service during the South African war, by means of her
                        strenuous exertions in equipping and sending out field hospitals for the use
                        of the Imperial Yeomanry. Then, before her illness of last summer, she was
                        one of the best riders and most wonderful "whips" in England, and used often
                        to be seen tooling her four-in-hand in the park or at Hurlingham. And since
                        her husband's accession to the earldom Lady Howe has been one of the
                        smartest of London hostesses. Both she and her sister, Lady Sarah Wilson,
                        are personal friends of King Edward, and she has entertained him many times
                        in London and in the country. On one occasion, when the King and Queen were
                        dining with her at Curzon House, she executed a tour de force in the way of
                        floral decoration. The dining-room was decorated with Gopsall roses for
                        dinner, and at supper, after a small dance, it appeared freshly adorned with
                        pink, ivy-leaved geraniums.</p>

                    <p>"THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT BEING TRUSTEE FOR EGYPT AND THE EGYPTIAN PEOPLE......
                        -Sir Howard Vincent, M.P.</p>
                    <p>It is refreshing to read such words as these "from the lips of a Conservative
                        member of Parliament who has recently visited Egypt, especially as they were
                        uttered in connection with such a topic as the suggested second Suez Canal.
                        Of late we have been treated to a lot of tall talk from irresponsible
                        writers, as to Egypt being "virtually a possession of the British Empire,"
                        etc., and it is well to be reminded that we are simply here as TRUSTEES for
                        the Egyptian people.</p>
                    <p>No term could more htly express our position in this country, and I am
                        surprised that it has not been freely adopted in what has been written and
                        said about the relations of England and Egypt to one another. Let us for a
                        moment glauce back to what gave rise to the British occupation.</p>
                    <p>Egypt was bankrupt under her spendthrift ruler, Ismail. Money was being wrung
                        from the people by the most exorbitant taxes that could be levied on the
                        fellaheen, and the foreign bondholders were clamorous for payment of their
                        dividends. England and France established a co-trusteeship under the name of
                        the Dual Control, and proceeded to reduce chaos to order. As trustees they
                        administered the finances of the country till 1882, when France no longer
                        cared to act, and withdrew, leaving the British nation sole trustee.</p>
                    <p>How well the trust has been executed let the present state of the country
                        testily. Under British guidance Egypt has become prosperous in the extreme,
                        and every one looks forward to a still fuller development in the future, and
                        a greater expansion in every way than in the past.</p>
                    <p>But England as trustee has a greater mission than a merely financial one, and
                        when every department of her ward's Government depends upon the advice of
                        experienced Englishmen, the trusteeslip resolves itself into guardianship, a
                        far wider responsibility, and one that opens out in every direction save
                        one, the control of foreign affairs, for Egypt is still under the suzerainty
                        of the Sultan and takes no share in discussing and settling foreign
                        questions.</p>
                    <p>That England will eventually abuse the trust reposed in her by acting as a
                        dishonest guardian. and appropriating to herselt her ward's estate, --in
                        other words will add Egypt to the British Empire-I, for one refuse to admit
                        to be in even the remotest degree possible. But will she succeed in
                        restoring to Egypt some of her ancient power? Whue Assyria, Persia, Greece,
                        Rome, and Islam have faued to make their rule over the country permanent,
                        will England by careful training succeed in giving to the Egyptians the
                        quality in which they have hitherto shown themselves to be so lamentably
                        wanting, that of the power of selfgovernment?</p>
                    <p>I see no reason why our future endeavour should not be to foster National
                        aspirations, and, frankly vowing our intention of developing Egypt for the
                        Egyptians, mould our policy in the direction of building up a new Egypt on
                        entirely new lines; lines on which territoria aggrandisement of ourselves
                        shall have no piace whatever.</p>
                    <p>We cannot, it is true, close the mouths or check the pens of those
                        irresponsible people who are always on the look-out for chances to do
                        mischief, and thwart an enlightened policy, but after all they can be safely
                        ignored, aud their powers or doing harm are exceedingly limited. Nobody pays
                        much heed to their vapourings.</p>
                    <p>But still such suggestions as those made by a corespondent of the "Morning
                        Post," signing himself "Pharoah," must cause needless irrita tion, and it
                        would much help to promote goou feeling, if editors of leading English
                        newspapers would abstain from printing such utterly senseless effusions.
                        They can only be written with one object, viz., the sowing of discord.</p>
                    <p>There is a yet more dangerous class who may work almost irreparable mischief,
                        and seriously retard the work of those respousible for the good government
                        of Egypt. And the worst of it is that this class is to a very great extent
                        (I wish I could say entirely) composen of earnest, well-meaning men, anxious
                        to do all the good they can, though often singularly wanting in tact.
                        Blinded by the worst of al prejudices, viz., religious ones, they have bu
                        one central aim before them, the conversion of all to their way of thinking
                        and their concep tion of what is truth. I mean, of course, missionaries.</p>
                    <p>The harm done by these men, the hatreds aroused, the embarrassments they have
                        caused their Governments, the little wars they have <cb n="2"/> been, not
                        only the indirect, but in some cases the direct cause of, let history
                        tell.</p>
                    <p>Well may "An Observer" remark (in his letter to the "Gazette" published 10th
                        inst.) on the question of missions to Mohamedans, "The matter must be dealt
                        with from the standpoint not of the devoted missionary, whose outlook
                        politically is limited, but from that ot the well-informed, trained, and
                        impartial observer who realises the gravity of the situation."</p>
                    <p>Another correspondent, apropos of Mr. MacInnes's recent letter, writes, "It
                        seems surprising than an English clergyman should be unwilling to state
                        publicly the results of missionary effort. Can it be that the methods
                        employed will not always bear the light 1"</p>
                    <p>And he goes on to say, "An incident which came under my personal notice
                        rather favors that view. A young girl used to be employed by my wife to do
                        needlework. Remarking ber semitro appearance, my wife had the curiosity to
                        ask her to what race she belonged. The child replied, 'We were all born
                        Jews, but the missionaries offered to give us tree schooling it we would
                        become Christians.. As we were too poor to pay for schooling we all became
                        Christians. This reminds me of Gilbert's immortal verse</p>
                    <p>'Be Christian you instead of Jew,</p>
                    <p>Become a Christian Kid.'</p>
                    <p>And so they did."</p>
                    <p>But, as usual, I am running away on a side issue, and as I have already
                        exceeded my usual limits of space, I must reserve till next week some
                        further remarks on England's Trusteeship. T. A.</p>

                        <p>MISSIONS TO MOHAMEDANS.</p>
                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE. Sir,-Permit me to add my humble
                            quota of testimony on the above mooted question. If I am not mistaken,
                            there has ever been, and there ever will be, but one religion in the
                            world. The text (James 1., 27) is, as I think, the only one in the Bible
                            where religion is defined. It says nothing about belief, creed,
                            profession, or ceremonial observances. It makes religion purely a matter
                            of right character and right conduct. Whosoever displays these, whether
                            in or out of the established church, has, it seems to me, genuine
                            religion, and is a loyal child of God. In this, Christianity seems to go
                            beyond its name.</p>
                        <p>We are learning to put the emphasis on the right place-on what a man is,
                            and not on what he believes. We are beginning to realise that salvation
                            is not a property to be bought, but to be developed, a taséut to be
                            traded with, an ideal to be realised, a theme to be worked out "with
                            tear and tremoling;" and that the great teaching of Christ's life is the
                            recognition of the spiritual part of our nature, and the need for
                            fostering it.</p>
                        <p>To realise this ultimate end, mankind needs a system of worship, a system
                            teaching of divine ethics, of personal ethics, and of social
                            righteousness. Intelligent and enlightened men will have the best. The
                            supremacy must be given to the one system of worship which satisfies
                            man's supreme spiritual necessities. And if we are to judge things by
                            their results, the Christian system of worship, undoubtedly, stands
                            pre-eminent. It makes the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man
                            its watchword, charity its motto, and love the mainspring of all its
                            activity and intercourse.</p>
                        <p>A careful study of the situation makes it evident that the Christian
                            system of worship is passing through a transition state, putting off
                            antiquated dogmas, customs, and methods, and adopting itself to the
                            modern world, and transforming itself so as to better accomplish its
                            work, both in the church and in the world. It is gratifying to see that
                            now-a-days greater attention is given to Christian ethics and sociology
                            than ever before Holy love in principle and practice, in the liberty of
                            selfacrifice, is better understood now, thau ever before.</p>
                        <p>No Christian can answer the question of "Missions to Mohamedans" or to
                            others except in the words of his Master:"To this end have 1 been born,
                            and to this end am I come into the world that I should bear witness unto
                            the Truth." I believe it is our high privilege a well as our bounden
                            duty to pass on the truth, in word and in deed, to those that know it
                            not No work could be more noble and ennobling. On the other hand, there
                            can be no questio: that an ordained missionary always occupies a very
                            delicate position. He must be, first of all a man of true Christiau
                            instinct; he must be a man of ripe judgment and of the greatest tact; he
                            must work by a system of organised and proportioned methods, based upon
                            definite knowledge of the material to be wrought up n. He may,
                            sometimes, need "the courage of a Paul, the patience of a Job, the
                            fidelity of a Stephen, the vehemence of a John the Baptist, the wisdom
                            of an archangel, and the spirit, sweetness, and fearlessness of Jesus to
                            reach ideal success." A WELL-WISHER. Alexandria, February 22.</p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
                        <p>Sir,-As a sign of progress in Egypt, I am pleased to note the prominence
                            given, of late, in several papers, to the temperance question. I also
                            commend the liberality of the "Gazette" in giving space in its columns
                            for the discussion of various moral and religious questions. This is as
                            it should be. Truth never suffers when contrasted with error. And no one
                            thing is of greater value to this country at the present time, than its
                            right relation to this same question of temperance. Therefore, I cannot
                            permit to pass unchallenged the intimation, by one of your contributors
                            in your issue of Feb. 18, that the Bible gives support to the practice
                            of moderate drinking. I know that this is a favorite contention of those
                            who desire justification for the "social glass;" and to the casual
                            reader, such contention may seem valid: but to the Bible student who
                            regards the general tenor of Scripture teaching rather than the partial
                            argument which may appear to be drawn from isolated texts, and who,
                            moreover, does not feel bound to sanction, at all hazards, popular
                            social customs, a very different view presents itself.</p>
                        <p>The writer above referred to has given, perhaps unconsciously, an
                            excellent illustration of his own statement that "it is so easy to read
                            the meaning we want a passage of Scripture to convey into it," by
                            referring to St. John 2: 1-11 as a "telling incident" in favor of the
                            moder ate use of alcoholic liquors. It would be interesting to read an
                            argument based on the miracle of Cana in favor of moderate drinking,
                            that did not deal largely in assumptions. From his point of view the
                            passage proves altogether too much. One hundred and twenty gallons of
                            wine contributed to a wedding feast near its close, when the guests had
                            already been imbibing quite freely, scarcely looks like an act in favor
                            of moderate drinking.</p>
                        <p>"How one might euiarge on this !" Yes, one might. But it is this very
                            enlarging on the Word of God that has toisted so many errors upon
                            Christendom. The Bible is without doubt the worst abused book in the
                            world. The most soul and body-destroying evils have claimed the sanction
                            of its sacred pages. Christian statesmen in Russia argue from it the
                            divine right of kings to tyrannise over the bodies and souls of their
                            subjects. Christian preachers in the United States, prior to 1865,
                            justified human slavery by appealing to God's Word. And thousands of
                            professed believers in the inspi- ration of the Bible yet claim its
                            support in the degrading practice of polygamy. In like manner" some
                            Christian clergymen in Eugland and on the Continent attempt to justuy
                            the moderate use of spirituous liquors by the writings of Solomon, the
                            words of Paul, or the example of Jesus. Such teaching, if viewed in the
                            light of practical results, will be seen to be not fardistantly related
                            to the practice, so justly condemned, of those "who, unfortunately, deem
                            it consistent with the preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, to sell
                            this, vile stuff (cheap distilled spirits) to the natives among whom
                            they labour." For a man can get as gloriously drunk on "good" wine as on
                            cheap spirits; and moderate drinking is the training school for
                            drunkards. That a large percentage never graduate does not save from
                            drunkards' graves the tens of thousands who do. No, "moderate drinking"
                            has been weighed in the balance of human experience, and found wanting.
                            It is justified neither by the Scriptures, the teaching of physiological
                            science, nor by human experience.</p>
                        <p>Another very dangerous suggestion, as I view it, is contained in the
                            statement that "what was said 1900 years ago, is of little value in.
                            considering present-day questions." And this with reference to the
                            teaching of the Bible! I must confess surprise that any one really
                            interested in moral or social reforms should take such a position. To
                            eliminate the teaching of the Book of books from the discussion of all
                            present-day questions, social, moral, or religious! But where will you
                            find a higher standard of morality, purer social ethics, or more just
                            laws? But this is too large a question to discuss in this article. If
                            space is permitted, I should be only too happy to defend the above
                            positions.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, let me say to the temperance workers of Egypt, if you
                            desire permanence in the results of your efforts do not fail to wield
                            the "sword of the spirit, which is the word of God." It is your most
                            potent weapon, notwithstanding the disparaging remarks made concerning
                            it.-Yours for total abstinence, W. H. WAKEHAM, (Director of S.D.A.

                        victims or more, the efficiency of Peruna in quickly relieving this malady
                        and its after-effects has been the talk of the continent."</p>
                    <p>IKE A DEMON grip has crossed our country, leaving behind scores of physical
                        wrecks.</p>
                    <p>Victims of catarrh of the head, catarrh of the throat, catarrh of the lungs,

                        catarrh, and sows the seed of chronic catarrh within the system.</p>
                    <p>This is so true that few grip sufferers are able to make a complete recovery
                        until they have used Peruna.</p>
                    <p>Never in the history of medicine has a remedy received such unqualified and
                        universal eulogies as Peruna,</p>

                    <p>"La grippe has entered thousands of our homes this fall, and I noticed that
                        the people who used Peruna were quickly restored, while those who depended
                        on doctor's prescriptions, spent weeks in recovering, leaving them weak
                        and</p>
                    <p>emaciated.</p>
                    <p>"I had a slight attack of la grippe and at once took Peruna, which drove

                    <p>"Following a severe attack of la grippe I seemed to be affected badly all
                        over. I suffered with a severe backache, indigestion and numerous ills, so I
                        could neither eat nor sleep, and I thought I would give up my work, which I
                        could not afford to do.</p>
                    <p>"One of my customers who was greatly helped by Perpins advised me to try it,
                        and I procured a bottle the same day. I used it faithfully and felt a marked
                        improvement. During the next two months I took five bottles, and then felt
                        splendid. Now my head is clear, my nerves steady, I enjoy food, and rest
                        well. Pe runa has been worth a dollar a dose to me."-D. L. Wallace.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Galloway Weir, M.P., has received the following letter from the Secretary
                        of State for Foreign Affairs:</p>
                    <p>--</p>
                    <p>"Foreign Office, Feb. 13, 1905.</p>
                    <p>"Sir, With reference to your letter of the 14th ult., I am directed by the
                        Marquis of Lansdowne to inform you that a despatch has been received from
                        his Majesty's Agent and Consul-General at Cairo respecting the steps taken
                        by the Egyptian Government to protect Egyptian pilgrims to Mecca who do not
                        accompany the Mahmal. In view of the ill-treatment suffered by Egyptian
                        pilgrims during the last pilgrimage, the Khedive caused representations to
                        be addressed on two occasions to the Turkish Government, and reports have
                        since been received that they have made some attempt to establish order
                        along the route of the pilgrimage. Lord Cromer observes that the Egyptian
                        Government cannot be held responsible for the maintenance of order in
                        Turkish Arabia. In these circumstances the only means within their control
                        of securing protection to Egyptian pilgrims was to induce as many as posable
                        to accompany the Mahmal, the escort of which has been considerably
                        strengthened. Lord Cromer calls particular attention to the fact that the
                        charge paid by pilgrims accompanying the Mahmal has not increased, as
                        erroneous statements have appeared on this subject in the Press. His
                        lordship adds that the popularity of these measures is sufficiently shown by
                        the fact that the number's accompanying the Mahmal have increased from 693
                        Last year to 1,605 this year.-I am, Sir, &amp;c., EGORST."</p>

                    <p>LES RELATIONS MARITIMES ENTRE ANVERS ET ALEXANDRIE</p>
                    <p>UN GROS PROCES</p>
                    <p>Quatre lignes anversoises, dont deux sont 1 nglaises, Wescott Line, Prince
                        Line,-une alle- aande, Deutsche Levante Linie,-et une belge, Adolf Deppe,
                        dasservent le commerce très dé- eloppé de la Belgique avec l'Orient. Elles
                        se ont syndiquées et font la loi au public.</p>
                    <p>Une très importante maison de commerce de Bruxelles, F. Lambert et Cie,
                        résolut d'ex- loiter le même filon productif et créa, l'an lernier, la
                        Sphinx Line. Le syndicat fut obligé, raison de cette concurrence, de baisser
                        ses prix de 30%. Mais il fallait surtout tâcher de 'en prendre à quelqu'un,
                        de trouver ou d'in- enter un coupable à qui faire supporter les pertes.
                        Anvers ne pouvait tolérer cette inno- vation de Bruxelles dans les affaires
                        mariti- mes. La maison belge Lambert et Ralli d'Alex- Andrie parut désignée
                        au syndicat pour servir He bouc émissaire.</p>
                    <p>Liée au syndicat pour l'année 1904 par un contrat qui l'obligeait à fournir
                        un minimum He transports, la maison Lambert et Ralli avait ponctuellement
                        remplit ses obligations. Mais elle portait presque le même nom que la mai-
                        son F. Lambert et Cie de Bruxelles, elle était son amie, et l'on connait la
                        morale du Loup de La Fontaine.</p>
                    <p>Si ce n'est toi, c'est donc ton frère!</p>
                    <p>Procès du syndicat contre les deux maisons Lambert entre lesquelles on
                        cherche à créer une confusion. Le Tribunal de commerce d'An- vers s'y laissa
                        prendre: composé de négociants anversuis élus par leurs pairs, il ne put se
                        défendre contre l'esprit de clocher et crut faire œuvre de justice en
                        favorisant des maisons de la métropole commerciale belge eontre une maison
                        de la capitale qui osait prendre au sérieux les travaux et l'avenir de
                        Bruxelles-- Port de mer.</p>
                    <p>Le syndicat gagna son procès avec des con- sidérants plus sévères que
                        juridiques: concur- rence déloyale, indemnités, publicité du juge- ment
                        ordonnée en Belgique et en Egypte, rien n'y manqua.</p>
                    <p>Les vainqueurs triomphèrent trop bruyam- ment; en Belgique, ils crièrent
                        victoire dans les journaux; à Alexandrie on colporta les bruits les plus
                        désobligeants pour la maison Lambert et Ralli; on alla presque jusqu'à
                        la</p>
                    <p>diffamation.</p>
                    <p>Heureusement, s'il y a des juges à Berlin, il ya à Bruxelles une Cour d'appel
                        composée de magistrats de carrière et qui ne se laisse guère influencer par
                        des considérations étrangères à la justice et au droit.</p>
                    <p>Un arrêt de la semaine dernière complète- ment réformé le jugement d'Anvers.
                        La Cour rend hommage à la parfaite loyauté de la mai- son Lambert et Ralli,
                        reconnaît à F. Lambert et Cie le droit de libre concurrence au syndicat
                        anversois, déboute celui-ci de toutes ses de- mandes et le condamne aux
                        dépens de première instance et d'appel.</p>
                    <p>Et la Sphinx Line continuera son service bimensuel entre Anvers et
                        Alexandrie,au grand bénéfice du développement du commerce entre la Belgique
                        et l'Egypte et au profit du public en général.</p>

                    <p>La vente des terrains de la</p>
                    <p>Municipalite</p>
                    <p>Monsieur le Directeur</p>
                    <p>de l'Egyptian Gazette</p>
                    <p>La Municipalité vient d'adopter un règle- ment sur la vente des biens-libres
                        de l'Etat dont vous avez été le premier à publier le texte dans vos numéros
                        du 23 et 24 et.</p>
                    <p>C'est le 15 août 1903 que l'élaboration de ce règlement et le lotissement des
                        terrains fu- rent décidées. Ce travail qui, demandait quel- ques jours
                        seulement a done duré un an et demi pour le règlement seul, car on ne pent
                        encore prévoir quand le lotissement sera ter- mipé</p>
                    <p>En attendant, les loyers augmentent faute de locaux et de terrains à bâtir,
                        parce que la Municipalité s'obstine à ne pas vendre les vastes espaces dont
                        elle dispose.</p>
                    <p>Une grande partie de ces terrains ont cepen. dant été gagnés sur la mer grâce
                        à l'emprunt de 500,000 L.E. dont le contribuable et le Gou- vernement payent
                        les annuités par moitiés. Le public, qui est ainsi le vrai propriétaire, se
                        voit indignement frustré par la Municipalité et -obligé, de ce chef, à payer
                        un loyer double ou triple d'auparavant. Agréez etc. Alexandrie, le 24

                    <p>LE NIL</p>
                    <p>SA NAVIGABILITÉ AU POINT DE VUE COMMERCIAL</p>
                    <p>Monsieur le Directeur de, "l'Egyptian Gazette"</p>
                    <p>Je viens de lire avec intérêt votre article sur l'étude que Sir William
                        Preece a publiée con- cernant la navigation fluviale en Egypte depuis
                        Assouan jusqu'à la mer. Il était difficile, en effet, de traiter avec plus
                        de compétence un sujet qui intéresse au plus haut degré tous les Egyptiens.
                        Comme vous avez déjà inséré plu- sieurs extraits de l'étude en question, je
                        me contenterai de signaler encore un passage où Sir William affirme "n'avoir
                        vu le long du Nil "aucun signe évident d'ouvrages d'art quel- "conques
                        accomplis dans le but de maintenir "la profondeur de l'eau afin de conserver
                        aux "canaux leur volume normal. Je n'ai même pas " vu une drague à l'œuvre,
                        dit-il; il est vrai que "ma ligne d'inspection était limitée à la Haute-
                        "Egypte. D'un autre côté la destruction des "bancs (de sable mouvant) par
                        les shadoufs "n'est qu'apparente. Il n'y a point de cartes "du fleuve et
                        celui-ci n'est soumis à aucun "système d'arpentage.</p>
                    <p>"Je doute, ajoute-t-il, qu'il y ait au monde. "un fleuve aussi délaissé que
                        le Nil, qui est "pourtant l'artère principale de la vie et du "commerce du
                        pays.</p>
                    <p>En raison de cette négligence, dit encore Sir W. Preece, on perd annuellement
                        trente mille tonnes de limon précieux qui s'écoule dans la mer et
                        l'élévation incessante du lit du fleuve qui en résulte constitue une menace
                        pour le Delta.</p>
                    <p>Après avoir ainsi examiné la difficulté au point de vuc toolniquo ot agricule
                        on pouvait s'attendre à ce que sir W. Preece aborde le côté commercial. Il
                        n'en a rien fait. Il va sans dire pourtant que la navigabilité du Nil est
                        une question vitale pour le commerce égyp- tien. Il y a autant à faire sur
                        le Nil dans le domaine commercial que dans le domaine technique. Les 22,000
                        gaiassas, dahabiehs, markebs, féloukas, etc. qui sillonnent actuelle- ment
                        le Nil sont des embarcations tout à fait primitives qui conviennent fort peu
                        au service des transports. La navigation à vapeur munie d'un outillage
                        moderne n'en est encore qu'à ses débuts. Il est à espérer dans l'intérêt du
                        pays que ce genre de navigation se déve loppe le plus tôt possible afin de
                        desservir d'une façon régulière les principaux centres agricoles disséminés
                        sur tout le parcours du fleuve.</p>
                    <p>Les cinq sociétés qui font le service des mar- chandises entre Alexandrie et
                        le Caire, sont la Delta Navigation Co., l'Internationale,Spetza- ropoulo
                        &amp; Co, Gentilini &amp; Co et l'Anglo-Ame- rican Nile. Elles ne peuvent à
                        elles seules assu- rer les communications commerciales du Delta que dans une
                        très faible mesure. Les marchan- dises, lorsqu'elles ne sont pas refusées,
                        restent souvent des mois entiers déposées dans les dé- barcadères avant
                        d'être embarquées.</p>
                    <p>Les bénéfices que procurent ces entreprises de transport sont fort
                        importants. Ainsi nous savons de bonne source qu'une de ces sociétés, dont
                        le siège est à Alexandrie, réalise annuelle- ment comme bénéfices le 50% du
                        son capital. La branche marchandises de l'Anglo-Ameri- can Nile gagne aussi
                        de l'argent malgré les fortes dépenses qu'elle fait à Alexandrie. Sit cette
                        société augmentait sa flottille sur le Nil, elle serait en état de prendre
                        une bonne partie du trafic actuel, qui est, comme on sait, fort
                        rémunérateur. Elle distribuerait alors non plus le 6 ou le 8%, mais des
                        dividendes qui feraient doubler, tripler même la valeur nominale de ses
                        actions.</p>
                    <p>C'est donc un brillant avenir qui attend l'ex- ploitation fluviale de
                        l'Egypte, mais à la condi- tion d'entretenir le Nil et ses canaux dans un
                        état satisfaisant de navigabilité.</p>
                    <p>Veuillez agréer, etc.</p>

                    <head>A MIGHTY PROJECT.</head>
                    <p>SIR W. WILLCOCKS INTERVIEWED.</p>
                    <p>"Cursed be Pharoah who said in his pride 'Am I not Pharoah, king of Egypt ?'
                        It he had seen Chaldea he would have said it with humility. Such were the
                        words reported to have been uttered by Maimun, the son and successor of
                        Haroun-el-Rashid, when he had ascended the Mokattam Hill and seen the land
                        of Egypt stretched below at his feet.</p>
                    <p>It was with this striking preface that Sir William Willcocks, the designer of
                        the Assouant Reservoir and the creator of the modern irrigation system of
                        Egypt, opened the remarkable lecture which he delivered, Learly two years
                        ago, at Cairo, on the restoration of the ancient irrigation works on the
                        Tigris, or the recrea tion of Chaidea. The Engiisu people were then passing
                        through one of their warm fits of interest in the Middle East. The project
                        for the Persian Gulf railway through German agency had focussed attention
                        once more upon the mysterious lands which formed the wealth of the Chaldean
                        kingdom, and had aroused speculation as to the possibility of re-fertilising
                        the countries which were the glory of the ancients. With the keenest
                        interest irrigation engineers followed Sir William Willcocks' reconstruction
                        of the great Nahrwan Canal, nearly twice the width of the largest Egyptian
                        canal, which, taking off the Tigris near Dura on the lett bank, supplied a
                        whole network of canals and irrigated a vast area before it rejoined the
                        river a little below Badrai. And of the eastern canal system, the Dijail
                        caual, over a hundred knometres long and filty metres wide, which irrigated
                        the lands above flood level as far south as Baghdad. The cause of the ruin
                        of these magnificent works was the desertion of its ancient bed by the main
                        stream of the Tigris in Chaldea's evil day, which cut off the supply from
                        the mighty canals and turned them into the feeble watercourses they are
                        to-day, converting a paradise into a desert. Even more fascinating was it to
                        turn to Sir William Willcocks' estimate as to what could be done to restore
                        fertility to these barren lands. On the Tigris alone he calculated, by an
                        expenditure of eight millions sterling, a million and a quarter acres could
                        be irrigated, equal to a capital sum of thirty-eight millions, and producing
                        a revenue of two millions a year, or twenty-five per cent. on the outlay.
                        Then in Lower Chaldea there are a million and a half. acres awaiting
                        reclamation at an estimated expenditure of thirteen millions sterling, with
                        an estimated return of twenty millions. Or for the whole of ancient Chaldea,
                        2,800,000 acres, at an expenditure of £21,000,000, with a return of
                        £60,000,000..</p>
                    <p>Immediate interest in the recreation of Chaldea having evanesced through the
                        temporary collapse of the Gulf railway scheme, the concern of the slumbrous
                        British public in this mighty project waned. Perchance there is buried in
                        some rarely-disturbed pigeon hole at the Foreign Office Sir William
                        Willcocks' lecture, with a minute from a cocksure Under Secretary describing
                        it as impracticable; certainly these notes and suggestions are treasured in
                        the Wilhelmstrasse, as part of the giant plan by which Germany hopes one day
                        to consolidate her influence in Asia Minor. But in the busy brain of the man
                        who conceived the idea of making ten blades of grass grow where none grow
                        now, the germ has never died. First there was permission of the slow-moving
                        Turk to be obtained. Then time found from the pressing engagements of the
                        busiest man of the busy men who are making Egypt flourish like the green bay
                        tree. But both were surmounted, and last November Sir William Willcocks set
                        out for a personal investigation of the conditions of the aforetime oasis,
                        whose possibilities hal fasci ated him these several years.</p>
                    <p>Is it et characteristic of the man that he should have changed direct fr m
                        the P. and O. ste mer to the Persian Gulf boat, never once setting foot on
                        Indian soil 1 And arrived at Baghdad that he should have organised a swift-
                        moving caravan, spent every hour of the too <cb n="2"/> few days studying
                        the irrigation problem, turn) ing neither to the right nor to the left to
                        examine historic monuments, however rare their archaelogical interest? Then
                        returning to Bombay, Sir William hastened from the Linga to the Caledonia,
                        not even stepping ashore for the formal medical examination. It was only in
                        a brief hour before the Caledonia raised anchor that he could be seen, and a
                        few points extracted as to the results of his tour. But an hour with Sir
                        William Willcocks is worth days with lesser men. He is one of those rare
                        men, the scientist with imagination. Canals and barrages and regulators are
                        not with him an end, as with many engineers, but a means to an end. He sees
                        beyond them the waving fields of corn and sugar cane and pulse, where now is
                        none. but the harvest of the desert. His enthusiasm is as contagious as his
                        technical skill is extraordinary. A man who has done great things and who
                        will do yet greater.</p>
                    <p>"Satisfied," he cried, in response to the first natural query as to the
                        fruits of his enterprise. "I am more than satisfied. I am amazed at the
                        scope there exists for irrigation in the Euphrates and the Tigris, and at
                        the ease with which the necessary works can be constructed. One thing is
                        clear, here irrigation and navigation must go hand in hand, and the Tigris
                        and Euphrates carry enough water for irrigation and navigation combined for
                        half a century. When I saw it in January the Euphrathes at Babylon was
                        twelve yards wide and one yard deep: it was, I believe, dry for three months
                        in the summer. The Tigris above Ezralent was forty yards wide and ten feet
                        deep in summer it is forty yards wide and three feet deep. Both rivers,
                        however, need vigorous taking in haud to prevent complete obliteration owing
                        to the heavy silt they carry."</p>
                    <p>"The country is literally made for irrigation. One river being fifteen feet
                        above the level of the other, there is a natural slope for the canals. I
                        divided the irrigable area into fifteen blocks, each self-contained, and yet
                        forming, when complete, one part of a co-ordinate whole. This is most
                        essential, because, owing to the heavy silt carried by both the rivers, all
                        irrigation. works must be comprehensive, working and tailing into one
                        another in order to obtain good velocities. When the country had a strong
                        central government, this all-important detail received close attention, and
                        the magnificent canal system was maintained in complete working order. When
                        the Central Government weakened, the canals began to silt, with the
                        appalling ruin and desolation seen to-day in what was once the granary of
                        the world. The first work would be for a combined irrigation and navigation
                        canal joining the Euphrates and Tigris near Baghdad. Then the other sectious
                        could be taken in hand as soon as the country was ready and money was
                        forthcoming. When the fifteen sections are. complete I estimate that it will
                        be possible to irrigate five millions of the fourteen or fifteen. million
                        acres comprised in the deltas of the two rivers, without the necessity of
                        providing reservoirs for thein, and also to ensure the necessary
                        navigation."</p>
                    <p>"The cost? For the first section I estimato that a sum of about eight
                        millions sterling will be required. Nor, when the possibilities of the
                        country are realised, do I think there will be any difficulty in raising the
                        money, having regard to the promptitude with which capital is forthcoming
                        for any well-conceived reclamation project in Egypt. The returns? Those must
                        for the most part be conjectural for the present. I never form any opinion
                        until I have the advice of the chemist to support it. I have collected a
                        very large number of specimens of soils,some eighty in all, and many of
                        these have alread been sent to Egypt for analysis. So far as I ca judge, the
                        best soils are extremely good, and in even the salt lands I have been unable
                        t detect the presence of any of the dreaded black alkalies. These, as you
                        know, are quite hopeless, as the salts are insoluble in water; sils
                        impregnated with white alkalies are reclaimable, as the salts can be washed
                        out. The engineering difficulties are unimportant. The problems to be faced
                        are far less serious than those we have to confront in Egypt every day.</p>

                    <cb n="3"/>

                    <p>As for the work of construction there is plenty of excellent building
                        material on the spot. Labour, I was also assured, would be forthcoming in
                        abundance as soon as it was known that it would be paid for."</p>
                    <p>Thence the talk drifted to the magnificent works of the Sassanian Kings,
                        described in the lecture already referred to. "Did I see any evidences of
                        them?" exclaimed Sir William. "Why, the country is full of monuments of
                        those old engineers. Is this a dining saloon 1"-we were sitting in the
                        saloon of the Caledonia-"You know it is by the chairs and the tables and the
                        lights. So for anyone who has eyes to see-I have been an irrigation engineer
                        all my life-on every hand there lie in Chaldea the remains of their splendid
                        irrigation system. You can see where their main canals ran, where the
                        regulators were constructed, where feeders took off. You can see where the
                        ancients made mistakes, and where and how they rectified them. So clear are
                        these indications that they greatly lightened the task of taking levels. I
                        could gauge how the land sloped and to what extent. As for utilising these
                        old works in my project, the Chaldean engineers were handicapped by the want
                        of iron. In cases where this did not affect their designs I should utilise
                        the remains of their works. Where the command of iron confers upon us
                        material advantages, we should naturally strike out a fresh and distinct
                        line."</p>
                    <p>As to his own plans Sir William Willcocks was equally frank. "The first
                        essential," he said, "is to obtain the consent of the Turkish Government,
                        and that I shall strive for. The l'urk has a firm hold on the land and has
                        quite ousted the Arab. Most properly too. The Arab is a human locust,
                        destroying everything before. him, contributing nothing to the productivity
                        of the soil, leaving nothing but desolation in his train. So well rooted is
                        Turkish power that my authorisation from the Government carried me
                        everywhere. I was treated with far greater consideration and respect in
                        ancient Chaldea than I, an Englishman and a Christian, would receive in
                        Egypt."</p>
                    <p>One little incident must not be omitted here, because of the light it throws
                        upon Turkish method, and upon the character of Sir William Willeeks, One
                        Moughel Bey, it seems, the son of that Moughel who built the great barrage
                        at Cairo and bequeathed it, a shaky heritage, to the British irrigation
                        engineers who came to restore prosperity to the distracted land, has been
                        engaged for many years in irrigation works on the Euphrates. The engineering
                        details are obscure, but the point is this, the water pours through openings
                        in the barrage and Moughel is afraid to close them. Said Sir William: "I
                        implored him to close them. 'No, said be, 'the dam will break.' Never mind,
                        was my response, let it break; if it does built it up. If it break again
                        build it up again. If it break a third time, build it yet again, for each
                        time your foundations will be stronger. But close the dam, man, and force
                        the torrent down the Euphrates, if only for one glorious hour of spreading
                        the water over the thirsty land and restoring fertility to this desolate
                        soil." There spoke the man who in the teeth of the croakings of the prophets
                        of disaster closed the gates of Moughel Bey's quaking barrage at Cairo, held
                        up water enough to give Lower Egypt a bounteous crop, and saved the money
                        which set the country firmly on the path to prosperity. It was trenching on
                        the domain of politics to touch upon the prospects of the German railway to
                        the Gulf. Sir William is of those who believe that it will come and at no
                        distant date; it is now only a question of money. As he reads their
                        concession, they could, too, if they had the command of capital, begin the
                        line at Baghdad and run it to Nineveh and to Khamkin. He holds, also, that
                        it is undignified of Great Britain to sulk and have no part in this
                        enterprise. "The natural line for the railway," he said, "is from Baghdad to
                        Khamkin, Kermanshah, Ispahan, Yezd, and Kerman, to link up the Nushki-Quetta
                        railway, now in process of construction. British enterprise should construct
                        the Khamkin Nushki railway which would traverse a country capable of
                        development, not a God-forsaken tract like the Gulf shore. The recent
                        discovery of oil wells at Khan-Shirin, on the route of the projected
                        Khamkin-Nushki railway, is most important and would have a great effect on
                        the working of the line. The steamer companies should build hotels at Basra,
                        Baghdad, and Babylon, to encourage tourists. In all facilities for travel
                        the country is most backward. There are eight or ten steamers on the Tigris;
                        nene on the Euphrates. The Germans could dover the Euphrates and the Tigris
                        with their steamers for the transport of their railway materials and stores
                        duty free. We ought to be doing something to put life in our half-dead
                        influence in the country."</p>
                    <p>And your own work in Egypt, Sir William 1 "Ah-" was the response. "I have
                        said my last word about the Nile. My new book, The Nile <cb n="4"/> in
                        1904,' the proofs of which I corrected before I came away, embodied the last
                        word I had to say about the Nile. I have squeezed myself dry; I have not,
                        and never shall have anything to add to what I have there written. My hopes
                        now lie in the re-creation of Chaldea. As I stood there, surveying the
                        remains of what was a superb irrigation system, I felt like the prophet
                        Ezekiel when he gazed upon the Valley of Dry Bones. Here were the dry bones
                        in the empty watercourses, the abandoned canals. I longed to call them to
                        life, to clothe them with flesh and blood; to make this land smile again
                        with the fruits of the earth. My hopes, my ambitions, my work, are bound up
                        with the re-creation of Chaldea." ("Times of India").</p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN MINISTERS</head>
                    <p>A correspondent, who signed himself "Pharaoh," recently wrote to the "Morning
                        Post" suggesting the advisability of abolishing Egyptian Ministers and Under
                        Secretaries of State. This letter has been seized upon with avidity by the
                        local Press, who consider that whatever appears in any of the London news-
                        papers is ipso facto an expression of official policy. It is hardly
                        necessary to point out that the letter of "Pharaoh" was the expres sion of a
                        purely personal opinion, and onewhich runs entirely counter to
                        Anglo-Egyptian policy. As a specimen of the criticism it has evoked we
                        extract the following from an article in the "Pyramides":-</p>
                    <p>Nos ministres cela est clair jusqu'à l'évidence méritent ce châtiment,
                        conséquence de leur trop servile obséquiosité. Il y a longtemps que la
                        presse clairvoyante d'Egypte, européenne et indigène, leur a crié casse-cou;
                        il y a longtemps qu'on leur a prédit cette chute lamentable. Ils ont manqué
                        d'énergie; plus, ils ont manqué de dignité. Dociles à satisfaire les
                        moindres volontés de leurs conseillers anglais, ils se sont déclarés
                        satisfaits de ne rien faire et d'émarger tout de même au budget; il n'y a eu
                        en eux de ministériels que leurs appointements. Et après avoir accepté
                        d'être réduits à zéro dans leurs fonctions, on lenr signifie brutalement
                        aujourd'hui que, ne faisant œuvre de leurs dix doigts, ils n'ont plus qu'à
                        plier bagages. Leur départ ne changerait absolument rien au fonctionnement
                        des services administratifs, il n'y aurait que des "cinquièmes roues" de
                        moins au char de l'Etat et vingt-trols mille livres de plus dans les caisses
                        du ministère des finances, du fait de la suppression de leurs
                        traitements.</p>
                    <p>Mais voilà près de quinze ans que ces sortes de sinécures ministérielles
                        existent, sans que la presse anglaise ait songé à s'apercevoir de cet état
                        de choses. On a, au contraire, tout fait pour trouver un ministère
                        absolument neutre. A la moindre velléité de résistance, on brisait le
                        ministre. Nubar pacha, Riaz pacha ont essayé de gouverner en bons patriotes
                        et ont tenté de remonter le courant. A quoi ont abouti leurs efforts: à la
                        disgrace, à l'effacement. Ce n'est qu'après de longs essais que l'on finit
                        par trouver des volontés malléables à souhait, des ministrables selon le
                        désir du gouvernement britannique. Pourquoi donc choisir cette heure tardive
                        pour remercier si cavalièrement ces Excellences de leur obéissance aveugle
                        ?</p>
                    <p>This criticism asoribes an importance to the letter of "Pharaoh" which it
                        entirely lacks. The co-operation of the Egyptian Ministers with their
                        English mentors is an essential part of the machine of Government, and it is
                        useless to invoke the memory of Riaz and Nubar, as the careers of these
                        statesmen are no longer possible in the Egypt of to-day. We may quote here
                        the tribute of Lord Milner to the present Prime Minister of Egypt, as a
                        proof that "Pharaoh's" su: gestions do notcome within the sphere of
                        practical politics :-</p>
                    <p>"With his accession to power a great, and, there is every reason to hope, a
                        permanent change has come over the spirit of the Bgypttian Government,
                        especially in its attitude towards ourselves. Mustapha Pasha is the first
                        Egyptian Premier who has been unreservedly in sympathy with the English. It
                        is his firm cons viction that Egypt must needs lean on some one of the great
                        powers, and there is no other nation whose protection would be as disinter-
                        ested as Great Britain's. Never has the co-operation of Englishmen and
                        Egyptians been so cordial as since Mustapha Pasha's succession to office,
                        never has progress been so general and 80 rapid."</p>

                    <p>"It is sufficient to my Protection from the Mosquito Bites affords complete
                        immunity in ague in all its forms... Yellow fever, like Ague, has been shown
                        to be communicated only by a mosquito." - Times, 30th, September, 1904.</p>
                    <p>Against this deadly insect science has at last provided us with a protection
                        in the shape of </p>
                    <p>ANTIKITO CREAM (Regd.)</p>
                    <p>This wonderful preparation – which is most delightfully refreshing to use –
                        is the outcome of long laboratory research. During the last five years it
                        has been thoroughly tested in all parts of the world. By its use the fatal
                        mosquito, as well as flies, gnats, and all flying insects, are set at
                        defiance. It is absolutely infallible as a preventive, and is guaranteed to
                        be free from carbolic and other deleterions ingredients. It is neither
                        sticky nor greasy and one application to the exposed parts affords
                        protection for hours. Invaluable for hospital use, and should be in the kit
                        of all expeditions. It is better than Quinine. Protects you from flies</p>
                    <p>ANTIKITO CREAM is manufactured under expert supervision in the Syndicate's
                        own laboratory, and is put up in two sizes. Proprietors:</p>
