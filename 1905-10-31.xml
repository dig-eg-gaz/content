							appointing M. Witte Prime Minister, with powers to co-ordinate and unify
							the different branches of the administration. It also grants civic
							liberties to the people and extends the legislative powers of the
							National Assembly, besides enlarging the franchise. It is rumoured that
							the crews of four ships of the Black Sea Squadron have mutinied, and
							that Admirals Bir[ ] and Tchuknin have been murdered. It is also
							rumoured that General Trepoff has been assassinated. (Reuter)</p>

							granted the Duma to the empire on the electoral principle, with the
							privilege of the civic liberty of conscience, speech, meeting, and

						<p>Butcher Murdered in Cairo.—An agent of the secret police recently

						and physically sound ; generous; zealous; brave; honest and must go to war
						in person and not prefer peace to war when the latter is necessary, taking
						the law as his guide ; he must also be economical in his home life, and his

					<head>“DOING” EGYPT ON SKATES. ROUND-THE-WORLD TOUR</head>
					<p>A visitor arrived at Alexandria yesterday from Europe, who intends “doing”
						Egypt and the Sudan in a highly original manner, his means of locomotion
						bring nothing more nor less than a pair of road skates-—or, when the roads
						are rough, his own sturdy legs. This enterprising traveler is <persName>Mr.
							A. W- Crawford</persName>, native of <placeName>St. John</placeName>,
							<placeName>New Brunswick</placeName> . He started a few months ago from
							<placeName>Rouen</placeName> and has crossed
							<placeName>France</placeName>, Spain, Algeria and
							<placeName>Tonis</placeName> . Tripoli is a closed country and everyone
						who desires to traverse it with security has to obtain a special permit from
						the Sublime Porte. Such a permit is almost impossible to procure at the
						present time and moreover necessitates a journey to Constantinople, so Mr.
						Crawford had to give up the idea of making his way to Egypt by land, and
						came on here by way of Malta. He is equipped with a pair of Ritter road
						skates on the acme pattern and intends travelling by the help of these
						appliances to Cairo and thence up the Nile valley to
							<placeName>Khartoum</placeName> . From Khartoum he will make his way to
							<placeName>Abyssinia</placeName> and on to <placeName>Adan</placeName>
						and via <placeName>Persia</placeName>, <placeName>Afghanistan</placeName>
						and <placeName>India</placeName> round the world. At the first blush the
						idea of travelling from Alexandria, to the Sudan and Abyssinia on road
						skates strikes one as being a somewhat eccentric method of locomotion and
						when one thinks, of the vast tracks of desert between here and Abyssinia the
						adventurous spirit that will essay a journey through this part of
							<placeName>Africa</placeName> in the fashion here related is likely to
						be more pitied, than commended. But Crawford is not actuated by the hope of
						winning a wager or of gaining notoriety. He merely wishes to see if the
						thing can be done without a penny in his pocket, only depending on the
						assistance and encouragement of those who appreciate pluck and endurance.
						Mr.Crawford, who has already covered 5,000 kilometres on foot and on wheel,
						looks wonderfully fit considering the hardships inseparable from an
						undertaking of such magnitude. Mr. Crawford left Rouen on May 1 last and is
						due at <placeName>Boston</placeName> in April, 1907. He is a good specimen
						of a young Canadian and is the son of the late <persName>Dr.
