                        <p>In connexion with the story of the life of Sir H.M. Stanley, the famous
                            African explorer, it appears that some difficulty has been experienced
                            in obtaining reliable data respecting the period from 1860 to 1865,
                            during which Stanley served in the United States navy. It was, however,
                            recently discovered that an old naval man named 'L.H. Noe, who was a
                            comrade of Stanley during the period mentioned, is still alive. Last
                            week a representative of Lady Stanley paid a visit to Mr. Noe at his
                            home on Long Island, and made arrangements with him to supply the
                            missing link by writing this portion of the story of Stanley's life. Mr.
                            Noe will also write some interesting and hitherto unknown particulars
                            concerning Stanley's explorations in Asia Minor. </p>

                        <p>The "Jewish Chronicle" states that it has received information from a
                            particularly reliable source that the Sultan has expressed himself
                            disposed on certain conditions to make liberal concessions to Jews in
                            Palestine. With this object in view, the Chief Rabbi of Turkey was last
                            week summoned to the Imperial Palace, where he had a long interview with
                            the principal private secretary of the Sultan. This otheial formally
                            stated that the Government was disposed to make concessions to the Jews
                            in Palestine. The Chief Rabbi declared, however, that he had no
                            relations whatsoever with any of these organisations, and that therefore
                            he could not undertake the matter. The steps taken by the
                            Government did not rest here. Another tew, who at the present moment
                            holds a very high public position, was then summoned to the place, and a
                            communication was made to him similar to that given above. </p>

                        quotes, in Friday's "Standard," an eloquent prayer from Borrow's "Bible in
                        Spain;" and prayer for England, and for the enduring patriotism of her sons.
                        May I be permitted to draw the attention of your readers to another, and,
                        perhaps, equally suggestive passage from the same fine work a passage which,
                        I fear, there is not the faintest possibility of your pronouncing
                        inappropriate at the present moment: - </p>
                    <p>"These gentry are invariably saying all they can in dispraise of their native
                        land, and it is my opinion, grounded upon experience, that an individual who
                        is capable of such baseness would not hesitate at the perpetration of any
                        villainy, for, next to the love of God, the love of country is the best
                        preventive of crime.... He who is proud of his country will be particularly
                        cautious not to do anything which is calculated to disgrace it." </p>

                    <p>E </p>
                    <p>Professor Flinders Petrie, in his fourth lee hi tore on Babylonia and Egypt,
                        delivered at University College, dealt with the various races and the
                        character of their art. In Egypt, he said, there could be traced five races
                        in early times. They were : (1) The Libyo-Amorite, el which extended through
                        from Algiers to Syria, as and formed the main prehistoric people of Egypt
                        ; (2) a North Syrian type ; (3) a people </p>
                    <p>probably from the eastern mountains; (4) a coast people like the early
                        Greeks; and (5) the conquering race which founded the historic age. In
                        Babylonia there were two great divisions, the Sumerian and the Semite. The
                        Sumerian was closely shaven on the head and face, with a large nose and a
                        large face, the chin retreating and the head short. He was the Toranian
                        founder of the civilization-the city life, the writing, and the art. All
                        were his invention, and the art of war had reached much the same stage as in
                        Roman or Norman times. The shield-wall was the system of attaçk, long spears
                        were used, the head was well covered with a large helmet, and swords and
                        bows and arrows were the usual weapons. </p>
                    <p>Art was well advanced, the chased patterns on the great silver vase of
                        Entemena before 4000 B.C. were free and bold, and showed a complete mastery
                        of engraving outline. </p>
                    <p>The rise of Semite power under Surgon, * 3800 B.C., brought a new style
                        forward. The </p>
                    <p>royal figures were all bearded, and a remarkably pictorial style of sculpture
                        appeared, with figures in active motion, trees, and hills. There is no
                        Oriental art which is at all to be compared to this in later times, the late
                        Greek Pergamene school being the nearest parallel. The great steel of
                        Naram-Sin and pieces of a limestone steel in Paris are the main examples of
                        this style. the work of Gudea, 3300 B C, was heavy and cold, and showed a
                        great falling off in energy and character. </p>
                    <p>The revival of art was seen about 2100 B.C., is the sculptores of Khammurabi,
                        whose code of laws were so celebrated. Some remarks were made about the want
                        of accuracy and regularity in Babylonian work; it never reached the
                        selfrespecting and scientific precision of the Egyptian. </p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN COTTON IN SIND.</head>
                    <p>In connection with the Karachi Branch of the British Empire League Professor
                        Shahani recently gave a very instructive account of the </p>
                    <p>progress of Sind Egyptian cotton. It has been told that the yield per acre
                        of Sind cotton is larger than anywhere else in India, except Ajmere, which,
                        in this respect, surpasses even Egypt and America. Egyptian cotton, said
                        Professor Shahani, was bound to thrive well in Sind. Two varieties had been
                        singled out as best for local conditions, but for certain lands he proposed
                        a third variety, which matured more quickly, viz, in five months. His
                        experiments showed that irrigated cotton crops exhausted the soil owing to
                        their luxuriant growth, hence it was necessary to rotate cotton with
                        Egyptian plower. The prospects of Sind-Egyptian cotton would much improve if
                        educated Sindhis, scientifically trained would devote themselves to its
                        cultivation, and in this connection he advocated the </p>
                    <p>opening of an agricultural branch at the Sind College. In conclusion, he
                        suggested the formation of two companies--one European, oue Indian for the
                        systematic and intensive cultivation of Egyptian cotton on a large scale. Mr
                        Younghusband, Commissioner of Sind, who presided, promised to consider the
                        suggestions made and to have the paper printed and sent Home. </p>

                        of the United Hotels of Egypt, Ltd., has proposed to the board of directors
                        to call an extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders of the above
                        company with a view to propose the voluntary liquidation of the society. The
                        company was duly incorporated last February with a capital of £120,000,
                        which amount was entirely under written and subscribed. The sum of 5/- per
                        share was paid on subscription and a further 5/- on allotment, the nominal
                        value of the share being £1. </p>
                    <p>The company acquired some first rate plots of land in the provinces at
                        reasonable prices and all arrangements had been made and plans drawn up to
                        build first class hotels at "Tantab, Zagazig, etc. We believe that it is </p>
                    <p>intended to reimburse at once 64 per share to those who have paid up the
                        second call and 1/- per share on all shares of which the first call has been
                        paid, and the remainder after the payment of all the companies liabilities
                        and obligations, which, we understand, are very moderate. It is believed
                        that the resale of the company's lands in the provinces may show a surplus
                        profit, in which case the shareholders would probably receive their money
                        back in full. The shareholders in this company without doubt will applaud
                        the action of Mr. Adolphe Cattani to recoup a certain amount of ready cash
                        at once, which at this moment is invaluable. </p>

                        Anna, who proved herself an emotional actress of exceptional ability. The
                        declamatory passages at the end of the third act were however, rather
                        exaggerated. On the other hand the male characters were for the most part
                        but weakly supported, Signor Pirovano's Duke of Castellieri-Estense being a
                        singularly colourless portrayal of an excellent character. Signora Q. Capri

                        the boom, about January last, </p>
                    <p>shares in most if not all Egyptian companies - were pushed to too high a
                        price in proportion </p>
                    <p>to their interest-bearing possibilities, and specalation was rampant. Another
                        great mistake was the fistation of a large number of new local companies,
                        the shares in which, without any reason excepting the excitement of the
                        speculators, were at once pushed to a premium, and repeatedly changed hands.
                        At a certain period in February or March money on call- was so dear that 80,
                        85, 40, and even 50 per cent was paid to carry over local shares. Naturally
                        this sort of thing could not go on, and the financial establishment of
                        Europe with agencies in Egypt began to close their credits and to call in
                        the longs they had previously granted to most of their Egyptian clients. </p>
                    <p>Naturally the state of affairs has been largely exaggerated by many European
                        papers, to such an extent that some people thought that Egypt was absolutely
                        rotten and on the verge of bankruptcy. Some of the largest Continental banks
                        were so afraid that they would not entertain any kind of business when
                        presented by Egyptian firms. To them everything and everyone was equally
                        bad, whereas it has been declared on good authority that tiot more than one
                        thousand of the whole Egyptian population has been seriously affected by the
                        recent crisis and the country itself is as sound and healthy as it possibly
                        can be. The following are the receipts and expenditure of the Egyptian
                        Treasury for the years stated : </p>

                    <p>Total of the Surplus..... £9,845,000 These figures show for themselves the
                        unexampled prosperity of this country; notwithstanding all the vast sums
                        paid out for irrigation and the construction of the Assouan Dam the net
                        surplus during the last seven years has been nearly ten millions sterling,
                        and this in face of the abatement of the following taxes :- Taxes for the
                        navigating of the Nile for goods, passengers, and steamers; oetroi dues;
                        taxes on sheep and goats, and c. There </p>
                    <p>has also been a large extension of local railway | lines paid for out of
                        revenge. </p>
                    <p>With the storage of water at Assouan there is now no need to fear about any
                        seven lean years, for even if the Nile at any time fails to have a
                        sufficient overflow there is now quite enough water stpred for artificial
                        irrigation. There is also under consideration the further i raising of the
                        Assouan Dam another seven metres, and also the erection of the Espeh
                        Barrage, both of which will be paid for out of revenue, and when completed
                        they will allow for the storage of enough water to increase largely the area
                        of land under cultivation. All these engineering works are under the control
                        of English and Egyptian engineers of the highest ability, and in consequence
                        of all these improvements the "fellabeen" are now immeasurably better off
                        than they were six or seven years ago. The main source of the richness and
                        prosperity of the country is cotton, and I append the export figures for the
                        last six years :Cotton. Other Produce. Total. </p>
                    <p>£ </p>

                        1904 ... 16,708,000 ... 4,108,000 ... 20,811.000. 1905 ... 15,806,000 ...

                        can therefore be seen that in the space of a half a decade the export of
                        cotton has nearly doubled, and as regards 1907 the figures for the first
                        eight months are :-Total export of all kinds $15,400,000 against £12,784,000
                        in the first eight months of 1906, showing the increase to be well
                        maintained. </p>
                    <p>When it is taken into consideration that the average price of cotton this
                        year has been $20 the cantar, or 10d. per pound, the amount received this
                        season, with probable drop of 7 to 7 million cantars (which will be a
                        record crop), will be 80 millions sterling for cotton only; it is rumoured
                        that over half the crop has been already sold, and the demand will ensure a
                        good sale for the balance. When only a half of this enormous amount enters
                        into circulation the late crisis will be remembered only in as a bad dream.
                        Under such conditions, and given a continuation of the present stable
                        government, who can say that Egypt is not only entering upon period of great
                        and ever increasing prosperity |-Yours, and c., Liverpool, October 30. </p>

                    <head>CRIME IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>MUDIRS AND OMDEHS. </p>
                    <p>en Only last week two more cases of murder </p>
                    <p>were recorded in Egypt, and it would almost seem that the crime of murder is
                        indeed possesed of an infectious nature, for upon </p>
                    <p>examining the statistics of crime in almost any country it will be found
                        that it has almost had invariably run in periods, during which many lives
                        are taken for no apparent reason save an </p>
                    <p>insatiable desire for blood on the part of the </p>
                    <p>murderers. Through such a period is Egypt apparently passing at the
                        present day. Murder by has always been a favoured sport among 58 certain
                        Oriental countries but Egypt has until </p>
                    <p>comparatively recent years shown no marked </p>
                    <p>propensity in this direction. However during on the past two years the growth
                        in the numbers </p>
                    <p>- of hospital crimes which have been committed has been enormous, and what
                        is more discon </p>
                    <p>certing still, there appears to be no legitimate grounds for supposing that
                        they may be reduced in the near future. It is an extraordinary fact 
                        too, that while the deeper crime of murder flourishes and increases, the
                        number of petty </p>
                    <p>crimes committed diminish rather than </p>
                    <p>increase, or at least statistics prove that the Es Dumbers of lesser felonies
                        occuring yearly are </p>
                    <p>more or less stationary, and it is therefore not unreasonable to hope
                        that the future should </p>
                    <p>hold increasingly satisfactory results. </p>
                    <p>Many explanations have been brought for ward purporting to account for the
                        ever increasing roll of murders which occur in </p>
                    <p>Egypt. Some say that it is due to the mudirs at of provinces being denied
                        their legitimate right of dealing with such cases, without the </p>
                    <p>interference of inspectors; others, that the remedy is to be found by
                        placing the omdehs </p>
                    <p>of villages in the full possession of the power </p>
                    <p>which they formerly held and which is at present denied them, while it is
                        also said that </p>
                    <p>the existing laws dealing with criminals are not sufficiently severe to
                        inspire a wholesome </p>
                    <p>respect of the authorities among the criminal classes. The forner suggestion
                        is of course absurd on the face of it. The power of the mudirs in dealing
                        with miscreants of their provinces is as absolute now as it ever was, but
                        with the omdehs it is different, and indeed it is almost certainly due to
                        the fact </p>
                    <p>that these latter are now subjected to a control of an infinitaly more
                        exacting nature than which obtainer under the older Administration, that
                        the unfortunate frequency of homicidal cases is ever increasing. Under the
                        earlier administration, the doctrine of "a life </p>
                    <p>for a life" was rigidly adhered in those -days a murder was almost invariably
                        followed </p>
                    <p>by the taking of another man's life as atonela ment for the crime, and in
                        cases where actual or circumstantial evidence failed to prove con clusively
                        the guilt of the suspected party, he was as often as not hanged on the
                        principles that there was no one else to be found who would have been more
                        likely than he to have committed the deed, while it was material that
                        someone should be found to suffer the blood penalty. Ak may well be
                        imagined numberless innocent persons were put to death under this
                        system, but it must be admitted in that the stringency of the measure was
                        mainly me responsible for the comparatively small number of murders
                        which were committed, since it was to the interest of every individual to
                        prevent the occurrence of a crime, the expiation of which might be
                        laid at the door of any dweller in the district where it had taken place.
                        Thus when during recent years the supreme powers of the omdehs were
                        subjected to restrictions which had not been previously enforced, and the
                        summary reprisals which, under the name of justice, followed immediately
                        upon the commital of crime, ceased to exist, when felons began to realise
                        that suspicion alone was notes sufficient to secure their punishment, and
                        that witnesses were required before the consequences of their act could
                        overtake them, it is not surprising that, fear being removed, they
                        should take to their former manners of life again with of increased zest,
                        more especially as they had be nothing particularly to fear from their
                        neighbours, even though suspicion should point strongly in their
                        direction, homicide being looked upon with much less abborrence in the
                        Eastern countries than it is in the West. </p>
                    <p>For this purpose, thoroughly reliable, trained men are necessary, and there
                        are surely plenty such in Egypt;if not, then competent men must be
                        introduced from outside. If by strengthening. the power of the Government in
                        its manner of dealing with criminals it is thonght that the present epidemic
                        of crime could be eradicated," strengthen it by all means, if only as an
                        experiment, but let is see that something tangible is at least being
                        attempted in the way of safeguarding the lives of the provincial
                        inhabitants. </p>
                    <p>The grafting of a twentieth century civilization upon a ocuntry which has
                        hitherto been subject to the iron hand of strength alone is a delicate
                        operation and one which is bound to meet with numberless difficulties before
                        the desired end is attained, but acknowledging this and fully appreciating
                        the obstacles which are met with in the tracing of crime to its sources in
                        a country where, as we have said the general population is inclined to
                        regard it from a somewhat apathetic stand-point, it is never-the-less
                        evident that active measures should be immediately taken in this
                        direction if Egypt is not to earn a reputation for brigandage from which
                        she was formerly free. It is impossible, in the interests of the law abiding
                        population, to revert to the old system of granting plenary powers to the
                        Omdehs, but it is not impossible , to increase the inspectorate and police
                        forces in the provinces until a thorough knowledge of the inhabitants of the
                        several districts is obtained, and the detection of crime thereby rendered
                        comparativaly easy. </p>

                            yesterday, may I be allowed to call attention to the fact that special
                            provision is made for English children at St. Mary's High School in
                            Kasr-el-Doubaru. Here, with an efficient staff of English masters,
                            children may receive an edncation similar to that provided in grammar
                            and other schools of that kind in England. If desired pupils are
                            prepared for the Oxford Local, and College of Preceptor's Examinations.
                            Accommodation is also provided for 15-20 European boarders for the
                            nominal sum of LE 37 per annum (ineluding tuition and tall board).

                        <p>Sir,- The idea suggested by a Lover of Gardens", in, I think, an
                            excellent one, especially with regard to the smaller class of gardens.
                            Our native gardeners have become so ambitions to exhibit against each
                            other, that they are inclined to fill up every available space,
                            including paths etc., with great stacks of pots, to the entire neglect
                            of lawns, paths, beds and borders etc., and the gardens there - fore
                            are, although they may contain many fine specimens, unsightly. I think,
                            therefore, that the little encouragement given to them in the way
                            suggested would very soon make a great improvement in the appearance of
                            many gardens. I would not have this applied to large gardens where the
                            owners have so much spare land etc. that they have no necessity of
                            enereaching on the garden proper for growing show plants, and whose
                            gardens therefore can be kept in quite a different manner, and whose
                            beautiful exhibits at out local shows do not in any way interfere with
                            their gardene. I am, Sir, Yours truly. </p>

                    <head>GERALD MASSEY'S LAST "MESSAGE"</head>
                    <p>A pathetic interest attaches to this work by Gerald Massey, poet of a former
                        time. Many years ago, after having attained a degree of eminence as a bard,
                        of the people, he laid aside his lute, and commenced what he him self
                        believed to be his life's work, the study of ancient Egypt, and during the
                        whole of that time, in spite of snftering, privation, and ad-|| vancing age
                        be pursued his course. The results of his earlier stadies were given to the
                        world in two large volumes twentysix years ago, and these were followed by a
                        couple more volumes two years later. His task was completed in May last on
                        his seventy-ninth birthday, and "Ancient Egypt" was published a few weeks
                        ago. Last week came the news that he had passed away, full of years, and
                        tired with his life's struggles. </p>
                    <p>"His task accomplished and the long day done." In the prebace to the work
                        under review the author says: "I have written other books, but this I look
                        on as the exceptional labour which has made my life worth living. "A book of
                        the beginnings" was written in the dark, "The Natural Genesis", was writ ten
                        in the twilight", whereas "Ancient Egypt" has been written in the light of
                        day." To posterity the fruits of his research have been committed, and
                        whatever may be the verdict upon his work, it is to be hoped that it will be
                        judged as that of one who laboured long and hard to throw new light upon the
                        great problems of life which have troubled not only Ancient Egypt, but men
                        of all ages before and since, </p>
                    <p>It is, however, a matter of doubt whether the loss to literature which
                        followed his de cision to give up writing poetry is compensated for by his
                        philosophic researches, for as a poet he possessed undoubted gifts. To the
                        present generation his name is little known, but half and century ago he had
                        attained fame as an interpreter of the aspirations of the democtacy, and his
                        writings find a worthy place among the literature of the time. </p>
                    <p>His life is a striking example of the triumph of natural genius over the
                        drawbacks of an adverse environment, scanty early education, and physical
                        weakness. As the son of very poor parents he was compelled when only eight
                        years of ago to work twelve hours per day in a silk mill At fifteen he was
                        an errand boy in London. Four years later he had published a volume of
                        "Original. poems and chansons". At twenty-one he was was editing the "Spirit
                        of Freedom," and was an active associate with the Christian Socialist,
                        Cooper, Maurice, and Kingsley, in the Chartist movement. "Voices of Freedom
                        and Lyrics of love" was published about this time, and was followed a few
                        years later by "The Ballad of Babe Christabel and Other Lyrical poems,"
                        which met with great success. Several of his later poems, notably
                        "Havelock's March" were also very popular. </p>
                    <p>It seems inconceivable that one whose early life was marked by such poverty
                        and lack of opportunity should in such a short space of time have attained
                        such a position of eminence. It is none the less remarkable, and affords
                        insight into his courageous charreter, that in middle life he should have
                        set himself such an enormous task, and one which he lived only just long
                        enough to see accomplished. </p>
                    <p>It is quite impossible to do anything like justice to a work of such
                        erudition within the limits of a short review, and the most that can be done
                        is to draw attention to the general line of argument of the author, and
                        mention a few of his more interesting points. </p>
                    <p>Gerald Massey studied Egyptology from the point of view of an ardent
                        evolutiomst and spiritualist, and be applied the principles of evolution to
                        the sign-language of the ancient Egyptians. He believed that the ignorance
                        of primitive sign-language vas "the source of the greatest errors in
                        theology": </p>
                    <p>"An ignorant explanation of the Egyptian sign-language was begun by the
                        Greeks, who could not read the bieroglyphies. It was reported by the Romans,
                        and bas been perpetuated by "Classical Scholars" ever since." </p>
                    <p>Some of his conclusions are likely to meet with much criticism from the
                        orthodox authorities, and especially those regarding the JesusLegend, which
                        he endeavours to trace in Egypt for ten thousand years. </p>
                    <p>He states: "The Messianic mystery, which has caused unparalleled mental
                        trouble to the world, did not originate with, nor was the solution to be
                        found in the biblical collection of the Hebrew writing. The Egyptian "Mesu",
                        to annoint, and as a name for the Anointed, is earlier than the Jewish
                        Messiah. Nor would there have been any, typical Christ the annointed but for
                        the making of the Karest-mummy. We have to look a long way beyond these
                        books to learn how salvation came into the world by water, or a saviour
                        could be represented by the fish. It was thus salvation came to Egypt
                        periodically in the new life of the Nile, and thence the saviour, who was
                        imaged in the likeness of a fish. According to the mythical rendering Horas
                        Lu-em-hetep was a saviour because he came with plenty of food and water in
                        the inundation, as the shoot of, or as the child on the papyrus. In the
                        eschatology be reprènsented the saviour who showed the way by which the
                        Mabes might attain eternal life, when immortality was held to be conditional
                        and dependent upon right condaet "and trae cha racter. A doetrine of
                        Messiahship was founded on the ever-coming Messa, or child of the nondation
                        in the pre-anthropomorphic phase of symbolism in which the type might be the
                        fish, the papyrus-shoot, the beetle, hawk or calf each one of which bears
                        witness that when the infant-likeness was adopted as a figure of the ever
                        coming saviour or Messiah the human type was jnst as non-historical as any

                    <p>all. </p>
                    <p>Later he says: "The Messu, or the Messianie Prince of peace, was born into
                        the world at Memphis in the cult of Ptah as the Egyptian Jesus, with </p>
                    <p>the title of la-em-hetep, he who comes with - peace or plenty and good

                        twenty </p>
                    <p>thousand years ago (Herodotus, 2,43. The author continues : "the Divine

                        monuments began for us, at least ten thousand years ago, but the zootypes
                        were still continued as data in signlanguage. This was the knowledge that
                        was in possession of the Wise Men, the Magi, the Zoroastrians, Jews,
                        Gnosties, Essenes, and others I who kept the reckoning, read the signs, and

                    <p>A work such as this, the result of untold labour and thought, affords much
                        food for the speculative mind, and the student can find occupation in its

                        been done, and quotations are reduced to plb. </p>
                    <p>Futures have been fairly active with consider able fluctuations, and the

                    <p>American Futures. The Market this week has continued in a very nervous and
                        excited condition, and is still under the cloud of the financial depression
                        in America. Prices have fallen considerably, the result of heavy selling
                        from all sides, many people looking for much lower prices and ignoring the
                        reports of cold weather and trost in the Carolinas. A change of front
                        however might easily take place. Still the situation is governed by the
                        monetary position and the expectation that the south may be forced to sell
                        heavily, and little notice is taken of Crop News </p>
                    <p>To-day there has been a better feeling and prices have advanced 1@ 5 points

                    <p>* The following article from the "Times" engineering supplement will no doubt
                        be of interest to our readers :| President Roosevelt, in his speech at St.
                        Louis on Ootober 2, referring to the question of water transport, said : </p>
                    <p>The Great Lakes offer a prime example of the importance of a good water
                        highway for mercantile traffio ... it is important to remember that a very
                        large part of this traffic is conditioned upon an artificial waterway, a
                        canal--the 800. The commerce that passes through the Soo for surpasses in
                        bulk and in value that of the Suez Canal. ("The Times," October 8). </p>
                    <p>Probably the statement in the last sentence of this passage will have come as
                        a surprise to many readers in England, where the facts concerning the
                        traffio on the Great Lakes are not 80 well known as they are in Canada and
                        the United States. Coming from such a speaker it should do something to open
                        the eyes of British manufacturers, merebants, and traders to the immense
                        importance of the business now being done in the region indicated. </p>
                    <p>The area of the industrial and agricultural di-triet affected by the
                        transportation system of the Great Lakes is the stretch of country having
                        its apex at Chicago and St. Louis, and reaching back to the west and
                        north-west, and comprising the States of Missouri, Illinois, Kansas,
                        Nebraska, Iowa, Wiso vnsin, Minnesota, the Dakotas, apd the provinces of
                        Mani toba, Ontario, and the Canadian North-West. This country has an area of
                        over 2,000,000 aquare miles. In 1901 it had a population of 21,000,000 an
                        increase of 4,000,000 on the population of 1896. It is one of the finest
                        graingrowing countries in the world, and produced. in 1899, 2, 223,000,000
                        bushels of wheat, barley. Toats, maize, and rye. It is to the export traffic </p>
                    <p>of a portion of this grain, together with the movement of iron-ore, that is
                        due the impulse to lake-shipping which has brought it to its present
                        magnitude aud perfection of econo mical transportation. (Memorandum on the I
                        growth of the traffic on the Great Lakes and the proposed Ottawa ship
                        navigation, issued by the Montreal, Ottawa, and Georgian Bay Canal Company.
                        Ottawa, May, 1901.) </p>
                    <p>It is only 200 years since the first sailing vessel was launched on the Upper
                        Lakes, and since that time the birch-bark canoe bas been superseded by the
                        steel freight steamship capable of carrying from 9,000 to 14,000 Det tons of
                        freight in a single cargo, and a freight traffic of 51,751,000 tons annually
                        has been developed from the natural resources of the country tributary to
                        the lake system of waterways. Without the facilities for easy transport
                        ation afforded by these waterways the lakecities would never have reached
                        their present importance, and without the commercial and manufacturing
                        requirements of these cities the unprecedented growth of the lake commerce </p>
                    <p>would not have occurred. 1. Reference to the map will show that the Sault
                        Ste. Marie Canals, otherwise known as the "S00," connect Lakes Superior and
                        Huron. They are necessary because of the difference of 18ft. between the
                        levels of the lakes. The first sanal built at this place was constructed by
                        the North-West Fur Company in 1797, to enable them to carry their furs and
                        supplies to and from the Indian country of the North-West. It was 40ft. long
                        and 9tt. wide, and had a total lift of 9ft. The boats were towed by oxen
                        from the end of the look, up a sluiceway, for the rest of the distance to
                        Lake Superior. This canal bad the first lock ever built on the North
                        American Continent. The site upon which this primitive lock was built is
                        preserved and used as a fishpond, its orken floor being apparently as good
                        as when it was laid over 100 years ago. Locks of various sizes have been
                        built from time to time, and now there are three looks in operation, two on
                        the United States side and one on the Canadian. The largest lock on the
                        United States side is 800ft. - long and 100ft. wide. The Canadian loek is
                        900ft. long and soft. wide, and is said to be the longest look in the world.
                        Both the Canadian and the United States lochs can pass vessels drawing 20ft,
                        of water. </p>
                    <p>The first ship canal, known as the State Caral, was built on the American
                        side of Saint Mary's River, the rapids of which are about half a mile wide
                        and three quarters of a mile long. This canal was constructed in the yeats
                        from 1858 to 1855, some 750,000 acres of land in Michigan having beeu
                        granted by the United States Congress for this purpose. It had two locks
                        which were destroyed in 1888 by excavations for the present Poe lock.
                        Another lock, named the Weitsel Look, was built between the year 1870 and
                        1881 by the United States Government, and the same Government constructed
                        the Poe Look between 1887 and 1896. The Canadian Canal was built on the
                        north side of the river between 1888 and 1895. In ronnd numbers the cost of
                        the construction of the canals and of the improve ments in the river channel
                        was £8,800,000, of whieb som the Canadian lock, canal, and approaches cost
                        £1,000,000. Hydraulic power is used for operating the American looks, and
                        electricity generated by water power for the Canadiay lock. Both the
                        Canadian and American canals are free for public use by all nations. </p>
                    <p>The movement of freigbt to and from Lake Superior before the opening of the
                        State Canal in 1858 was entirely by boat from Sault Ste. Mario, where the
                        cargoes were unloaded, then taken across the portage, one mile long, and
                        reloaded on board boats. La 1851 about 12,600 tons passed over the tramway
                        portage. The trans-shipment to Lake Superior ports comprised the commodities
                        hay, onts, dry goods, groceries, and mining machinery to the value of
                        £900,000, and</p>
                    <cb n="4"/>
                    <p>those to lower leke ports included copper, iron blooms, and fish, valued at
                        £185,000. During the 82 years that the canal has been in commission the
                        yearly traffio has increased from a minimum of 14,608 tons to a maximum of
                        51,751,080 tons. For each decade the averAge percentage of yearly increase
                        and the total tonnage are as follows :1865-1864 ... 44% ... 1865-1874 ...
                        12% ...... 4,829,947 18754884 ... 17% ... ... 14,868,689 1886-1894 ... </p>

                    <p>Total ... ... 450,268,919 tons. The above figures are in short tons of
                        2,000lb., and to illustrate the kind of freight carried it may be said that
                        out of the 51 million tons for 1906 about 854 million tons was iron ore and
                        81 million tons was coal. </p>
                    <p>The total freight traffio of 61,751,080 net tons for the season of 1906, when
                        compared with that of 1905, shows an increase of 17 per cent, or 7,480,400
                        tons, and the net registered tonnage of 41,098,324 shows an increase of 12
                        per cent., or 4,480,625. The items showing an increase are coal, flour,
                        wheat, grain other than wheat, manufactured and pig iron, salt, iron ore,
                        copper, and general merebandise. The season of navigation continued for
                        eight months and nine days, during which time the average monthly freight
                        traffic was 6,235,070 net tons and 4,951,605 net registered tons. The total
                        freight valuation in 1906 was £107,492,690. It is difficult to make an exact
                        comparison between the traffic through the "800" and the Suez Canals, as the
                        published figures in each case are arrived at by a differ ent method of
                        computation. In such a comparison it should be remembered that the Lake
                        steamers are really huge steam bergas of slow speed, in which the engines
                        occupy little room and are placed aft. The cargoes are dead weight Core,
                        coal, and stone), and the net tonnage is a large percentage of the groog.
                        The Suez traffic, on the other hand, is largely made up of passenger
                        steamers. The cargo steamers have a smaller percentage of gross tonnage as
                        their net register. </p>
                    <p>Also the traffic throngh the Suez is of oceangoing steamers making long
                        voyages, while for the "Soo" it is the reverse. It must be remembered,
                        however, that the "S00" canal is open for traffic during some two-thirds of
                        the year only, while the Suez is open all the year round. It may be objected
                        that no useful purpose can be served by comparing the traffic between the </p>
                    <p>800" and the Suez, as the former is a local convenience to internal North
                        American trade, while the latter is an international highway connecting East
                        and West, and that the char. acter of the vessels using the two canals is
                        very different. But the object of an attempt to make a comparison is simply
                        to show how large is the business now being done on the Great Lakes, and how
                        important it is that British traders should be alive to its possibilities. </p>
                    <p>During the last three years the total passages of vessels through both
                        American and Cana dian canals were for 1904 16,120, the net registered
                        tonnage 24,864,188, and the total freight net tons 31,646,106 ; for 1905 the
                        cor responding figures were 21.679, 36,617,699, and 44,270,680 ; and for
                        1906 the figures were respectively 22, 155, 41,098,824, and 51,751,080
                        (Statistical Report of Lake Commerce passing through canals at Sault Ste.

                    <p>In 1904 the number of vessels passing through the Suez Sanal was 4,237, the

                        the figures were respeotively 3,975, 18,810,713, and 13,445,504. </p>
                    <p>The Canadians are fully alive to "the im. portance of a good water highway
                        for mercantilo tratto," and scheme has long been under consideration for
                        connecting Lake Saperior with the Atlantic Ocean by means of and abip canal.
                        This project, which is known as the Georgian Bay Canal, is one for taking
                        ships trom Georgian Bayon Lake Horon into French River, Lake Nipissing, and
                        some smaller lakes, and into the Mattawa, thence into the Ottawa River, and
                        so past the capital of the Dominion to Montreal. Such a canal as the one
                        proposed would take any steamer or barge that could be made to navigate the
                        lakes profitably right down to the seaboard, without any transfer or
                        obstruction, there to transter into the ocean steamers. Besides this, it
                        would take any steamer on the ocean except the largest liners. There seems
                        reason to believe that serions efforts will be made before long to carry
                        into effect this scheme the advocates of which maintain that its realization
                        would mark an epoch in the industrial development of Capada, and make of
                        Montreal one of the largest cities on the continent of America. </p>

                    <head>MURRAY'S HANDBOOK OF EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>We have received from Mr. Edward Stanford, Long Aere, W.0, the eleventh
                        edition of Murray's Handbook of Egypt and the Soudan, which has just been
                        published. The original Handbnok appeared as far back as 1847, and was the
                        result of the exhaustive labours of Sir Gardner Wilkinson. In 1878 the book
                        was thoroughly recast, and subsequent editions appeared in 1880, 1896, and
                        1900, the last two of which were edited by Miss Mary Brodrick, Ph. D., with
                        the able assistance of Professor Sayor and Captain H.G. Lyons. </p>
                    <p>The eleventh edition, which has now made its appearance has been prepared
                        under the editor bip of Mr, H.R. Hall, M.A., F.R.G.S. Assistant in tho
                        Deparment of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities at the British Museum, and is
                        a great improvement in tany respects on its predecessors. The numerons
                        interesting archeological discoveries which have been made in the Valley of
                        the Nile during the past few years rendered a fresh re modelling of the work
                        necessary, and this bas been ably carried out. The Handbook contains much
                        new matter, as well as additional maps. Many sections have been re-arranged
                        and re-cast, others have been greatly sugmented, and some almost entirely
                        re-written. A new section has been written on the Anglo-Egyptian Soudan,
                        which takes the traveller from Wadi Halta to the frontiers of Abyssinia and
                        to the Uganda Railway and Mombasa. All information regarding the railways
                        has been carefully revised, and particolars have been added of the light
                        railways in the Delta. The hotel information has, of course, also been
                        brought upto date. The new maps include modern Alexandria, th. Mosques of
                        El-Azhar, Talan, and Klit Bey, the Church of Aba Sarga, the Py. ramide of
                        Abusir, the Payam, the Temple of Medinet labi,the Tombs of the Kings, Aswan,
                        and several of the Sudan. </p>
                    <p>This Guide Book to Egypt and the Sudan is quite the best of its kind which
                        has come into our hands, and we can without hesitation recommend it to those
                        about to travel in this interesting country. Mr. Hall has earned the thanks
                        both of the European al dents in Egypt, to whom the Handbook will ever be a
                        source of interest, and of tourists, who will find much of the information
                        it contains invaluable. </p>

                    <head>THE LITERATURE OF EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>Professor Petrie's fifth lecture at University College, London, on the
                        comparison of Egypt and Babylonia dealt with the literature. The difference
                        between the two peoples, he said, was muoh like that between the Greek and
                        the Roman ; the one strongly artistio and full of ethics and humanism; the
                        other bound in legal, physical, and scientific views </p>
                    <p>The Egyptian seldom gave the precise de scriptions of geography, of
                        phenomena, of dimensions, and of building in which the Babylonian delighted.
                        The Babylonian never wrote the songs, tales, and romances, fall of life and
                        passion, nor the suave and refined proverbs which formed the son of the
                        Egyptian. The tales of the 1,001 nights, though referring to Baghdad, yet
                        were al essentially Egyptian in scene and origin. </p>
                    <p>The historical literature of the campaigns and buildings, and the legal
                        details of tenancy were compared with those of Egypt. In Babylonia there
                        were a great variety of forms of tenaney according to the varying amount of
                        capital pat into the work by the landlord. For </p>
                    <p>date erop, where the labour was very little compared to the land, the
                        landlord bad two thirds; while a yearly tenant, who provided everything,
                        only gave about 13 per cent of the crop as rent. Land was classed in
                        different qualities, according to the amount of seed required for it and the
                        quality was recorded at the beginning of each deed concerning land. </p>

                    <head>BRITISH EXCAVATIONS IN GREECE.</head>
                    <p>The director of the British School at Athens, Mr. R. M. Dawkins, gave an
                        account of the season's excavations at a meeting of the subscribers held at
                        Burlington House last week. </p>
                    <p>In Thessaly, on the supposed site of a Greek temple, four "geometrio" tombs
                        were discover. ed, and these contained skeletons, brooches, rings, iron
                        pins, with bronze heads, and eighteen vases. The floor mosaic of a church of
                        the fourth or fifth century and two Byzantine columns were also found. </p>
                    <p>Excavations were also carried out at Sparta. There a pretty complete
                        exploration of the temple and altar of Artemis Orthia was made, and the main
                        points thereby settled are that there had been a succession of alters, that
                        the theatre from which the people witnessed the rites had been in front of
                        the temple, and that the votive objects indicated a northern origin of the
