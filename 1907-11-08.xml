Stanley
                        In connexion with the story of the life of Sir H.M. Stanley, the famous African explorer, it appears that some difficulty has been experienced in obtaining reliable data respecting the period from 1860 to 1865, during which Stanley served in the United States navy. It was, however, recently discovered that an old naval man named 'L.H. Noe, who was a comrade of Stanley during the period mention
                        ed, is still alive. Last week a representative ** of Lady Stanley paid a visit to Mr. Noe at his home on Long Island, and made arrangements with him to sppply the missing link by writing this portion of the story of Stanley's life. Mr. Noe will also write some interesting and hitherto unknown particulars concerning Stan. ley's explorations in Asia Minor. Jews in Palestine.
                        The "Jewish Chronicle” states that it has received information from a particularly reliable source that the Sultan has expressed himselt disposed on certain conditions to make liberal concessions to Jews in Palestine. With this object in view, the Chief Rabbi of Turkey was last week summoned to the Imperial Palace, where he had a long interview with the principal private secretary of the Sultan. This otheial formally stated that the Government was disposed to make concessions to the Jews in Palestine. The Chief Rabbi declared, however, that he had no relations whatsoever with any of these organisations, and that theretore he could not undertake the matter. The steps taken by the taken by the Govern. ment did not rest here Another tew, who at the present moment holds a very high publie position, was then summoned to the place, and a communication was made to him similar to that given above.

                        Sir. ---Under the above heading “A Delhi Veteran" - all honour to him -- quotes, in Friday's "Standard," an eloquent prayer from Borrow's "Bible in Spain;" and prayer for England, and for the enduring patriotism of her sons. May I be permitted to draw the attention of your readers to another, and, perhaps, equally suggestive passage from the same fine work a passage which, I fear, there is not the faintest possibility of your pro nouncing inappropriate at the present moment: -

He who is proud of his country will be partieolarly cautious not to do anything which is calculated to disgrace it."

                        PROF. PETRIE ON BABYLONIAN ART
                        E
                        Professor Flinders Petrie, in his fourth lee hi tore on Babylonia and Egypt, delivered at UniIt Iversity College, dealt with the various races d and the character of their art. In Egypt, he
                        said, there could be traced five races in early
                        times. They were : (1) The Libyo-Amorite, el which extended through from Algiers to Syria, as and formed the main prehistorie people of ts Egypt ; (2) a North Syrian type ; (3) a people
                        probably from the eastern mountains; (4) a coast people like the early Greeks; and (5) the conquering race wbich founded the historic age. In Babylonia there were two great I divisions, the Sumerian and the Semite. The Sumerian was closely shaven on the head and face, with a large nose and a large face, the chin retreating and the head short. He was the Toranian founder of the civilization-the city life, the writing, and the art. All were his invention, and the art of war bad reached much the same stage as in Roman or Norman times. The shield-wall was the system of attaçk, long spears were used, the head was well covered with a large helmet, and swords and bows and arrows were the usual weapons.
                        Art was well advanced, the chased patterns on the great silver vase of Entemena before 4000 B.C. were free and bold, and showed a complete mastery of engraving outline.
                        The rise of Semitie power under Surgon, * 3800 B.C., brought a new style forward. The
                        royal figures were all bearded, and a remarkably pictorial style of sculpture appeared, with figures in active motion, trees, and hills. There is no Oriental art which is at all to be compared to this in later times, the late Greek Perga. mene school being the nearest parallel. The great steel of Naram-Sin and pieces of a limestone steel in Paris are the main examples of this style. the work of Gudea, 3300 B C, was heavy and cold, and showed a great falling off in energy and character.
                        The revival of art was seen about 2100 B.C., is the soulptores of Khammurabi, whose code of laws were so celebrated. Some remarks were made about the want of accuracy and regularity in Babylonian work; it never reached the selfrespecting and scientifie precision of the Egyptian.
                        EGYPTIAN COTTON IN SIND. In connection with the Karachi Branch of the British Empire League Frofessor Shahani | recently gave a very instructive account of the
                        progress of Sind Egyptian cotton. It has been | touyd that the yield per acre of Sind cotton is larger than anywhere else in India, except Ajmere, which, in this respect, surpasses even Egypt and America. Egyptian cotton, said Professor Shabani, was bond to thrive well in Sind. Two varieties had been singled ont as best for local conditions, but for certain lands he proposed a third variety, which matured more quickly, viz., in five months. His experiments showed that irrigated cotton crops exbansted the soil owing to their luxuriant growth, hence it was recessary to rotate cotton with Egyptian plover. The prospects of Siml-Fgyptian cotton would much improve if educated Sindhis, scientifically trained would devote them elves to its cultive trained would devot tion, and in this connection he advocated the
                        pening of an agricultural branch at the Sind College. In conclusion, he suggested the formation of two companies--one European, oue Indian for the systematic and intensive cultivation of Exyptian cotton on a large scale. Mr Younghusband, Commissioner of Bind, who presided, pr«mised to consider the suggestions made and to have the paper printed and sent Home.

                        APPEAL AGAINST MISRULE
                        ( Gazetto's Speelal Service. )
                        London, Thursday. - An appeal to the nation headed by the
                        Archbishop of Canterbury concerning misgov
                        ernment in the Congo insists upon the abro"sgation of the existing system of misrule and
                        the total disappearance of the fundamental claims and practices, which render such misrale inevitable.
                        UNITED HOTELS OF EGYPT. We understand that Mr. Adolphe Cattani, the promoter of the United Hotels of Egypt, Ltd., has proposed to the board of directors to call an extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders of the above company with a view to propose the voluntary liquidation of the society. The company was duly incorporated last February with a capital of £120,000, whicb amount was entirely under written and subscribed. The sum of 5/- per share was paid on subscription and a further 51- on allotment, the nominal valne of the share being £1.
                        The company acquired some first rate plots of land in the provinces at reasonable prices and all arrangements had been made and 1 plans drawn up to build first class hotels at "Tantab, Zagazig, etc. We believe that it is
                        intended to reimburse at once 64 per share to those who have paid up the second call and 1/- per share on all shares of which the first call has been paid, and the remainder after the payment of all the companies liabilities and obligations, which, we understand, are very moderate. It is believed that the resale of the company's lands in the provinces may show # surplus profit, in which case the sbareholders would probably receive their money back in full. The shareholders in this company without doubt will applaud the action of Mr. Adolphe Cattani to recoup a certain amount of ready cash at once, which at this moment is invaluable.

                    <p>LORD CROMER'S WORK.
                        THE DEVELOPMENT OF EGYPT.
                        The following interesting letter has been addressed to the Editor of the "Manchester Guardian." Sir,- At the present moment, when London has just honoured Lord Cromer by electing him a freeman of the City, it may
                        be appropriate to call attention to a few facts a and figures concerning the development and
                        increasing prosperity of Egypt, mainly if not entirely owing to the able and judicial guidance of our great proconsul.
                        Egypt has jnst emerged from a financial crisis, bronght on, as most such crises are, by over-speculation amounting almost to madness, At the time of the boom, about January last,
                        shares in most if not all Egyptian companies - were pushed to too high a price in proportion
                        to their interest-bearing possibilities, and specalation was rampant. Another great mistake was the flstation of a large number of new local companies, the shares in which, without any reason excepting the excitement of the speeulators, were at once pushed to a premium, and repeatedly changed hands. At a certain period in February or March money on call- was so dear that 80, 85, 40, and even 50 per cent was paid to carry over local shares. Naturally this sort of thing could not go on, and the financial establishment of Europe with agencies in Egypt began to close their credits and to call in the logns they had previously granted to most of their Egyptian clients.
                        Naturally the state of affairs has been largely exaggerated by many European papers, to such an extent that some people thought that Egypt was absolutely rotten and on the verge of bankruptcy. Some of the largest Continental banks were so afraid that they would not entertain any kind of business when presented by Egyptian firms. To them everything and everyone was equally bad, whereas it has been declared on good authority that tiot more than one thousand of the whole Egyptian population has been seriously affected by the recent crisis and the country itself is as sound and healthy as it possibly can be. The following are the receipts and expenditure of the Egyptian Treasury for the years stated :
                        RBCRIPTS. EXPENSES. SURPLUS.
                        1900......11,447,000 ... 9,896,000...1,652,000 1991.......19, 160,000 ... 11,896,000... 764,000 1909......12,149,000 ...11,483,000... 716,0 al 1903...... 12,464,000 ...11,720,000... 744,000 1904......13,906,000 ..12,700,00 ..1,206,000 1905......14,813,000 ...12,125,000...2,688,000 | 1906.......15,387,000 ...13,162,000...2,175,000
                        Total of the Surplus..... £9,845,000 These figures show for themselves the unexampled prosperity of this country; notwithstanding all the vast sums paid out for irriga tion and the construction of the Assouan Dam the net surplus during the last seven years has been nearly ten millions sterling, and this in face of the abatement of the following taxes :- Taxes for the navigating of the Nile for goods, passengers, and steamers; oetroi dues; taxes on sheep and goats, and c. There
                        has also been a large extension of local railway | lines paid for out of revenge.
                        With the storage of water at Assouan there is now no need to fear about any seven lean years, for even if the Nile at any time fails to have a sufficient overflow there is now quite enough water stpred for artificial irrigation. There is also under consideration the further i raising of the Assouan Dam another seven metres, and also the erection of the Espeh Barrage, both of which will be paid for out of revenue, and when completed they will allow for the storage of enough water to increase largely the are of land under cultivation. All these engineering works are under the control of English and Egyptian engineers of the highest ability, and in consequence of all these improvements the "fellabeen" are now immeasurably better off than they were six or F seven years ago. The main source of the richness and prosperity of the country is cotton, and I append the export figures for the last six years :Cotton. Other Produce. Total.
                        £
                        £ 1901 ... 11,383,000 ... 4,771,000 ... 16,154,000 1902 ... 13,886,000 ... 4,161,000 ... 18,047,000 1903 ... 15,677,000 ... 3,863,000 ... 19,540,000 1904 ... 16,708,000 ... 4,108,000 ... 20,811.000. 1905 ... 15,806,000 ... 4,551.000 ... 20,860,000 1996 ... 90,528,000 ... 4,349,000 ... 24,877,000 It can therefore be seen that in the space of a half a decade the export of cotton has nearly doubled, and as regards 1907 the figures for the first eight months are :-Total export of all kinds $15,400,000 against £12,784,000 in the first eight months of 1906, showing the increase to be well maintained.
                        When it is taken into consideration that the average price of cotton this year has been $20 the cantar, or 10d. per pound, the amount reti ceived this season, with probable orop of 7 to 7 million cantars (which will be a recorda crop), will be 80 millions sterling for cotton only; it is rumoured that over half the crop has been already sold, and the demand will ensure a good sale for the balance. When only a half of this enormous amount enters into cir culation the late orisis will be remembered only in as a bad dream. Under such conditions, and given a continuation of the present stable government, who can say that Egypt is not only entering upon period of great and ever ipereasing prosperity |-Yours, and c., Liverpool, October 30.

                    <p>CRIME IN EGYPT.
                        MUDIRS AND OMDEHS.
                        en Only last week two more cases of murder
                        were recorded in Egypt, and it would almost seem that the crime of murder is indeed possesed of an infectious nature, fou apon
                        examining the statistics of crime in almost any to country it will be found that it has almost ad invariably run in periods, during which many ot lives are taken for no apparent reason save an
                        insatiable desire for blood on the part of the
                        murderers. Through such a period is Egypt al apparently passing at the present day. Murder by has always been a favoured sport among 58. oertain Oriental countries but Egypt has until
                        comparatively recent years shewn no marked
                        propensity in this direction. However during on the past two years the growth in the numbers
                        - of ospital crimes which have been committed s has been enortaous, and what is more direon
                        certing still, there appears to be no legitimate y grounds for supposing that they may be reduced 1. in the near future. It is an extraordinary fact d too, that while the deeper crime of murder d flourishes and increases, the number of petty
                        crimes committed diminish rather tham
                        increase, or at least statistics prove that the Es Dumbers of lesser felonies oceuring yearly are
                        more or less stationary, and it is therefore not in et unreasonable to hope that the future should
                        hold increasingly satisfactory resulta
                        Many explanations bave been brought for ward purporting to account for the ever in orensing roll of murders which occur in
                        Egypt. Some say that it is due to the mudirs at of provinces bbing denied their legitimate e right of dealing with such cases, without the
                        interference of inspectors; others, that the yremedy is to be foand by placing the omdehs
                        of villages in the full possession of the power
                        which they formerly held and which is at t present denied them, while it is also said that
                        the existing laws dealing with oriminals are m not sufficiently severe to inspire a wholesome
                        respect of the alathorities among the criminal classes. The forner suggestion is of course absurd on the face of it. The power of the mudirs in dealing with misoreants of their provinces is as absolute now as it ever was, but with the ondehs it is different, and findeed it is almost certainly due to the fact
                        that these latter are now subjected to a control of an infinitaly more exaoting nature than which obtainer ander the older Administra tion, that the unfortunate frequency of homicidal cases is ever increasing. Under the earlier administration, the dootrine of "a life
                        for a life” was rigidly adhered in those -days a murder was almost invariably followed t
                        by the taking of another man's life as atonela ment for the crime, and in cases where actual or circumstantial evidence failed to prove con clusively the guilt of the suspected party, he was as often as not hanged on the principles that there was no one else to be found whop would have been more likely than he to have th committed the daed, while it was material that some one should be found to suffer the P blood penalty. Ak may well be imagined nem-el berless innocent persons were put to death under this system, but it must be admitted in that the stringency of the measure was mainly me responsible for the comparatively small num. 1 ti ber of murders which were committed, since it w was to the interest of every individual to pre-l le vent the copurrence of a crime, the expiation of which might be laid at the door of any dweller in the distriot where it had taken place. Thus when during recent years the supreme powers of the omdels were subjected to restrictions which hard not been previously enforced, and the summary reprisals which, ander the name of justice, followed immediately upon the commital of erime, ceased to exist, when felona G began to realise that suspicion alone was notes sofficient to secure their panishment, and that go witnesses were required before the consequences of their act could overtake them, it is not sur-th prising that, feas being removed, they shonlap take to their former manners of life again with of inereased sest, more especially as they had be nothing particularly to fear from their neighbours, even though suspicion should pointsp strongly in their direction, bomicide being looked upon with much less abborrence in the w Eastern countries than it is in the West.
                        For this purpose, thoronghly reliable, trained men are necessary, and there are surely plenty such in Egypt;if not, then competent men must be introduced from outside. If by strengthening. the power of the Government in ita manner of dealing with oriminals it is thonght that the present epidemic of prime could be eradicated," strengthen it by all means, if only as an experiment, but let is see that something tangible is at least being attempted in the way of safeguarding the lives of the provincial inhabitants.
                        Tho grafting of a twentieth century civiliza tion upon a ocuntry which has hitherto been subject to the iron hand of strength alone is a delioate operation and one which is bound to meet with numberless difficulties before the desired end is attaind, but acknowledging this and fally appreciating the obstacles which are ! met with in the tracing of orime to its sources in a country where, as we have said the generals population is inclined to regard it from a some H what apathetio stand-point, it is never-the-less Sp evident that active measures should be imet mediately taken in this direction if I pt is not to earn and reputation for brigandage from which she was formerly free. It is impossible, in the interests of the law abiding population, to revert to the old systein of granting plenarys powers to the Omdels, but it is not impossible , to increase the inspectorate and police forces in the provinces until a thorough knowledge of the inhabitants of the several districte is obtained, and the distection of crime thereby rendered comparativaly easy.

                        a report is being circulated to the effect that a on prize of L.E. 50 is to be distributed by Burton
                        Bey amongst the Postal employés who will propose the most useful reforms which will not demand excessive expenditure. Is this not open to the general public? If so I am ready with a suggestion, which I think will be gener ally appreciated. It is in connection with the distribution of letters at the Post Office. Last night was an excellent example of the inadequate arrangements made by the Postal
                        authorities to prevent crowding and erushing ng as soon as the distribution windows were open
                        ed. I was unfortunate enough to have been patiently waiting some considerable time, owing to the delay in distributing an already much overdue mail, and as soon as and move was made found myself an unwilling participator in a cosmopolitan scramble, which, after being nearly crushed to death, eventually landed ine like a sardine against the bars of "the cage" I had sofficient breath to whisper my name to

                        and beartily agree with the views expressed. 1 Surely in such a large city as Cairo, it is
                        essential there should be a good school solely for English children, and run on purely English lines. If English parents in Cairo, are thoroughly interested in the matter, Will they kindly send their addresses to A.B.

                        Sir, -With regard to a letter appearing in the "Egyptian Gazette" of yesterday, may I be allowed to call attention to the fact that special provision is made for English children at St. Mary's High School in Kasr-el-Doubaru. Here, with an efficient staff of English masters, children may receive an edncation similar to that provided in grammar and other schools of that kind in England. If desired pupils are prepared for the Oxford Local, and College of Preceptor's Examinations.

                        Sir,- The idea suggested by a Lover of Gardens", in, I think, an excellent one, especially with regard to the smaller class of gardens. Our native gardeners have become so ambitions to exhibit against each other, that they are inclined to fill up every available space, including paths etc., with great stacks of pots, to the entire neglect of lawns, paths, beds and borders etc., and the gardens there - fore are, although they may contain many fine specimens, unsightly. I think, therefore, that the little encouragement given to them in the way suggested would very soon make a great improvement in the appearance of many gardens. I would not have this applied to large gardens where the owners have so much spare land etc. that they have no necessity of enereaching on the garden proper for growing show plants, and whose gardens therefore can be kept in quite a different manner, and whose beautiful exhibits at out local shows do not in any way interfere with their gardene. I am, Sir, Yours truly.

                    <p><hi rend="bold">"MESSAGE"</hi></p>
                    <p>A pathetic interest attaches to this work by Gerald Massey, poet of a former time. Many years ago, after having attained a degree of eminence as a bard, of the people, he laid aside his lute, and commenced what he him self believed to be his life's work, the study of ancient Egypt, and during the whole of that time, in spite of snftering, privation, and ad-|| vancing age be pursued his course. The results of his earlier stadies were given to the world in two large volumes twentysix years ago, and these were followed by a couple more volumes two years later. His task was completed in May last on his seventy-ninth birthday, and "Ancient Egypt" was published a few weeks ago. Last week came the news that he had passed away, full of years, and tired with his life's struggles.
                        "His task accomplished and the long day done." In the prebace to the work under review the author says: "I have written other books, but this I look on as the exceptional labour which has made my life worth living. "A book of the beginnings" was written in the dark, "The Natural Genesis", was writ ten in the twilight", whereas "Ancient Egypt" has been written in the light of day." To posterity the fruits of his research have been committed, and whatever may be the verdict upon his work, it is to be hoped that it will be judged as that of one who laboured long and hard to throw new light upon the great problems of life which have troubled not only Ancient Egypt, but men of all ages before and since,
                        It is, however, a matter of doubt whether the loss to literature which followed his de cision to give up writing poetry is compensated for by his philosophic researches, for as a poet he possessed undoubted gifts. To the present generation his name is little known, but half and century ago he had attained fame as an interpreter of the aspirations of the democtacy, and his writings find a worthy place among the literature of the time.
                        His life is a striking example of the triumph of natural genius over the drawbacks of an adverse environment, scanty early education, and physical weakness. As the son of very poor parents he was compelled when only eight years of ago to work twelve hours per day in a silk mill At fifteen he was an errand boy in London. Four years later he had published a volume of "Original. poems and chansons". At twenty-one he was was editing the "Spirit of Freedom," and was an active associate with the Christian Socialist, Cooper, Maurice, and Kingsley, in the Chartist movement. "Voices of Freedom and Lyrics of love" was published about this time, and was followed a few years later by “The Ballad of Babe Christabel and Other Lyrical poems," which met with great success. Several of his later poems, notably "Havelock's March" were also very popular.
                        It seems inconceivable that one whose early life was marked by such poverty and lack of opportunity should in such a short space of time have attained such a position of eminence. It is none the less remarkable, and affords insight into his courageous charreter, that in middle life he should have set himself such an enormous task, and one which he lived only just long enough to see accomplished.
                        It is quite impossible to do anything like justice to a work of such erudition within the limits of a short review, and the most that can be done is to draw attention to the general line of argument of the author, and mention a few of his more interesting points.
                        Gerald Massey studied Egyptology from the point of view of an ardent evolutiomst and spiritualist, and be applied the principles of evolution to the sign-language of the ancient Egyptians. He believed that the ignorance of primitive sign-language vas "the source of the greatest errors in theology":
                        "An ignorant explanation of the Egyptian sign-language was begun by the Greeks, who could not read the bieroglyphies. It was reported by the Romans, and bas been perpetuated by "Classical Scholars" ever since."
                        Some of his conclusions are likely to meet with much criticism from the orthodox authorities, and especially those regarding the JesusLegend, which he endeavours to trace in Egypt for ten thousand years.
                        He states: "The Messianic mystery, which has caused unparalleled mental trouble to the world, did not originate with, nor was the solution to be found in the biblical collection of the Hebrew writing. The Egyptian "Mesu", to annoint, and as a name for the Anointed, is earlier than the Jewish Messiah. Nor would there have been any, typical Christ the annointed but for the making of the Karest-mummy. We have to look a long way beyond these books to learn how salvation came into the world by water, or a saviour could be represented by the fish. It was thus salvation came to Egypt periodically in the new life of the Nile, and thence the saviour, who was imaged in the likeness of a fish. According to the mythical rendering Horas Lu-em-hetep was a saviour because he came with plenty of food and water in the inundation, as the shoot of, or as the child on the papyrus. In the eschatology be reprènsented the saviour who showed the way by which the Mabes might attain eternal life, when immortality was held to be conditional and dependent upon right condaet "and trae cha racter. A doetrine of Messiahship was founded on the ever-coming Messa, or child of the nondation in the pre-anthropomorphic phase of symbolism in which the type might be the fish, the papyrus-shoot, the beetle, hawk or calf each one of which bears witness that when the infant-likeness was adopted as a figure of the ever coming saviour or Messiah the human type was jnst as non-historical as any of its</p>
                    <p>1 predecessors. The advent of the Most (the Hebrew Messiah) was periodic in accordance with the natural phenomena : not once for
                        all.
                        Later he says: "The Messu, or the Messianie Prince of peace, was born into the world at Memphis in the cult of Ptah as the Egyptian Jesus, with
                        the title of la-em-hetep, he who comes with - peace or plenty and good fortune as the type
                        ot an eternal youth...... this divine child, Inem helep, as the image of immortal youth, the little hero of all later legend, the Kamite Her
                        akles, had been one of the eight great gods 1 of Egypt who were in existence twenty
                        thousand years ago (Herodotus, 2,43. The author continues : "the Divine Mother ani! child had been humanised in the Egyptian religion when the stone monuments began for us, at least ten thousand years ago, but the zootypes were still continued as data in signlanguage. This was the knowledge that was in possession of the Wise Men, the Magi, the Zoroastrians, Jews, Gnosties, Essenes, and others I who kept the reckoning, read the signs, and knew the time at which the advent was to occur, once every fourteen lifetimes (14X71 minus 2 years), in the "house of a thousand years, ''or once every 2,155 years, when the prince of peace was to be reborn as the lamb in the sign of the
                        ram, or as Ichthus the fish in the sign of - Pisees... And when the Easter equinox had | moved round slowly into the sign of the ram, the coming falfiller of the eyele was Jesus or Horus, that "Lamb of God" who is supposed to have become historical 2,410 years later to take away the sins of the hristian world."
                        A work such as this, the result of untold labour and thought, affords much food for the speculative mind, and the student can find occupation in its pages for many a day, many of the old Egyptian legends being elaborated, and presented in a new light.

                        THE RAILWAY CRISIS.
                        London, November 7. The Railway dispute has been settled by the adoption of a system of coneiliation and of arbitration on the questions of wages and hours. The employees of each company will elect men.bers to represent them before the boards which the companies will form for such sections. If the sectional board fails to come to a settlement the matter will be referred to an arbitrator appointed by mutaal agreement, on in default of that, by the Speaker of the House of Commons and the Master of the Rolls. The daration of the scheme has been fixed for 6 years, thereafter terminable at a year's notice.
                        The settlement was announced late yesterday evening after the terms bad been submitted to the King who has taken the keenest interest in the negociations. The King's messenger travelled by a special train to Sandringham.

Prices have fallen considerably, the result of heavy selling from all sides, many people looking for much lower prices and ignoring the reports of cold weather and trost in the Carolinas. A change of front however might easily take place. Still the situation is governed by the monetary position and the expectation that the south may be forced to sell heavily, and little notice is taken of Crop News

                    <p>THE “S00" AND THE SUEZ
                        CANALS.
                        * The following article from the "Times" engineering supplement will no doubt be of interest to our readers :| President Roosevelt, in his speech at St. Louis on Ootober 2, referring to the question of water transport, said :
                        The Great Lakes offer a prime example of the importance of a good water highway for mercantile traffio ... it is important to remember that a very large part of this traffic is conditioned upon an artificial waterway, a canal--the 800. The commerce that passes through the Soo for surpasses in bulk and in value that of the Suez Canal. ("The Times," October 8).
                        Probably the statement in the last sentence of this passage will have come as a surprise to many readers in England, where the facts concerning the traffio on the Great Lakes are not 80 well known as they are in Canada and the United States. Coming from such a speaker it should do something to open the eyes of British manufacturers, merebants, and traders to the immense importance of the business now being done in the region indicated.
                        The area of the industrial and agricultural di-triet affected by the transportation system of the Great Lakes is the stretch of country having its apex at Chicago and St. Louis, and reaching back to the west and north-west, and comprising the States of Missouri, Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Wiso vnsin, Minnesota, the Dakotas, apd the provinces of Mani toba, Ontario, and the Canadian North-West. This country has an area of over 2,000,000 aquare miles. In 1901 it had a population of 21,000,000 an increase of 4,000,000 on the population of 1896. It is one of the finest graingrowing countries in the world, and produced. in 1899, 2, 223,000,000 bushels of wheat, barley. Toats, maize, and rye. It is to the export traffic
                        of a portion of this grain, together with the movement of iron-ore, that is due the impulse to lake-shipping which has brought it to its present magnitude aud perfection of econo mical transportation. (Memorandum on the I growth of the traffic on the Great Lakes and the proposed Ottawa ship navigation, issued by the Montreal, Ottawa, and Georgian Bay Canal Company. Ottawa, May, 1901.)
                        It is only 200 years since the first sailing vessel was launched on the Upper Lakes, and since that time the birch-bark canoe bas been superseded by the steel freight steamship capable of carrying from 9,000 to 14,000 Det tons of freight in a single cargo, and a freight traffic of 51,751,000 tons annually has been developed from the natural resources of the country tributary to the lake system of waterways. Without the facilities for easy transport ation afforded by these waterways the lakecities would never have reached their present importance, and without the commercial and manufacturing requirements of these cities the unprecedented growth of the lake commerce
                        would not have occurred. 1. Reference to the map will show that the Sault Ste. Marie Canals, otherwise known as the "S00," connect Lakes Superior and Huron. They are necessary because of the difference of 18ft. between the levels of the lakes. The first sanal built at this place was constructed by the North-West Fur Company in 1797, to enable them to carry their furs and supplies to and from the Indian country of the North-West. It was 40ft. long and 9tt. wide, and had a total lift of 9ft. The boats were towed by oxen from the end of the look, up a sluiceway, for the rest of the distance to Lake Superior. This canal bad the first lock ever built on the North American Continent. The site upon which this primitive lock was built is preserved and used as a fishpond, its orken floor being apparently as good as when it was laid over 100 years ago. Locks of various sizes have been built from time to time, and now there are three looks in operation, two on the United States side and one on the Canadian. The largest lock on the United States side is 800ft. - long and 100ft. wide. The Canadian loek is 900ft. long and soft. wide, and is said to be the longest look in the world. Both the Canadian and the United States lochs can pass vessels drawing 20ft, of water.
                        The first ship canal, known as the State Caral, was built on the American side of Saint Mary's River, the rapids of which are about half a mile wide and three quarters of a mile long. This canal was constructed in the yeats from 1858 to 1855, some 750,000 acres of land in Michigan having beeu granted by the United States Congress for this purpose. It had two locks which were destroyed in 1888 by excavations for the present Poe lock. Another lock, named the Weitsel Look, was built between the year 1870 and 1881 by the United States Government, and the same Government constructed the Poe Look between 1887 and 1896. The Canadian Canal was built on the north side of the river between 1888 and 1895. In ronnd numbers the cost of the construction of the canals and of the improve ments in the river channel was £8,800,000, of whieb som the Canadian lock, canal, and approaches cost £1,000,000. Hydraulic power is used for operating the American looks, and electricity generated by water power for the Canadiay lock. Both the Canadian and American canals are free for public use by all nations.
                        The movement of freigbt to and from Lake Superior before the opening of the State Canal in 1858 was entirely by boat from Sault Ste. Mario, where the cargoes were unloaded, then taken across the portage, one mile long, and reloaded on board boats. La 1851 about 12,600 tons passed over the tramway portage. The trans-shipment to Lake Superior ports comprised the commodities hay, onts, dry goods, groceries, and mining machinery to the value of £900,000, and</p>
                    <p>those to lower leke ports included copper, iron blooms, and fish, valued at £185,000. During the 82 years that the canal has been in commission the yearly traffio has increased from a minimum of 14,608 tons to a maximum of 51,751,080 tons. For each decade the averAge percentage of yearly increase and the total tonnage are as follows :1865-1864 ... 44% ... 1865-1874 ... 12% ...... 4,829,947 18754884 ... 17% ... ... 14,868,689 1886-1894 ...

                        ODS.
                        Total ... ... 450,268,919 tons. The above figures are in short tons of 2,000lb., and to illustrate the kind of freight carried it may be said that out of the 51 million tons for 1906 about 854 million tons was iron ore and 81 million tons was coal.
                        The total freight traffio of 61,751,080 net tons for the season of 1906, when compared with that of 1905, shows an increase of 17 per cent, or 7,480,400 tons, and the net registered tonnage of 41,098,324 shows an increase of 12 per cent., or 4,480,625. The items showing an increase are coal, flour, wheat, grain other than wheat, manufactured and pig iron, salt, iron ore, copper, and general merebandise. The season of navigation continued for eight months and nine days, during which time the average monthly freight traffic was 6,235,070 net tons and 4,951,605 net registered tons. The total freight valuation in 1906 was £107,492,690. It is difficult to make an exact comparison between the traffic through the "800" and the Suez Canals, as the published figures in each case are arrived at by a differ ent method of computation. In such a comparison it should be remembered that the Lake steamers are really huge steam bergas of slow speed, in which the engines occupy little room and are placed aft. The cargoes are dead weight Core, coal, and stone), and the net tonnage is a large percentage of the groog. The Suez traffic, on the other hand, is largely made up of passenger steamers. The cargo steamers have a smaller percentage of gross tonnage as their net register.
                        Also the traffic throngh the Suez is of oceangoing steamers making long voyages, while for the "Soo" it is the reverse. It must be remembered, however, that the "S00" canal is open for traffic during some two-thirds of the year only, while the Suez is open all the year round. It may be objected that no useful purpose can be served by comparing the traffic between the
                        800" and the Suez, as the former is a local convenience to internal North American trade, while the latter is an international highway connecting East and West, and that the char. acter of the vessels using the two canals is very different. But the object of an attempt to make a comparison is simply to show how large is the business now being done on the Great Lakes, and how important it is that British traders should be alive to its possibilities.
                        During the last three years the total passages of vessels through both American and Cana dian canals were for 1904 16,120, the net registered tonnage 24,864,188, and the total freight net tons 31,646,106 ; for 1905 the cor responding figures were 21.679, 36,617,699, and 44,270,680 ; and for 1906 the figures were respectively 22, 155, 41,098,824, and 51,751,080 (Statistical Report of Lake Commerce passing through canals at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and Ontario during season of 1906, prepared under direction of Col. Chas. E. L. B. Davis Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army, pp. 16 and 17).
                        In 1904 the number of vessels passing through the Suez Sanal was 4,237, the gross tonnage 18,661,092, and the net tonnage, 18,401,885 ; for 1905 the corresponding figures were 4, 116, 18,810,442, and 18,184, 105; and for 1906 the figures were respeotively 3,975, 18,810,713, and 13,445,504.
                        The Canadians are fully alive to "the im. portance of a good water highway for mercantilo tratto," and scheme has long been under consideration for connecting Lake Saperior with the Atlantic Ocean by means of and abip canal. This project, which is known as the Georgian Bay Canal, is one for taking ships trom Georgian Bayon Lake Horon into French River, Lake Nipissing, and some smaller lakes, and into the Mattawa, thence into the Ottawa River, and so past the capital of the Dominion to Montreal. Such a canal as the one proposed would take any steamer or barge that could be made to navigate the lakes profitably right down to the seaboard, without any transfer or obstruction, there to transter into the ocean steamers. Besides this, it would take any steamer on the ocean except the largest liners. There seems reason to believe that serions efforts will be made before long to carry into effect this scheme the advocates of which maintain that its realization would mark an epoch in the industrial development of Capada, and make of Montreal one of the largest cities on the continent of America.

                    <p>MURRAY'S HANDBOOK OF EGYPT.
                        We have received from Mr. Edward Stanford, Long Aere, W.0, the eleventh edition of Murray's Handbook of Egypt and the Soudan, which has just been published. The original Handbnok appeared as far back as 1847, and was the result of the exhaustive labours of Sir Gardner Wilkinson. In 1878 the book was thoroughly recast, and subsequent editions appeared in 1880, 1896, and 1900, the last two of which were edited by Miss Mary Brodrick, Ph. D., with the able assistance of Professor Sayor and Captain H.G. Lyons.
                        The eleventh edition, which has now made its appearance has been prepared under the editor bip of Mr, H.R. Hall, M.A., F.R.G.S. Assistant in tho Deparment of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities at the British Museum, and is a great improvement in tany respects on its predecessors. The numerons interesting archeological discoveries which have been made in the Valley of the Nile during the past few years rendered a fresh re modelling of the work necessary, and this bas been ably carried out. The Handbook contains much new matter, as well as additional maps. Many sections have been re-arranged and re-cast, others have been greatly sugmented, and some almost entirely re-written. A new section has been written on the Anglo-Egyptian Soudan, which takes the traveller from Wadi Halta to the frontiers of Abyssinia and to the Uganda Railway and Mombasa. All information regarding the railways has been carefully revised, and particolars have been added of the light railways in the Delta. The hotel information has, of course, also been brought upto date. The new maps include modern Alexandria, th. Mosques of El-Azhar, Talan, and Klit Bey, the Church of Aba Sarga, the Py. ramide of Abusir, the Payam, the Temple of Medinet labi,the Tombs of the Kings, Aswan, and several of the Sudan.
                        This Guide Book to Egypt and the Sudan is quite the best of its kind which has come into our hands, and we can without hesitation recommend it to those about to travel in this interesting country. Mr. Hall has earned the thanks both of the European al dents in Egypt, to whom the Handbook will ever be a source of interest, and of tourists, who will find much of the information it contains invaluable.
                        The work is published by Mr. Stanford at
                        THE LITERATURE OF EGYPT.
                        Professor Petrie's fifth lecture at University College, London, on the comparison of Egypt and Babylonia dealt with the literature. The difference between the two peoples, he said, was muoh like that between the Greek and the Roman ; the one strongly artistio and full of ethics and humanism; the other bound in legal, physical, and scientific views
                        The Egyptian seldom gave the precise de scriptions of geography, of phenomena, of dimensions, and of building in which the Babylonian delighted. The Babylonian never wrote the songs, tales, and romances, fall of life and passion, nor the suave and refined proverbs which formed the son of the Egyptian. The tales of the 1,001 nights, though referring to Baghdad, yet were al essentially Egyptian in scene and origin.
                        The historical literature of the campaigns and buildings, and the legal details of tenancy were compared with those of Egypt. In Babylonia there were a great variety of forms of tenaney according to the varying amount of capital pat into the work by the landlord. For
                        date erop, where the labour was very little compared to the land, the landlord bad two thirds; while a yearly tenant, who provided everything, only gave about 13 per cent of the crop as rent. Land was classed in different qualities, according to the amount of seed required for it and the quality was recorded at the beginning of each deed concerning land.
                        BRITISH EXCAVATIONS IN GREECE.
                        The director of the British School at Athens, Mr. R. M. Dawkins, gave an account of the season's excavations at a meeting of the subscribers held at Burlington House last week.
                        In Thessaly, on the supposed site of a Greek temple, four "geometrio" tombs were discover. ed, and these contained skeletons, brooches, rings, iron pins, with bronze heads, and eighteen vases. The floor mosaic of a church of the fourth or fifth century and two Byzantine columns were also found.
                        Excavations were also carried out at Sparta. There a pretty complete exploration of the temple and altar of Artemis Orthia was made, and the main points thereby settled are that there had been a succession of alters, that the theatre from which the people witnessed the rites had been in front of the temple, and that the votive objects indicated a northern origin of the Dorian moe</p>
