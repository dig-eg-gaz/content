                    <p>THE EXTERMINATION OF MOSQUITOES.</p>
                    <p>How true it is that there is nothing new under the sun! It has been pointed
                        out that the use of nets against mosquitoes in Egypt is spoken of in
                        Herodotus. But a correspondent has sent us an extract from the writings of
                        Lucian of Samonata, a contemporary of Trojan, which clearly shows that even
                        the use of oil as a preventative of the accumulation of insects was known.
                        Speaking of the fly, he says, “It is in man’s company as long as it lives,
                        and takes the freedom to taste of all his food-oil only excepted, because it
                        is poison to him.” The fable tells us that the fly was originally a very
                        beautiful but very loquacious woman, a perpetual tattler and a singer into
                        the bargain. She was rival to the Moon in her love with Endymion; and the
                        Moon, being in a rage with her one day, turned her into a fly. For this
                        reason she still seems to envy everybody’s sleep, especially the tender and
                        young, retaining in her memory the sleep of Endymion. Her bites and thirst
                        for blood (evidently a reference to the mosquito) proceed not from cruelty,
                        but humanity and love. Lucian also mentions that Tragedy mentions this
                        fly-</p>
                    <p>“That the fly may be with dreadful slaughter filled, She flies with wondrous
                        force upon the body, And armed warriors fear her little dart.”</p>
                    <p>Lucian evidently classes the mosquito as a fly, as he speaks of it inflicting
                        a wound by its bite, not only in man’s skin, but in that of an ox and a
                        horse. There is also a reference to the proboscis making an incision in the
                        wrinkles of an elephant’s trunk.</p>
                    <p>The fact that oil was known to the ancients as being poisonous to flies makes
                        one wonder why it is only comparatively recently that this fact has been put
                        to practical use. We have little doubt but that, as it has been possible to
                        rid lamailia of the mosquito and its attendant evils, so in the event of an
                        honest endeavor being made to cope with the breeding of mosquitoes in any
                        other place, we will find that pari person there will be a great decrease in
                        the number of flies and other insects.</p>
                    <p>We have strongly advocated the wholesale destruction of mosquitoes in our
                        reports, having in mind the experiences of other towns, such as New Orleans,
                        which was recently devastated with yellow fever. That we are not at present
                        in any danger is entirely due to the fact that no one of yellow fever has
                        ever reached Egypt. Should it ever make its appearance in this country,
                        where we have its carrier, the mosquito, in such numbers, Egypt may be
                        devastated with a plague equal in the severity of its consequences to the
                        visualization of the time of Moses. </p>

                        the inauguration of so important and netful a work—a token of civilisation
                        and an omen of successful progress. You are aware, my brethren, that the
                        region in which we celebrate this ceremony, like the other regions of the
                        Sudan, was once a home of imposture and fanaticism and a source of
                        disturbances and rebellions, and was for several years subject to the
                        horrors of war, disease, and to many calamities, so that you would have been
                        reduced to misery and would have indeed been utterly destroyed had it not
                        been for the grace of God and the watchful care of H. H. the Khedive Abbas
                        Pacha Helmy the Second and his Government, combined with the wisdom and
                        valour of the British Empire and the skillful administration of that
                        venerated chief, the renowned statesman who presides over this ceremony in
                        the name of both the Egyptian and the British Governments. I refer to the
                        Right Hon. the Earl of Cromer, His Britannic Majesty's Agent and
                        Consul-General in the Nile Valley. The two Governments have combined to save
                        you and your country from utter destruction. I only mention your past
                        sufferings on an occasion of joy and congratulation in order to draw a
                        comparison between your present and your past, and to thank God for His
                        mercy on you and to thank your exalted rulers for the benefits they have
                        already conferred upon you. “In consequence of the agreement between the
                        Governments of H. H. the Khedive and of the British Empire, that rebellion
                        was suppressed, its instigators and supporters were utterly an nihilated, a
                        just and well organised Government was established in their place, and the
                        banners of peace and prosperity which we now see flying were hoisted
                        throughout your land This came to pass after the sacrifice of the lives of
                        thousands of men from among us and our helpers and the expenditure of
                        millions of pounds, which we have willingly and liberally offered in order
                        to see you, as we see you to-day, happy and prosperous, assembled to
                        celebrate the accomplishment of one of the greatest and most important of
                        these works which are highly prized among the civilised nations of the
                        world, the foundation of Fort Sudan and the extension of the railway between
                        this port and Berber, an enterprise now achieved, which links the regions of
                        the Sudan with the civilised world; in other words, it exchanges the
                        products and fruits of the Sudan, formerly neglected and undervalued owing
                        to the lack of adequate means of communication, with the special products of
                        western civilisation, its numerous inventions, and the different commodities
                        in which its markets trade. It will also facilitate and shorten the journey
                        to the Hedjaz and the pilgrimage to Mecca. While this great work and other
                        useful works which have a ready been completed in the Sudan, have been made
                        possible by the care of H.H.’s Government and of the Government of Great
                        Britain, yet we should not forget the high energy exhibited by that gallant
                        commander <persName>Major General Sir Reginald Wingate</persName>, Sirdar of
                        the Egyptian Army and Governor-General of the Sudan, who, together with his
                        able assistants, and notably those who have helped in the construction of
                        this railway—the inauguration of which you celebrate on this happy
                        day—deserve our warmest admiration and thanks. If any nation in the world
                        shonld take part in your public ceremonies and national rejoicings we
                        Egyptians should be-that nation, we who consider your country and ours as
                        twins, two bodies possessing one soul, each of which feels whatever affects
                        the other. This is the reason that you see us here among you at this
                        splendid ceremony to exchange our congratulations and to strengthen that,
                        connection between the two countries which is due to the River Nile, which
                        connects and flows through both and is almost the only source of their life
                        and happiness. “It is natural for those in your condition, recently freed
                        from tumults and insurrections, and now enjoying a period of peace and
                        tranquillity, to deliberate on the prospects of their future. You will
                        therefore permit me, my brothers, to give you a summary of the reforms
                        achieved in our country so as to enable you to foretell your country’s
                        future. In 1881, at the beginning of the notorious end deplorable</p>

                    <p>rebellion in Egypt, the income of the Government amounted to L.E. 8,560,000.
                        On September 15, 1882, the rebellion was suppressed and since that date the
                        Egyptian Government has gradually improved in organisation and
                        administration until it has reached a standard that is in itself a guarantee
                        against relapse. Its financial position resembles that of the most civilised
                        Governments and its income, as shown in the present year’s Budget (1906),
                        amounts to L.E. 13,500,000, i.e, about £5,000,000 more than in 1881,
                        although several State taxes have either been reduced or wholly abolished.
                        Meantime H.H. the Khedive’s Government has expended millions of pounds to
                        lighten the burden of the people and to avert the dangers that from time to
                        time threatened the country, such as the cotton worm, the locusts, and the
                        evil effects of too low or of too high a Nile. The Government has also
                        during this period spent enormous sums on the opening of canals, the
                        construction of dams and reservoirs, the establishment of justice, the
                        enactment of laws, the facilitation of the means of communication throughout
                        the country, on the organisation of the army, the consolidation of
                        governmental authority in the interior, and on the protection of the
                        frontier of both countries against any aggression or attack. In consequence
                        of this, my brothers, the capitalist of Europe hastened to our land and
                        numerous enterprises were undertaken and the sources of gain multiplied. The
                        cultivator, the proprietor, the merchant, and the tradesman shared in the
                        benefits of this movement. The prices of commodities have risen and the
                        general wealth of the country has increased, while the financial and
                        economic condition of the people has been improved to such a degree that
                        they have lately made up in great part for their past losses. "This is, my
                        brethren, the present state of affairs in Egypt which we hope to see you
                        enjoy in your own country in the near future. We ask God to enable you to
                        profit by the virtues and benefits of civilisation and to avoid its evils.
                        Last of all we hope that we may again meet at similar ceremonies under the
                        shadow of H. H. the Khedive, whom God perserve. Amen.”</p>

                    <head>THE EXCISE DUTY.</head>
                    <head>FREE TRADE AND THE GOVERNMENT.</head>
                    <p>Among those who believe that the new Government at home will change the
                        policy that has hitherto been followed in Egypt is the chairman of the
                        Egyptian Cotton Mills. At the annual general meeting of that company, held
                        in London last week, that gentleman declared that he was disposed to think
                        "that with such a strong Free Trade Government in power,” they ought to be
                        successful in getting the obnoxious excise duty removed, if proper
                        representations were now made. This point of view is rather amusing as the
                        determination of the Egyptian Government to impose the excise duty in this
                        case has been stated by Lord Cromer as being dictated from a Free Trade
                        standpoint, and in his statement of the Government’s case his lordship
                        remarked that "to Free-traders the action taken by the Egyptian Government
                        requires no defence. I fear that nothing I can say will be likely to
                        convince confirmed Protectionists.” The position taken up by the Government
                        is that the abolition of the excise duty would encourage the growth of a
                        protected cotton industry in Egypt, inasmuoh as Egyptian cotton now goes to
                        Lancashire paying a one per cent. export duty, and is reimported in the form
                        of yarn and piece goods, paying an eight per cent ad valorem import duty.
                        The excise duty on the preducts of the Egyptian Cotton Mills was therefore
                        enforced in the interests of Free Trade because it placed the home-made on
                        precisely the same footing as the imported goods, in accordance with the
                        precedent set by the Government of India. Lord Cromer supported this policy
                        because, as he declared, "I do not consider that, in Egyptian interests, it
                        would be at all desirable to imperil the considerable revenue derived from
                        the customs duties on cotton goods by the creation of an industry which
                        would very probably have had to depend mainly on Protection for its
                        existence." We are afraid that it will not matter a jot whether the
                        Government be Free Trade or Protectionist for there is little likelihood
                        that the cotton mill policy in India or Egypt will be changed in order to
                        permit of the mills of those countries competing with Lancashire without a
                        handicap. The seventh annual general meeting of the Egyptian Cotton Mills
                        (Limited) was held yesterday week at Winchester House, Mr. Giles Atherton,
                        J. P., presiding. In moving the adaption of the report, the chairman said
                        whereas the gross profit on manufacture at the mill the previous year was
                        only £992, the accounts then presented for the year ended Sept 30 last
                        showed a gross profit of £14,409. The year 1906 would be remembered as a
                        phenomenal year in the history of the cotton trade, and if was a pity that
                        the company was not in a position to share in that prosperity during the
                        whole of the year. With, regard to the future he was glad to believe, that
                        the prospects were very healthy, but although trade had been exceptionally
                        good, they could hardly expect it to remain at that high-water mark. There
                        was, however, every indication that the country was likely to enjoy a period
                        of long prosperity. Were it not for the three important items of
                        commissions, &amp;c., excise duty, and interest, &amp;c., the net profits
                        would have been considerably more than £2,726. Regarding the excise duty, he
                        was disposed to think that with such a strong Free Trade Government in
                        power, if proper representations were now made, they ought to be successful
                        in getting that obnoxious tax removed. In order to place the concern on a
                        sound basis, he would suggest that the directors at once take steps to
                        reduce the capital of the company to, say, one- half, or £80,000. and issue
                        preference shares to the extent of £30 000. He was confident that had the
                        undertaking received fair encouragement at the hands of the Egyptian
                        Government, it would without doubt have shown excellent results.
                            <persName>Mr. T. Stoker</persName> seconded the resolution, which was

                        <p>Representative Clark of Florida, has introduced a bill into the
                            Legislators which has been referred to the Committee on Ways and Means,
                            providing for levying a duty on Egyptian and other long-staple cotton
                            imported into the United States from foreign countries. The bill
                            provides : That on and after the first day of October, 1906, there shall
                            be levied, collected, and paid upon all Egyptian and other long staple
                            cotton imported into the United States from foreign countries, in the
                            lint, an import duty at the rate of 10 cents per pound, and upon all

                    <dateline>Port Said, Friday.</dateline>
                    <p>The Sultan has ordered the immediate despatch of 10,000 troops for the relief
                        of Faizi Pacha, who is reported to be hard pressed by the rebels in the
                        Yemen. Arrangements are being made for the transport of these troops to
                        Hodeideh.</p>
                    <p>Warships.</p>
                    <p>The first-class cruiser H.M.S. Kent passed through Port Said on January 29,
                        en route for the Chinese Squadron. The French transport Cholon went through
                        on the same date, en route for Haiphang, with 500 troops. When the Russian
                        cruisers Oleg and Aurora were leaving, the officers and crew of the French
                        transport gave the Russians a great send-off, shouting “Vive la Ratine,”
                        which cries were vociferously reciprocated by the Russians. Eli S. Diana is
                        expected back in Port Said on February 6. The Minerva will return to
                        Alexandria on the 9th.</p>
                    <p>Sport</p>
                    <p>The younger residents of Port Said are greatly indebted to the officers and
                        crew of the warships for the encouragement they have given to the promotion
                        of sport in the town. For the last two months there has been, on an average,
                        three games of football a week. Owing to the success of the Rugby match
                        between Port Said and the Diana, a match was played with the Minerva,
                        resulting, however, in a defeat for Port Said by 8 points to nil. The latter
                        gave a very creditable performance, considering that a few of the team had
                        not played Rugby before. Gunnery, Wallace, Cox, and King, especially, gave a
                        good exposition of the game. The Association match, Port Said v. Minerva,
                        ended in a draw 2 goals each. Gunnery boo red both goals for Port Said. On
                        Saturday afternoon the officers and crew of H. M. S. Minerva hold field
                        sports in Port Said.</p>
                    <p>Hookey.</p>
                    <p>Hookey has become very popular here of late, for the introduction of which we
                        have to thank the Diana and Minerva. It is pleasing to see some of the older
                        sporting enthusiasts donning the jersey again. All this interest in sport
                        angora well for the success of the new Sporting Club, which will be in fall
                        swing next season</p>
                    <p>A Tragedy.</p>
                    <p>A tragedy which occurred here on Wednesday night about 10 o’clock caused a
                        great sensation owing to the circumstances under which it occurred, A French
                        working man named Senes, who lived with an Italian woman, attempted to kill
                        his mistress by cutting her throat with the blade of a jointing plane. The
                        couple were locked in their room when all of a sudden the neighbours heard
                        piteous cries for help. They forced open the door and found the poor woman
                        stretched out on the ground with her head almost severed from the body. The
                        murderer managed to escape by another door, but he was caught and arrested
                        almost immediately. The unfortunate victim was removed to hospital in a
                        precarious condition, and little hopes are entertained of her recovery. The
                        object of the crime is unknown.</p>

                    <head>ALL SAINTS’ CHURCH, CAIRO.</head>
                    <head>FABRIC IN BAD CONDITION.</head>
                    <p>At a special meeting of the committee of All Saints’ Church, Cairo, held
                        recently at H.B.M.’s Agency, the Earl of Cromer in the chair, <persName>Lord
                            Cromer</persName> said that the fabric of the church was in a very bad
                        condition and called on <persName>Mr. B. Richmond</persName> to make a
                        statement. Mr. Richmond reported that the foundations of the church were
                        sound ; but that the wall of the north aisle was unsafe, and that the whole
                        aisle must be rebuilt, and the structure strengthened in other ways. It was
                        decided that the necessary works should be commenced at once and that the
                        scraping of the interior should be begun at the earliest opportunity. It was
                        decided not to enlarge the north aisle, but to rebuild on its present lines.
                        It was farther determined to address an appeal to the English and American
                        residents and visitors, and to solicit subscriptions. The east sum required
                        for necessary repairs will be £500; and if the building is put in thorough
                        repair more will be needed. Judge Tuck proposed that copies of the appeal,
                        and collecting cards, should be placed in the peers on the ensuing Sunday.
                        This suggestion was unanimously approved and acted on with good effect.
                        During the past week and indeed every day since the Dean’s first appeal in
                        Church subscriptions have flowed in. A special list of subscribers to the
                        Restoration Fund will be published. During the restoration it will be
                        necessary to discontinue all week day services except the Holy Communion at
                        8.30 on Fridays and Saints’ days, The Sunday services will be held us usual;
                        the North aisle has been screened off, but the rest of the church can be
                        used all through the restoration.</p>

                    <head>THE COTTON FIRE.</head>
                    <head>WORK OF SALVAGING BEGUN.</head>
                    <head>EXTENT OF DAMAGE</head>
                    <p>A meeting of all the agents of the insurance companies affected by the fire
                        at the Press ex-Choremi was held yesterday afternoon at the offices of the
                        Societe de Pressage et des Depots. <persName>M. Charruy</persName>, the
                        manager of the company and agent for three English insurance companies
                        affected, took the chair. He opened the proceedings with a detailed
                        statement of the property. The meeting afterwards unanimously decided to
                        confer the fullest powers on the chairman in regard to the disposal of the
                        property not damaged by the fire and also in reference to going on with the
                        work of the press at the earliest possible opportunity. This demonstration
                        of confidence in the manager of the Pressage Company, as shown by the
                        meeting, will greatly facilitate, matters, and it reflects credit on the
                        agents of the insurance companies, as such promptness will tend to improve
                        the salvage, which is a very important item under the circumstances. The
                        companies have authorised the Societe de Pressage to draw twenty-five per
                        cent. on the value insured, which is very liberal and puts the clients of
                        the Pressage in a favourable position. The meeting next elected a committee
                        of adjustment composed as follows: Messrs. Charroy, <persName>Percy
                            Carver</persName>, <persName>Adolphe Stross</persName>, and
                        Sevastopoulo. We learn that this committee subsequently appointed Mr.
                        Charroy as their chairman. The salvage of the cotton began early this
                        morning. The work was entrusted to Mr. Frank Haselden, who has had great
                        experience of this class of work on similar occasions. Possibly the loss
                        will be a little less than was expected as the salvage is somewhat more
                        important than was originally thought, for a great many of the bales wen
                        steam-pressed; and consequently the interior is not seriously damaged in
                        many cases. Our criticism as to the faulty condition of the Alexandria Fire
                        Brigade hose and the weak water projection are corroborated on all sides,
                        and universal surprise is expressed at the Municipality having allowed the
                        Fire Brigade’s equipment to be in such a state.</p>

                        his discovery of a system of turning waste products into plush. He was born
                        in 1815 and created a Baron in 1891. He took his title from the town of
                        Masham, which was chiefly his property. It was one of the attainted titles

                        <p>Of those arrested at Sainte Clothilde 17 have been detained, including
                            Counte Rochefoucauly and Georges de Bourbon, who are charged with
                            assaulting the polios. An interpellation on the affair in the Chamber
                            led to a heated debate, and violent altercations. The sitting was
                            suspended on account of the uproar. Confidence was finally voted by 384
                            to 166. (Reuter)</p>
                        <p>Paris, February 2.</p>
                        <p>The authorities expect further scenes of violence. The Catholic youth are
                            determined to oppose the taking of inventories, while counter
                            demonstrations are being organised. During the afternoon the most
                            serious disorders have taken place in the Parish Church of Saint Pierre
                            near the Chamber. A crowd of 3,000 inside the church barricaded the
                            doors and flung stones. The firemen climbed up to the roof and turned on
                            the hose while the troops stormed the doors. Finally the greater part of
                            the crowd was expelled, many persons being drenched and bleeding. An
                            enormous and excited crowd gathered outside and engaged in incessant
                            scuffles and affrays with the gendarmes, who repeated’y charged with
                            drawn swords. Several persons were wounded. (Reuter)</p>

                        <p>Disorders took place at the Gros Caillon church. The firemen inundated
                            the resisters. Several people were injured and fifty arrests were made.

                    <head>"WILL THEY CURE ME?”</head>
                    <head>This is the question many women ask themselves when they read the
                        marvellous cures effected by Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People—cures
                        published every week in the newspapers. But men are quicker in their
                        decision ; they consider : "Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills cured this person ; I
                        suffer from the same ailment ; I shall try them.” And why, fair reader,
                        should you not be cured by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills ? Your ailment is not an
                        unknown one. If, for instance, you suffer from indigestion, remember that
                        Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills have restored healthy digestive powers to thousands
                        of others. What they have done for others they will do for you. Doubt is
                        impossible, for every week new testimonials meet your eye, testimonials in
                        every way reliable, giving the address of the person cured. As an instance
                        we give here the portrait of a Parisian lady. Her name is Mies Marie
                        Dehaffrengue; her address, 19, Avenue Bosquet, Paris ; her illness,
                        indigestion. What cured her? She states—Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale
                        People. Mdlle. Dehaffrengue remarks : For several years I suffered greatly
                        from indigestion, being distressed after every meal for two or three hours.
                        I always felt the discomfort one experiences from a bilious attack, namely,
                        heaviness, flashes of heat, followed by shiverings, nausea and sickness. “I
                        tried many remedies, but in vain. At last my sufferings were relieved by Dr.
                        Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People, which did me a great deal of good at
                        once. Other medicines were helpful only for a day or two, but Dr. Williams’
                        Pink Pills strengthened me ; I improved in health steadily as I continued
                        them, until at length I was quite cured." Many women, and men also, suffer
                        from stomach disorders at this season of the year, when dangerous chills
                        weaken the system. Frequently complete exhaustion follows. Dr. Williams’
                        Pink Pills stimulate the vital organs, give strength, and dispel indigestion
                        with all its resulting evils. They are a sterling remedy for Anæmia
                        Palpitations, General Weakness, Neuralgia, Sick Headaches, Rheumatism,
                        Sciatica, St. Vitus’ Dance, Paralysis, and Locomotor Ataxy. Obtainable of
                        all dealers or direct from Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co., Holborn-viaduct.
                        London post free, 2s. 9d. for one box, or 13s. 9d. for six boxes. Sold in
                        Egypt by all chemists at P.T. 13 per box or P.T. 70 per 6 boxes. Can be
                        bought at the general depôt : Max Fischer, Cairo, Hotel du Nil St. (1st

                    <head>LA DOGARESSA.</head>
                    <head>Music by Nicola Sinadino. — Words by Victor Sikano.</head>
                    <byline>( By our Cairo Critic. )</byline>
                    <p>This opera has been admirably criticised by the "Journal du Caire” for
                        Wednesday last. We agree more especially with what the critic has said on
                        the influences traceable through the work—Wagner, in Tristan, Schumann, and
                        a touch of Massenet, as well as of modern Italy. These influences are
                        suggested, not reproduced, the composer has his own personality, very quiet
                        and subdued, but none the less distinct, throughout. The prominent
                        impression is great self- . restraint : the opera is a foundation, as it
                        were, well laid, and does not lapse into tunes or brazen marches. One can
                        instantly see that the composer has put failure far from him. This very
                        restraint, however, renders criticism difficult. We cannot merely catalogue
                        themes and subjects, or instrumentation, but let us touch on some of the
                        features of the work. This may give the key to it. In the first act is a
                        chorus the subject commencing on a single note—solo—instantly taken up by
                        the other voices, returning again to that same commencement—a curious and
                        effective passage. The quartette in the same act is also noticeable ; but
                        the four voices were not evenly matched, and full justice was not done. In
                        the second act the approach of the 'Bucentaur' marks the point of interest.
                        We have a fugal movement, delicate and charming, and with a certain
                        suggestive depth. This continues into a passage of trumpets ; and then
                        follows the dance music, plaintive and solitary, recalling at once the two
                        shepherd’s Bongs in Tristan. At the end of this act occurs the Italian
                        touch, suitable, naturally enough, to the moonlight and the waters, etc.,
                        etc. But it is only momentary ; and the third act returns again to the real
                        scheme of the whole opera. But here it is more subtle, more flowing, full of
                        limits and touches of mystery, those very touches that an Italian night has
                        : flowers, perfume, the caress of the moonlight on the canal, under an
                        infinite depth of sky, — and two lovers. And this is perhaps the key to the
                        act and even to the opera. Here is the composer's subject. An Italian love
                        story, renaissance in aspect, we could say even modern, and therefore
                        finite—a love story in a land where love is of every passing d*y and night
                        Contrast Tristan : a hero when the world of the West was still young, and
                        fall of strange powers : love comes upon Tristan and Isolde as that force
                        which is above dreams, or death or life itself ; their story is full of the
                        greatness, and sorrowful mystery. of the winds and the sea and all things
                        eternal in a wild and unknown land. We cannot now say what this opera, La
                        Dogaressa, may or may not mean for the future. Will the composer attempt,the
                        greater idea of the world, legends and symbols or will he describe? We have
                        the commencement of a descriptive school, for example Strauss. and in opera
                        Charpentier. And modernity described need not mean the end of all things.
                        Charpentiar attempts. Paris and Montmartre, he town calling to the citadel
                        at night Not one can say that the descriptive school may not be as great as
                        any we have known. We pass on to the rendering of the opera and attack the
                        defects at once, and briefly. The chorus was “reedy,” as in Sansone e Dahla.
                        Signor Palet was unsatisfactory. Whatever promise may be in his voice, it
                        has at present little enough colour, and no form ; and he does not produce
                        it—it never “carries.” Signor Constantino was disappointing and not
                        sufficiently audible. The “symbolic” dance before the Doge was trying; why
                        that eternal 1830 pirouette? And what a contrast to the other flower dance!
                        There was the realty of dancing, the unending symbol of pursuit and coy
                        retreat, inviting pursuit we could call it ”La Desiruse.” Signor Zuccani,
                        for the orchestra, is always good ; he knows his score, and uses his violins
                        perfectly, but there are glimpses of cold-blooded cynoisism in the brass :
                        he does not spare or humour his voices. We recall the finale of Tristan last
                        year, and Mefistofele in both of which be might have sacrificed just a
                        little of the climax ; it is not as if he were conducting in some
                        opera-house where the singers would all be capable of meeting the demands of
                        the music. Signora Bellincioni and Signor Pasquale were both admirable and
                        displayed to the foil all that the others lacked — except Signora Zeppelli:
                        her part is of course a second role, but her voice is sweet and tree, and
                        well delivered. It fell to her to give the high note to the chorus in the
                        first set, and each time she achieved the effect exactly. The scenery,
                        dresses, and all arrangements were most excellent.</p>

                        except for the “reediness” of the sopranos in the chorus, all was excellent,
                        unexpectedly so. The music is a delight throughout for its strength and
                        variety : perhaps the most fascinating part is the fugal movement in the 3rd
                        act. One suspects a canon, it is a canon, and then diverges into a fugue and
                        prolongs what might only be technically interesting into a most dominating
                        and profound sequence exactly fitting to the scene. The early Victorian
                        pirouetting in the dances would lead a frivolous critic to say that these
                        Philistines were modern Philistines in our sense of the word : and we must
                        confess that it was at best out of place and annoying. But the opera as a
                        whole, and we repeat, the way in which it was gives, amply compensated for
                        these minor and temporary disadvantages.</p>

                    <head>SIGNOR SERATO’S CONCERT.</head>
                    <p><persName>Signor Arrigo Serato</persName> gave his second concert at the
                        Savoy Hotel on Wednesday evening before a very numerous and exceedingly
                        appreciative audience. He was accompanied by both Mme Malatesta, the
                        talented pianiste who played at his first concert and also by the orchestra
                        so ably conducted by <persName>Mr. Bracale</persName>. <persName>Signor
                            Serato</persName> is no stranger to Cairo, but his reputation grows
                        greater every time be appears before the public. His technique is so far
                        above the average and his brilliancy of execution and refinement of feeling
                        rank him high among his fellow-violinists. The first item on the programme
                        was Beethoven’s magnificent concert for violin and orchestra op. 61, and
                        Signor Serato’s treatment of it was masterly in the extreme- more especially
                        in the rondo allegro with its wonderful long drawn-out solo. The second item
                        was Liszts’ ‘Fantaisie Hongroise," arranged for the piano and orchestra, and
                            <persName>Mme. Malatesta</persName> surpassed herself in her rendering
                        of the same. Her touch is wonderful, especially for a woman, and her
                        execution is equally fine. She also possesses the happy faculty, not always
                        found in a pianiste, of being a particularly sympathetic accompanist. The
                        final event on the programme was Vieuxtemps’ “Adagio religioso” and though
                        Vieuxtemps’ works are slight and may be thin after Beethoven’s and Liszts'
                        they are full of grace and tuneful melody <persName>Signor Serato</persName>
                        met with a great ovation and his playing evoked a great display of honest
                        enthusiasm. He is assuredly a remarkably fine violinist and it is sincerely
                        hoped that he will give Cairo many more opportunities of hearing him again.
                        Congratulations are also due to <persName>Mme Malatesta</persName> and to
                        the orchestra, to which not a little of Wednesday's success was due. Its
                        performance was most excellent both in tone, time, and appreciation of the
                        ensemble.</p>

                    <head>THE NEW GERMAN CUSTOMS TAX.</head>
                    <p>The scheme of the German Government to increase the taxes on imported
                        Oriental tobacco and cigarettes has raised considerable trepidation among
                        the many persons interested in the Egyptian cigarette trade as Germany is
                        Egypt’s best client as regards cigarettes. The International Chamber of
                        Commerce at Cairo in its bulletin discusses the question in a carefully
                        written article. The conclusion is as follows — Nous avons dfijh dit que
                        nous ne prA voyions pas une solution en ce qui concerne retro snrd’dvation
                        des tsxes, maia le Gouver- nement Egyptian doit penser à remddier, dans la

                    <head>BOOKS OF REFERENCE.</head>
                    <p>"Who’s Who,” the issue for 1906 of which we have received, increases in bulk
                        with each succeeding issue, and the extent of its usefulness as a guide to
                        the life and works of men and women whose position or rank entitles them to
                        a place in its pages, increases in proportion. “Who’s Who” (London : A &amp;
                        C. Black) is a distinctly valuable addition to one’s reference library, and
                        should be on the desk of every man of the world. The “Who's Who Year Book"
                        (London : A. &amp; C Black) is made up of the tables which were formerly
                        such a popular feature in “Who’s Who” itself. These tables were, in fact,
                        the original nucleus of the took, which developed on different lines into a
                        biographical anneal. The information it of necessity brief, but pertinent,
                        and it is one of the must universally useful little directories as yet
                        produced. “The Writers and Artists’ Year Book” contains in compact form
                        about 600 addresses to which MSS may be sent, with the names of the editors
                        in some cases, a general idea of the stories and articles wanted, and other
                        information to guide those who wish to place their literary work. The book
                        also caters for all artists who can do good work with pen or brush, and who
                        seek acceptance in magazines. The publishers are Messrs. A. &amp; C.

                    <head>ROMANCE IN A BOOTH</head>
                    <p>A love romance that is probably without equal is reported to have taken place
                        at one of the booths during the fair at Geneva. In this booth, the
                        “Newcastle Chronicle” says, was exhibited a girl of 18, armless and legless,
                        but of exceedingly fine features. Her show name is “Princess Annette.” A
                        young German who had gone to stars, remained to admire the pretty face, and
                        after numerous visits became so enamoured of it as to forget the other
                        physical defects. When the question of marriage was mooted, the showman
                        strenuously resisted the loss of his loading “draw,” and the young German
                        laid information against him for exercising duress. That, however, was a
                        slow process, so watching his opportunity, and armed with the necessary
                        licences. Romeo carried off his Juliet bodily to church, where they were at
                        once married, the bridegroom holding the bride in his arms during the
                        ceremony.</p>

                    <p>Two of the pigmies from the Ituri Forest, Central Africa, are spending their
                        honeymoon at Brandesburton Hall, a manor house about 20 miles from Hull.
                        When the bride, Kurake, the beauty of the party, brought over by Mr. James
                        Harrison, and Matuka, her lover, had made up their minds to be united, they
                        went to their chief, and said, “Bokane, we are going to be married.” After a
                        little opposition the wedding was agreed to, and the bride and bridegroom
                        solemnly brought forward all their real and personal estate, consisting of
                        beads, knives, razors, and bracelets, and mingled the two lots together in
                        one basket. Matuka then sealed the compact with a kiss, and there ensued
                        much dusky rejoicing.</p>
