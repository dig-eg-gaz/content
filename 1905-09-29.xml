                    <head>The Canal Explosion</head>
                    <p>The Chatham or the greater part of her hull with its explosive freight has
                        vanished, the menace of dynamite has disappeared and all is over but the
                        dredging and the press paragraphs and the litigation. Port Said, after
                        alarming anticipations of a bombard- ment by showers of debris and a shock
                        that would break windows and level walls, has resumed its work, perhaps as
                        one of our correspondents remarked,somewhat disappoint ed that no damage has
                        been done, and so far the only loss of life reported is among the fishes
                        whose bodies are being picked upon the injured banks or found floating on
                        the water.That there should be some damage to the banks and bed of the canal
                        was inevitable, but it is astonish- ing that it should have proved so
                        slight. The Asiatic bank suffered the most, the bed under the Chatham’s
                        magazimes was depressed some 28 metres by the force of the explosion which
                        raised it in many other places over ten feet but the banks did not collapse
                        and the tidal wave which it was feared might rash north and south to wreck
                        vessels and wash away the ance, to the great relief of the shipping in the
                        harbour But the fact that the explosion was less formidable than had been
                        expected in way diminishes the credit due to Mr. Harris and to the
                        Government Mr. Harris, in spite of an experience of explosions that puts the
                        record of the most uneasy monarch or the most militant nihilist in the
                        background, was faced by a problem for the solution of which few, if any,
                        data were available. The Aboukir explosion —a world's record till
                        Thursday—took place far out to sea and the results of the explosion of 16
                        tons of dynamite under such circumstances could not afford valid conclusions
                        as to the consequences of exploding 100 tons in the canal. Mr. Harris,
                        however faced the situation with confidance, came out the difficult and
                        somewhat dangerous preliminaries with success and had the grati fication of
                        witnessing the complete success of his arrangements and the confirmation of
                        hs optimism as to the danger of the proceeding Mr Harris has deserved well
                        of Egypt and of the world’s shipping and we offer him congra tulations on
                        his triumph.</p>
                    <p>The Government, on realising the situation noted promptly and vigorously. The
                        Canada Company seconded its efforts. Soldiers ad policeman formed an
                        effective cordon, mea sures were taken to restore railway aand telegraphic
                        communication as soon as pos sible after the explosion and dredgers ad
                        repairing gangs wen kept in readiness to see to work on the banks and bed of
                        the canal. Not a single parson was killed, injured, or apparently seriously
                        disturbed by the explo sion, the damage done to the railway was
                        infinitesmal, to the wires slight, and the canal it seems will not be
                        blocked for more than a week at most "All’s well that ends well" is the
                        quotation that best suits the circumstances meantime we have to thank the
                        Suez Canal Company and the Railways Administration for the facilities kindly
                        offered to our represent atives and those of the many other organizations of

                    <head>THE GERMAN SOCIALISTS.</head>
                    <p>The members' of the German Social Demo cratic Congress in Berlin, like
                        members of other congresses elsewhere, have been largely occupied in
                        quarrelling among themselves. There is a rather bitter controversy raging
                        between the old Socialists and the new. The followers of Herr Bebel, the
                        veteran leader, are still, so to speak, waving the red flag of ’48. They
                        believe in the doctrines of Karl Marx and Lassalle, and continue to repeat
                        them. These moderate reformers would be perfectly content with a few trifles
                        such as the national alisation of the land, the abolition of all private
                        property, the confiscation of stock and shares, the extinction of private
                        owner ship, and the conversion of the State into the supreme capitalist and
                        sole employer of labour. On the other hand, there is a large party, in
                        cluding most of the younger leaders of an ability, who point out that this
                        remarkable temperate and reasonable programme, whatever its theoretical
                        merits, is a little difficult realisation. Pending the complete reconstruc
                        tion of society from top to bottom, they submit that it might be more
                        politic to concentrate attention on a certain number of reforms which are
                        somewhat less difficult of attainment These so-called political socialists
                        are haugh tily scoffed at by the old stalwarts, who denounce them as little
                        better than allies of the capitalist. Indeed, some of them are capitalists
                        themselves. Nevertheless, the poli tical socialists are gaining ground with
                        the working-men, and the old rigid group seem likely to be reduced to a
                        comparatively unimportant faction.</p>
                    <p>The fact is the modern German social de mocratic party scarcely deserves more
                        than half its name. It is becoming much more democratic than socialistic. It
                        is true the socialism is cherished as a pious opinion by many German
                        artisans, as for the matter is the case all over the world. On own trades
                        unionists at their annual con ferences pass resolutions in favour of natio
                        nalising some forms of property and con fiscating others as a matter of
                        course, though most of them are themselves property owners and capitalists
                        in a small way, with shares it co-operative societies and money in benefical
                        clubs and savings banks. Socialism is so vague a creed that anybody may hold
                        it without much thought of patting its tenets into opera tion. Such is the
                        situation of a good many of the German social democrats. In practice they
                        have become largely transformed into mere radicals. It is not so much
                        revolution they are seeking as the redress of grievances and this concession
                        of certain rights which have been granted to their fellows in other
                        countries They would like, for one thing, to make constitutional government
                        a reality. In Ger many they have a Parliament and a very wide franchise, but
                        there is scarcely responsible government in the British sense. The executive
                        is not under the control of Parliament, and the Parliament is not under the
                        control of the majority of the electorate. Owing to plural voting, property
                        qualifications, and the manner in which the constituencies are arranged, on
                        vote has by no means one value. If it had, the social democrats would
                        constitute more than half the Reichstag, for more votes were cast for their
                        candidates at the last general election than for all the other parties put
                        together.</p>

                    <p>Paris, September 28 The French press has received the Anglo- Japanese treaty
                        favourably, and it is believed that there is no reason why it should cause
                        any ill feeling between Great Britain and Russia, and that the safety of
                        Indo China is strengthened by the alliance of Japan with a power which is in

                        Russo German counter alliance, of which it is believed that M. Witte's visit
                        is the precursor. They advocate the inclusion of France in the alliance.

                        Russia. It enables the allies to co operate either for the eventual
                        annexation by Great Britain of part of Afgha- nistan or of Northern
                        Saghalien by Japan, For these reasons Russia must counterbalance the treaty

                    <p>Liberal circles here welcome the alliance as tending to restrain aggressive
                        policy, and to concentrate the attention of Russia to the improvement of the

                        prejudicial to the interests of the country and that the Khedive should
                        restore the properties illegally obtained, he added : — “ I still maintain
                        my opinion and regret to inform your Highness that not only am I unable to
                        support your claim but that should the Egyptian Government be disposed to
                        admit it, I would be obliged to protest in the most effective fashion in the
                        interests of the Egyptian people and taxpayers.”</p>
                    <p>This excellent and uncompromising answer appears to have greatly annoyed our
                        confrere, Mustapha Pasha Kamel, who calls upon the Egyptian public to show
                        their resentment at the affront offered to the sons of the late Khedive
                        Ismail and to support the demand of the princes for the restoration of their
                        rights. We imagine that the Egyptian public will prefer Lord Cromer's advice
                        to that of the "Nationalist leader” and Turkish pasha.</p>

                    <head>THE CHATHAM EXPLOSION MR. HARRIS' GREAT SUCCESS WATER ASCENDS 500 YARDS.
                        (From our Port Said Correspondent.)</head>
                    <p>Port Said, Thursday 2 p.m. I am now able to send you full details of the
                        world's record dynamite explosion, which, as I telegraphed you as soon as
                        the wires were in working order at 1.30 p.m., was successfully performed,
                        and if I may be allowed to say so, reflects the greatest credit upon Mr.
                        Harris. The divers, who bad been specially selected on account of their
                        previous experience and because they bad been down all over the ship on
                        former occasions, were on the scene last night as well as tags and material,
                        so that all should lie in readiness for laying the mines at the first streak
                        of dawn. Mr. Harris, his two assistants, Mr. Schmitt and Mr. Plata, Lieute-
                        nant Cunningham and the interpreter, left here at 5 a.m. in the Albatross
                        arriving at Ras el Esh at 5.45 a.m. where they dropped Mr. Plum who
                        proceeded to kilometre 15.5 to prepare the north end of the firing wires and
                        cut everything else. At Ras el Esh the party took on board two skilled
                        telegraph wire workers and the vessel left at once, towing the dabsbeah,
                        with the charges on board, after them, to the Chatham. The mines were made
                        up in huge bolsters of sail canvas and each had two submarine detonators in
                        them with about eight feet of cable attached, to which the submarine cable
                        was to be connected.</p>
                    <p>Arriving alongside the Chatham the divers were at once sent down to open the
                        hatches ready for lowering the mines into place, whilst Mr. Harris himself
                        proceeded to attach the connecting wires. These wore each of 100 yards long
                        and were, at the proper time, led ashore and fixed on to Nos. 2 and 4
                        telephone wires on the posts on the canal bulk. The joints were made most
                        care fully, and in about half an hour the 300 lb. mine for No 1 hold was
                        ready for lowering. The mine was put into a canvas hammock, the rings of
                        which served as slings, All was now ready, and the charge was care- fully
                        raised and put into a boat, which, in its turn, was taken under the derrick
                        head with which the dahabesh had been specially fitted. The piece of cable
                        which was to connect the mines in Nos 1 and 3 holds being attached, and the
                        joint being covered with guttapercha, the mine was lifted by the winch and
                        gently lowered to the divers who were standing on the trunk deck waiting for
                        it, some 14 feet below the surface. Great care and gentleness was exercised
                        in the lowering of the charge as it would have been absolutely fatal had the
                        mine received the least shock, and after some little time taken in
                        manipulating the awkward ‘baby’ it eventually, some 15 minutes later, lay
                        resting on the cases of dynamite in the vessel's hold. To avoid any shock,
                        the rope by which the mine was lower- ed, was then cut, and the dahabeah
                        with its greatly relieved operators on board proceeded to the next hold to
                        which the divers had already gone, whilst the cable which would complete the
                        circuit between the two charges was enrolled from a boat. Before going any
                        further the first shore line was sent away and tied to a post as it was not
                        safe to connect in any way with shore lines until all the work on the
                        Chatham had been finished.</p>
                    <p>The divers then opened np hold No. 3 whilst Mr. Harris went on with his
                        joints and con- nections, if anything more carefnlly than before. All being
                        ready at eight o’clock, the second charge was lowered in its hammock and
                        placed in dose proximity to the case of detonators, which had been the Canal
                        Company’s "bate noir” in the early days of this dangerous and most anxious
                        problem. By 8.15 a.m. all was ready, and the boats were sent away to the
                        tugs waiting some little distance north of the ship, and these vessels at
                        once left for Port Said at top speed. Mr. Harris and his little select group
                        then went about their final shore connections, whilst Mr. Tillier
                        telegraphed to Port Said to hoist the signal which would tell the people of
                        that town that in an hour, vix., at 9.50 a.m., the wires would be fired. In
                        a few moments the wires were connected and the party left for the firing
                        point where were assembled Mr. Tillier, Mr. Coallant, Mr. Doyen, Mr. Schmid,
                        and Mr. Perrier, no one else being allowed within the cordon of sol- diery
                        which had been drawn at an early hour at kilometre 3.1.</p>
                    <p>Arriving at the firing point, kilometre 12.52, the experts proceeded to test
                        the wires, the result of which would prove whether the explo- -ion would
                        occur or not, for were there the very least fault in the wires or
                        connections the galvanometer would show at once the use- lessness of
                        proceeding further, and the need fir at once lifting the charges anew and
                        making new joints and examinung the whole length of three miles of wire. The
                        galvsnomoter register- ed a force of 11, and with a sigh of great relief the
                        party lit up pipes and cigars to await the appointed time knowing that the
                        ship would go up the moment the twist exploder lever was put down. </p>
                    <p>At 9.45 a.m. the first wire was screwed on to the exploder and in four
                        minutes the other wire was treated similarly, whilst the little party stood
                        round, watches in hand, waiting the word from Mr. Tillier on whose time the
                        order to hoist the Port Said signal was made. Precisely at 9.50 a.m Mr.
                        Harris quietly took out his handkerchief and firmly grasped the lever,
                        thrusting it down with all his force. Istant- aneously, and before he had
                        taken his hand off the lever, a shock was felt as if the ground had been
                        struck heavily in the near vicinity, and an immense column of water, sand,
                        debris, stones, and pieces of iron ascended and con- <cb/>tinued to ascend
                        for five seconds, getting blacker every moment as the fragments in- creased
                        in number. The column appeared at first like a huge fountain, and as it grew
                        it assumed the form of an immense black tree with great branches. Up it went
                        with great rapidity, growing in height, density, and volume, till 15 seconds
                        after the explosion it had attained a measured height of 560 yards and had
                        spread the width of the canal twice over. The water boiled and foamed, being
                        scattered the while in a hundred ways all across the canal. The report,
                        which resembled that of a 4.7 gun at a distance of say 500 yards, reached
                        the firing point 16 seconds after the lever was put down and considerably
                        surprised me by its feebleness. I think most of the other untechnical
                        watchers, like me, expectated a much louder report and several of them
                        remarked on the weakness of both sound and shock. Thirty-five seconds after
                        the charges were fired, the greater part of the debris had fallen, but for
                        fully two min- utes the sir was full of mist and the water above the remains
                        of the unfortunate ship continued to boil up violently and tear up the banks
                        of the canal. Whilst awaiting the train, which was in readiness with some 50
                        guests on board at kilometre 8, the party amused itself in trying to
                        discover the extent of the damage to the canal, but this distance was too
                        great and nothing was certain. No tidal wave accompanied the explosion
                        though a current with a veloc- ity of about two miles an hour ran past
                        kilometre 12 and back some few minutes after; nor did any debris reach the
                        spot—both of which points Mr. Harris had declared himself sure of.</p>
                    <p>The train arriving shortly after, the party proceeded slowly fearing
                        accidents to the wires at Ras el Esh where telegraph line staffs were
                        stationed to get their lines at once in order. Slowly and carefully we went
                        on to kilometre 18 and there stopped, finding the line smother- ed in grass,
                        reeds, trees, telegraph wires, frag- ments of iron etc., and the country
                        inundated, but rapidly drying, for some 1,009 yards round the spot.</p>
                    <p>With great excitement the guests and Mr. Harris' party left the train and
                        crossed the fresh water canal by the bridge which had been erected the
                        previous day, find- ing the fresh water canal intact, though very muddy and
                        thick with weeds, grass, and trees. Arriving on the maritime canal bank
                        walking became difficult. Wires, posts, pieces of ship's plates, beaxs, and
                        frames were sticking up in all directions and the surface of the ground was
                        under water in places, and muddy in the extreme.</p>
                    <p>No telegraph posts were actually down but all the wires were off the posts,
                        lying about everywhere and covered with a thick coating of oxide. Along the
                        African bank, which had not suffered in the least except for numerous and
                        immense holes in the ground where the masses of water had descended, all was
                        desolation and wreck.</p>
                    <p>In a circle of about 600 yards radius thous- ands of pieces of the ship lay
                        in confusion and all the country had been covered deeply in water. Dead fish
                        were plentiful and were secur- ed by the Arabs on the train.</p>
                    <p>The Railway staff at once proceeded to their survey but found no damage
                        beyond a few loose bolts and the telegraph parties started at once to repair
                        the damage to their lines. The Asiatic bank presented a truly awful sight
                        with a huge hole driven into it of some 70 yards wide and 250 long, strewn
                        with wreck- age and coke in a fine powder.</p>
                    <p>The fore end of the ship as far as abaft the engine room had completed
                        disappeared, the mainmast in small pieces lay resting on what little
                        remained of the poop and no signs were visible of anything else belonging to
                        the ship except the hundreds of pieces with which the East bank and its
                        environs were strewn.</p>
                    <p>Immense fissures were cut in all directions, the wreck lay everywhere in
                        thick mud, half a mile way great pieces of engines and plates were standing
                        sentry over the surronnding waste of marsh and desert. All was black from
                        the coke dust and smelt strongly of nitro- glycerine, the fumes from which
                        were contin- ually rising from what was left of the vanished but famous
                        Chatham.</p>
                    <p>A hurried survey with the lead line was made before the officials and Mr.
                        Harris’ party left for Port Said after their mostt anxious and tiring day.
                        At the spot where the fore end of the ship lay -yesterday there were 22
                        metres of water. The depths varied from 20 to 15 metres and in the middle of
                        the canal where originally 9 metres covered the bottom, only 6, or even
                        less, could be measured. The shock had excavated hundreds of tons of mud and
                        sand and deposited it towards the African shore.</p>
                    <p>Railway traffic was resumed this afternoon by 3 o'clock, whilst the State
                        telegraph lines were repaired and in use by half past one and those of the
                        Canal Company only half an hour later. Great relief is felt at the little
                        damage which has been done and Port Said especially congratulates itself
                        upon the escape of its fresh water supply from any interuption, as this was
                        regarded as more than possible. It cannot be definitely said for how long
                        the canal traffic will be delayed but I hardly think that a clear passage
                        will be obtained for another ten days. I shall, however, be able to tell you
                        more when I have learnt the results of the soundings which are, at the time
                        of writing, being taken. Tags, divers, sounders, and dredgers are all on the

                    <p>A remarkable example of the terrors of the unknown has been affurded by the
                        scare created in Port Said by the blowing up of the Chatham which was
                        successfully effected shortly before ten o'clock. Shops in the town remained
                        unopen, people left their houses in fear that they would collapse, and in a
                        variety of other ways showed their dread of the effects of the explosion.
                        And yet when it did take place, even the sound of it in the still morn- ing
                        air was so dull that it might well have passed unnoticed by any one not
                        expecting anything out of the common. Seated on a chair placed on the frail
                        covering of the water tank on the roof of the Eastern Exchange and exposed
                        to the foil glare of a burning sun, with eyes or glass fixed on one spot,
                        the time of waiting, seemed long. The signal flag was hoisted on the Canal
                        Company’s offices a little before nine o'clock. The hour struck, all of us,
                        (about a dozen) were gazing intently on the distant landscape, but the
                        minutes went by, the chimes told the quarter-past, half-past,and a quarter
                        to ten without the least sign of anything having happened. But directly
                        after wards two or three steam launches were seen to be rapidly coming in
                        the direction of Port Said and it was evident that the moment for which we
                        were eagerly waiting was at hand. At seven minutes to ten a huge gray column
                        slowly rose and spread out like a tree, disap- pearing again in the space of
                        a few seconds, almost before the dull muffled sound of the explosion was
                        heard. This column rose to an enormous height impossible to estimate, and
                        consisted of water and sand, though it looked more like smoke. Not the
                        slightest earth tremor could be detected and the water below us was not in
                        the least disturbed.</p>
                    <p>I understand that little more than I have described was experienced by those
                        who went by the special train and who were unable to get any nearer than
                        five miles from the scene of explosion.</p>
                    <p>Altogether the damage done has been far below even the minimum estimate and
                        it seems to be only a question of the removal of the wreckage of the ship
                        and the time in which this can be effected, before the traffic of the canal
                        can be resumed. The present estimate is that it will take about three or
                        four days only.</p>

                    <p>Port Said, Friday, 9.22 a.m. The following were present at the electric
                        generative station at kilometre 12 yesterday:— iMM. Coallant, Tillier,
                        Diyeo, Jasserand, Schmitt, Lieutenant Cunningham, Mr. Harris and his two
                        assistants. The first wire was connected at a quarter to ten exactly, the
                        second at 9.49 a.m. and the explosion took place in less than one second
                        after Mr. Harris had pressed the lever of the twist exploder. In one second
                        the column of water had risen to a height of 100 yards, in eight seconds it
                        measured 400 yards and in twelve seconds a height of 550 yards was reached.
                        Then the debris was seen to rise in great masses, and pieces of iron
                        weighing more than a ton were thrown into the air as high as half a mile.
                        The mixture of water, sand, and debris continued to rise for thirty five
                        seconds. It is anticipated that further explosions will be necessary to
                        complete the destruction of the vessel. Prompt measures were taken by the
                        Canal Company officials towards repairing the damage done. At two o’clock
                        sounding and repairing gangs, engineers, divers, and dredgers were hard at
                        work and careful surveys were being made. The length of time for which the
                        canal traffic will be interrupted cannot be estimated accurately until the
                        report which the engineers make as a result of their survey is to hand, but
                        it is generally anticipated that it will be a week. Mr. Harris, however,
                        considers that ships will be able to pass through in safety in less than a
                        week's time.</p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN SHARE MARKET (From our Financial Correspondent).</head>
                    <p>London, September, 22. The dominating factor during the earlier part of the
                        week has again been the money market and the question as to what action
                        would be taken by the dimeters of the Bank of England at their meeting
                        yesterday was dis- cussed. Opinions were fairly evenly divided respecting a
                        rise in the Bank rate but three discount houses which accepted six months
                        Bank bills at 2 1/2 have proved correct in their anticipations rather than
                        those which declined them under 3 2/5, for no change was made of the
                        directors yesterday, the weekly return showing a stronger position then was
                        expected. The Bank rate therefore remains for the present at 3 %. The
                        opening of the markets yesterday shows that this was pretty well anticipated
                        before midday with the consequence that there was a more cheerful tendency
                        all round, and prices generally hardened. Consols, which we quoted last week
                        at 89 13/15. have been up again to 89 7/8, and today close at. 89 9/25 This
                        upward tendency has permeated all other gilt- edged securities, and they may
                        be said to be on the advancing tack again.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Government bonds gained renewed strength on Continental buying.
                        Japanese stocks were in special requests on a report which comes from a
                        creditable source that Japan is already rewiring large amounts of money in
                        respect of the Manchurian railway. The new loan is quoted at 4 7/8 Russian
                        bonds have been firmer, it being reported that M. Witte has had an interview
                        with Messrs Rothschild. Baron Hottingner, and Herr Pisehel. of Berlin, for
                        the purposes of raising a "Peace" loan. The situation is considered
                        favourable for the launching of this shortly, and it is believed that the
                        loan will be offered in France, Germany, Belgium and Holland, but not the
                        United States.</p>
                    <p>In the Home Railway market, increased traffics, the result of the steady
                        improvement in trade, have produced a hardening tendency in prices. The
                        amalgamation of the Great North of Scotland Railway with the Highland
                        Railway, which is now on the tapis, and will probably be consummated era
                        long, is looked upon favourably. The Amarican market has been stronger
                        throughout the week, and Pacifica have taken the lead again. Not with-
                        standing that the bulls have been taking profits, the shares have steadily
                        risen, and it is predicted that they will shortly reach 200.</p>
                    <p>There is little to report regarding, move- ments in the Egyptian share market
                        generally. Stocks have been quite inactive since our last, with, if
                        anything, a slightly easier tendency. It is expected that the new Bank of
                        Abyssinia, is about to make its appearance under the auspices of the
                        National Bank, and, although nothing definite is yet known of the exact
                        nature of the issue, it is favourably spoken of. It is believed that the
                        last issue of New Natio- nal Bank shares was with connected with the
                        Abyssinian venture. National Banks close to-day 27 7/8 and Agricultural
                        Banks 14 5/8.</p>
                    <p>The only news to hand since our last with reference to the Societe de
                        Sucreries et de la Raffinerie d'Egypt is that the accounts show a loss of
                        L.F.213,000 over a period of ten months to the end of August last. In this
                        is not included a deficiency of £920,000 which must be added to the former
                        sum in the event of the Company being declared responsible for the bills
                        drawn by M. Cronier. Daira Sugar shares are still quoted 4 3/4 and Daira
                        Sanieh 27 7/8. Some business has been taking piece in the 1/2%. Preference
                        shares of Walker and Meima- rachi which are quoted at 3 3/4 to 4 1/4. , In
                        the mining market, the week has ended with a slightly firmer tendency in
                        prices, and in the Rhodesian market Bankets are well maintained at £4. Mr.
                        Garthwaile’s report, whilst not entirely optimistic, is looked upon with
                        more or less favour as giving a tree version of the real state of affairs in
                        the Banket section.</p>
                    <p>In the Egyptian mining market, Nile Valleys have slightly eased off since
                        last week, and are now 1 3/16. ‘'Vigilant," in "Truth," says regard- ing
                        these:—“Nile Valleys are being favourably influenced by a cable announcing
                        that good rich ore has been located at the 200 feet level, the extent and
                        value of which has not yet been ascertained. This is pleasant reading
                        bearing in mind the discouraging developments of the past month or so.”</p>
                    <p>New Egyptians have also been easier at 1, whilst 15/ is the beet price for
                        Egyptian Mines Exploration. Egyptian Estates and Egyptian Trust are also
                        quoted at lower figures. United African Exploration, the mother company of
                        several Egyptian ventures, have improved in price to 1 1/4.</p>

                    <p>Noue extrayons du "Progrès” l'entrefilet suivant : Contrairement à ce qui a
                        été dit par un £ nos confrères, MM Leroux, de la Bouglisr, Poutrel, Pangalo
                        et Minci n'assistaient pas à l’entrevue que Harari pacha a eu hier matin
                        aveo l’hon. A. J. Davoy, aux Sucreries. Ces Messieurs n'avaient, en effet,
                        aucune qualité pour prendre part à la réunion. M. Ninci, en particulier,
                        bien quesimplementdémissiounairr, doit être considéré comme effectivement
                        li- cencié, ayant été mis 8n demeory ou de donner sa démission ou de
                        recevoir une lettre de ren- voi. Nona apprenons de la source la plus auto-
                        risée, que cette grave mesure a été prise à l'égard de M. Ninci par suite de
                        détournement depièoes, dont il so serait rendu coupable : un document
                        important serait encore dans les mains de M. Ninci. La lettre par laquelle
                        l'hon. Davey a accepté la démission de l'ancieu ad ministratenr fait
                        d'ailleurs toute réserve sur sa gestion.</p>

                    <head>UPPER NILE PROBLEMS. BY SIR WILLIAM GARSTIN. ( Continued. )</head>
                    <p>During July, then, daily increasing dischar- ges are arriving at Khartoum
                        from both the Blue and White Niles, and to these are added the volume of the
                        Atbara, north of the junc- tion. These three rivers combined cause the
                        annual flood rise in Egypt. In August, the effect of the two great eastern
                        flood-feeders becomes much more pronounced, and in this month occurs one of
                        the most important and most interesting phenomena of the entire Nile system.
                        At this period the flood discharge of the Blue Nile increases very rapidly,
                        and attains to a volume some ten times as great a* that brought down by the
                        White Nile. Tho Blue Nile now plays an exactly similar part (but upon an
                        infinitely larger scale, with regard to the White Nile) to that which I have
                        already described the Sobat as doing to the White Nile above the junction.
                        As soon as the Blue Nile flood exceeds a certain volume at Khartoum, it
                        Holds back the waters of the White Nile entirely - ponding them up and
                        forming an immense reservoir, which floods the White Nile valley for several
                        hundred kilometres up stream of the junction of the two rivers. This ponding
                        up is maintained until the discharge of the Blue Nile again falls below the
                        volume in question, which generally occurs in September. As soon as this
                        happens, the impounded water in the White Nile is set free, and passes on to
                        the north. As the Blue Nile discharge further decreases, its place is taken
                        by that of the White Nile water. In conse- quence of the water stored in the
                        reservoir, the discharge of this last river increases stead- ily until the
                        end of the year. When the Sobat also fills, the water held up in the smaller
                        reservoir—up stream of the junction with the White Nile- passes down the
                        latter channel and helps to maintain the supply. In the month of November,
                        when the Sobat discharge has shrunk to small dimensions, the equatorial lake
                        water, passing down the Bahr el Gabel, again becomes the main source of the
                        White Nile supply, but the water hold up in the two reservoirs above
                        mentioned is so considerable in quantity that, throughout the early winter
                        months, the volume actually passing Khartoum is considerably greater than
                        that which comes down from the lakes after having passed through the great
                        marshes.</p>
                    <p>I hope I have succeeded in making the above comprehensible. To those who do
                        not know the Nile, and who have not studied its discharges, it is difficult
                        to explain this wonder- ful arrangement, by which these rivers auto-
                        matically compensate one another, so that at the time when the one system is
                        passing on a large volume of water, the other is storing up its discharge,
                        and when the former begins to decrease in volume the stored water takes its
                        place and makes good the deficiency.</p>
                    <p>I must now say a low words regarding the water requirements of Egypt and of
                        the Sudan.</p>
                    <p>Many people, I think, know that in Egypt there are two systems of
                        irrigation—the one known as “basin," and the other as “perennial’
                        irrigation. The former system, which dates from the days of the Pharaohs,
                        consists of turning the Hood-water over the land, then draining it off, and
                        sowing a crop upon the slime thus deposited. In the latter system water is
                        given throughout the year, but only in such quantities as required, and is
                        our. trolled in an elaborate system of canals. By this last method the more
                        valuable crops such as cotton and sugar-cane, are raised, and land
                        perennially irrigated increases in value over that watered as “basin" to an
                        extra ordinary extent. Consequently, all the effort of the irrigation
                        service in Egypt are directed to devising some means by which—during this
                        month previous to the flood, when the river would be naturally at its
                        lowest—the supply of the Nile may be materially increased and the area of
                        land perennially irrigated mater ially augmented.</p>
                    <p>To begin with the water requirements of Egypt. The latest return assess the
                        total cultivable area at eight millions of acres, of which about one million
                        consists of waste land From this total it will be safe to deduct half a
                        million acre; as representing land unfit for cultivation. Another half
                        million acres border ing the edge of the western desert south of Cairo will
                        aways be reserved as basin. This reduces the area to seven millions acres.
                        Of this, four million acres, at present, receive peronnial irrigation, and
                        by the end of 1908, the conversion of the basins will raise this total to
                        four and a half millions. Deducting this figure, there remain two and a half
                        mil lion acres to be provided for. Experience has shown that one milliard
                        (1,000 millions) of cubic metres of water stored will suffice for the summer
                        irrigation of half a million acres of land. Consequently, these two and a
                        half million acres will require a storage of five milliards of cubic metres
                        of water.</p>
                    <p>The question before us is —how are these five milliards to be obtained ? The
                        Assouan dam, if raised, will provide for another half million acres ; but,
                        even suppos- ing this be done, there will still be four milliards of cubic
                        metres to be eventually provided.</p>
                    <p>The depression in the western desert— known as the Wadi Rayyan—has been pro
                        posed as a reservoir. It is very possible that it may one day be made use of
                        for this purpose but, owing to its situation, it would probably be best
                        reserved until such time as the question of reclaiming and irrigating the
                        shallow lake which border the northern delta shall become one of
                        urgency.</p>
                    <p>It is probable that storage reservoirs, of sufficient capacity to store the
                        required four milliards, can be constructed in the Nile valley, somewhere
                        between the second and the sixth cataracts. This cannot, however, be stated
                        with certainty until the survey of the cataracts —now in progress—shall have
                        been completed. Meanwhile, supposing it were possible to construct each
                        reservoirs, it would be im- possible to fill them with water, unless the
                        winter supply in the river, brought down from the south, be largely
                        increased. Those responsible for irrigation in Egypt are well aware that
                        under present conditions, in a year of low supply, it would only just be
                        possible , to store another milliard of water above the Assouan dam, if
                        raised as proposed. I say this would be just possible, but in doing so the
                        extreme limit of water available for storage would be reached, and
                        undoubtedly the winter navigation of the Nile, between Assouan and Cairo,
                        would suffer very considerably. In order, then, to find the extra water
                        required, some means must be found of increasing the flow of the Upper Nile
                        during the periods of winter, spring, and early summer.</p>
                    <p>Now, as to the irrigation requirements of the Sudan.</p>
                    <p>The area of cultivable land in the Sudan may almost be termed unlimited, as a
                        far larger area exists than could ever be irrigated by the Nile, supposing
                        that its waters were entirely devoted to such a purpose. The irrigation
                        limits, then, are those due to the water avail- able, the physical features
                        of the country, and the density of population. Large tracts, how- ever, are
                        blessed with a bounteous rainfall, and much of the area is so scantily
                        populated that it may be left out of the present calcula- tion. It will be
                        amply sufficent, for all present needs, to select those tracts which, from
                        their favourable situation, appear to be most likely to bring in a return
                        for money expended. Among such areas are the lands of the north- eastern
                        Ghezireh—namely, the land lying be- tween tho two Niles. To these may he
                        added the tracts bordering the cast bank of the Blue Nile. Tho extent of
                        laud that can be irrigated must depend entirely upon the amount of water
                        that the proposed new works can secure for the summer irrigation of this
                        country, but, if a few million acres can be thus benefited, ample provision
                        will have been made for the wants of the next generation of Sudanese.</p>
                    <p>In a recent report upon the basin of the Upper Nile I recommended that all
                        summer water available in the Blue Nile should be made use of for the Sudan
                        alone, while the waters of the White Nile should be reserved for Egypt and
                        the river valley between Khartoum and Assouan. I ven- ture to think that
                        this recommendation is a sound one,and it certainly logical. The richest
                        ands in the Sudan—namely, those I have alluded to above—can only be watered
                        by means of the Blue Nile. The White Nile owing to its feeble elope, is not
                        suitable for any large irrigation schemes, and, moreover, the lands
                        adjoining it are not nearly so rich as those upon the Blue Nile. As it its
                        im- material to Egypt from whence is water shall be derived, of maintain
                        that the White Nile must be need to a carrying channel for con- veying water
                        to that country, while the Blue Nile water must be reserved for the benefit
                        of the countries adjoining it, which can bf irrigated by no other means, The
                        projects, with the proposed expenditure, may then be divided into two
                        categories: those relating to the White Nile, which will benefit Egypt; and
                        those on the Blue Nile, which will benefit the Sudan alone.</p>
                    <p>I will discuss the schemes regarding the White Nile first, as they are not
                        only larger but infinitely more difficult to pronounce de finitely upon than
                        those contemplated for tLi Blue Nile. In order to comprehend what ii
                        proposed it will be necessary to study thi accompanying map. ,</p>
                    <p>It will be Been that the Bahr el Gebel, or White Nile, leaves the cataract
                        region and enters the marshes, near the Belgian port of Rajaf, and down
                        stream of the Pedden Rapids For the purposes of this note th:s point may be
                        considered to be Gondokoro, the Uganda frontier station, which is situated a
                        few miles to the north.</p>
                    <p>Between Gondokoro-and Bor—a distance of 100 miles—the river is bordered by
                        wide swamps, but does not enter the great marshes in which the sudd blocks
                        occur, until the latter point is reached. Consequently, although im-
                        provement of the channel between the two places will be requisite, in order
                        to enable it to carry the extra water required, the work will be
                        comparatively straightforward, and, in any case, no alternative line exists.
                        This portion of the scheme is, of course, common to all projects for
                        improving the White Nile. What is re quired here is the widening and
                        deepening of the channel, upon a sufficient scale, and the closing of all
                        the spills by which the river water is wasted in the marshes.</p>
                    <p>North of Bor, however, there are severs alternative proposals, and it is here
                        that the real difficulties commence. I should mention that what is called
                        Bor consists merely of a collection of Dinka villages, but this place
                        becomes important from the point of view of our schemes as being the last
                        point where the high bank—on the east — abuts upon the river before the
                        latter loses itself in the great swamps. I have said that, in all our
                        schemes for increasing the Egyptian water supply, we must turn to the White
                        Nile Although at the sources of this river Nature has provided water in
                        abundance she has tantalisingly erected an effectual barrier to its being
                        made use of, in the shape of the vast marshes, through which the river
                        struggles for nearly five hundred miles, and in which it loses more than
                        half its volume. All our aims must then be directed to devising some means
                        by which this waste may be avert ed, and by which the lost river may be
                        enabled to pass through the swamps in undiminished in volume.</p>
                    <p>I have mentioned that the first reach of tl river—from Gondokoro to Bor—has a
                        length 109 miles. The projects for further re- modelling the Upper Nile most
                        all lie within the reach between Bor and the junction of the Sobat with the
                        White Nile—a distance of some 444 miles, as measured upon the river
                        itself.</p>
                    <p>A farther reference to the map will show that, at 366 miles below Bor, the
                        Bahr-el-Ghazal meets the Bahr el Gebel—the junction a shall- ow sheet of
                        water known as Lake No, and called by the Arabs "Moghren el Buhur." or the
                        Meeting of the Rivers. Also, it will be observed that, from below Bor,
                        somewhere in the marshes, a loop of the Bahr-el-Gebel runs to the east,
                        conveying the White Nile between Lake No and the Sobat junction. This loop
                        is known as the Bahr-el Zaraf, or Giraffe River, and is formed by numerous
                        spills from the Bahr-el-Gebel. In its upper course this river is difficult
                        to trace, but lower down it has a well-defined channel. It is not easy to
                        make the above explanations clear and comprehensible ; the nomenclature of
                        these rivers is so perplex ing. I hope, however, that the map will render
                        assistance in this respect, and, in order to understand what is proposed, it
                        is indispen- sable that these names should be borne in mind.</p>
                    <p>The problem, then, before us is—how best to improve the river, between Bor
                        end the Sobat junction, so as secure that the summer supply passing the
                        former point from Gondo- koro shall be delivered et the Sobat juno- tion
                        with as small amount of loss as is possible.</p>
                    <p>Obviously, the natural way to do this, and that which would occur to everyone
                        first visiting these rivers, or studing their course upon the map, would be
                        to take np and im- prove either the Bahr-el Gebel or the Bahr- el-Zaraf—
                        widening and deepening the one or the other, by means of dredgers, and, at
                        the same time, closing all its outlets into the marshes, so as to render it
                        capable of carry- ing the required supply. I mention that neither of these
                        channels is at present at all capable of doing this. The Bahr-el-Gebel,
                        which is the main stream and by far the larger of the two, can, under
                        present conditions, only carry one third of the future required supply. The
                        Bahr-el-Zaraf, again, has a very much smaller section, and is even less
                        fitted for what is required. Neither of these streams has any banks at all,
                        and, were any extra water turned into them, it would only spill over into
                        the marshes and be lost by evap- aration, and by the absorption of the
                        water- weeds which cover this area.</p>
                    <p>In my last year’s report, to which allusion has already been made, I
                        described an alterna- tive scheme which, if feasible, is to my mind, a great
                        improvement upon either of the others. The original idea for this scheme was
                        first suggested to me by Mr. J. S. Beresford, late Inspector-General of
                        Irrigation in India. I will describe it.</p>
                    <p>Between Bor and the Sobat junction, the Nile takes a great bend to the west.
                        A straight line drawn between these two points, upon a meridian, would not
                        only shorten the distance between them very considerably, but would pass
                        through dry land, leaving the entire swamp area well to the west of it. The
                        project then is to out a channel—between Bor and the Sobat
                        junction—sufficiently large to take the entire future summer discharge of
                        the Upper Nile, but not large enough to take in the flood water. This last
                        is an important point I will explain why.</p>
                    <p>When I first passed through the sudd in the year 1900, and for several years
                        after, I was under the impression that—although in sum- mer (when the river
                        is low) the waste through the marshes was excessive—daring flood, when the
                        volume is large, the mass of the river water passed through the swamps and
                        found its way into the White Nile, down-stream of them, with but little
                        diminution. Consequen- tly, all my earlier projects for improvement were
                        based upon the idea that it was neces- sary so to widen the river, through
                        the marshes, as to render it capable of carrying the entire flood discharge
                        passing Gondokoro. It was not until the sudd had been removed, and I was
                        able to obtain a series of consec- utive measurements of the discharges,
                        above and below the obstacle, that I realised that my first impression had
                        been erroneous, and that the greater the volume of water arriv- ing at the
                        south end of the marshes, the larger is the proportion of loss in that is-
                        suing from their northern extremity. Farther, it was not until two years ago
                        that I grasped the real solution of the problem—namely, that these marshes
                        provide a magnificent natural escape for the flood-water, and that all oar
                        efforts should be devoted to encour- aging it to spread over them, and be
                        thus wasted and evaporated, while the precious si name r water is confined
                        to a well-defined and satisfactorily constructed channel of its own, and
                        conveyed to the north with com- paratively little waste. All the present
                        sche- mes are based upon this idea, which has im- mensely simplified the
                        problem to be solved.</p>
                    <p>Now, in the case of the remodelling of the existing channels—the
                        Bahr-el-Gebel and the Bahr el-Zaraf—there are certain disadvantages and
                        difficulties, to which I will afterwards allude, in the way of so
                        constructing either channel that it may carry the entire summer water
                        supply, and yet permit of the flood- water escaping into the marshes. In the
                        case of the proposed new cut, from Bor to the Sobat, such difficulties do
                        not arise.</p>
                    <p>A masonry regulator (with a look for navi- gation) would be built at the head
                        of the new channel, while another masonry regulator would be constructed
                        across the river bed at Bor. The new cut would thus assume the cha- racter
                        of a large artificial canal, and, by means of the regulators, the most
                        perfect control over its discharge, and over that of the river, would be
                        secured. Thus, in winter and in summer, when it was desired to pass down all
                        the water in the river to the north, the head regulator of the new channel
                        would be completely opened, and the regulator acroes the .Nile would be
                        closed. At this time no water would past into the marshes. In flood the
                        reverse would be the case. The Nile regulator would be fully opened, so that
                        the flood water could pass through and lose itself in tha swamps, while the
                        head of the new channel would be so regulated upon that only so much water
                        would be permitted to pass down it as was required for navigation. It must
                        be remembered that, at this season, no water is required in the White Nile
                        from the south, as the Sobat discharge, during the flood months, takes the
                        place of the Bahr el Gebel water and arrests the latter entirely.</p>
                    <p>Undoubtedly this project is a most attractive one, and to my mind—always
                        supposing that farther detailed studies shall not prove it to be
                        impracticable— it is the soundest of all those under consideration for
                        impro- ving the Upper Nile. It requires no technical knowledge to understand
                        and appreciate how great would be the advantages to be gained by the
                        construction of such a diversion of the river. The present long winding
                        channel through the marshes would be replaced by a straight cut, through dry
                        land, very much shorter than the existing line. This cut would be under
                        complete control, owing to the regulator at its head. There should be
                        comparatively little loss throughout its length, as the velocity would be
                        considerable, and its alignment would take it well to the east of the
                        swamps. The earth derived from the excavation of the channel would form wide
                        banks on either side, which would form good lines of communication, even
                        during the rainy season, and upon which the trans continental telegraph
                        line, sod even the railway—should this last ever be constructed—might with
                        advantage be placed. No obstruction would be caused to the drainage east of
                        the channel, which would flow, most probably, into the Khor Filus, a
                        drainage line running parallel to the new cat. Lastly, the flood water
                        should not enter the new channel at all—beyond the amount actually required
                        for navigation—but would spread all over the marshes and be lost by
                        evaporation. In this way a perfect control over the Upper Nile could at all
                        seasons be obtained.</p>
                    <p>I give here the approximate distances bet- ween Gondoro and the Sobat
                        junction by the three respective schemes I have mentioned. I ought to say
                        that the length of the proposed new channel, between Bor and the Sobat, is,
                        approximately, 210 miles. These figures show how great is the advan- tage,
                        as regards distance, to be gained by the new channel.</p>
                    <p>I do not consider that any of the objections that I have seen brought forward
                        against this project militate seriously against its sound- ness. My own
                        objection to it, and that which, to my mind, may cause its abandonment, is
                        the probable cost of such a work. This mast necessarily be very great, and
                        it is quite pos- sible that it may prove to be so excessive as to be
                        prohibitive. Until the levelled survey has been completed it is useless to
                        speculate upon this point, as it is impossible to prepare any estimate which
                        can be, in the slightest degree, an accurate one. It may be that the
                        longitud- inal slope of the country between Bor and tho Sobat may prove to
                        be so feeble that a very large cross section of channel will be entailed,
                        and consequently an immense cube of excava- tion. On the other hand, it may
                        be that the great gain in distance secured by this channel may compensate
                        for this extra cube, as com- pared with the other projects. We cannot yet
                        say, and must await the detailed survey.</p>
                    <p>Another objection that occurs to me as regards the new channel, though not so
                        serious as the foregoing, lies in the difficulties of its execution, and the
                        time that the work might take to complete. I hope, however, that, with the
                        progress made in recent year in the way of perfecting types of hydraulic
                        dredgers and steam excavator*, it may be found that such difficulties may
                        not prove to be so great ax they at present appear. It must be understood
                        that, whatever may be the project finally selected, machinery must be made
                        use of in its execution, as the employment of hand labour upon a large scale
                        in these regions is quite out of the question. (To be continued.)</p>
