                    <head>CHURCH AND STATE IN FRANCE.</head>
                    <p>"Al Mulk wa ad Din Towaman," the State and the Church are twins, says the
                        Arabic adage, and the subjection of civil polity and social life to the
                        authority of a religious creed has been conscientiously carried out by all
                        the nations which follow the teaching of the Arabian Prophet with, it must
                        be admitted even by the warmest admirers and stoutest defenders of the Faith
                        of Islam, very disappointing results. The fatal result of a steadfast
                        adherence to a rigid system of dogma" and ceremonial framed to meet the
                        needs of society as it existed in Arabia thirteen hundred years ago is
                        visible in the political condition of the nations of Islam at the present
                        day. Incapable of an independent existence or of</p>
                    <p>united</p>
                    <p>action, they are fast passing into the hands or under the control of the
                        aliens and foreigners whom they formerly met and fought on equal terms. And
                        a similar decadence has overtaken the Latin nations of Christendom which
                        have persisted in their loyalty to a spiritual dominion which was evolved by
                        the political exigencies of the Middle Ages, and which has become an
                        anachronism in the world of to-day. Spain and Portugal are now of little
                        more account in the world than Turkey or Morocco. The Renaissance and the
                        Reformation were the fruits of the awakening of the peoples of Europe to the
                        fact that it was impossible for the human intelligence to remain for ever
                        chained to an unchangeable system of social and ethical laws and
                        regulations. Even after the Protestant Reformation the old idea of the
                        necessity for the supremacy of the Church over the State re-asserted itself
                        among the recently enfranchised nations. The Puritans in England aimed at
                        the establishment of a theocracy on the model of that described in the
                        Pentateuch: and discerning men among the Presbyterians of Scotland observed that "new Presbyter was only old Priest writ large." But the march of
                        Rationalism, once started, could not be arrested by the zealots of the Kirk
                        any more than by the fanatics of the Inquisition. The forms of religion were
                        still strictly observed, but they were no longer allowed to direct the
                        policy of the country. But the nations which adhered to the older forms lost
                        ground continually. The state of Spain and Portugal we have already remarked
                        upon; Catholic Poland was torn in pieces by its neighbours; Catholic Austria
                        was thrust from the hegemony of Germany by Protestant Prussia. France, the
                        eldest daughter of the Church, the champion of the Catholic cause in Europe,
                        was beaten and humiliated by England, stripped of her colonies, made
                        bankrupt both of fame and credit. Then her people, furious at the system
                        which had brought the country to such a pass, rose in arms against it. They
                        tore down the altars, they slew the priests, or hunted them from <cb n="6"
                        />the country, their atheistical armies beat the allied armies of believers
                        arrayed against them and chased the Pope from Rome. For ten years France was
                        a country without any religion at all.</p>
                    <p>But the inevitable reaction came and the cunning Corsican, who rose to power
                        out of the welter of the Revolutionary orgies, knew how to profit by it. He
                        resolved to restore the partnership between Church and State, but with the
                        proviso that the former should become the obedient servant of the latter. He
                        set up the old idols and the old fetishes again for the repenting iconoclast
                        nation to worship. When he attended in State the first mass celebrated in
                        the restored Cathedral of Notre Dame, the staunch Republican General Delmas
                        said to him, "Sire, it seems a pity that there were only a million of meu
                        killed to destroy what you are setting up again to-day !". Atter the fall of
                        Napoleon the impoverished Church regalued some of its former influence and
                        privileges under the Bourbon dynasty, but its old domination could no longer
                        be maintained, and under the liberal governments that succeeded, its
                        exclusive claims to recognition as the State's religious confessor were no
                        longer to be tolerated. Protestants and Jews formed such numerous and
                        clamorous minorities that their voices could not be silenced, and the French
                        Government found themselves obliged to choose between two courses: either to
                        boldly sever the connection between Church and State altogether, or to
                        recognise and subsidise three State churches instead of one. They chose the
                        latter alternative, which, after all, has probably only proved a stepping
                        stone to the former. The Catholic, the Protestant Reformed, and the Jewish
                        churches in France all enjoy subsidies from the State, and are all subjected
                        to some sort of State supervision. This system, though it has been long in
                        operation, does not seem to satisfy the Catholic hierarchy, which longs for
                        a return to the old state of things, and is, rightly or wrongly, accused of
                        conspiring to bring it about. Consequently there is continual friction
                        between the Republican State and the Catholic Church, which has at last
                        culminated in the introduction of a Bill in the French Chamber for the
                        separation of Church and State. To this complexion it must come at last. The
                        whole trend of modern ideas and modern policy is in this direction. The
                        greatest Republic in the world, established by the descendants of English
                        Puritans exiled to the New World on account of their religious opinions,
                        announced this principle in its Declaration of Independence. All the new
                        nations springing into existence in the English self-governing Colonies have
                        adopted it. It is the natural corollary of complete religious freedom. A
                        nation in the twentieth century cannot suffer its evolution to be clogged
                        and hampered by an ecclesiastical system which was eminently suited to the
                        tenth. Even in England, where there is no question of Disestablishment
                        within the range of prac tical politics, we see the important work of
                        national education hindered by the quarrels of contending sects over the
                        schools. In the United States of America no religious lesson is given in the
                        national schools, for there is no national religion. The children are left
                        to learn their religion at home or in the Sunday schools. In Great Britain
                        many of the people who interest themselves in education and interfere in
                        educational matters do so simply to assist in propogating the religious
                        opinions of their own particular denomination.</p>
                    <p>And this is the chief grievance of the French Republicans against the
                        clerical party in France. They allege that the priests and monks engage in
                        educational work not for its own sake, nor even for the sake of religion,
                        but as a means of political proselytism. M. Combes and his friends hoped to
                        put an end to the stifled and subterranean warfare carried on between the
                        Republic and the Church of France, by divorcing the Church from the State
                        altogether. But success would not have extinguished eituer the hostility or
                        the activity of the former. If released from all responsibility to the
                        Government, and with no more dependence upon it for financial aid, the
                        Church would be free to throw its immense weight into the scale against the
                        men who had cast it out,</p>

                                distinctly political character. The demands include the recognition

                                regards the oppression of labour by capital. Attached to these

                        <p>A curious and painful incident occurred on Monday last at the Esbekieh
                            caracol. It appears that the "maitre d'armes" of the "40 Club," after
                            receiving some chairs which he had ordered, gave "backshish" to the Arab
                            who brought them, and was proceeding with a fencing lesson when a
                            message came by a shawish summoning him to the caracol It seems that the
                            Arab and an Italian who had helped him quarelled so violenty over the
                            division of the backshish that the police took both up and conveyed them
                            to the caracol. They had just been brought before the mamour when the
                            Italian threw up his arms and dropped dead. Heart disease is believed to
                            have been the cause of his death.</p>

                    <head>A SECOND SUEZ CANAL.</head>
                    <p>In last week's "Fairplay" there is an interest ing article putting forward a
                        strong plea for a second Suez Canal. We have before stated that we think
                        that the whole idea is somewhat chimerical, and that the dangers of the
                        present state of affairs are partly exaggerated, partly imaginary. If the
                        shipping interests have grievances against the Canal authorities, which we
                        have no wish to dispute, their proper course is to bring pressure on the
                        Government to get them remedied. Even if a second canal were practicable
                        without raising most serious inter national complications, the spending of
                        many millions on an unnecessary project in order to provide against a remote
                        and intangible con tingency would not be good for the country, however it
                        might benefit the shipping industry temporarily. And no one will seriously
                        contend that a second canal is necessary, or would pay as a commercial
                        venture. The article from "Fairplay" will be reproduced in to-morrow's

                    <p>The recent arrest of Ahmed Bay Saib in Cairo has occasioned a great deal of

                        Ottoman Government, and is a native of Daghestan and a Moslem. He served in
                        the Russian army, and subsequently deserted to the Turkish, where he
                        obtained the rank of captain. He afterwards was attached to the household of
                        the Ottoman High Commissioner in Egypt, where he became the object of
                        suspicion as it was believed that he belonged to the Young Turkish party. He
                        was accord ingly summoned to Stamboul, but preferred to resign his
                        appointment with Ghazi Muhktar Pasha and settle in Egypt, where he married a

                    <p>Among the arrivals by the Messageries boat this week we notice Mr. Pryor, of
                        the Cooper Steam Digger Company, who was in the country during last summer
                        with the company's No. 8 steam digger. The success of the trial held on the
                        Behera Company's estate in August has led to the design of a smaller and
                        lighter machine, named by the makers "No. 5." It speaks well for the future
                        of the digger that eleven orders have already been received from large land
                        companies and others before the first machine which is now due has ever been
                        seen at work in Egypt.</p>

                        increase steadily. Most of the officers were there on Wednesday, and dancing

                    <p>The issue of the Russian loan in Berlin has, according to telegrams received
                        from that centre, "been a great success," and subscribed for many times
                        over-no sooner were the lists open than they were at once closed. This part
                        of the programme has been carried out to the letter as every one here knew
                        it would be. The opening and closing operation was a little too precipitate
                        to be of any value, and gives the "show" away. We have thuch pleasure in
                        desuring our readers that the question of peace is now again to the fore,
                        and the services of the leading diplomats of the world are again in
                        requisition. Some of the best-informed say that it is much nearer than
                        generally supposed. Our good King's efforts at the time of the sailing of
                        the Baltic fleet were very near being successful, and should he see fit to
                        "offer advice with his consummate tact and ability, matters will soon take a
                        rapid turn for the better. Nevertheless Russia must have a very heavy bir to
                        pay, which will tax her resources to the utmost. The figures disclosed in
                        the Imperial Budget tor 1905, issued to-day in St. Petersburg, are of little
                        use to the financier desiting to know the true position of Russian finances,
                        because none of the expenditures in connection with the war have been
                        included!</p>

                        stocks have held their prices well during the week, in fact, the tone was
                        strong in the earlier part, Bank shares being largely bought, Nationals
                        touching 24 buyers. Delta Lands also were good and as high as 34, but this
                        price brought stock in and they have steadied down to 3 again. Delta Light
                        Railways are a good market at 12) and there are buyers of the Debentures at
                        over 101. Salt and Soda are an active market again at 2. In the mining
                        section Nile Valleys, after beginning the week dull at 21, rose to 21, but
                        are inclined to ease off again. United Africanis are steady at 1g. Egyptian
                        Mines look a weak market at 168. and there are said to be several sellers
                        about. South Africans have been idle and dull A rumour which is current at
                        the moment, that a large financial house here, which has only recently got
                        out of a tight cor ner, is again in difficulties, may in part explain the
                        weakness of Kallits, added to the fact that the speculative division inside
                        have been dis appointed since the turn of the year. The Foreign Market is
                        not a bad one: Japanese stocks are well supported and strong; Russians on
                        the other hand, after being temporarily propped up early in the week from
                        Berlin, for the benefit of yesterday's new issue, have given way again to
                        901. Investment stocks are fairly steady. The American market has a firm
                        tentency, with little doing at the moment. Consols close at 88§.</p>
