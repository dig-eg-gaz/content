                    <head>THE DUMA ELECTIONS.</head>
                    <p>In little more than five weeks the new Duma will be sitting in St.
                        Petersburg, and in some of the villages the elections have already begun.
                        The Continental Press, which is not favourable to the Russian Bureaucracy,
                        is filled with stories of the way in which the Government is tampering, and
                        is preparing to tamper, with the elections. It is accused of favouring by
                        every means in its power the candidates of the Right, namely, the League of
                        the Russian People, the Union of Law and Order, and the Octobrists, and of
                        paralysing and disorganising the parties of the Opposition. The lists of
                        voters are filled up irregularly, newspapers are suppressed, meetings of
                        elec- tors are forbidden, and suspects are marched oft to Siberia by the
                        hundred. The Government has completely regained the upper hand in the
                        provinces, and is taking care that a “good” Duma, as the phrase goes, shall
                        be returned. Had the St. Petersburg officials not been too proud to learn
                        from Servia and Bulgaria, they might have secured a proper majority in the
                        first Duma, but there is now every sign that the methods of those States
                        have been studied and carefully laid to heart. It is rather sur- prising
                        that Russia should ever have allowed the little Slav States at its door to
                        possess elected houses, for the example must necesarily have been bad from
                        the Bureaucratic point of view, but having allowed the creation of the
                        Skuptschina, it would have been well also to have studied the Government
                        methods of electing them. That has now apparently been done, and we may
                        expect the new Duma to reflect the amount of skill which the Rus- sian
                        officials have acquired in the manner in which elections in the minor Slav
                        States are managed and controlled.</p>

                    <head>GERMAN TRADE IN TURKEY.</head>
                    <p>There was a time when English manufac- tures and goods held the first place
                        in Turkey, and were approached by those of no other Power. But that is all
                        changed now, and for some years past, Germany has been all power- ful at the
                        Porte. A correspondent of the “Daily Telegraph,” writing from
                        Constantinople, gives several instances in which German contractors and
                        financiers have been favoured to the ex- clusion of English and other
                        non-German competitors. For this he gives two reasons, first, that the
                        German Government works in complete accord with its national commerce, and
                        any first-class firm can count on being backed to the utmost by the German
                        Embassy. Secondly, that English finance and industry, finding themselves
                        without support from the Government ,have gradually become dispirited, and
                        have abandoned the field to their Teutonic rivals. The correspondent urges
                        that our Am- bassador should strongly support our con- tractors and
                        financiers in their endeavour to recover a share of the trade of Turkey, but
                        he seems to overlook the fact that our diplomatists would urgfe in vain. The
                        people really re- sponsible for the boycott of all things Eng- lish in
                        Turkey are the fanatics who have never ceased to insult the Sultan and the
                        Turks: the people who talk of "Abdul the Damned” and so on. The Turks are a
                        slow race to rouse, but even they cannot be sup- posed to overlook the
                        torrent of insults and invective poured out on them by the Exeter Hall
                        crew.</p>

                        <p>We read in the "Matin” of January 10, 1907, the following:—M. Tronillot,
                            ex Minister of Commerce, who presided at the Commercial Corgress of the
                            "Matin,” delivered yesterday a discourse in London which was much
                            applauded, on the occasion of the inauguration of the new branch of the
                            Berlitz Schools for the instruction of French. The King was officially
                            represented by a member of the Royal family. This is a proof of how
                            esteemed the celebrated schools of languages are, and their success

                            estimates for the new construction of new railways in Egypt and the

                            proposed to be built, the cost being spread over the years 19 8-12; and,

                        <p>On Sunday afternoon the Turks and Turco- philes of Cairo celebrated the
                            608th anniversary of the foundation of the Turkish Empire by Ottoman, at
                            the Continental Hotel. Prince Haidar presided, and opened the
                            festivities with a speech in French, in which he reviewed the sad
                            situation in Turkey proper, owing to its bad government . Mustrapha
                            Pasha Kamel, who followed, was less pessimistic. Speaking in Arabic, he
                            alluded to the toleration of the Turkish people, and endeavoured to show
                            that, from the standpoint of politics and religion, the Egyptians ought
                            to take part in this festival. Djelaleddin Arif Bey, the lawyer, is an
                            eloquent Turkish orator, and wound up an im-passioned appeal with an
                            invocation of all Ottomans to unite to resonate Turkey from her
                            threatened ruin. Pierre Loti was an honoured guest, but did not venture
                            to voice his opinions ; possibly the author of "Disenchanted" felt that
                            the matter had been sufficiently dealt with by such a flood of
                            eloquence. He was, however, made mcuh of, and hailed "ami iutime” by
                            Kamel. The party then adjourned to the buffet, and did full justice to
                            its viands.</p>

                    <p>Yesterday evening the armed guard, which the authorities of the Alexandria
                        Gouvernorat had stationed at the Russian Consulate, was withdrawn, as the
                        Commandant of Police and the Russian Consol consider that there is no
                        farther danger of any outrage being attempted. There are still a number of
                        detectives in the immediate neighbourhood of the consulate keeping watch
                        lest some unex- pected assault should be made, and any suspicious-looking
                        individual approaching the con- sulate is carefuly scrutinised. Some strange
                        tales have been bruited about in the local Press as to the position and
                        careers of the three Russians. A Cairo newspaper declared that one of the
                        men was a Georgian prince of the name of Mitchikwadze, who was a prominent
                        member of the Russian Socialist party and had assassinated no less than
                        fifty- eight Russian officials before he left his native land. These and
                        such-like stories are pure inventions. The three men were individuals
                        belonging to the lower orders. One was an old sailor who had not done any
                        work for some time, another was a house painter by trade, while the third
                        was a young man who is known to have passed through three classes of a lower
                        grade school but had no claim to be considered a person of education. The
                        arrival of the three Russian prisoners in Port Said passed quite unpercieved
                        by the populace, abd the men were embarked with such swiftness that the news
                        had not time to spread about the town. The Russian S.S Korniloff was uuder
                        steam when the train with the prisoners arrived, and they were hurried on
                        board without a moment’s delay. </p>

                        here are accused, has been disoovered at the Pireans. The Athenian newspaper
                        "Akropolis," of the 26th inst., announces that two Russian Jews embarked as
                        passengers on board the Russian merchantman S.S. Mark at the Piraeus for
                        Odessa. One of the two men, whose name is Ivan Velinski, was found by the
                        captain of the ship to have in his possession two bombs and other explosive
                        material. He and his friends were arrested by the captain ard handed over to
                        the Russian man-of-war Ma-vrotb'achasetes, which is at the Pireaus. An
                        official enquiry was opened, and both the men confessed that they were
                        Anarchists. Ivan declared that he intended to blow up the ship after it had
                        left the port. He stated that he was quite willing to sacrifice his life in
                        order to effect his purpose. </p>

                        Bermnsi canals, which are not navigatble waterways. A part of the
                        above-mentioned sadd will be specially affected to transhipment of goods
                        arriving on boats. Tge transhipment will be carried out at the risk, peril,
                        expense, and care of the owners of the boats or goods. The sadd will be
                        closed about 10th March, and will be removed about 15th August. </p>

                        every two years; and a meeting of the association will be held next
                        September at The Hague. At present Great Britain and France have not
                        officially joined the association, but it is understood that a re-

                    <p>We will publish in a few days' time the prospectus of the Anglo-Egyptian
                        Finance and Exchange Company, Limited. It is based on very sound principles
                        and has been drawn up with a view to ensuring the maximum efficiency of the
                        company. There are no founders,’ preference, or deferred shares, and this
                        fact will greatly enhance the value of the shares of the company. No less
                        than two-thirds of the entire capital of the com-pany have already been
                        subscribed so that there will be a very small balance for public
                        subscription. The Anglo Egyptian Finance and Exchange Company, Limited, will
                        be floated early next month. This is an Egyptian company, but all the board
                        of directors and the management will be in Egypt. The capital will be
                        £200.000, of which only £67,000 will be offered for public subscription, as
                        the balance of the capital has already all been taken up by the memorandum
                        of association. There are 200,000 ordinary shares of £1 each, and there has
                        been no underwriting commission. The main objects of the company are to
                        carry on business as bankers, stock and share brokers, etc., in Cairo,
                        Alexandria and elsewhere. The subscription will be opened at the Anglo-
                        Egyptian Bank at Cairo, Alexandria, and the provincial branches on the 7th
                        and 8th proxo. There is already a premium of five-eighths on the shares,
                        which are being dealt in private- ly at that price.</p>

                    <p>The prospectus of the Egyptian Mail Steam- ship Company, Limited, appears to
                        have evoked some criticism among financial authorities in London, especially
                        as to the premium. The "Statist” remarks: "It will naturally be under- stood
                        that much depends upon the management and the issue can only be regarded as
                        a decidedly speculative one, and why the premium of £1 per share?” "Public
                        Opinion” says :— One of the most impudent attempts of re-cent years to raise
                        funds at the expense of the investing public is that now being made by the
                        Egyptian Mail Steamship Company, Ltd. The company proposes to establich what
                        it terms a "line” of steamships between Europe and Egypt. Such "line” is to
                        consist of—not ten or six or even foor, but—two steamers. Neither one is yet
                        built, and presumably delivery cannot be obtained until the public have
                        furnished the money to pay the builders. The contract price is £606,000,
                        which seems a pretty stiff figure. Admitting, however, that the price is no
                        more than the ships are worth, does it not seem ridiculous that a publics
                        company thould be formed to carry on a shipping business with only two
                        vessels, either of which or both may be lost or damaged so as to be
                        unnavigable? Of course, the boats will be insured, but in the event of the
                        con- tingency referred to the revenue of the com- pany would cease, and with
                        it the dividends to the shareholders. There would be nothing to take their
                        place—no reserve leet, as is the shipping companies with which we are
                        familiar, and which have served the public so well, and paid their
                        shareholders such good dividends. The most astonishing feature of the
                        promoting, however that the shares are issued at a premium. What is the
                        justification for this in the case of a business still in embryo?</p>

                    <head>NEW BULGRAIAN AGENT.</head>
                    <p>REFUSAL OF EXEQUATUR.</p>
                    <p>We gather that the refusal of the Porte to grant an exequatur to the new
                        Bulgarian Agent at Cairo is due to two causes : the political dependence of
                        Bulgaria on the Otto-man Empire and the absense of any consular convention
                        between the vassal State and its suzerain. Bulgaria, be it remembered, is de
                        jure a principality tributary to the Sultan. and it is not surprising that
                        rights that would certainly be refused to Egypt have not been accorded to
                        the Balkan Principality. De facto Bulgaria is independent: too independent
                        perhaps from the Turkish point of view, but the legal situation of the
                        vigorous little principality is that of a vassal state, and the Porte, which
                        (at times) stands enormously on its dignity, is not likely to grant Bulgaria
                        over many diplomatic con- cessions. M. Veroazza, who holds the position of
                        Bulgarian Diplomatic Agent at Cairo, is moreover unlikely to obtain his
                        exequatur, failing the conclusion of a consular convention between the two
                        states, for the agreement betweenn M. Natchevich and the Porte did not we
                        believe, impose on the Suzerain any obligation of the sort. The most
                        probable solution of the difficulty is the recognition of M. Varnazza by a
                        note or official letter from the Grand Vzier as commercial agent of the
                        Principality of Bulgaria, though we fancy that the new addition to the
                        Diplomatic Body will act, if and when necessary, as a Consul General. </p>

                    <p>"ZAZA."</p>
                    <p>Opera may conceivably be divided into two categories : those to which the
                        plot is incidental to the music and those wherein the music is dependent
                        upon the plot; an adaptation of a play usually comes w thin the latter
                        province. Thus, in the case of "Zaza,” one gets a result so crowded with
                        incident that there is little scope for enlargement or for exercise of the
                        imagination. It is like a Burlington Arcade shop with nothing to back up the
                        display in the window. As a play "Zaza” had, of course, a big success in Mme
                        Rejane’s hands and created something of a furore in London after
                        miraculously having passed the censor. The action turns upon the love of
                        Zaza, a music- hall singer, for Dufresne, but, after succeeding in winning
                        his affection, she is horrified at the discovery that he is a married man.
                        Finding out his address she madly rushes there, but confronted with his
                        little daughter, the fury of her disappointment is turned to compuction at
                        being the cause of roin to his household. Sobbing and heartbroken, she
                        returns and, at their next meeting, Dufresne learns to his despair of her
                        secret visit and forthwith abandons her. Here the opera ends, while the
                        comedy has another act in which Dufresne, after a prolonged absence, tries
                        to regain his former place in “Zaza's" affections. The opera is scored in
                        Leoncavallo’s usual easy style, and, apart from one or two good romances,
                        notably that of Dufresne in Act III, contains nothing very striking or
                        original. However, it is always pleasant and "unan-strengend,” and had the
                        advantage of being very well produced last night. It depended cheifly for
                        its success on Signa. Livia Berlendi in the title ro'e, and we congratulate
                        her : upon a remarkably fine achievement. Her voice, acting, and appearance
                        were all that they should be. The rapid contrasts between joy gand grief
                        (Act II ) and between rage and remorse (Act III) were particularly well ex-
                        pressed. As Dutresne, Sig. Acerbi sang with considerable effect, but the
                        part calls for greater histrionic talent than is his. A word should be said
                        for the pretty manner in which little Miss Finzi spoke her lines. The house
                        was crowded, and enthusiastically applauded what was undoubtedly a very
                        pleasing per- formance. In the first entrancte a small fire occurred in the
                        adjoining exhibition of Sig.Rossi’s pictures, and we fear some of these
                        dainty works have been destroyed. Tbe onbreak was, how- ever, promptly
                        extinguished, and passed practi-cally unnoticed. </p>

                    <p>Lord Kitchener’s recent accident might have been most serious, but he must be
                        getting pretty well inured to accidents by thie time. There was a certain
                        explosion of a mine at Chatham, one remembers, which permanently injured his
                        right eye and condemned him to the use of pince-nez whenever he pores over
                        maps and charts. At the battle of Suakin, again, a hostile bullet broke his
                        jaw, and still embedded somewhere despite several pain- ful operations with
                        the purposee of extracting it. His lordship fraotored his leg shortly after
                        his arrival in India. </p>
                    <p>But perhaps Lord Kitchener’s most excting adventure happened in Palestine
                        while he was engaged with Major Condor in the survey of that country The
                        surverying party were swamped at Safed in Galilee when a horde of fanatical
                        Moslems attacked them. Kitchener had nothing bnt his cane to defend himself
                        with, and when the tussle was over he turned up covered with blood, having
                        had a narrow escape from a negro who bad attempted to cleave him with a huge
                        scimitar. Malarial fever followed, and for the first time in his life, they
                        say, ‘K. of K.” gave way to his emotion by yelling, one burning afternoon.
                        "For the Lord’s sake, give me some of that beer!" </p>
                    <p>Major William J. Marshall. V C., who is retiring from the post of Camp
                        Quartermaster at Aldershot, won the Victoria Cross by a notable act of
                        bravery during the Sudan campaign of 1884. The incident, occured in the
                        memorable calvary charge at El Teb, where Lient.-Col. Barrow, commanding the
                        19th Hus- sars, was severely wounded, and with his horse killed, was lying
                        on the ground surrounded by the dervishes. Major Marshall (then Quarter-
                        master Sergeant) remained with his chief throughout the action, and at an
                        opportune moment seized Colonel Barrow by the hand and dragged him safety
                        through the enemy back to his regiment. </p>
                    <p>Major Marshall had previously seen active service in the Egyptian War, being
                        present at the battle of Tel-el Kebir. He took part in the defence of
                        Ladysmith during the South African campaign. </p>

                        <p>CHEIF GAINS AND LOSSES</p>
                        <p>Berlin, January 28</p>
                        <p>The chief party gains and looses are: Conservatives, 7 seats gained, 2
                            lost ; Imperialists, 2 and 4; Liberale, 9 and 9 ; Radicals, 4 and 2 ;
                            Centra, 2 and 4; Poles, 2 seats gained; Guelphs. 3 seats lost ;
                            Socialists, 1 gained and 20 lost. In many constituences while one party
                            definitely lost a seat, it is uncertain which other party will win it in
                            second ballot, heince the inequality of the present totals of losses and
                            gains. Herr Dernbnrg, in the course of an interview, stated that the
                            attitude of the Centre towards the Colonies had lost its significance,
                            as a majority was now secured without it. While this is possibly true in
                            a general sense, the co-operation of the Radicals and Conservatives is
                            most unlikely. The former will probably remain an opposition party: to
                            most purposes the Centre will thus still hold the balance. (Reuter)</p>

                            Sudan ever since its reconquest has been under strict martial law, and,
                            according to Article X. of the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium, signed on
                            January 19,1899, no Consuls, Vice-Consuls, or Consular Agents were to be
                            accredited in respect of or allowed to reside in the Sudan without the
                            previous consent of the British Government. This consent has up to now
                            been most steadfastly refused, just as was the case with the permission
                            of the setting up of missions. But the Sudan has progressed so much, and
                            in such a peaceful way, that all such prohibitions can with safety be
                            relaxed now, and I understand that the appointment of an Italian Consul
                            at Khartoum will shortly be followed by the nomination of an Austrian,
                            and perhaps a Greek one. If 1 am not mistaken, the last Consul
                            accredited to the Sudan was the Austrian Consul. Hansal, who was in
                            Khartonm with Gordon, and whom Slatin Pasha mentions in "Fire and Sword
                            in the Sudan.” The introduction of foreign Consul into the Sudan will
                            fortunately not entail the exercise of the capitulations. The latter are
                            only in force in the countries which owe allegiance to the Sultar, and
                            the Sudan is certainly not one of there latter. It is entirely under an
                            Anglo-Egyptian administration, which in no wise is dependeut on Turkey.
                            In, theory it is dependent on the British Agent in Cairo and the
                            President of the Council of Ministes* of the Khedive ; but in practice,
                            of course, he former controls through the Governor-General. One can
                            positively assent that one of the potent factors in the speedy
                            pacification of the Sudan, and, at all eveuts, the oue which has enabled
                            the Governor-General, Sir Reginald Wingate, to achieve his work so well,
                            has been the absence of interference of the capitualations in the
                            maintenance of order, and there is no doubt that Lord Cromer showed
                            considerable foresight and an appreciation of the difficulties when l.e
                            laid down in the agreement ot January 19, 1899, that not even the
                            jurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunals should be extended or recoguised in
                            the Sadan. </p>

                    <head>HELOPOLIS OASIS</head>
                    <p>We have just paid a visit to the oases in the desert of Abbassieh, and, truth
                        to tell, we marvelled at all there was to see. When one considers that
                        scarcely eight months ago this part of the desert, situated to the east of
                        Konbbeb and north of the old Suez road, was an arid waste, and that it is
                        now marked out with long, broad avenues, with here and there a gigantic
                        hotel, a restaurant and bar, villas, water mains, in a word, a garden city,
                        all this in course of construction and almost finished, one wonders whether
                        some magician or other has not touched the land with his magic wand to make
                        it produce the great modern city which is now taking shape. Magic, however,
                        plays no part in this metamorphosis : it is the work of a devouring human
                        activity placed at the service of a concious will. A visit to the spot will
                        reveal the legion of engineers, surveyors, contractors, draughtsmen,
                        foreman, and workmen carrying out under the vigilant eye of an able
                        management those many works accomplished daily by over 2,500 work- men for
                        account of the Cairo Electric Railways and Heliopolis Oasis Company. Formed
                        on the 23rd January, 1906. it took over from Bogho Pasha Nubar and Baron
                        Empain the concessions for the electric railways and tramways which are to
                        connect the oases with Cairo, and the ownership of an estate covering
                        twenty-five squaree kilometres, ie, 5,952 fad- dans, north-east of the
                        Po'ygon of Abbassieh and bought from the Government for £1 per feddan. The
                        railway and tramway concessions extend over a period of seventy years, after
                        which they revert to the Government with all appurtenances. The land itself,
                        of course, remains the property of the company, and the agreement of the
                        23rd May 1905, reserves to it the right, within a period of seven years, to
                        purchase on the same terms as mentioned above i.e., £1 per feddan, a stretch
                        of desert twice the size of the one which the company already possesses,
                        viz., 11,904 feddans, for the purpose of creating other oases. It is to be
                        noted that the Company has abundant means at its disposal. Its capital
                        amounts to 15,000,000 francs, which may be increased to 30,000,000 by
                        decision of the board of directors. The capital is divided into 60,000
                        Ordinary shares of 250 francs each and 60,000. Deferred shares of nominal
                        value. Only 10,000 Ordinary shares were offered to the public. The, board of
                        the company is composed of Baron E louard E npa’n (chairman), Boghos Pasha
                        Nubar and Lord Armstrong (vice-chairmen), Me-srs. Berthelot, Carton de
                        Wiart, François Empain, Col. Sir Augustus FitzGeorge, Todd Symons, Sir John
                        Rogers Pasha, aud Jacobs, (directors) while the managing director is Sir
                        Reginald Oakes. It may be said that the ides of creating close to Cairo
                        large airy subrybs where side by side with dwellings which fufuils every
                        demand of modern comfort people will find all that contributes to facilitate
                        the conditions of living and render life more attractive, is due to the
                        actual conditions of living in the capital. The rentals within recent years,
                        have attained absurd proportions, and the dearth of suitable houses is felt
                        more than ever. The ‘vox populi” demanded susomething more and better. The
                        Cairo Electric Railways and Helio-polis Oaises Company cans just in time to
                        realise the great work needed, and the creation of the oases of the desert
                        of Abbassieh war thereupon decided. The site chosen, in the im mediate
                        vicinity of Cairo, makes it very attractive. It is situated 50 metres above
                        sea level and practically dominates Cairo and the Pyramids. Its altitude,
                        which is higher than Koubbeh or Matarieh (as the desert stretches from the
                        cultivated lands on which the eastern suburbs of Cairo are placed and mounts
                        gradually towards the hills which form the spurs of the Mokattam), makes it
                        one of the healthiest spots about Cairo. Doubtless Cairo residents during
                        the summer season will fleek there, and many of the British officers
                        quartered at Abbassieh will take up the villas which are to be built. Only
                        one difficulty stood in the way of making the oases popular, and that was
                        the great distance from the centre of Cairo, but this difficulty no longer
                        exists since the company has obtained the 70 years' concession for the
                        electric railway and tramway connecting the Oases with Cairo. trains on the
                        railway will cover the distance between the Oases and Pont Limoun in 40
                        minute-; here the carriages will run partly on the Cario Tramway Company and
                        He i -pol e Oi-es Company and partly on those of the Cairo Tramway Company,
                        thus transporting passengers without any change to the centre of the
                        capital. Thus great work is being pushed on with admirable activity by the
                        Heliopoilis Company, and we hope to give further particulars as to the
                        progress of the undertaking in a few days.</p>

                        pretentions, rather vague, yet with moments of real beauty. Mme. Baron, now
                        and again, M. Mézy, and M. M were good enough—but only now and again. Mile.
                        Davilloy was faautless and delightful, M. Mézy was never quite on his note ;
                        and for that matter M. Maas himself was far less certain and accurate than
                        usual. M. Fontaine attempted the tenor part. He sang with taste, and acted
                        well. He generally does that ; but his voice was inadequate : the high notes
                        were an effort, and—listened to dispassionately— they sounded trying,
                        forced, vociferous rather than musical ; the lowar notes and softer passages
                        were strangled to the last degree. He did not seem to have real tenor’s
                        command over anything but "forte” or "fortissimo.” But once and for all it
                        is the same story for the whole of this company. They are "thereabouts,” but
                        never "there.” They give some good acting, some fine tones and notes, but
                        Dover a real workmanlike finish : they never have the mastery of the piece
                        except for three, Escalais, Darand, and Charpentier. Mila. Charpentier may
                        not always be in good voice, but she always sings as a professional should.
                        M. Da rand may be past his best, but he is always accurate, exact, and
                        thorough. M. Escalais may displease many who think he only shoots (he often
                        does!) but he sings in the manner and with the ease of a grand opera singer
                        : to the worst criticism one might give— long power, one must add, lung
                        power well directed. The rest, as well as the orchestra and chorus, seem as
                        if they had never been properly directed or in any opera housee stringently
                        controlled. One should be able to compare Cairo opera with that of the great
                        cities ; instead of which we compare it, per- force, to opera of the
                        provinces, and of travelling companies. No wonder! But then the prices
                        should be lowered and a more honest and less impressive prospectus issued.

                    <p>"OTELLO"</p>
                    <p>"The Italian company ran a great risk in taking "Otollo” as their opening
                        piece. Apart from its associations with the greatest singers and theatres,
                        it is a formidable opera in itself. ' hey would have done better to try
                        "Tosca” first. It is early to pronounce on the performers, but one can at
                        least say that Sig. Arrighetti (whose singing most of us disliked in the
                        summer) was a complete surprise. He took I ago at the last moment, and
                        though it hardly suits the range of his voice, he sang (and acted) quite
                        well, and with a fine full tone. His aria in the 2nd act was indeed
                        excellent. Signor Valls was by no means pleasing as Otello, either for his
                        acting or for his singing. His voice is true to the note, but most
                        unattractive. Signa Fabri was nervous at first, thin, and not always true to
                        the note, but she improved and sang quite well in the last act. The rest
                        were good enough after their kind. And what a relief to hear a good chourus
                        and an excellent orchestra led by a really enthusiastic orchestraand a good
                        room, but does that excuse its hopless discords and apathy in the theatre?
                        Oh orchestras have played well enough here. One word One word I would
                        venture-- from certain criticism I heard last night. It is hardly fair to
                        judge the Abbas as if it were La Scala. I does not pretend to be. The
                        Khedivial Theatre has glorious promises, high prices, and— we know its
                        performances. Thoese who direct it must not be surprised if a disillusioned
                        listener says what he thinks, and does make comparisons. Another word as to
                        the chorus and their protects. Everyone recognises that it is far less their
                        fault than that of the powers that be if they are a failure. Still, some of
                        their fiascos were inexecusable on any grounds. To return to the Abbas : the
                        house was crowded and most critical, rather unfavorable at moments ; but, as
                        I said, the company took a great risk for their first night, and the
                        performance was not perfect. I am sure they will do many of the operas
                        really well, and equally sure hat they will be fairly judged, and fully
                        praised for all the is good. I have never yet heard a Cairo audience allow a

                        They did se last night : such a critical spirit deserves its reward in real
                        effort on the part of the performers ; and I believe that in the operas that
                        suit them, perhaps in all the repertoire (once they are acclimated), they
                        will make the effort with success. At least, 1 am sure we all wish them that
                        success : it is quite likely they will achieve it in "Tosca.”</p>
                    <p>‘LA TOSCA.”</p>
                    <p>"La Tosca” was a real pleasure. Italy seems so prolific in sopranos, tenors,
                        and conductors, and they all seem to have “Tosca" in the blood. I have not
                        yet seen a perform in whichsome part or some singer was not really good. On
                        Friday night it was—almost all- very good. Perhaps the only fault was that
                        once or twcoe Sig. Campanini seemed to smother his violines : the " 'cellos
                        ” were so prominent in one place—at ‘Senti l’ora é vicina’- (3rd act), as to
                        ronghen and almost break up the movement of tha music, and the music of
                        "Tosca” suffers from that. Heard for the first time it repels, then from its
                        curious strength, its approach to savagery, its rapid passion and eagerness
                        for love or death, it attracts and finally conquers. The whole scheme is so
                        primitive, as primitive and earnest as a Huguenot chorale : people who can
                        love, who can kill, who can believe are amongst this world’s eter- nities ;
                        and the music which expresses them, should, once it can conqner our modern
                        practical apathy, be also eternal, sounding a dim echo within our own
                        emotions. To return to ‘La Tosca,” Signora Orbellini and Signor Tachierdo
                        were both delightfal. Her entry and all her singing and actiug in the first
                        act were all one could hope for, replete with the most minate touches of
                        tenderness, malice, reproach, scorn—but the polite scorn of a diva for an
                        old "viveur.” Her seoand act was rather to0 violent. I heard Pandolfini and
                        Ballinoioui in it. Pandolfini was, and will be believe, always for those who
                        heard her, "La Tosca” incarnate, as ' La Tosca” must have been. Bellinoioni
                        seemed to be one of the cleverest women who ever studied the part—but
                        transformed it. In the 3rd act; Signs. Orbelliai was again perfect in
                        everything, and her partner was nearly so. His great song ‘E lnoevan le
                        stelle” was admirable. The opening, "O dolci mani,” was a delight ; but he
                        borders on convention, and he has not always finish ; thire are moments of
                        uncertainty and too muoh individuality. But his voice is charming, and has
                        that openness and distance of clear tone one longs for in a lyric tenor.
                        Sig. Arri- ghetti was quite a good Scarpia, but his voioe seems unsuitable,
                        as it did sometimes in "Otello.” He does not command all his notes. The
                        chorus and orchestra were excellent and true, but Campanini was often too
                        hard on his singers. The house was packed, as on Thursday, and, I
                        understand, Satarday night. If that continues, they will be al'e to afford
                        one or two more really good singers, and to "sarry off’ these operas which
                        at present would seem rather above their powers. At least we can remember
                        that Signor Battani is one of the company. </p>

                        <p>To the Editor of the ‘Egyptian Gazette.”</p>
                        <p>Sir,—We tourists have a good deal to be thankful for, in view of the
                            excessive cold all over Europe, in finding ourselves in Egypt, although
                            even here it is by no means warm. However, this is not what I wish to
                            write about. Some days ago when at Assiout it was so bitterly cold that
                            no amount of pestering on the part of the donkey boys or drivers muster-
                            ed on Cook’s landing stags, woauld overcome our persuasion to go for a
                            sharp walk, thinking it the only means of warming our hitherto frozen
                            bodies. On inquiry, the dragoman informed us that there was a lovely
                            promenade on thr front, with gardens, etc, and we had no difficulty in
                            following his instructions. The part was indeed unexpectedly pretty with
                            the Coptic palaces as a background, but alas ! for the loveliness of ths
                            promenade. I had not gone far when I fell on my side, spraining my
                            ankle. The roughness and stones strewn abont made it painful to proceed,
                            we hailed a vehicle and returned to our steamer, where I had to lay up.
                            We have been wondering how the inhabitants of the place can placidly put
                            up with such an apology for a road on the river front, when by a very
                            small outlay it might indeed be made into a most desirable promenade.
                            Naturally we enquired who was responsible for the roade ; the dragoman
                            told us it was the Governor, mudir 1 think was the word he used ;
                            another said it was the Municipality, but he as promptly sat upon, and
                            told that there was no such body in Assiout; then a third very knowingly
                            came forward, and said that it might be the Governor, but that he had no
                            power left him to do anything, withont first consulting the Ministry of
                            the Interior, or some such authority, generally represented in the
                            provinces by young and inexperienced University men, and that under the
                            circumstances the Governors preferred to temain inactive, drawing mean-
                            while their pay, as any, seal on their part to ameliorate their
                            districts would be promptly pat down by the young Inspectors. As we are
                            rather sceptical about these views, we would he grateful for any
                            enlightenment on the subject Meanwhile, might 1 beg those responsible
                            for my sprained ankle (which, by the bye, prevent-ed my visiting the
                            temples between Assiout and here) to ameliorate the cause of it, in liea
                            of damages, which I could have claimed in a civilized country.
                            Apologizing for taking up so muoh of your valuable space for a personal
                            grievance, which might benefit others if my prayers to the proper

                        <p>Sir,-- It seems incredible that the Museum should be closed for five
                            consecutive says at this time of the year when the visitors' season is
                            at its height.Two of my friends on their way to South Africa came
                            purposely to cairo to see the Pyramids and the Museum, but had to leave
                            without seeing the latter. three other friends were here during
                            Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and left on Sunday without being
                            about to see the Museum. I feel sure these are not the only cases of
                            dissappointment. I enclose my card, and remain, yours, etc,</p>

                        <p>Sir,—Mr. Secretary A. S. Preston, in his letter published in your issus
                            of 26th inst, does not gainsay the facts stated in mine of previous
                            date. He merely suggests that 1 should call at his office to have my
                            facts set right, assuming of course they are not in order, whcoh might
                            perhaps be the case in some unimportant particalar not affecting the
                            principle involved. Without in the least wishing to enter into any
                            controversy on this subject, I only want to know, not for my own
                            information merely, but for that of the British public whose respect for
                            the memory of our late Queen called the memorial into existence, why it
                            is that imported material used in its con-struction is of non-British

                        <p>Sir,—While I was passing to-day at 2 p.m. through some lane in Paolino
                            something, which made me sick at heart, stopped me. This was a tiny cat
                            mewing and mewing over the top of a tree. I had to ask a servant—sitting
                            at the door of a house near by—to get it down. The poor little thing was
                            feeling cold, hungry, and miserable, T was told that the animal was
                            being tormented in the morning by some wicked little boys. 1 would only
                            draw the attention of the Alex. Sooiety for the Preven- tion of Cruelty

                            fast good length ball, which he failed to time. Macaulay and Marsden
                            then took the score to 29, when the former was bowled by Graves. Of the
                            rest of the innings the less said the better ; except Marsden, who
                            showed excellent defence throughout, no one could stay against Wyatt,
                            and when Marsden was bowled by a beauty at 58 all chance of even a
                            passable score was gone. At the same total McLean fell to a good long
                            field catch by Capt. Liddell, and the innings was over. Wyatt, till now
                            unlucky against Alexandria, had a great day. We have only once or twice
                            seen him bowl better (considering his want of practice) and some of the
                            balls he sent dowu took a lot of playing. Marsden played a very fne
                            innings, only succumbing to a really good ball, and overyone was sorry
                            that be did not carry his bat. At lunch time Cairo had made 58 for three
                            wickets ; Alexandria were a little shakey in the slips to start with,
                            Bathurst being let off early in his useful innings of 28 After lunch
                            Capt. Liddell quickly put Cairo in a very comfort- able position. His
                            innings of 66 was in every way a fine effort. He bit very hard on the
                            offside and numbered nine boundary hits and seven threes among his
                            strokes. The remainder of the Cairo team were obviously inclined to live
                            up to the adage, "A short life but a merry one,” and gave the Alexandria
                            outfields much to do. MacLaren and Carver made good catches and Barnard,
                            besides effecting a characteristic catch in the slips, showed great
                            courage in attempting the ‘ tour de force" of catching a big on-drive in
                            the middle of his chest. Doubtless owing to an accident the ball rolled
                            off, leaving a bruise to mark its impact and a grateful recollection of
                            the event in the minds of the spectators. Sanderson made a useful debut,
                            scoring 28 and keeping wicket well for Cairo. Dawson was not at his lest
                            behind the sticks. In a poor light Alexandria fared badly in their
                            second attempt, and when stumps were drawn seven of their wickets were
                            down On the day's play Cairo were undoubtedly the better side, but a
                            first innings of only 58 is ex- ceptional in Egyptian oricket. Score: -- </p>

                    <p>Cairo has been a good deal enlivened the last few days by the arrival of our
                        visitors from Alexandria. The football, cricket, and golf matches have been
                        all keenly contested We hope that next year tennis requests and polo will be
                        added to the list of competitors. The Alexandria sportsmen seem to be able
                        to bold their own at most games. They are all good sportsmen. We welcomed
                        their arrival, and deplore their departure. The football match proved most
                        exciting, and after a keen struggle the game ended in a draw. In the cricket
                        Cairo triumphed. Alexandria bad their revenge at golf. Below is the score :
                        —</p>
                    <p>Lord Edward Ceoil v. Mr. Monroe Kerr, Cairo won 5 up and 4 to play.</p>
                    <p>Mr. A. P. Friend v. Mr. D. Morice, Cairo won 5 up and 4 to play.</p>
                    <p>Mr. C. E. Crawley v. Mr. J. B. Clarke, all square.</p>
                    <p>Capt. Lane v. Mr. C. Ferguson, Alex, won 8 up and 2 to play.</p>
                    <p>Mr. R. R Monteith Smith v. M. C. Robert- son, all square.</p>

                    <p>CAIRO 5-A SIDE COMPETITION.</p>
                    <p>This competition took place on Wednesday and Thursday last. The first and
                        second rounds were played on Wednesday. Eighteen teams entered, so to
                        prevent byes coming in each round the first consisted of only two games. A
                        sensational start was made, last year’s winners, the Egyptian State Railway
                        Inatitute “A” team, being easily beaten by 1st team "G" Coy. 2nd Innukilling
                        Fusiliers by 3 goals to nil. The Institute "C” team made a good fight
                        against H. Coy. of the Inniskillings but were defeated by a goal and a minor
                        to nil.</p>

                    <p>Some interesting games were witnessed in the second ronnd, a strong wind not
                        interferring much with the play. Quite the best match was the last game of
                        the day, between the Royal Engineers’ "A" team and "G” Coy. Innitkillings.
                        Two replays were trade before a definite issue could be arrived at.</p>

                        lucky goal just before time. The Army Service Corps and the band of the
                        "Skins" 2nd team won their respective games in clever style. The 1st team of
                        the band and the Military Police played very keenly, the former winning a

                    <p>The semi finals ware keenly contested and very exciting.</p>
                    <p>The two band teams played an extremely fast game, the 1st team winning by a
                        goal. The mach between "H” Coy. of the Inniskillings and the Army Service
                        Corps was the best of the whole competition. "H” Coy. played a very good
                        game and only the brilliant play of the corps goalkeeper, B. Jordan.kept
                        them out. Gartland, the corps half back, worked like a Trojan. Three replays
                        were necessary before a splendid combined movement by the corps towards
                        ended in Baxter scoring with a beautiful shot. "H" Coy. worked hard to
                        equalize, but Jordan and Gartland were impassible.</p>

                    <p>After a short rest the finalists turned out. It promised to be an easy
                        victory for the band, as the corps were still a bit tired after their
                        exertions in the semi-final. But to the delight of their supporters the
                        crops made a determined attack at the very start and Baxter scored with a
                        magnificent shot. The band made strenuous efforts to draw level but Jordan
                        and Gartland kept their goal intact in magnifioent style. Time after time
                        their fine efforts were applauded. The Army Servioe Corps well deserved
                        their success. Messrs. J. S. Peacock and C. P. Richardeon refereed very
                        efficiently, and pleased everybody with their decisions.</p>

                        <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers
                            the accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by
                            which they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange
                            them as accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that
                            none of them are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home
                            there are several things to be considered. To begin with there is the
                            difference in climate between Egypt and the various points at which you
                            may arrive in Europe.</p>
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                            January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so
                            warm as Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more
                            uniformly warm than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt
                            far too early in the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is
                            perfect. The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                        <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent
                            at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on
                            each of the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of
                            Europe.</p>

                            Southhampton, London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones
                            are as follows:—</p>

                        <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                            Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines
                            are also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by
                            travellers to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to
                            Alexandria, without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made
                            without change in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                        <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                            Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German
                            Levant line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                        <cb n="5"/>
                        <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by
                            P.&amp;O. Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd
                            Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
                        <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little
                            luggage is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several
                            good and responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed
                            charge to deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                        <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by
                            the fast Mail Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to Brindisi. One of these
                            leaves port Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the
                            Indian <cb n="6"/>mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                        <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                            attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats"
                            having been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to
                            Brindisi. If you are going straight through to England you will find the
                            train waiting at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without
                            changing. It has complete arrangements for sleeping and eating on board,
                            and you should arrive in London on the fifth day from leaving Port
                            Said.</p>

                        <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers
                            which leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to
                            TAORMENA, one of the most charming and popular places on the island.
                            Giardini is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina
                            is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the town is
                            much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                            restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent
                            of Etna and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and
                            Saracenic remains that are found all over the island, are an endless
                            sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a
                            Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by
                            the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be
                            seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                            about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                            delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city.
                            The Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of
                            S. Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The
                            Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also
                            worth a visit.</p>

                    <div type="article">
                        <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                        <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every
                            Wednesday during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3
                            days.</p>
                        <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino
                            Co.’s steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave
                            it without wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely
                            places on its bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that
                            takes you to Sorrento [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                        <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can
                            will devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and
                            interesting portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are
                            too well-known to need comment here.</p>
                        <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five
                            hours brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent
                            admiring the City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence
                            itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the
                            local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is
                            the most attractive and fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the
                            Viale dei Colli, one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago,
                            goes winding up through the hills a distance of four miles. The most
                            delightful excursion outside Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its
                            Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is made first by ordinary
                            train from Florence to St. Ellero, thence by cog-wheel railway to
                            Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                            striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                        <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a
                            fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night
                            should if possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile
                            at sunset.</p>
                        <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near
                            Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient
                            half-way house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable
                            and the air and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy,
                            with the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European
                            cities and a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and
                            deliciously cool breezes from the surrounding mountains and the
                            Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                        <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                            gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings,
                            are a constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn
                            in Genoa. Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches
                            containing exquisite marble columns and historical paintings, and the
                            incomparable Campo Santo filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                        <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                        <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                            Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful
                            windows illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and
                            the monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                        <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                            SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal
                            springs, change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are
                            at Salsomaggiore.</p>

                        <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                            delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                            vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage
                            or bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every
                            turn. The approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any
                            other sea port. The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of
                            the sea, no hills behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of
                            Campaniles appear above the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering
                            town rises like a fairy mirage out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                        <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                            lakes.</p>
                        <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in
                            one-and-a-quarter hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                        <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is
                            very beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                            enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo,
                            Cadenabbia, and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio
                            opposite. The walk from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio
                            is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake
                            Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in
                            two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                            is an excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated
                            above the town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings,
                            “Entombment," by Ciseri, and ‘Tho Flight into Egypt,” by Bramantion.</p>

                            reached from Alexandria ; the climate in April is charming. The best
                            steamers are those of the Khedivial Mail Co. and the Russian Steam
                            Navigation Co.</p>
                        <p>If possible tourists should arrange to be in Athens for the Orthodox
                            Easter in order to witness the Good Friday and Easter Eve ceremonies,
                            and to be present at the dancing on the Easter Tuesday festival held at
                            Megara for which a special train is run from Athens.</p>
                        <p>It is worth while to spend a few days in CORFU on account of the beauty
                            of the scenery. There is also good snipe and quail shooting to be
                            had.</p>

                    <p>FLEET STREET, LONDON. E.C</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen,</p>
                    <p>Ten years ago we established in London the CAXTON TYPE FOUNDRY to manufacture
                        Printing Types on the interchangable time and lobr-saving principles of
                        Standard Point Line and Point Set on Point Body. We claimed, and have
                        established the statement, that the exclusive use of Caxton Printing Types
                        would save one-fourth of the compositiors time in the setting of all kinds
                        of hand composition. At the present time onver 10,000 Printers in the United
                        Kindom, Australasia, Canda, Africa, the Indian Empire and other British
                        possessions are customers of the Caxton Type Foundry.</p>
                    <p>As is well known the type industry of America is controlled by a type TRUST,
                        and in the Uniter Kingdon by a similar organization known as the type RING
                        of British Type Manufacturers.</p>
                    <p>The CAXTON TYPE FOUNDRY was founded to oppose all such conmbinations. It is
                        indpendent of all such connections, and is therefore, selling type at a
                        lower price, and futhermore, guarantees to sell at the same price in all
                        parts of the British Empire.</p>
                    <p>Another branch is the CAXTON WOOD MILLS, the largest and most complete Wood
                        Working Plant in the British Empire exclusively employed in the production
                        of space and labor=svaing woodwork for Printers. We have made a speciality
                        of uding hard wood exclusively in all our productions. Wood Furniture and
                        Reglet is made out of Tungstone, a specially close-grained Wood which is so
                        heavy that is sinks in water and is therefore particularly valuable.</p>
                    <p>We are also makers of the widest and most complete range of PLATEN PRESSES in
                        the World, comprising the well-known "Caxton" Platen, for fine work: the
                        light-running "Swift" Platen for small printers: the Haddon "Improved
                        Gordon," suitable for any jobbing printer: the Hadden "Saftey Platen"
                        capable of printing 2,500 full formes per hour: the Haddon "Importved
                        Victoria," modelled on the Cropper principle, but superior in construction
                        and output.</p>
