<head>THE KHEDIVE.</head>
<p>Ahmed Pasha Zeky, De Martino Pasha, and the principal members of the Khedivial House hold will leave for Alexandria with H.H. the Khedive on Thursday next. The remaining members of the household will leave next Tuesday.</p>
<p>The officers, N.C.O's. and men of the 7th Battalion left Cairo for Alexandria this morning by special train.</p>
<p>H.H. the Khedive attended prayer yesterday in the El Mardani Mosque. This mosque was built in 1338 A.D. by the son of the great Mameluke ruler Kelaun, but was allowed to go to ruin, and at the end of the nineteenth centnry appeared to have reached a stage of dilapidation beyond the hope of repair. In 1897 the Committee for the Preservation of Monuments of Arab Art were at last able to begin the reconstruction of the mosque, which had been with difficulty saved from collapsing by a variety of makeshift expedients. Thanks to the able direction of Herz Bey and the energy of the committee, the mosque has finally been restored in 1905.</p>
<p>The Khedive was accompanied by the Ministers, the Grand Cadi, the Governor of Cairo, the Ulema, and the Director General of the Wakfs Administration. The mosque had been brilliantly decorated in his honor, and the inhabitants of the Darb-el Ahmar quarter showed a lively interest in the Khedivial visit to the restored mosque.</p>
<p>His Highness has congratulated the Committee for the Preservation of Arab Monuments and Herz Bey on their success.</p></div>

<head>ALEXANDRIA WATERSUPPLY.
GREAT IMPROVEMENTS.</head>
<p>The inhabitants of Alexandria have been rejoycing for the last two days at the great improvement in the quality of the water in town, due to the starting of the new filtration plant at the waterworks. This new supply, although not promised by the Water Company to the Municipality in their convention in 1903 until the end of July, is now in actual daily use, and we think some considerable credit is due to the Water Company for having got through their most difficult task in three and a half months before the specified time; it is only owing to the utmost energy on their part that this has been achieved.</p>
<p>We understand that at present no date has yet been fixed for the official inauguration of the new works, but it is to be hoped that it will take place in the early summer. It seems a pity that the Municipality is not quite so well up to time with their part of the work, viz., the drain to carry off the dirty water from the filter-washing apparatus; but at present a temporary connection has been made so as to discharge this water into the moat of the fortifications at Rosetta Gate, which has been done as a temporary measure only. It behoves the Municipality therefore to pash forward as quickly as possible with the completion of the permanent drain, the contract for which has only been awarded this week for the part between the Water Company’s premises and Rosetta Gate, where it will join the new branch of the east collector now in course of construction.</p></div>

<head>EGYPT'S IMPORTS.</head>
<p>The "Manchester Guardian," commenting on the fact that German imports to Egypt show a tenfold increase in twenty years,says,— We cannot reasonably expect that the German exports will stand still, but the more eager of our commercial friends are anxious that we should increase in the same proportion as Germany. As twenty years ago our share was 57.7 per cent, it appears that we ought now to be exporting to Egypt 577 per cent. of her imports, which, as Euclid used to say, is absurd. The fact is that our imports are increasing substantially and on a far larger scale than those of Germany or any other country. To expect us to maintain our present proportion of exports in the expanding markets of the world is hardly reasonable.</p></div>

IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS.</head>
<p>We understand that this Company contemplate shortly introducing into their services, several new, luxurious, and thoroughly up-to-date vessels of the most modern design and high speed (possibly turbines), with a view to greatly accelerating and improving each of their existing mail connections, and providing for the increased comfort and convenience of their passengers.</p>
<p>The vessels would be fitted with all the latest improvements for the rapid handling of cargo, and special provision would also be made for the transport of perishable goods such as fruit, vegetables, and other produce.</p>
<p>Further, the Red Sea mail service will be greatly improved, and an accelerated direct connection with Suakin will be inaugurated next month, with regular weekly departures from Suez instead of fortnightly, as at present. An official announcement concerning this service may be expected very shortly.
The Company has also decided to take up lighterage business in the port of Alexandria, and intends at once adding to its existing plant one or two tug boats and many additional lighters.</p></div>

<head>CAIRO EVANGELICAL FREE CHURCH.</head>
<p>Thursday, 27th April. 1905, is a day which marks a very decided step in the history of Nonconformity in Egypt for on that date its first pastor, the Rev. T.A. Cooper, was inducted to the charge of the first Free Church in the land.</p>
<p>At 4.30 p.m. the beautiful German Church in Sharia El-Maghraby was thronged with members of the congregation and friends. In addition to the ministers and others from England we noticed the Rev. Dr. Watson, Rev. Dr. Harvey, and Rev. Dr. Giffen, of the American Mission; Rev. R. Maclnnes, M.A., and Rev. A. J. Toop, of the C.M.S. ; Rev. Dr. Kahle, German pastor; Rev. Dr. Morel, French paator, Rev. M. H. Kanadjian, Armenian Evangelical Church; Mr. George Swan and Mr. W. Wilson Cash, of the Egypt General Mission; Mr. A.T. Upson, of the Nile Mission Press, and many other well-known members of the British colony in Cairo, who had been drawn together by the unusual service.</p>
<p>The Rev. J. C. Easterbrook, of Caledonia. Road Congregational Church, London, presided, and was assisted by the Rev. Charles Leach, D.D., of Harecourt Congregational Church, London, and the Rev. G. N. Williams, Baptist minister of Choltoncum Hardy, Manchester.</p>
<p>During the evening a large gathering assembled in the Hotel Villa Victoria, where a conversazione was held, the large dining room being taxed to accommodate the number who were present. Tea and general conversation were indulged in between 8 and 9 o’clock, after which some delightful music was rendered by members of the choir and other friends, the accompaniments being ably played by the church organist, Mr. J. E. Williams. Speeches were delivered by the ministers and others present, and a most interesting day was brought to a close by the benediction pronounced by the Rev. Dr. Leach.</p>
<p>Heartiest congratulations were showered upon the Rev. T. A. Cooper, pastor, and the office-bearers on the success of the day’s proceedings.</p>
<p>The Cairo Evangelical Free Church was started in September, 1904, and was the outcome of the successful mission carried on in the Shoubra and Boulac districts for over two years previously by the Rev. T. A. Cooper, who, in December last, was called to the permanent pastorate of the new church.
The congregation is under a deep debt of gratitude to the German community, who have, in the most fraternal spirit, granted facilities for worshipping in their buildings. The success which has attended the church daring the past eight months amply justifies its establishment. The congregations have been good, and the membership has steadily increased. Two Sunday schools are in active working, and the first session of the Young Men’s Literary Society was brought to a close last week ; while the weekly evening prayer meeting is well attended.</p>
<p>We understand that it is intended to continue the Sunday services, morning and evening, and the weekly prayer meeting throughout the summer.</p></div>

<head>THE CAPITULATIONS.</head>
<p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
<p>Sir,—Excellent and worthy people like your correspondent, Mr. Thos. Atwood, and the unconscious humourist, Mr. John Smithers, are the most effectual bar to the removal of the Capitulations that I know of. There are very serious reasons for white men—and those not necessarily English, or of the "baser sort"—why the question of the Capitulations should be handled very delicately, and not in the spirit of Exeter Hall and the Y. M. C. A. For my part, I candidly confess to a very real terror of being handed over to the Native Courts with or without a Habeas Corpus ; and I should distrust the arrangement even more if I were not an Englishman, unless I had the best of guarantees. In one breath Mr. Atwood questions our right to be here at all and in another lays down the law as to what we should do! It is a sweet thing to have a good conceit of oneself, but when will the all-important Sassenach realize that he is not the only pebble on the beach?- I am, etc.,</p>

<head>“THE HOLY CITY."
HEATED CONTROVERSY.</head>
<p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
<p>Sir,—Contrary to “Harmony” and “Accord,” the absence of a criticism on the performance of Gaul’s work at the St. Mark's Church jubilee commemoration, in your issue of 26th inst., struck me as being in very-good taste. I assumed that the singing of this cantata (a work of great charm) was to be regarded as part of divine service—active worship by the singers and players, and passive by the congregation, of Almighty God—and consequently without the scope of detailed analysis and criticism, as a performance. That this view must now be abandoned, as a piece of unreasonable optimism, is plain from the tone of "Accord’s" letter, which is very painful reading, and from the article in your issue of to-day. You, Mr. Editor, are severely taken to task for “want of taste and courtesy towards those who gave up their time, talent and gifts for weeks (what prodigality of giving !) towards making the show of the afternoon a success"! The italics are mine.</p>
<p>May we ask “Accord" if this sacrifice was made for the reward of notice in your columns of “the show of the afternoon," or was it done to the glory of God and the good of His House? We amateur singers and players have very sensitive feelings and our little (?) failings ; but I have never met with so ruthless an exposure of our weakness at the hands of severe critics as "Accord," the champion of the augmented choir of St. Mark's Church, has made in the words above quoted. It is appalling to reflect that what one feels impelled to regard as an act of divine worship, the culminating point of work in which time and divinely bestowed talents have been employed for weeks, is described as “the show of the afternoon." One most hope that “Aooord" is an “irresponsible" and that the revolting terms he uses do not express the real minds of the ladies and gentlemen who, let it be earnestly hoped, found their chief reward in the labour of love itself and in praising God in His temple. Otherwise one feels doubtful about the refining influence attributed to Music —nay, even that of the Master's spirit, as preached by his ministers.</p>
<p>Even had the Cantata been given by a choir of matchless supremacy, to this portion of the service could not be assigned the chief place in the events of the day. Serious reflection ought soon to decide this.</p>
<p>If the assumption regarding the act of worship is wrong and we are to understand it was purely “a show,” then, Mr. Editor, possibly you may have merited “Accord's" charge! Had you finally ventured on a complete criticism of the performance, may be the charge of "great want of taste and courtesy” would have gained in intensity! One can easily criticise the efforts of a small amateur choir in a work like “The Holy City." Much better to regard it solely as an act of worship and to say in one's heart “Venite exultemus Domino." I enclose my card, and am, yours truly,</p>
<p>Ex-Choirmaster</p> <p>Bulkeley, Ramleh, April 28.</p></div>

<head>To the Editor of the “Egyptian Gazette.”</head>
<p>Sir,—Might I be allowed to suggest to those members of the British colony here who belong to the congregation of St. Mark’s that it would be more in accordance with decorum, if they were to cease from rushing into print to air their personal jealousies. If "Accord" is a member of the congregation, as presumably he is, I consider that the tone of his letter was in egregiously bad taste. It is not a secret who was the writer of the first report, and to carp because all those good people, who took part in the "Holy City," were not advertised by name in the newspaper and praised up to the skies, is a sad reflection on Christian humility. Why certain members of the congregation cannot refrain from writing to newspapers I do not know, but St Mark's appears to enjoy an invidious monopoly for “incidents” such as no other Anglican congregation in Egypt can boast of. Let us hope that the "incidents" such as occurred in reference to the “Canon Davis Memorial” and the "Holy City” will not occur again, or at least that members of the congregation will refrain from airing them in the public Press, for such un-Christian pettiness and spite, as “Accord” displays, are unworthy of a Christian and an Anglican."—I am, etc.,</p>

<div type="item">
<head>To the Editor or the "Egyptian Gazette.”</head>
<p>Dear Sir,—I confess to being much shocked at the tone of the letters regarding the performances of the "Holy City” at St. Mark’s Church. It is spoken of as an ordinary secular concert, and as if the only idea in the minds of the choir was that they were singing for the glory of men, and not that they were celebrating the jubilee anniversary of the consecration of their church to the glory of God.</p>
<p>In the second letter on this subject your correspondent is misguided enough to speak of the singing of the "Holy City" as a “show," an expression which I consider as inappropriate as it is vulgar.—I am, etc.,</p>

<head>BANDMANN-DALLAS OPERA.
THE CHINESE HONEYMOON</head>
<p>When a play has had such an enormous run in Loudon as the “Chinese Honeymoon" enjoyed, the critic approaches it with a feeling of awe and respect, his only possible task being, we suppose to recount its various merits. But apart from the stage, these did not seem to us to stand out very strikingly: the music was chiefly akin to the simple strains we strummed in the schoolroom, whilst the dialogue more than once had the effect of causing some of the audienoe to indulge in a quiet nap, so the success of the play most have been due to the clever drolleries of the caste at the Strand Theatre. One grows tired of the everlasting sequence of cross marriage 'affairs, an idea which the author works to death, and gladly welcomes the introduction of the “official mother-in-law” to relieve the tedium of the story. We emphatically protest against the inevitable 'coon-song, dragged in by the heels d propos de rien in an Emperor’s palace, and think it high time that this class of music was relegated to the variety stage or troupes of itinerant minstrels.</p>
<p>In the first act the mise-en-scene was a great improvement on the previous efforts at staging, but the play hung sadly until Mr. Cotter made his appearance: all praise is due to his untiring energy and humour, his comic business in a variety of disguises being the backbone of the play—but where  were his red whiskers? Miss Nina Liesk sang delightfully as “Soo Soo,” her “Parasol” song and duet with Mr. O’Connor fully deserving their encores. To tread in the steps of Louie Freear was a difficult task, but Miss Mona coped with it most successfully, perhaps her, best effort being the song “I wants ter be a lady.” Mr. Percival as "The Emperor” seemed unhappy, especially at being left entirely alone so often during Act II. in his vast throne-room; but his ennui (and ours) was thoroughly dispersed when Miss Karkeek appeared, her study of the “official mother-in-law” being full of original wit and acting. We would congratulate the management on the finale of Act I., the whole of the humorous wedding business going with a verve and swing that  are rare when numbers are so small, the singing of the chorus too being much better than we have heard it before. In Act II. we understood that the sleeping draught was a matter of great importance necessary to solve at least one Gordian knot, but beyond a casual allusion by Soo Soo it was lost in an obscurity from which the wearied stage-manager was perhaps not over-anxious to drag it.</p></div>
