                    <head>ALEXANDRIA WATER SUPPLY. GREAT IMPROVEMENTS.</head>
                    <p>The inhabitants of Alexandria have been rejoycing for the last two days at
                        the great improvement in the quality of the water in town, due to the
                        starting of the new filtration plant at the waterworks. This new supply,
                        although not promised by the Water Company to the Municipality in their
                        convention in 1903 until the end of July, is now in actual daily use, and we
                        think some considerable credit is due to the Water Company for having got
                        through their most difficult task in three and a half months before the
                        specified time; it is only owing to the utmost energy on their part that
                        this has been achieved.</p>
                    <p>We understand that at present no date has yet been fixed for the official
                        inauguration of the new works, but it is to be hoped that it will take place
                        in the early summer. It seems a pity that the Municipality is not quite so
                        well up to time with their part of the work, viz., the drain to carry off
                        the dirty water from the filter-washing apparatus; but at present a
                        temporary connection has been made so as to discharge this water into the
                        moat of the fortifications at Rosetta Gate, which has been done as a
                        temporary measure only. It behoves the Municipality therefore to pash
                        forward as quickly as possible with the completion of the permanent drain,
                        the contract for which has only been awarded this week for the part between
                        the Water Company’s premises and Rosetta Gate, where it will join the new
                        branch of the east collector now in course of construction.</p>

                    <p>On the retirement of H.E. El Ferik Sir Edward Henry Zohrab Pasha, K.C.M.G,
                        C.B., His Highness's Under Secretary of State for War, the Sirdar desires to
                        record his appreciation of the long and valuable services rendered by this
                        officer during a period of 35 years. Sir Edward Zohrab has served in many
                        important posts and in each of them the excellence of his work has been most
                        conspicuous. He also served in thB following campaigns: Abyssinia, 1875 1876
                        ; Turco-Russian War, 1877-1878 ; Egyptian Expedition, 1882; Sudan
                        Expedition, 1884-1885. The Sirdar feels sure he is expressing the feeling of
                        all ranks at his Highness’s Army in wishing his Excellency a speedy
                        restoration to health and every good wish for the future.</p>

                    <p>The "Manchester Guardian," commenting on the fact that German imports to
                        Egypt show a tenfold increase in twenty years,says,— We cannot reasonably
                        expect that the German exports will stand still, but the more eager of our
                        commercial friends are anxious that we should increase in the same
                        proportion as Germany. As twenty years ago our share was 57.7 per cent, it
                        appears that we ought now to be exporting to Egypt 577 per cent. of her
                        imports, which, as Euclid used to say, is absurd. The fact is that our
                        imports are increasing substantially and on a far larger scale than those of
                        Germany or any other country. To expect us to maintain our present
                        proportion of exports in the expanding markets of the world is hardly
                        reasonable.</p>

                        most modern design and high speed (possibly turbines), with a view to

                        and providing for the increased comfort and convenience of their
                        passengers.</p>
                    <p>The vessels would be fitted with all the latest improvements for the rapid
                        handling of cargo, and special provision would also be made for the
                        transport of perishable goods such as fruit, vegetables, and other
                        produce.</p>

                        history of Nonconformity in Egypt for on that date its first pastor, the
                        Rev. T.A. Cooper, was inducted to the charge of the first Free Church in the
                        land.</p>
                    <p>At 4.30 p.m. the beautiful German Church in Sharia El-Maghraby was thronged
                        with members of the congregation and friends. In addition to the ministers
                        and others from England we noticed the Rev. Dr. Watson, Rev. Dr. Harvey, and
                        Rev. Dr. Giffen, of the American Mission; Rev. R. Maclnnes, M.A., and Rev.
                        A. J. Toop, of the C.M.S. ; Rev. Dr. Kahle, German pastor; Rev. Dr. Morel,
                        French paator, Rev. M. H. Kanadjian, Armenian Evangelical Church; Mr. George

                        of the Nile Mission Press, and many other well-known members of the British
                        colony in Cairo, who had been drawn together by the unusual service.</p>
                    <p>The Rev. J. C. Easterbrook, of Caledonia. Road Congregational Church, London,
                        presided, and was assisted by the Rev. Charles Leach, D.D., of Harecourt

                        of Choltoncum Hardy, Manchester.</p>
                    <p>During the evening a large gathering assembled in the Hotel Villa Victoria,
                        where a conversazione was held, the large dining room being taxed to
                        accommodate the number who were present. Tea and general conversation were
                        indulged in between 8 and 9 o’clock, after which some delightful music was
                        rendered by members of the choir and other friends, the accompaniments being
                        ably played by the church organist, Mr. J. E. Williams. Speeches were
                        delivered by the ministers and others present, and a most interesting day
                        was brought to a close by the benediction pronounced by the Rev. Dr.
                        Leach.</p>
                    <p>Heartiest congratulations were showered upon the Rev. T. A. Cooper, pastor,
                        and the office-bearers on the success of the day’s proceedings.</p>
                    <p>The Cairo Evangelical Free Church was started in September, 1904, and was the
                        outcome of the successful mission carried on in the Shoubra and Boulac
                        districts for over two years previously by the Rev. T. A. Cooper, who, in
                        December last, was called to the permanent pastorate of the new church. The
                        congregation is under a deep debt of gratitude to the German community, who
                        have, in the most fraternal spirit, granted facilities for worshipping in
                        their buildings. The success which has attended the church daring the past
                        eight months amply justifies its establishment. The congregations have been
                        good, and the membership has steadily increased. Two Sunday schools are in
                        active working, and the first session of the Young Men’s Literary Society
                        was brought to a close last week ; while the weekly evening prayer meeting
                        is well attended.</p>
                    <p>We understand that it is intended to continue the Sunday services, morning
                        and evening, and the weekly prayer meeting throughout the summer.</p>

                    <p>Sir,—Excellent and worthy people like your correspondent, Mr. Thos. Atwood,
                        and the unconscious humourist, Mr. John Smithers, are the most effectual bar
                        to the removal of the Capitulations that I know of. There are very serious
                        reasons for white men—and those not necessarily English, or of the "baser
                        sort"—why the question of the Capitulations should be handled very
                        delicately, and not in the spirit of Exeter Hall and the Y. M. C. A. For my
                        part, I candidly confess to a very real terror of being handed over to the
                        Native Courts with or without a Habeas Corpus ; and I should distrust the
                        arrangement even more if I were not an Englishman, unless I had the best of
                        guarantees. In one breath Mr. Atwood questions our right to be here at all
                        and in another lays down the law as to what we should do! It is a sweet
                        thing to have a good conceit of oneself, but when will the all-important
                        Sassenach realize that he is not the only pebble on the beach?- I am,

                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                    <p>Sir,—Contrary to “Harmony” and “Accord,” the absence of a criticism on the
                        performance of Gaul’s work at the St. Mark's Church jubilee commemoration,
                        in your issue of 26th inst., struck me as being in very-good taste. I
                        assumed that the singing of this cantata (a work of great charm) was to be
                        regarded as part of divine service—active worship by the singers and
                        players, and passive by the congregation, of Almighty God—and consequently
                        without the scope of detailed analysis and criticism, as a performance. That
                        this view must now be abandoned, as a piece of unreasonable optimism, is
                        plain from the tone of "Accord’s" letter, which is very painful reading, and
                        from the article in your issue of to-day. You, Mr. Editor, are severely
                        taken to task for “want of taste and courtesy towards those who gave up
                        their time, talent and gifts for weeks (what prodigality of giving !)
                        towards making the show of the afternoon a success"! The italics are
                        mine.</p>
                    <p>May we ask “Accord" if this sacrifice was made for the reward of notice in
                        your columns of “the show of the afternoon," or was it done to the glory of
                        God and the good of His House? We amateur singers and players have very
                        sensitive feelings and our little (?) failings ; but I have never met with
                        so ruthless an exposure of our weakness at the hands of severe critics as
                        "Accord," the champion of the augmented choir of St. Mark's Church, has made
                        in the words above quoted. It is appalling to reflect that what one feels
                        impelled to regard as an act of divine worship, the culminating point of
                        work in which time and divinely bestowed talents have been employed for
                        weeks, is described as “the show of the afternoon." One most hope that
                        “Aooord" is an “irresponsible" and that the revolting terms he uses do not
                        express the real minds of the ladies and gentlemen who, let it be earnestly
                        hoped, found their chief reward in the labour of love itself and in praising
                        God in His temple. Otherwise one feels doubtful about the refining influence
                        attributed to Music —nay, even that of the Master's spirit, as preached by
                        his ministers.</p>
                    <p>Even had the Cantata been given by a choir of matchless supremacy, to this
                        portion of the service could not be assigned the chief place in the events
                        of the day. Serious reflection ought soon to decide this.</p>
                    <p>If the assumption regarding the act of worship is wrong and we are to
                        understand it was purely “a show,” then, Mr. Editor, possibly you may have
                        merited “Accord's" charge! Had you finally ventured on a complete criticism
                        of the performance, may be the charge of "great want of taste and courtesy”
                        would have gained in intensity! One can easily criticise the efforts of a
                        small amateur choir in a work like “The Holy City." Much better to regard it
                        solely as an act of worship and to say in one's heart “Venite exultemus
                        Domino." I enclose my card, and am, yours truly,</p>

                    <head>To the Editor of the “Egyptian Gazette.”</head>
                    <p>Sir,—Might I be allowed to suggest to those members of the British colony
                        here who belong to the congregation of St. Mark’s that it would be more in
                        accordance with decorum, if they were to cease from rushing into print to
                        air their personal jealousies. If "Accord" is a member of the congregation,
                        as presumably he is, I consider that the tone of his letter was in
                        egregiously bad taste. It is not a secret who was the writer of the first
                        report, and to carp because all those good people, who took part in the
                        "Holy City," were not advertised by name in the newspaper and praised up to
                        the skies, is a sad reflection on Christian humility. Why certain members of
                        the congregation cannot refrain from writing to newspapers I do not know,
                        but St Mark's appears to enjoy an invidious monopoly for “incidents” such as
                        no other Anglican congregation in Egypt can boast of. Let us hope that the
                        "incidents" such as occurred in reference to the “Canon Davis Memorial” and
                        the "Holy City” will not occur again, or at least that members of the
                        congregation will refrain from airing them in the public Press, for such
                        un-Christian pettiness and spite, as “Accord” displays, are unworthy of a
                        Christian and an Anglican."—I am, etc.,</p>

                    <p>Dear Sir,—I confess to being much shocked at the tone of the letters
                        regarding the performances of the "Holy City” at St. Mark’s Church. It is
                        spoken of as an ordinary secular concert, and as if the only idea in the
                        minds of the choir was that they were singing for the glory of men, and not
                        that they were celebrating the jubilee anniversary of the consecration of
                        their church to the glory of God.</p>
                    <p>In the second letter on this subject your correspondent is misguided enough
                        to speak of the singing of the "Holy City" as a “show," an expression which

                    <head>BANDMANN-DALLAS OPERA. THE CHINESE HONEYMOON</head>
                    <p>When a play has had such an enormous run in Loudon as the “Chinese Honeymoon"
                        enjoyed, the critic approaches it with a feeling of awe and respect, his
                        only possible task being, we suppose to recount its various merits. But
                        apart from the stage, these did not seem to us to stand out very strikingly:
                        the music was chiefly akin to the simple strains we strummed in the
                        schoolroom, whilst the dialogue more than once had the effect of causing
                        some of the audienoe to indulge in a quiet nap, so the success of the play
                        most have been due to the clever drolleries of the caste at the Strand
                        Theatre. One grows tired of the everlasting sequence of cross marriage
                        'affairs, an idea which the author works to death, and gladly welcomes the
                        introduction of the “official mother-in-law” to relieve the tedium of the
                        story. We emphatically protest against the inevitable 'coon-song, dragged in
                        by the heels d propos de rien in an Emperor’s palace, and think it high time
                        that this class of music was relegated to the variety stage or troupes of
                        itinerant minstrels.</p>
                    <p>In the first act the mise-en-scene was a great improvement on the previous
                        efforts at staging, but the play hung sadly until Mr. Cotter made his
                        appearance: all praise is due to his untiring energy and humour, his comic
                        business in a variety of disguises being the backbone of the play—but where
                        were his red whiskers? Miss Nina Liesk sang delightfully as “Soo Soo,” her
                        “Parasol” song and duet with Mr. O’Connor fully deserving their encores. To
                        tread in the steps of Louie Freear was a difficult task, but Miss Mona coped
                        with it most successfully, perhaps her, best effort being the song “I wants
                        ter be a lady.” Mr. Percival as "The Emperor” seemed unhappy, especially at
                        being left entirely alone so often during Act II. in his vast throne-room;
                        but his ennui (and ours) was thoroughly dispersed when Miss Karkeek
                        appeared, her study of the “official mother-in-law” being full of original
                        wit and acting. We would congratulate the management on the finale of Act
                        I., the whole of the humorous wedding business going with a verve and swing
                        that are rare when numbers are so small, the singing of the chorus too being
                        much better than we have heard it before. In Act II. we understood that the
                        sleeping draught was a matter of great importance necessary to solve at
                        least one Gordian knot, but beyond a casual allusion by Soo Soo it was lost
                        in an obscurity from which the wearied stage-manager was perhaps not
                        over-anxious to drag it.</p>

                    <head>THE CAPITULATIONS. EGYPTIAN OPINION.</head>
                    <p>Although native public opinion is opposed to the Capitulations, so far as
                        regards the privileges they confer upon Europeans, yet at the same time the
                        statements of Lord Cromer in favor of their abolition have not been received
                        with any enthusiasm, as it is believed that the Capitulations are an
                        effectual hindrance to the increase of British influence of Egypt, and that
                        it would be better to leave them with all their imperfections and injustices
                        than to remove such a powerful obstacle to the growth of the power of the
                        Occupation. The following article explains this standpoint It is translated
                        from “Al Express,” an Arabic weekly published and edited by Mahmoud Ibrahim,
                        an influential ex-Government official, (Mohamedan) :—</p>
                    <p>On notifying tho publication in London of Lord Cromer’s report the telegrams
                        pointed out three of the subjects treated therein, namely - the necessity
                        for abolishing the Capitulations ; the favorable attitude of the Khedive
                        towards tho establishment of amicable relations between the British and the
                        Egyptians; and tho co-operation or the Legislative Council and tho General
                        Assembly. We wish now to deal with the first-mentioned part of these
                        subjects, viz. ; the Capitulations. One of our best writers rejoiced at the
                        statements made by Lord Cromer as to the necessity of the abolition of these
                        Capitulations in order to save Egypt from their abuse. We doubt, however,
                        whether his joy is real or imaginary, for these Capitulations are a
                        guarantee of the independence of Egypt and a brake on the Occupation.
                        Without the Capitulations Egypt would have become a British Colony long
                        ago.</p>
                    <p>It is not strange then that Lord Cromer should complain of their existence
                        inasmuch as they constitute the only remaining stumbling block in his way
                        for the accomplishment of his work in Egypt. He has overcome all
                        difficulties ; he has established the most friendly relations between the
                        British and the Egyptians, so that if any Egyptians were told that England
                        was about to evacuate the country they would weep and would seize the
                        British soldiers by their uniforms to induce them to romain at Kasr el-Nil
                        and Kom el Dik.</p>
                    <p>The Anglo French agreement will mark in history a very convicting proof of
                        Lord Cromer’s great ability in politics for the joke he has played on the
                        French Republic. His Lordship has brought the Khedive and King Edward
                        together and thus silenced the National Party. He has secured the good-will
                        of the members of the Legislative Council, so that they are more submissive
                        to Kasr el Doubara than ever before. He has abolished the Caisse de la Dette
                        and put the Finance at his disposal. He has subdued the Sudan for his
                        country. There remains nothing besides the Capitulations; after putting an
                        end to them he will bid us “good-bye” to go and live quietly on the banks of
                        the Thaunes for the remainder of his life in order to make room for his
                        disciple, Sir Eldon Gorst, who is at present studying politics at the
                        Foreign Office and preparing himself for the important post which will be
                        left vacant by Lord Cromer.</p>
                    <p>The Capitulations ensure the existence of the International Courts for a long
                        term of years. Their existence strengthens the influence of the Consuls and
                        their influence is most beneficial to the country in regard to the freedom
                        it enjoys in speech and in action. Without them we would not have a free
                        Press to write, criticise, and oppose. Without them no Egyptian would have
                        been allowed to stand in tho midst of Mohamed Aly Square and say “I am free
                        to say and write what I like,” and no one would be allowed to preach
                        patriotism and speak on any national subject were it not for the
                        Capitulations. Why then should natives complain of them owing to the
                        trifling disadvantages resulting therefrom? But after all what are these
                        drawbacks? They say that these disadvantages are that the foreigners are not
                        tried with the natives in the same tribunal? We may here say that there is
                        no harm or disadvantage in such treatment ; any foreigner who transgresses
                        against a native is liable to be accused by the native before his competent
                        consular authorities, tried and condemned by his consular court. If this
                        court does not act with justice and impartiality the matter could be
                        referred to and brought before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on which that
                        court depends.</p>
                    <p>We cannot pretend that the French, the Italian, or the Hellenic Government
                        would not deal out justice in cases between Egyptians and their subjects, in
                        order not to show the natives the way how to obtain satisfaction against
                        those who encroach upon them, and consequently would refrain from going to
                        law, or to apply to the proper authority in the right way. The fault lies
                        therefore with our timidity, for we are offended, but we remain in silence.
                        We are encroached upon, but we do not take the trouble to seek redress at
                        the Consulate which is near at hand.</p>
                    <p>In numerous instances we have recently noticed that the consular authorities
                        are now dealing more severely with their subjects. As to civil rights we are
                        all equally tried by International courts, and no one can deny the
                        independence in action and freedom of opinion of these institutions, their
                        impartiality and their influence. These courts are the only sources of Egypt
                        of justice and equality between the high and the low, and between the ruler
                        and the ruled. On various occasions they have condemned the Government in
                        favor of natives as well as foreigners, in favor of local subjects. We are
                        of opinion that on the very day these Capitulations are abolished, on that
                        day the British Flag will be hoisted over the land of Egypt. Are the
                        Egyptians aware of this or not? If not, the sooner they appreciate the
                        situation, the better it will be for them.</p>

                    <head>CAIRO S.P.C.A. ANNUAL REPORT.</head>
                    <p>Allusion has been made in previous reports to the question of the
                        construction of a Decauville, or light rail way, leading from the principal
                        quarries to points at the outskirts of the town and thus doing away all
                        together with the use of carts for the conveyance of stones over the desert.
                        This is a matter in which the committee take the greatest interest. The
                        concession for these lines was approved and sanctioned in June last, but a
                        good many technical details in regard to the crossing of the State Railway
                        lines, and the points at which stone and material could be unloaded, had
                        subsequently to be arranged, so that the Delta Light Railways could not
                        begin work until December. Lines are to be laid to the Red Mountain, to the
                        sand and klin quarries, and to two quarries beyond the Citadel known as the
                        Middle and Upper quarries. Distributing depots for the town will be at
                        Bab-el-Hasanieh, the Mousky, and at a point north of the Citadel. The work
                        will be pushed on, and should be completed by the end of July. If, as is
                        hoped, these lines are eventually exclusively used for the transport of
                        stone, etc., cart traffic across the desert should cease.</p>
                    <p>The method of disembarking cattle, horses, sheep, etc., et Alexandria has
                        recently been engaging, the attention of the Alexandria and Cairo
                        S.P.C.A.’s. Until quite recently bullocks and Cairo were hoisted by the
                        horas from the bottom of the hold, and naturally struck against the sides of
                        the hatch and bulwark, as the which was swung round to drop them into the
                        lighter. Oxen with no horns were dragged from the lower deck by the
                        forefeet. Cases of dislocation occurred in consequence of animals being
                        hoisted by one foot and roughly lowered into the lighter, and the horns of
                        some of the bullocks were broken. In one instance a consignment of over 300
                        goats arrived. They had been on board for 8 days without food or water, the
                        water being apparently only sufficient in quantity for the crew.</p>
                    <p>This state of things was brought to the notice of the Khedivial Mail Line and
                        Bell’s Asia Minor S.S. Co. and the personal influence of Mr. Gould and Mr.
                        F. Allen largely contributed to cause the former company to change their
                        method of disembarking animals.</p>
                    <p>All ships arriving at the Port of Alexandria with cattle should use slings
                        similar to those now used by the Knedivial Mail Co. for bullocks, homes, and
                        mules. Sheep and goats should be hoisted up from the hold in a square box
                        large enough to hold 6 or 8 sheep at a time. The box or boxes should have
                        iron rings at the corners with a small chain hooking on to the chain of the
                        winch.</p>
                    <p>In view of the fact that large numbers are brought to Egypt in ships
                        belonging to the Austrian Lloyd Co. and to Greek companies, Mr. Gould spoke
                        to the Austrian and Greek Consular authorities on the subject of the methods
                        of disembarkation complained of. They promised to enquire into the matter at
                        once and to take action. The Austrian Lloyd Agent has since issued a
                        circular forbidding the use, in the vessels of his company, of objectionable
                        modes of disembarking cattle.</p>
                    <p>The instructions of Bell’s Asia Minor S.S. Co. to the captains of their
                        steamers are to use canvas slings for all heavy animals such as bullocks,
                        horses, etc. It is sincerely to be hoped that the company will, in future,
                        see that these instructions are properly carried out.</p>

                    <head>EGYPT AND U.S A. MACHINERY IMPORTS.</head>
                    <p>Lately we referred to the fact that there is a large and steadily increasing
                        market in Egypt for British machinery. Our views receive ample confirmation
                        in a very candid note by Consul-General Morgan, the American representative
                        at Cairo. He writes—“Unlike British manufacturers, the Americans refuse to
                        guarantee their goods, contenting themselves by saying, ‘The machines do the
                        work we claim for them in this country (the United States,') and then
                        proceed to put idiomatic expressions into their letters which are, in many
                        cases, beyond the linguistic attainments of the intending agent or
                        purchaser. One manufacturer lost a market for his 'cultivators’ owing to the
                        springs carrying the body of the machine not being strong enough to properly
                        support the machine when crossing the irrigation channel, with which all
                        fields in Egypt are intersected. In reply to the suggestion made to
                        strengthen the springs, he said that the machines were not made to ‘jump
                        ditches’. These ditches are fillets of but 2 ins. or 3 ins. deep.
                        Suggestions as to ‘finish' of certain wearing parts are as regularly scouted
                        as they are made, as are also suggestions about modifications to make the
                        machines more adaptable to the peculiar agriculture conditions of the
                        country, the nature of the soil, etc. British manufactures have long had the
                        reputation of acting in precisely a similar manner as that now attributed to
                        Americans, but I have it from a gentleman recently returned from the United
                        States, which he visited for the sole purpose of inducing manufacturers to
                        introduce certain modifications in their agricultural machinery which were
                        essential to their efficient working in Egypt, that he simply lost his time
                        and money, and, returning east, he offered his suggestions to a British
                        manufacturer, who at once took up the business. The purchaser is paying 30
                        per cent, more for his machines, but he gets what he requires, and also the
                        guaranty for working efficiency, which the American manufacturers
                        refuse.”,</p>
                    <p>LOCOMOTIVES IN EGYPT.</p>
                    <p>Following up these exceedingly interesting remarks, the American
                        Consul-General treats his Government to some “home truths" with regard to
                        Yankee locomotives. He writes:- “American locomotives a few years ago
                        obtained an unenviable reputation in Egypt, and were the subject of more
                        than one official report and reference. Here, again, I think it but just to
                        remark that at the time they were ordered there was a general outcry at the
                        lack of transport—locomotives were required and that immediately. American
                        manufactures undertook to fill the void in an incredibly short space of
                        time, and did so. The order was in every sense ‘rushed’ to fill an immediate
                        necessity. Under other conditions it is not impossible that American
                        manufacturers could successfully compete with those of other countries
                        whether from the point of view of rapid delivery, finish, or general
                        efficiency, or all three combined. The reasons for the comparative failure
                        of the American locomotives to come up to local expectations might form the
                        subject of a report by a machinery expert sent here to study the general
                        question of machinery for the Egyptian market." Before the American expert
                        gets to Egypt the British firms interested should make their market secure.
                        At the present time they have an opportunity which may never occur
                        again.</p>

                    <head>CORPORATION OF WESTERN EGYPT SOME PARTICULARS OF THE COMPANY’S
                        CONCESSION.</head>
                    <p>The agricultural and mineral possibilities of Egypt are now occupying
                        increasing attention. This applies especially to the outlying provinces of
                        the country, away from the valley of the Nile and the proverbial fertility
                        of the riparian region. The Corporation of Western Egypt, Ltd., which was
                        formed in January last, has been granted a concession covering about 74,000
                        square miles of land in these provinces; but, as the corporation issued no
                        prospectus, no particulars of its properties have been made known. It is
                        stated that the capital was over subscribed, and the details that follow
                        have been furnished to us by the company.</p>
                    <p>The lands owned by the corporation include the four oases, named respectively
                        Kharga, Dakhla, Baharia and Farafra, which bear evidence, in their now
                        silted Roman wells, of considerable prosperity in by-gone times, as a result
                        of possession of that essential requirement in a rainless country—an
                        unfailing supply of water. The engineers of the corporation have exploited
                        these wells, but it appears that it will not be necessary to rely on any
                        such limited supply. The news has reached the corporation that a plentiful
                        supply of water bas been struck in the oasis of Kharga not far below the
                        surface, and, at a depth of 145 ft, artesian water, by means of keystone
                        drillers, yielding a supply which rises 3ft above the ground.</p>
                    <p>As a natural result of the discovery of water by the engineering staff,
                        attention is being directed to the natural of the concessions held by the
                        Corporation of Western Egypt, Ltd., from the Egyptian Government. Chief
                        among these and land grants, which, of course, increase in value as the
                        permanency of the water supply can be assured. The extent of these land
                        grants will be appreciated when it is stated that the corporation is
                        entitled to locate Government lands at the rate of 20,000 feddans of land
                        per annum for thirty years, making 600,000 feddans in all. We understand
                        that the first 20,000 feddans have been located by the corporation where
                        there is plenty of water, and that the necessary application has been made
                        to the Government. These lands are free under the terms of the
                        concession.</p>
                    <p>The corporation expect to drew large revenues from the sale or leasing of
                        lands; but besides this the well-boring operations are to be extended to
                        other areas, and it is stated that an agreement of a favorable nature to the
                        corporation has been already concluded with the local omdehs, sheikhs and
                        principal inhabitants of Western Egypt for the boring of wells on lands
                        other than those owned directly by the company.</p>
                    <p>The railway, which will be laid in the near future to connect Western Egypt
                        with the Egyptian State Railway near Farshut, on the Nile, will enable the
                        corporation to deal with the surplus produce grown, as the district will be
                        placed in direct communication with Cairo, where the data, cotton and other
                        crops are expected to find a ready market. The corporation has the monopoly
                        of constructing this line from near Farshut to the Kharga oasis. The
                        distance is about 120 miles, and the company has a guarantee of interest at
                        3 precent from the Egyptian Government for 25 years after the completion of
                        the railway. A survey was commenced in January last, and the construction
                        will probably occupy not more than a year.</p>
                    <p>A further concession obtained by the corporation relates to earthy materials,
                        beds of which are stated to be very numerous and over the region of Dakhla
                        especially extend almost uninterruptedly. Ochres, alums, phosphates and
                        cobalts are expected to become important facts in determining the measures
                        of prosperity of the corporation. A number of samples and specimens of these
                        earthy minerals are already at the corporation’s office in London.</p>
                    <p>It is, of course, impossible to determine as yet the mineral producing
                        capacity of the concession, but the company regards it as a most valuable
                        asset, and points out that it has, so to speak, all ready to hand, without
                        the necessity for uncertain prospecting operations, elaborate mining
                        machinery and expensive labour. The railway, of course, will be equally
                        available for carrying the chemically treated products of these earthy
                        mineral beds to market as the crops of the cultivated lands.</p>
                    <p>A mining license, ceding the right to prospect for metals, mineral and
                        precious stones within the area of the corporation’s concession, completes
                        the tale of the special privileges which the corporation holds from the
                        Government. It is stated that the company has ample funds for working
                        capital.</p>

                    <p>It is still holiday time with us. The Greek and Coptic Churches are
                        celebrating their Easter, and everybody on Monday will be “smelling the
                        zephyr”, which is what the name of the holiday — Shem-en-Neesim—means when
                        translated into English.</p>



                    <p>Although the suspension of business on this day is general, and everybody who
                        can take the holiday does so, little of the holiday element as we know it in
                        England, is to be seen in the large cities of Egypt I suppose it is in the
                        country districts that the people may be seen enjoying themselves to the
                        full, according to the customs of the country. The “Egyptian Calendar"
                        states that one of these is for women on this day to take an onion and
                        bruise it, and then to hang it on the door or wall of the house. Sometimes a
                        wife wakes her husband in the morning by bringing the onion and using it as
                        a charm ‘to drive away tho heaviness of the giaour.” The origin of the
                        custom, we are told, is lost in antiquity.</p>



                    <p>According to the calendar, Shem-en-Nessim is the first day of the Khamseen
                        period, but we have already had one or two very good specimens of the
                        hot-winds that are associated with this period, and that of Saturday last
                        was, if I may indulge in a slang term, a ‘caution’. The thermometer
                        registered a trifle over 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the shade, and such a
                        temperature has not been exceeded in Alexandria in more than four out of the
                        last ten years, the highest reading during that period being 105 degrees in
                        May, 1901.</p>



                    <p>It is interesting to learn on the authority of a well-known author, that hot,
                        dry, and charged with sand and dust as this wind is, its immediate effect is
                        not weakening or depressing, but to many persons, on the contrary, somewhat
                        stimulating, though when it blows steadily for three, five, or more
                        consecutive days and nights, more or lees lassitude is generally felt.</p>



                    <p>I can quite believe it, and hope that five or more days experience of last
                        week’s heat will not fall to our lot many times during this year’s
                        Khamseens. But it is consoling to be told that those who pass through the
                        period without suffering will find the months that follow far less
                        trying.</p>



                    <p>The Arabs have a legend which refers the origin of the Khamseen wind to a
                        period of fifty days during which Cain carried on his shoulders the wasting
                        body of his brother Abel.</p>



                    <p>Poor fellow! and probably with no such thing as a tin of carbolic powder, or
                        a bottle of eucalyptus oil in his possession!</p>



                    <p>Tantah fair, an amusing account of which appeared in the "Gazette" of
                        Thursday, must have been a big affair if the correspondent who wrote about
                        it was even approximately correct in his figures. He states that, in
                        addition to those who travelled by camel or came on foot, some 700,000
                        persons were estimated by the Railway Administration to have come to Tantah
                        by train.</p>



                    <p>Seven hundred thousand railway passengers! Nearly three quarters of a
                        million! A tenth part of the number would seem a mighty host, and have
                        required a few ‘specials,’ but even taking the number at that, the sight
                        must have been a remarkable one, and well worth a long journey to see.</p>



                    <p>And yet it must have been a melancholy sight, if it be true that in Egypt a
                        fair is "a holiday devoted to immorality, indecency, drunkenness and useless
                        extravagance.” Having been suspended for four years, it may well be asked
                        why Tantah fair was again allowed to be held. It is sad to read that "a poor
                        fellah was beaten to death” during the crush at Friday prayers in the
                        Mosque, and one can only hope that it was a pure accident, and that the word
                        crushed can be substituted for beaten.</p>



                    <p>Lord Cromer in his Report for 1904 (page 45) seems disposed to account for
                        the increase of crime in this country by suggesting that it is a result of
                        the growth of prosperity. He says:</p>
                    <p>Large numbers of persons, who but recently were very poor, have now become
                        moderately rich. Having tasted the enjoyment of wealth, they wish to become
                        richer, and in their desire to attain their object, they are far more
                        frequently than heretofore brought into collision with others who are
                        seeking precisely the same object as themselves.</p>



                    <p>In order to test tho probable accuracy of this assumption, an exhaustive
                        analysis of the criminal statistics is necessary, and this I have not at
                        present had an opportunity of making, but I mention it here because it seems
                        to me very aoropos to the subject of fairs. It is not at all likely that the
                        increase of wealth spoken of failed to have its effect at Tantah ; indeed on
                        every hand are we faced by difficulties caused by the newly-found wealth of
                        the Egyptian fellah, and Lord Cromer has my heartiest sympathy as he
                        writes,—“It is obviously no easy matter to deal with the special economic
                        and moral phase through which Egypt and the Egyptians are now passing.”</p>



                    <p>There is one appeal I would make, and that is an earnest one to the educated
                        native, and especially to the native press, to accord Lord Cromer all the
                        possible support they can in his efforts to solve the many economic and
                        moral questions that are pressing upon him with increased force. I fear that
                        the tone of the native press in dealing with his Report is not entirely a
                        satisfactory one.</p>



                    <p>So far I have only seen a translation of the article in “Al Express," but as
                        this paper is edited by an influential ex-Government official, it does not
                        presage a very favorable reception of Lord Cromer’s suggestions as to the
                        Capitulations. The remark (which I presume he is correctly translated) that
                        “the Anglo-French agreement will mark in history a very convincing proof of
                        Lord Cromer’s great ability in politics, for the joke he has played on the
                        French Republic," is to my mind conceived in a spirit hardly suitable to
                        questions of serious import, while the contention that the Cousular
                        authority is exerted effectually on foreign subjects, is manifestly
                        incompatible with the condition of affairs existing both in Cairo and
                        Alexandria.</p>



                    <p>I think, too, that those who are really genuinely desirous to see their
                        country occupy again a position in the world commensurate with its former
                        greatness, should rejoice rather than cavil at the present excellent
                        relations existing between the Khedive and Lord Cromer as the representative
                        of Great Britain, and do all in their power to help in consolidating the
                        efforts both are putting forth for Egypt’s benefit. </p>



                    <p>The comments of the English Press on the Report bat I have seen are on the
                        whole disappointing and superficial. Few papers seem to care to go deeply
                        into the many questions dealt with in the 149 pages of which it consists,
                        and nearly all content themselves with very commonplace remarks on
                        theCapitulations, Anglo-French agreement, etc.</p>



                    <p>There is however one very notable exception. The “Daily News," a paper seldom
                        seen in Egypt, and generally considered to be the organ of “Little
                        Englanders,” writes of Lord Cromer in an appreciative spirit that is very
                        different from the hackneyed form of expression so commonly adopted. There
                        is real feeling displayed in the following extracts, with which I will
                        conclude my remarks this week.</p>



                    <p>“It is pleasant to turn from India and South Africa to the admirable rule of
                        Lord Cromer in Egypt. Here is a man who does not advertise, and who rules
                        the land over which he is set with a sympathy and a capacity which give him
                        a high place with the great Proconsuls. We doubt whether there is any
                        parallel to the work he has unostentatiously carried on for some twenty
                        years. He has organized a nation. He has given the dwellers by the Nile a
                        security and a prosperity they have not enjoyed literally for thousands of
                        years.</p>



                    <p>“On the land question Lord Cromer’a policy is admirable. The reclaimed land,
                        for which there is a great demand, he advises the Government not to sell at
                        present. When they do sell he suggests selling it in small plots, so as to
                        give the fellaheen a chance of purchasing it. How much this wise policy of
                        giving the people the land is responsible for the success of Egypt is
                        evident. In the last four years the number of land owners bas increased by
                        nearly a hundred thousand. Cannot Lord Cromer bring his wisdom of the small
                        holding and the agricultural bank to benighted England?” T.A.</p>

                    <head>EGYPTOLOGICAL NOTES. THE KARNAK FINDS,</head>
                    <p>The details of M. Legrain’s discoveries at Karnak are given in the current
                        number of the Recueil de Travaux, and prove quite as interesting as was
                        anticipated. As has been already announced in the columns of be “Egyptian
                        Gazette" his chief discovery was that of a pit or well, in which, when the
                        water was at last removed, there appeared no fewer than 457 statues of one
                        kind or another, and nearly 8,000 bronze figures of Osiris and other gods.
                        M. Maspero’s opinion, here recorded, that the pit was a favissa into which
                        were cast things past service belonging to the cult, would not lead one to
                        suppose that they were all in a good state of preservation; but M. Ligroin’s
                        own theory seems to be that they were thrown in all at one time and in
                        haste. From them he is able to show that the site of ancient Thebes covers
                        treasures going much further back than bas hitherto been thought possible
                        and he hopes that further excavations may lay bare monuments as archaic as
                        anything hitherto found at Abydos or Negadeh, Hieraconpolis or Saqqarah.
                        Meanwhile he tells us of a new king, Mer-ankh-Ra, a Mentuhotep of the
                        eleventh dynasty, who seems to have been the sixth of that name. There are
                        also a Usertseen IV., a Neferhotep III, and a Sebekhotep VIII.,to be added
                        to the list of kings in the shadowy period between the twelfth and and the
                        fourteenth dynasties; and we bear for the first time of a joint reign shared
                        between Hern-seb-khanut II., evidently the last Tanite king of the
                        twenty-first dynasty, and the Libyan soldier Sheshonq I., who was probably
                        King Solomon’s suzerain. M. Legrsin is also able to establish from his
                        discoveries regular pedigrees of some of the kings of be twenty-second
                        dynasty, including Sheshonq himself) Osorkon II., and a Horisiesi, who seems
                        to have reigned conjointly with the last-named. The article will clear up
                        several disputed points in the history of Egypt, but the full effects of M.
                        Legrsin’s find will only be seen when his monuments are published, which
                        will probably come to pass in several numbers of the gigantic Catalogue of
                        the Cairo Museum. This mode of publication, though defensible, is a severe
                        tax on the resources of Egyptologists, the Catologue having already extended
                        to some seventeen large volumes, costing on an average some 21 apiece.</p>

                    <p>— MASPERO v. MANETHO.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile M. Maspero has returned to a subject always near to his heart, and
                        urges in the same number of the Recoil that Manetho’s statements with regard
                        to the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties require correction. His view is
                        that Manetho, in the form in which he has come down to us, does not
                        distinguish between historical facts which he was in a position to verify
                        and popular tradition, as exemplified in the “Leper” story of the Exodus and
                        elsewhere, and has therefore often mentioned the same king twice under
                        slightly different names. This is likely enough to have been the case in the
                        earlier dynasties, as there are some signs that the length of the different
                        reigns has been manipulated either by Manetho or his transmitters in the
                        interests of a mystical chronology, which would make historical events occur
                        in regular cycles. But M. Maspero now declares that Manetho’s Khebros,
                        Misphragmouthosis, and Misaphris never had any real existence, but were
                        legendary monarchs like Sesostris or Osymandyas, to whom the popular
                        imagination attributed, in exaggerated form, the real deeds of the different
                        Amenhoteps and Rameses. M. Maspero’s authority in matter Egyptological is so
                        great that everything that he says deserves respectful attention; yet, if
                        his views prevail, a good many cherished idols will be shattered.</p>

                    <head>THE ASSOUAN DAM.</head>
                    <p>If there are any whose fears for the Assouan Dam give them sleepless nights
                        (says “Engineering”), we commend them to read be letter by Sir William
                        Willcocks which we borrow from be “Egyptian Gazette” and print on another
                        page. It is popular but it is convincing; and since there is no word about
                        the new theory of vertical cleavage which has so perturbed many good people,
                        we may take it that Sir William Willcocks suffers no uneasiness on that
                        account, He knows what the dam is made of, and on what it is founded ; it is
                        made of the most tenacious cement mortar, and it is tied on either side to
                        the solid granite by cement, but in the calculation of its strength the dam
                        has been regarded as mud and the cement as “so much plum jam.” It is founded
                        on granite rock, “regardless of expense, and supervised in every detail by
                        sound engineers.” Hence Sir William has the feeling of assurance without
                        which knowledge is not worthy of the name. Possibly his sentiments towards
                        Messrs. Pearson and Atcherley are very much those of Algazzali the Arabian
                        who, having convinced himself that ten was more than three, remarked that
                        “if one came to me and said, ’On the contrary, three is more than ten, and,
                        to prove the truth my assertion, I will change this rod into a serpent,' and
                        if he were to change it, my conviction of his error would remain unshaken.
                        His manceuvre would only produce in me admiration for his ability. I should
                        not doubt my own knowledge.” We suspect that Sir William Willcocks admires
                        the ingenuity of the two great mathematicians, but we are sure that he does
                        not doubt his own knowledge, and is quite happy in his mind about the
                        strength of the dam.</p>

                    <head>ST. VITUS’ DANCE CURED. BY DR. WILLIAMS’ PINK PILLS.</head>
                    <p>Daily growing more common in school children, St Vitus’ Dance is one of be
                        most difficult disorders to cure. Ordinary medicine often fails to touch it.
                        The great success of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills in this ailment makes them
                        important to parents.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Owen, 24 Bath-street, Newton Health, Manchester, mother of a child
                        cured, said:-</p>
                    <p>“My little girl had a slight accident in be Physical Drill lesson. For a time
                        I kept her at home, and when she want to school again the poor little thing
                        could not do the slightest thing without trembling with nervousness.
                        Sometimes she nearly fainted. The School Board inspector saw that she had St
                        Vitus’ dance. Her arms and neck began to twitch ; it was pitiful to see her.
                        She would flush about the face, and was often sick. She never went out to
                        play with other children. She was very weak! too, and I did not know what to
                        do. St Vitus’ dance is a terrible affliction. The sufferer is moving,
                        twitching, starting, all the time. Yon can do nothing but watch her waste
                        away, never at rest. That was Minnie's state before I gave her Dr. Williams’
                        Pink Pills for Pale People. She was better after the very first dose, and
                        from that time she kept on steadily improving. I have great faith in Dr.
                        Williams’ Pink Pills. For ten years I have seen them effect many wonderful
                        cures, even more marvellous than Minnie’s.”</p>
                    <p>From St. Vitus’ dance to Paralysis and Locomotor Ataxy, these pills have
                        effected wonders in nervous disorders. They enrich and purify the blood, and
                        feed the starved nerves through the blood. Sciatica, Rheumatism, Eczema,
                        Rickets, Anaemia, Decline and Consumption have been cured repeatedly, as
                        well as the ailments of ladies. Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co., Holborn-viaduct,

                    <head>INLAND NAVIGATION IN EGYPT. By SIR HANBURY BROWN, K.C.M.O. No. II*</head>
                    <p>Having got rid of tolls in our last article let us now return to tho
                        consideration of the physical conditions controlling the river navigation,
                        and we will then pass on to the main artificial lines used by the boat
                        traffic. Now that the Assouan Dam and its locks are in working order, there
                        is through navigation from the second cararact at Wadi Halfa to the sea, a
                        distance of 969 miles (1,650 kiloms.). This is Miss Amelia B. Edwards’ “One
                        Thousand Miles up the Nile," the authoress having accomplished the journey
                        from the sea to Wadi Halfs. The thirty-one miles required to complete the
                        round thousand were taken credit for, as being included in the view from the
                        top of some heights at Wadi Halfa. Starting from Wadi Halfa in the south,
                        and traveling downstream, the Assouan Dam is reached after a journey of 215
                        miles (34.5 kiloms.), for about half of which the depth of water has been
                        increased at certain times of the year by the act of storing water above the
                        Assouan Dam. The size of vessels on this reach is limited by the dimensions
                        of the locks of the Assouan Dam, which are 70 m. long by 9 1/2 m. wide.
                        There are four such locks in one flight.</p>
                    <p>The next reach, from Assouan Dam to Assent Barrage, is 346 miles (554 kilos.)
                        long. The Nag Hamadi Railway Bridge is passed on his length. The third
                        reach, from Assiout Barrage to the Delta Barrage below Cairo, is 260 miles
                        (417 kilos.) long. The obstructions to navigation on this reach are the
                        bridges at Cairo, viz., the Kasr-el-Nil road bridge and the Embabeh railway
                        bridge, soon to have added to them the Rodah Island tramway and road
                        bridge.</p>
                    <p>From Assouan to the Delta Barrage the dimensions os steamers are limited by
                        the size of the Assiout Barrage lock, which is 80 m. long by 16 m. broad.
                        But no boats of this size can get into the reach unless they are built here,
                        as the lock of the Delta Barrage has a width of 14.83 m. only, and a length
                        of 61.45 m. In high floods it would be possible to get a boat 61.40 m. long
                        and 14.80 m. wide into the Cairo reach by bringing it into the Rosetta
                        branch from the sea; and, further, if here is no regulation being done on
                        the barrage, and it is fully open with its gates all raised, the length of
                        the boat would not be limited by the length of the lock, as both pairs of
                        its gates would be fully open. When, however, the conditions of the Nile
                        discharge make it impossible to use this large lock, the width of the other
                        lock, the width of the other lock, namely, 11.83 m., determines the maximum
                        bean of the boat that can be passed, and its length of 53.30 m. limits the
                        boat length.</p>
                    <p>In the Damietta Branch Barrage there is no second large lock, and passing
                        boats are always limited by the 11.83 m. width of lock and 53.50 m. length,
                        excepting when the barrage is not being regulated on and both pairs of lock
                        gates are fixed open, allowing boats of any length to pass. Five hundred
                        metres below the barrage on the Damietta branch, and .500 m. below that on
                        the Rosetta branch, are what are known as the Barrage subsidiary weirs.
                        During flood, when there is sufficient depth of water flowing over the weir
                        crest, steamers and boats can pass freely over them without danger. But when
                        the depth is insufficient, navigation is provided for by a lock at one
                        extremity of each weir, having a length of chamber of 64.25 metres and a
                        width of 12 meters. The Zifta Barrage, recently built cross at the Damietta
                        Branch about half-way between the old Delta Barrage and the sea, is provided
                        with a lock 65 meters long by 12 meters wide. The length of each of the
                        Damietta and Rosetta Branches of the Nile is 148 miles (236 kilos.). The
                        obstructions to one free passage of boats on these branches have already
                        been enumerated. Navigation on them is only possible during the season that
                        the river is in flood, and for a short time after roughly speaking for five
                        months, from August to January inclusive.</p>
                    <p>The available depth of water on the river from Assouan to the sea naturally
                        varies considerably. In floods there may be as much as 10 metres or even
                        more ; in summer under two metres, or even under one metre at bad shoals.
                        Below the Delta Barrage there is practically no discharge in summer, as the
                        whole river is completely dammed by tho lowering and caulking of the Barrage
                        gates, and every drop of the Nile water is turned into the canals to be made
                        use of for the irrigation of crops. As the efficient working of the Barrage
                        had as its inevitable result the drying up of the river branches below it,
                        and their annihilation in summer as navigable routes, it was considered
                        necessary to substitute artificial channels of navigation for the natural
                        ones which had been wiped out. In spite of the shutting off of all supply to
                        thèse two river branches, the last reach from the sea for some distance up
                        the branch still remained navigable on account its depth and the backwater
                        from the sea. Above the Barrage, as has been pointed out, the result of its
                        damming the river was to produce deep water between it and Cairo all the
                        year round. Consequently, to restore navigation between Cairo and the towns
                        of the Delta to the north of it, what had to be done was to construct
                        navigable canals, or adapt to navigation existing canals, from the Delta
                        Barrage to the deep water tail reaches of the river branches above Rosetta
                        and Damietta.</p>
                    <p>The substitute for the Rosetta Branch was already existing at this time that
                        the Barrage was made efficient, but it required adaptation to make it a
                        satisfactory substitute, the principal work to be built being a lock to
                        connect the canal route with the deep-water reach at the seaward end of the
                        branch. The first reach of this line of navigation consists of the fine
                        Central Canal of the Delta, the Rayyah Menufia, by which the whole of the
                        irrigation of the land lying between the two branches is effected. About 20
                        kiloms. from the Barrage the route leaves the main canal and takes to the
                        Baguria Canal, and, further down, to the Kodaba Canal, on which is the
                        Kodaba lock, whereby boats pass from the canal into tho lower river. The
                        channel of the Baguria Canal requires remodeling in width and direction
                        before it can be considered a satisfactory navigable way. The principal town
                        passed on the way to Kodaba lock is Kafr Zayat. After passing into the river
                        by the Kodaba lock, boats can either go down the river to Rosetta or past it
                        to the sea ; or may enter at Atfeh the Mabmudieh Canal, which carries them
                        into Alexandria, where there is a tail lock connecting the canal with the
                        Maritime harbour.</p>
                    <p>On this Cairo-Alexandria route there are a considerable number of navigation
                        obstacles, which I will not detail. It is, however, important to note the
                        dimensions of locks which limit the dimensions of boats. If, during flood,
                        boats use the river route between Cairo and Atfeh and thence the Mahmudieh
                        Canal to Alexandria, the larger of two locks at the Atfeh entrance to the
                        canal limit the dimensions to an extreme of 54 m. length by 12m. width. But
                        unless the conditions allow of the larger lock in the Delta Barrage passing
                        boats, the size of boats using this route is limited by the smaller Barrage
                        lock to 53.50 m. by 11.83 m., as already pointed out.</p>
                    <p>When the Rosetta Branch below the Delta Barrage cease to be navigable, the
                        lock at the head of the Rayyah Menufia is the controlling point, reducing
                        the dimensions of boats to 8m. width, but still allowing a length of 54 m.,
                        as it has that length and a metre more to spare. Ten kiloms. from the head
                        is a short lock, evidently a child of the Irrigation Department of former
                        days born out of due time. Fortunately the regulator with which it is
                        associated is rarely regulated on, and so both pair of lock gates can be
                        left fully open, so that any boats that can get into the canal can pass this
                        lock also, as it has a width of 8 m.</p>
                    <p>On this route between Cairo and Alexandria there are six State Railway
                        bridges to pass, and one or more Light Railway bridges, so that the journey
                        is not all plain sailing, and calculations of the time required for goods to
                        reach their destination are complicated by the unsolvable personal equation,
                        with its unknown quantities, of each of the native “captains” of the
                        bridges, who would count it less shame to neglect their duty than to neglect
                        their opportunities. What the boatmen should see to, in their own interests,
                        is that the opportunities for blackmailing them be reduced as far as it is
                        in their own power to reduce them. And a very effective way of cutting down
                        the opportunities is to imitate the example set by an Egyptien company under
                        English direction. This company undertakes the transport of goods by river
                        and canal, and has so fitted up its barges that their masts can be easily
                        lowered to enable them to pass under the girders of the railway bridges at
                        most seasons of the year. During the height of the flood only, the opening
                        of the navigation passage has to be awaited. It may not be easy to adapt the
                        native boat of today and of the long past to meet the new conditions of
                        traffic created by the construction of bridges across the navigable routes,
                        but it should not be difficult for experts to design a new type of boat
                        suited both to the old conditions which continue to exist, and to the new
                        conditions as well. The Egyptian lives in an atmosphere that preserves much
                        that is ancient, and a period of less than thirty years, during which the
                        canal and river bridge obstructions have been multiplying, is as a day in
                        any effect it can produce on the slow changing boatman of the Nile. Unless
                        the boatmen of today and yesterday change in time, they may see their
                        carrying business pass to the boatmen of tomorrow, more ready to adapt
                        themselves to a changing environment, according to the law that rules the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>There is in this connection an interesting instance of persistance of type in
                        the Fayoum, which in some respects may be considered an oasis cut off from
                        the rest of Egypt. Except for quite a narrow strip of land along which the
                        Bahr Yusuf flows, the province is entirely surrounded by desert. On that
                        edge of it which is most remote from the Nile Valley, is the Lake Kurun, the
                        persistent rudiment of the ancient Lake Mœris. On this lake the fishermen
                        use boats of a description that, it would seem, even a land-lubber could
                        improve upon. The development of naval architecture must have been arrested
                        on this lake a long time ago. The shape of the boats and their whole
                        equipment do not perhaps belong to pre-historic time, but they are not much
                        more modern. Even the ancient Egyptians used sails, but the lake boatmen of
                        the Fayoum do not, so perhaps we have here an example of reversion to a more
                        ancient type. The pressure of competition does not reach this out-of-the-way
                        pieoe of water to which the fishermen’s boats are confined, and no change of
                        type is likely to be seen until tourists, or tome other innovation, invade
                        this hitherto little visited corner of Egypt. But we must leave these
                        interesting questions to the study of the evolutionist, and get back to the
                        Delta canals.</p>
                    <p>The navigation route, which was intended to take the place of the Damietta
                        branch, was created by the construction of a new canal from the Barrage to
                        Benha, and of locks and regulators on existing canals north of Benha. The
                        new canal is called the Rayyah Tewfiki, and the canals forming its
                        continuation, the Sahel and Mansuria. The lock, connecting the canal with
                        the lower part of the river, is at Mansura, north of which town it was
                        expected that there would always be deep water. But this bas been proved by
                        later experience to be a mistake, as the permanent deep water, when the
                        Delta Barrage is tight closed, does not reach farther up the branch than
                        Sherbin, a village 16 miles (26 kms.) below Mansura. In a dry summer,
                        therefore, through navigation between Cairo and Damietta is interrupted by a
                        reach of shallow river between Mansura and Sherbin. No doubt this defect in
                        the navigation System will some day be remedied by adapting to navigation
                        the continuation of the Mansuria Canal—known as the Sahel-Fareskut—and
                        connecting it by a lock with the Nile at a point opposite or a little below
                        Sherbin. Until that be done, the substitute for the river route is a
                        defective one. As long, however, as there is sufficient water in the river
                        to float boats between Mansura and Sherbin—generally from August to March
                        inclusive—vessels of a size that can pass through a lock 54 1/2 m. long by 8
                        m. wide can use this route to carry goods between Cairo and Damietta, but
                        for the greater part of this time the river route is practicable and
                        preferable. The third through route, connecting Cairo with the sea, is by
                        way of the Ismailia Canal, by which boats can go from Cairo to Ismailia, and
                        thence by the Ship Canal to Port Said or Suez, or by the Sweet Water Canal
                        to Suez. The lower lock at Ismailia connecting with the Ship Canal is 37 1/2
                        m. long by 8 1/2 m. wide, and this limits the size of boats entering or
                        leaving the Ismailia Canal. Inside the canal the locks have a length of
                        37.95 m. and a width of 8 1/2 m. The locks on the Sweet Water Canal to Suez
                        have the same width of 8 1/2 m., and, with the exception of the tail lock at
                        Suez, a length of 36.20 m., but, as they are always open, the length of the
                        lock does not affect tho size of the traffic. There is, however, very little
                        traffic on this canal, as it has many shallows and much weed growth. The
                        tail lock communicating with the Gulf of Suez has a length of 89 1/4 m.
                        Boats, therefore, 37 m. long and 8 1/4 m. wide can go anywhere on the
                        Ismailia System of canals.</p>
                    <p>There is one other fine navigation line which is worthy of special mention,
                        that, namely, from the Delta Barrage to Rahbein through the Central Delta by
                        way of the Menufia-Shibin Canal. The limiting lock bas 39.20 m. length and 7
                        m. width. All the other locks but one have a width of 8 m. Some day, if the
                        boat traffic develops sufficiently, it may be considered worth while to
                        enlarge the 7 m. locks to a width of 8 m., or to build new ones to the
                        standard width. The Karanein Lock, which is one of tho narrow ones, has a
                        length of 21 m. only, but, being high up the canal, has generally both pairs
                        of gates fully open. Otherwise its length of 21 m. limits the size of
                        passing boats. Unless it is found unnecessary to use the regulator with
                        which this look is combined, it is evidently desirable to build a new look
                        to the standard size. The standard sizes of lock chamber adopted in the
                        Delta, as those to which future locks should be built, are as follows :—</p>

                    <p>(1) On tho Nile branches... 64 24 by 12 </p>
                    <p>(2) On the Nile from Assouan to Cairo ................ 80 by 16</p>
                    <p>(3) On main lines of canal navigation... ............. 55 by 8</p>
                    <p>(4) On secondary lines of canal navigation........... ... 85 by 8</p>
                    <p>(5) On feeder lines in the North of the Delta ... 27.75 by 6 </p>

                    <p>It is a matter for regret that standard dimensions were not laid down before
                        some of the comparatively modern locks were designed and built. The depth of
                        water in the canals varies considerably at different seasons, but not to
                        such an extent as the depth of the river varies. Generally speaking, a depth
                        of 2 m. can be relied upon on the main lines, with a minimum of 1 m. in
                        summer ; on the secondary lines perhaps rather less ; and on the feeder
                        lines from 1 1/2 m. to a bare metre.</p>
                    <p>On page 19 of Lord Cromer’s Report on Egypt and the Sudan in 1903 (Egypt, No.
                        1, 1904) tome interestlng figures are given to show the increase of
                        navigation in Egypt subsequent to the removal of tolls. Tolls were generally
                        suppressed from January 1st, 1901, and it is in this year that the increase
                        of navigation began in a decided manner. But as the Kasr-el-Nil Bridge tolls
                        were suppressed two years earlier, the returns for the year 1898 are used,
                        in the case of the Barrage, for purpose of comparison with 1903. In Egypt
                        the sizes of boats and their cages are reckoned in “ardebs.” an ardeb being
                        equal to 5.44 bushels. The inland waterborne traffic from and to Alexandria
                        is gauged at the Atfeh locks, through which boats pass in and out of the
                        Mahmudieh Canal. The figures given below are the sums of the number of boats
                        passing inwards and outwards, whether loaded or empty. The “ardebage" in the
                        case of the Atfeh locks I have not been able to ascertain :—</p>

                    <p>Year. Number of boats passing Atfeh locks.</p>

                        everywhere</p>

                    <p>The suppression of the tolls of Kasr-el-Nil Bridge had little effect, as the
                        payment at this bridge used to clear the Barrage, so that this first partial
                        suppression of tolls resulted in little more than payment being made at the
                        Barrage instead of at Kasr-el-Nil (Cairo, The numbers and ‘'ardebage” of
                        boats were not affected till after the general suppression of tolls. Still,
                        to exclude any possible effect that the first suppression may have had on
                        the Barrage figures, the year 1898 is selected for comparison with 1903.</p>
                    <p>The figures are as follow :— </p>

                    <p>Year. Number of boats passing river and canal locks at the Ardebs barrage up
                        and down.</p>
                    <p>1898 ............ 15,867 ........2,414,601</p>
                    <p>1903 ............ 37,880.........7,676,365</p>

                    <p>It will be seen that the effect of the removal of tolls has been
                        unmistakeable and immediate.</p>
