                    <p>THE CRISIS IN RUSSIA. </p>
                    <p>Nothing is more remarkable about the present crisis in Russia than the
                        closeness of the parallel between the course of events in that country and
                        that of the great prototype of the Russian movement—the French Revo­lution.
                        That the parallel lines may not be produced indefinitely mast be earnestly
                        hoped, even by those who believe the most firmly in the righteousness of the
                        popular cause and the pressing need of the substitution of the
                        constitutional for the autocratic system. So far, however, the analogy has
                        held good, and we have recently had a farther prolongation of the parallel.
                        The Deputies have done almost precisely what the States General did 1789,
                        that is to say that, having been excluded from their own House of
                        Parliament, they have adjourned to another, and Viborg, in Finland, has
                        supplied them with the Tennis Court of Versailles, whence they have issued a
                        manifesto to the Russian people which may possibly stand in history as a
                        landmark not less noteworthy than the ‘‘Ser- ment du Jeu de Paume.” The
                        essence of that manifesto is an appeal to the nation to refuse to recognise
                        the Imperial ukase dis­solving the Duma: ‘Russia must not re­main for a day
                        without popular representation." Without the assent of the popular
                        representa­tives, say the deputies, the Government has no right to collect
                        taxes or to call recruits to the colours. "Accordingly, until the popular
                        representatives are summoned, do not give a copeck to the Throne or a
                        soldier to the army." It has been semi officially declared that the
                        dissolution of the Duma "has not produced such an impression as the Press
                        had foretold," and the new Prime Minister has telegraphed to the Paris
                        "Matin" that "the Emperor is firmly and irrevocably determined to maintain
                        the regime of national representation." M. Stolypin mast have what the
                        readers of the “Matin" would probably call "an rude toupet" to say that Bat
                        that sort of thing is just official Russia all over make-believe, ham- bag,
                        sound and fury signifying nothing.</p>
                    <p>While it is utterly impossible to see any­thing ahead, through the darkness
                        of the gathering storm, one can only note the effect of events in Russia
                        upon public opinion outside. In London the dissolution of the Duma has been
                        effected simultaneously with the gathering of the Inter-Parliamentary Union
                        at Westminster, when the delegates were wel­comed by the Prime Minister, who
                        rightly crystallized his sentiments in an epigram, “La Duma est morte, Vive
                        la Duma: " It was a brilliant impromptu, and had, no doubt, been carefully
                        thought out beforehand, but we must confess that we always feel a little
                        nervous when a Liberal statesman assumes the part of the “mouton enrage."
                        Sir Henry and his col leagues are men of peace—very much so. At the same
                        time, one cannot forget the extra- ordinary propensity of the Liberal party
                        to make up for its habitual apathy where British inte­rests are in question
                        by an occasional excessive alertness where those of other nations are
                        concerned.</p>
                    <p>It is impossible to foresee in what com­plications the Russian crisis may not
                        involve certain Continental Powers, or what practical steps such Powers may
                        not feel compelled to take in their own real, or pretended, interests. It
                        is, therefore, eminently desirable that the British Government should
                        preserve an abso­lutely free band, walk warily, and not allow itself to be
                        morally committed to any line of action fraught with danger to the peace of
                        Europe. The present crisis is one in which it is peculiarly necessary to
                        keep a cool head, and to do nothing rashly. For, upon the events of the next
                        few months may depend the future, not of Russia alone, but of the whole of
                        that Europe of which Russia forms so large and so important a part. ("Pall

                        erected in the playground of the High School in the Missala quarter. There
                        was a very large gathering of the friends of the schools and of the pupils,
                        who seemed thoroughly to appreciate the varied items on the excellent
                        programme, composed of scenes and dialogues in English, French, and Arabic,

                        did great credit to the training of Mr. O. Stanley Heaton. Consul General

                    <p>MEX ASSAULT CASE. </p>
                    <p>TRlAL OF THE ACCUSED. </p>
                    <p>SEVERE SENTENCE.</p>
                    <p>The trial of the two natives accused of assaulting Private O'Brien, of the
                        Dublin Fusiliers, near Mex on the 21st nlto., began this morning at
                        Alexandria in the Attarin Native Court. The Bench consisted of Judges Ahmed
                        Bey Hilmi, Piesident of the Coart, Yoassef Bey Shawky, and Ahmed Bey Ziour.
                        The Chief of the Parquet was Mohamed Bey Mahfouz. A representative of the
                        Army of Occupation and Miralai Hopkinson Bey, Com¬mandant of the Alexandria
                        City Police, were present. The President commenced the proceedings by asking
                        the accused whether they had taken part in the assault. To this question
                        both replied in the negative. The Chief of the Parquet then read out the
                        indictment and gave a sum mary of the case wherein he showed that there was
                        a strong chain of evidence tending to prove that Mohamed Ismail Kotb and
                        Fayoumi Gabbari, the accused, were guilty of the crime imputed to them. He
                        concluded his speech by asking the Coart to pass an exemplary sentence on
                        the men as there was very clear evidence of their guilt. Private O’Brien
                        then related the circum¬stances of the assault, his statements being
                        interpreted to the Court. The donkey boy who accompanied O’Brien was
                        afterwards called and gave his version of the affair, at the same time
                        identifying the prisoners as the culprits. The advocate for the defence, Aly
                        Bey Assem, then rose and asked Private O’Brien, who was allowed to sit down
                        owing to the state of his health, whether he could account for all the money
                        which he had with him when he started on his journey from Alexan-dris.
                        Private O’Brien stated that he gave P.T. 2 to the cabman P T. 3 to the
                        donkey boy, and P.T. 3 to the native who helped him to the camp after he had
                        been attack¬ed. He started with P.T. 40 and arrived at the camp with P.T.
                        20, but he was quite unable to state how he had disposed of the rest of the
                        money. Counsel then went on to point out that, although the alleged outrage
                        had been perpetrated on Monday evening it was not until Tuesday evening at
                        10 o’clock that any intimation of the affray reached the caracol. Yet
                        Private O’Brien was quite able on Monday to give a ver ion of the assault to
                        Private Marvill (No. 3,706). In his statement he declared that the donkey
                        boy, prior to the assault, had addressed some remarks to the two natives who
                        were following him. This clearly showed that the donkey-boy, who might have
                        had a hand in the assault, had recognised some others. In regard to O’Brien,
                        he had declared to Blattner Bey, who translated his story, that he was
                        unable to recognise the men who had attacked him. There were no other
                        confirma¬tory witnesses and consequently the pro¬secution broke down on this
                        question of identification. Why did not the donkey boy return to the nearest
                        house and ask for help ? Probably the boy was particeps criminis and was
                        concealing the truth in order to shield some of his friends, who were the
                        actual perpetrators of the crime, O’Brien knew the donkey boy. When asked in
                        hospital by the Chief of the Parquet to identify the accused, who were
                        present by his bedside, he declared that one of them was the donkey boy, who
                        did not happen to be present. On another day the accused together with the
                        boy were con¬fronted with O’Brien at the hospital and he identified the
                        donkey boy and declared that the other two men were his aggressors. This
                        discrepancy shows that he was incapable of identifying his assailants.
                        Moreover, when the coffee-shop keeper at Mex was asked about the accused,
                        who were said by the donkey boy to have been at his cafe op that evening, he
                        said that he had not seen one of them for three months, as he was keeping
                        away because he owed him money. Kotb is in the service of the salt works and
                        counsel asked the authorities to enquire of this man’s Employers as to his
                        character. Kotb had willingly offered to be confronted with O’Brien together
                        with five other natives as he was so certain that O’Brien would not identify
                        him, but his offer was not enternained by the authorities. Counsel then
                        triod to show that O’Brien, who had received his pay, had lingered in the
                        city until 10 p.m. although he had been told to be back at 9 p.m. This point
                        was overruled by the Court as being not pertinent to the case, and counsel
                        was asked to refrain from this line of defense. The trial was concluded at
                        12.30 p.m , one of the accused, Kotb, being sentenced to 10 years’
                        imprisonment with hard labour and his accomplice to 7 years’ imprisonment
                        with hard labour. A full report of the trial will appear in to morrow’s
                        issue. </p>

                    <p>FRENCH IN EGYPT. CRITICISM OF ADMINISTRATION. </p>
                    <p>The following excerpt from a letter addres sed to “Le Journal” of Paris by
                        “Un groupe de Francis habitant l’Egypte” may be of interest to our readers,
                        who will notice that Judge Tuck is described below as an "English
                        functionary,” and that the British officials of the Auglo-Egyptian
                        Government are accused of a policy of opposition to French interests :— "We
                        cannot admit that Europeans can be judged by natives on criminal charges.
                        This may easily happen now that numbers of Egyp¬tians are trying to become
                        naturalised British subjects (sic). The majority of the judges will
                        certainly be English and the status of British subjects will certainly be
                        safeguarded, but how about the other Europeans ? We have no inten¬tion of
                        attacking England’s role in Egypt. On the contrary, we admire the
                        improvements she has made and we wish to see her continuing her civilising
                        work, but if France, by the con¬vention of 1904, renounced her secular
                        rights in Egypt, it does not follow that French interests should be
                        completely sacrificed. We are sincere partisans of the Entente Cordiale. but
                        this “entente” is only followed loyally at London. Abroad and in the
                        Colonies the British functionary, long since accustomed to oppose French
                        interests, cannot make up his mind tD become the friend of his old foes. We
                        have just had an example of this in the case of the Sucreries Company, in
                        which magistrate began by demanding that the company should be declared
                        bankrupt, only to contradict himself later by demanding of the Court a
                        “concordat judiciaire” on the same basis as that which he had declared
                        inad¬missible three months earlier. This is a strik-ing example of the
                        attitude of British func¬tionaries. "French interests in Egypt are most
                        con¬siderable. It is in France in which lie two- thirds of the Egyptian
                        Debt, nearly all the bonds of the Credit Foncier, and the shares and bonds
                        of the Saoreries and Raffineries. Numer¬ous deposits have been made daring
                        the last several years and the important landed interests are in French
                        hands. The total, at the least, is two milliards and a half, not including
                        the Suez Canal shares, of which a large number are owned by Franca. It is
                        these interests which a change in the regime would most seriously affect.
                        Moreover, we are opposed to any modification or suppression of the
                        Capitula¬tions, which would subject us entirely to the Egyptian Government.
                        Lord Cromer is at present in England ; it is probable that he will ask his
                        Government to call a conference. The interest of the conference would not
                        seem to be great for England, which is mistress of all the wheels of
                        Egyptian Administration. What Lord Cromer would seek is the personal
                        satis¬faction of making Egypt into a British Colony, and so crown his work.

                    <p>The efforts to recover the bodies of the five Italian seamen who perished in
                        the fishing boat disaster off the Abonkir coast a fortnight ago were finally
                        crowned with success yesterday. The boat in which the unfortunate men were
                        imprisoned was refloated, and it was thus possi¬ble to remove their bodies
                        from the wreck. Owing to their prolonged immersion the bodies were in a very
                        advanced state of de¬composition, and partly devoured by sharks. They were
                        at once conveyed to the Govern¬ment Hospital, where the legal formalities
                        were gone through previous to their burial, which will take place this

                    <p>THE LAW OF TRESPASS IN EGYPT. </p>
                    <p>In the House of Commons, Mr. Pickersgill asked the Secretary of State for
                        Foreign Affairs what was the outcome of the promise made by Lord Cromer in
                        1901, after the fracas near Cairo between British officers and the watchmen
                        of Mr. Wilfrid Blunt, that he would consult the legal advisers of the
                        Egyp¬tian Government as to the suggested strength¬ening of the law of
                        trespass in Egypt, so as to protect native cultivators from injury at the
                        hands of Europeans ; and whether any¬thing had been done in the premises.
                        Sir E. Grey replied : Lord Cromer consulted the legal advisers to the
                        Egyptian Government on his return to Cairo in 1901, and they were of opinion
                        that no change in the law was necessary or practicable. Nor is there reason
                        to believe that cases of trespass by Europeans are more common than cases of
                        trespass by natives. </p>
                    <p>A CASE FOR ENQUIRY. To THE EDITOR OF THE “EGYPTIAN GAZETTE,” Dear Sir,—I most
                        respectfully beg to inform you that on the evening of the 27th inst., whilst
                        taking my evening walk from the French Gates to Moss Berth, I stopped to
                        watch some native fishermen, 10 in number. Sud¬denly one in particular began
                        up braiding some British sailors belonging to the Moss boats, informing them
                        that in a year or two all Englishmen would be out up, and furthermore the
                        language used was outrageous and if only these men knew what was going on I
                        am afraid it would have ended very seriously. Police Guard No. 215 standing
                        by suggested not in two years but in two months all Christians would be cut
                        up. This looks very good for the Egypt at the same time. From Lord Cromer’s
                        Quays police, however such was the case, and I Report we learn that the
                        Government inspector hope this will be brought to his notice,—I had reported
                        favourably upon the working of am, etc., our railways and the advancement of

                    <p>THE EGYPTIAN DELTA LIGHT RAILWAYS, LIMITED'. ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING. </p>
                    <p>The annual general meeting of the Egyptian Delta Light Railways, Limited, was
                        held on the 24th inst. at Winchester House, Old Broad Street, London, E.C.,
                        Sir Auckland Colvin, K.C.S.I., K C.M.C., C.I.E. (Chairman of the company)
                        presiding. The Secretary (Mr. F. J, Horne) having read the notice convening
                        the meeting and the report of the auditors, the chairman said : I presume
                        yon will, as usual, take the re port and accoonts as read. They refer to a
                        period of half a year only, for which I pre pared yon at our last general
                        meeting in January last. This fact, and the inclusion of tbe Helouan line
                        (which, as I also then explained, kept its accounts previously in far less
                        detail than we did) makes it impossible to effect the usual comparisons with
                        the preceding corresponding period, but such as are practicable have been
                        given to you in our report, and will now be so by me. The gene¬ral position
                        is described by our agent in Egypt (Capt. Adams, R.E.) in a paragraph of his
                        report to the Board which I will read to yon : "The net receipts for both
                        the light lines and the Helouan branch are the best on re¬cord, being £6,901
                        and £5,432 respectively more than the corresponding previous half- year,
                        that is, the results are 25 % better, as the net receipts increased by 28 %
                        whilst the increase in open kilometrage was 3 %. It will be seen from the
                        analysis of working that the receipts and expenditure per kilometre per week
                        and per train kilometre, as compared with the previous year’s figures, are
                        very satisfactory, and the proportion of expenditure to receipts for the
                        whole system has it been reduced from 60 % to 55 %. I do not think better
                        results could have been hoped for, and it should be remembered that the
                        cotton crop, on which we depend for so much, was less than in the previous
                        year, and that wages and other expenses, throughout the country, have in the
                        last few years risen considerably.” I am sure you will regard this general
                        state¬ment as satisfactory, and it is completely borne out by an examination
                        of figures in our possession. If we take our light lines alone we find that
                        onr earnings improved by Dearly LE. 10,000 and the expenses increased by
                        rather less than L.E. 3,000 compared to the previous corresponding period.
                        It follows that there was corresponding improvement in the net result, in
                        the ratio of expenses to earnings, in the net receipts per kilometre open,
                        etc., while it is no less satisfactory to reoord that our earnings improved
                        under each main head of account. On the Helouan line our earnings increased
                        by over L E. 6,000, and our expen¬ses by less than L.E. 1,000, so on
                        analysis we get results even more satisfactory than on the Deltas proper,
                        but the records of the previous period were not sufficiently complete same
                        detail. Taking our passenger traffic we find an improvement in every class,
                        giving us receipts 12 1/2% better in the case of the Deltas, and 10% better
                        in that of the Helonan line than in the corresponding previous half year. In
                        our goods traffic there was a slight falling- off from the carriage of
                        cotton. We have no reason to regard this as likely to be permanent; on the
                        contrary, we look to increased areas being brought under cotton cultivation,
                        but it is satisfactory to note that, in spite of it, our earnings from oar
                        goods traffic have in¬creased by about 8%, principally doe to bigger
                        business in stone, so called manure, and fruit. The additional mileage
                        opened during the half- year was on the Atfeh Edfina line, in the north of
                        Egypt. We have commenced other extensions in the same part of the country
                        opening op new territory to us. Progress on all the exten¬sions, of our
                        light railways is going on satis¬factorily. On the Helonan line the
                        additions being made take the form of doubling part of the road and
                        providing necessary passenger coaches and goods wagons. During the half-year
                        under review we have placed upon this line four first-class bogie carriages
                        and twenty 15-ton stone wagons, which, I may say, have given entire
                        satisfaction. For our light lines we purchased the rolling stock of the
                        narrow-gauge line which previously existed between Port Said and Ismailia.
                        It became available owing to the extension of the Egyp¬tian State Railways
                        between these places on the standard guage, and we secured it on very
                        favourable terms. As affecting the final result to the company of the half
                        year’s working, I wish to remind you that the accounts we are dealing with
                        are for the best half of a fall year. On the other hand, our expenditure on
                        exten¬sions, mostly unproductive at present, will become productive daring
                        the course of this year. Altogether 564 miles of line were open to traffic
                        daring the six months. From this time we revert to accounts, etc, for the
                        full year, commencing at the 1st April and ter¬minating at 31st March. For
                        the current period the returns received from Egypt show that we have earned
                        £403 more than in the corresponding 14 weeks of last year. I am also glad to
                        say that there is a general expectation of what is called a good Nile this
                        season ; and that there is probability of business continuing brisk in
                        Egypt. On the other hand there has been some recrudescence of cattle plague.
                        Our lines were visited by Mr. F. E. Robertson, C.I.E., C.E., one of our
                        consulting engineers, in February last, and he was able to report favourably
                        on their condition, and that of the rolling stocks ~ Our managing director
                        visited I now wish to refer to what I will describe as the severance of the
                        connection between this company and the Egyptian Delta Land and Investment
                        Company. The Utter com¬pany was formed in April, 1904, under the auspices of
                        our railway company, its operations were confined to lands in the proximity
                        of our railways or their proposed extensions. Our company took up 10,000 of
                        the land company’s first issue of shares of one pound each at par, and a
                        similar number of its second issue at a premium of one pound per share,
                        i.e., at £2 per share. As a consequence the direction and management of the
                        land company was placed to a great extent in the hands of the directors and
                        officers of the railways. The land company found it desirable to alter its
                        memorandum of association and have its own management to attend to its
                        important business. Its capita] had grown to a quarter of a million, its
                        properties were scattered and required attention and development. We, of the
                        rail¬way company, had already been asked to very seriously consider whether
                        it was judicious to retain so large a holding in a land company which had
                        gone far beyond its original inten¬tions, and we farther felt that we could
                        not control advantageously the growing ope¬rations of the land company with
                        a joint common staff, and that on the whole we had no right to oppose the
                        reasonable wishes of that company. We were advised by our solicitors that it
                        would not be feasible to alter our own Memorandum of Association
                        sufficiently to enable us to hold shares in an independent land company,
                        although the monies for the purpose were derived from pre¬mium on shares,
                        and were consequently entirely at the disposal of the railway company. In
                        view of all these circumstances we decided very reluctantly to sell our
                        holdings in the land com¬pany and have done so at considerable profit which
                        has been and will be credited to Share Premium Account. In ceasing to be a
                        proprie tor the railway company put an end to such power of control over the
                        land company as it had previously possessed. Your agent and general manager
                        has now again, as his sole duty, to attend to the affairs of oar railways.
                        The services of your former chief engineer (Mr. Peacok) have been placed at
                        the disposal of the land company, for employment as their mana ger. In
                        conclusion I have to refer with the deepest regret to the sad death of Mr.
                        H. Turton Norton the senior of our firm of Solicitors. His assistance was
                        invaluable to as in many difficult questions, and his loss to as is indeed
                        great. THE CHAIRMAN: I now move that the report Of the directors dated 3rd
                        July, 1906, together with the audited statement of accounts and balance
                        sheet for the year ended 31st March, 1906, be and they are hereby approved,
                        con¬firmed, and adopted. This was seconded by Sir Chas. Wm. Fremantle. THE
                        CHAIRMAN: I now move that a dividend ait the rate of 5 % per annum for the
                        half year ended 31st March, 1906, on the preference share capital of the
                        company be and hereby is declared to be paid to the shareholders of the
                        preference shares standing on the registers of the company at 23rd July,
                        1906, and to the holders of preference share warrants to bearer. This being
                        seconded by Mr. Robert Miller and carried the chairman moved that Sir
                        Francis L. O’Callaghan (one of the directors retiring by rotation) be re
                        elected. This was seconded by Mr. Montaga Sharp. Mr. P. W. Carver and Mr. W.
                        Pelizaena (two of the retiring directors) were then re¬elected. THE CHAIRMAN
                        :—Gentlemen, in the report the firm of Messrs. Frank Davies, Meredith and
                        Co. is mentioned as the auditors of the com¬pany offering themselves for
                        re-election. Since the report was issued, that firm has dissolved
                        partnership and the directors recommend that the firm of Messrs. Meredith
                        and Co. be elected, Mr. Meredith, the head of that firm, having undertaken
                        the personal supervision of the company’s accounts since its inception. The
                        necessary resolution being moved and seconded , this concluded the business
                        of the meeting. </p>
                    <p>NEW ABBAS THEATRE, CAIRO. DELLA TERRA ALLA LUNA. </p>
                    <p>The representation of Della Terra alia Luna by the Lombardo operetta company
                        at the New Abbas Theatre, Cairo, leaves so little to be desired that it has
                        been given on three suc¬cessive evenings, of which Friday was the first,
                        before large houses, which on each occasion received it very well. Such a
                        play is, of course an occasion for exceptional spectacular display, and in
                        this Lombardo’s company seems to excel. The plot is known to all and was
                        well carried out, while it is sufficient to say that the music is by
                        Offenbach to convey the idea that it is bright and attractive throughout.
                        The play contains twenty scenes divided into three acts, and the staging of
                        all these was as perfect as we have seen in Cairo. The prin¬cipal characters
                        were also very well given, without exception, and the thorns was dis¬tinctly
                        less harsh and more evenly balanced than is the case usually. Both Signora
                        Baldi and Signora Montis represented the parts of Fantasia and Carpaccio
                        excellently, and Re When by Signor Pirracini and Misorospio by Signor Urbano
                        left nothing to be desired. In fact in all the pieces in which these four
                        artistes have appeared they have been seen to advantage and they are
                        thoroughly deser¬ving of the applause which their appearance invokes. The

                    <p>A very successful Gymkhana was held on Saturday last on the grounds of the A.
                        S. C. The attendance, which included H. H. Prince Omar Tonssonn, Mr. and
                        Mrs. Gould, etc., was necessarily not large at this time of the year, but
                        the entries were good and the competi¬tions keenly contested. The band of
                        the Royal Dublin Fusiliers, by kind permission of Lt.- Col. Chapman and the
                        officers, contributed to the success of the afternoon with a pleasing
                        selection of music. The following were the events :— TENT PEGGING.—3 runs. 2
                        points for a hit, 3 for a draw, and 4 for a carry of 20 yards. Com¬petitors
                        must gallop and not drop their lance until within a length of peg. There
                        were ten competitors for this event and some good form was shown. The judges
                        had not, however, any difficulty in awarding the prize to Captain Wilkins,
                        who bad come down from Cairo to take part in the Gymkhana. The winner took
                        all three pegs in finished style and we do not remember to have ever seen a
                        better display of tent pegging at Alex¬andria than he gave. Amongst others
                        who did well were Captain Jeffreys, Mr. Eiken, and Mr. E. A. Beuachi.
                        TROTTING RACE.—For Arabs. To be ridden from Grand Stand round flag and back
                        to winning post. Any horse breaking must pull up and turn round on the spot
                        where be broke. Distance 3 furlongs. A large field started for this race and
                        the lead was soon taken by Mr. J. E. Corniah, who maintained it till well
                        after the turning flag, when unfortunately his pony broke and he had to turn
                        round; Mr. Smithwick then assumed the lead and was never caught, though Col.
                        Chapman might have made a near thing of it if his pony had not broken in the
                        run in. POTATO AND BUCKET COMPETITION. - Each competitor to ride at fall
                        gallop and drop a potato into each of three buckets placed at intervals.
                        Three runs. Any competitor not riding at full gallop will be disqualified.
                        The number of competitors reached its maximum in this event, as many as 22
                        taking part. The first to try his hand was Captain Jeffreys, who took all
                        three buckets in good style, bat he was unable to keep up the aver¬age and
                        the eventual winner was found in Mr. Jenkinson, who made a possible on each
                        of his last two runs. If we mistake not this is not the first time Mr.
                        Jenkinson has taken this particular event on the A.S.C.grounds. Others who
                        did well were Mr. Eiken and Mr. Stuart. WHISTLING COON RACE.—Gentleman to
                        run 60 yards, whistle tune to lady, who must write the name of the tune on
                        paper, and hand the paper to the gentleman. The latter, whose pony will be
                        held by the sais, will ride round a post to the winning post. The first in
                        with the correct answer wins. This race afforded very considerable
                        amuse¬ment, the efforts of the men after their brisk race on foot up the
                        course to whistle the tones set them being very diverting. Mr. Macaulay was
                        the first to get from his lady the written answer and was never caught, bat
                        alas! the tune turned out to be other than had struck the ear and the
                        winning lady was Mrs. Douglas Allen, for whom her husband whistled and rode
                        away. BENDING RACE.—Competitors to ride their ponies in and out a row of
                        flags, turning round the end one and returning the same way. Heats of 3.
                        From a spectator’s point of view this was probably the most interesting
                        event of the day. The race was run in heats, and the winners of the
                        preliminary heats were Mr. Eiken, Capt. Crawley, and Ibrahim Bey Cherif; Mr.
                        Logan, Capt. Wilkins and Capt. Jeffreys. The semi-finals resulted in Capt.
                        Crawley and Capt. Jeffreys being left in to contest the final. In this Capt.
                        Jeffreys, who bad all through shown the best form and looked like winning
                        easily, unfortunately fouled one of the posts, and being, in consequence
                        dis¬qualified, left Capt. Crawley to come in a winner at his leisure. It
                        seemed to us that several of the competitors would have done better to have
                        taken the race at a slower but surer pace, as the disqualifications were
                        numerous. POLO BALL RACE.—Round a selected course. The last race was rather
                        tedious for the onlookers, as it took the riders some time getting round the
                        coarse, down the polo ground, and up the straight to the goal. The
                        irrigation canal and training track had their fair share of attention and
                        proved as effi¬cient bankers as they are accustomed to do at golf. The
                        winners of the preliminary heats were Capt. Wilkinson, Mr. Stuart Mr. Eiken,
                        and Mr. Jenkinson. The final produced an excellent finish, Captain Wilkinson
                        only just securing the goal from Mr. Jenkinson. At the conclusion of the
                        races Mrs. Gould very kindly gave away the prizes to the winners. </p>
