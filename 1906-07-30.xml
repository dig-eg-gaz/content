                        <p>THE CRISIS IN RUSSIA. </p>
                        <p>Nothing is more remarkable about the present crisis in Russia than the
                            closeness of the parallel between the course of events in that country
                            and that of the great prototype of the Russian movement—the French
                            Revo­lution. That the parallel lines may not be produced indefinitely
                            must be earnestly hoped, even by those who believe the most firmly in
                            the righteousness of the popular cause and the pressing need of the
                            substitution of the constitutional for the autocratic system. So far,
                            however, the analogy has held good, and we have recently had a farther
                            prolongation of the parallel. The Deputies have done almost precisely
                            what the States General did 1789, that is to say that, having been
                            excluded from their own House of Parliament, they have adjourned to
                            another, and Viborg, in Finland, has supplied them with the Tennis Court
                            of Versailles, whence they have issued a manifesto to the Russian people
                            which may possibly stand in history as a landmark not less noteworthy
                            than the ‘‘Ser- ment du Jeu de Paume.” The essence of that manifesto is
                            an appeal to the nation to refuse to recognise the Imperial ukase
                            dis­solving the Duma: ‘Russia must not re­main for a day without popular
                            representation." Without the assent of the popular representa­tives, say
                            the deputies, the Government has no right to collect taxes or to call
                            recruits to the colours. "Accordingly, until the popular representatives
                            are summoned, do not give a copeck to the Throne or a soldier to the
                            army." It has been semi officially declared that the dissolution of the
                            Duma "has not produced such an impression as the Press had foretold,"
                            and the new Prime Minister has telegraphed to the Paris "Matin" that
                            "the Emperor is firmly and irrevocably determined to maintain the regime
                            of national representation." M. Stolypin mast have what the readers of
                            the “Matin" would probably call "an rude toupet" to say that Bat that
                            sort of thing is just official Russia all over make-believe, ham- bag,
                            sound and fury signifying nothing.</p>
                        <p>While it is utterly impossible to see any­thing ahead, through the
                            darkness of the gathering storm, one can only note the effect of events
                            in Russia upon public opinion outside. In London the dissolution of the
                            Duma has been effected simultaneously with the gathering of the
                            Inter-Parliamentary Union at Westminster, when the delegates were
                            wel­comed by the Prime Minister, who rightly crystallized his sentiments
                            in an epigram, “La Duma est morte, Vive la Duma: " It was a brilliant
                            impromptu, and had, no doubt, been carefully thought out beforehand, but
                            we must confess that we always feel a little nervous when a Liberal
                            statesman assumes the part of the “mouton enrage." Sir Henry and his col
                            leagues are men of peace—very much so. At the same time, one cannot
                            forget the extra- ordinary propensity of the Liberal party to make up
                            for its habitual apathy where British inte­rests are in question by an
                            occasional excessive alertness where those of other nations are
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>It is impossible to foresee in what com­plications the Russian crisis may
                            not involve certain Continental Powers, or what practical steps such
                            Powers may not feel compelled to take in their own real, or pretended,
                            interests. It is, therefore, eminently desirable that the British
                            Government should preserve an abso­lutely free band, walk warily, and
                            not allow itself to be morally committed to any line of action fraught
                            with danger to the peace of Europe. The present crisis is one in which
                            it is peculiarly necessary to keep a cool head, and to do nothing
                            rashly. For, upon the events of the next few months may depend the
                            future, not of Russia alone, but of the whole of that Europe of which
                            Russia forms so large and so important a part. ("Pall Mall

                            which was erected in the playground of the High School in the Missala
                            quarter. There was a very large gathering of the friends of the schools
                            and of the pupils, who seemed thoroughly to appreciate the varied items
                            on the excellent programme, composed of scenes and dialogues in English,
                            French, and Arabic, the whole concluding with a musical sketch sung by

                            in French and English, showed most careful training on the part of the

                        <p>SEVERE SENTENCE.</p>
                        <p>The trial of the two natives accused of assaulting Private O'Brien, of
                            the Dublin Fusiliers, near Mex on the 21st nlto., began this morning at
                            Alexandria in the Attarin Native Court. The Bench consisted of Judges
                            Ahmed Bey Hilmi, Piesident of the Coart, Yoassef Bey Shawky, and Ahmed
                            Bey Ziour. The Chief of the Parquet was Mohamed Bey Mahfouz. A
                            representative of the Army of Occupation and Miralai Hopkinson Bey,
                            Com¬mandant of the Alexandria City Police, were present. The President
                            commenced the proceedings by asking the accused whether they had taken
                            part in the assault. To this question both replied in the negative. The
                            Chief of the Parquet then read out the indictment and gave a sum mary of
                            the case wherein he showed that there was a strong chain of evidence
                            tending to prove that Mohamed Ismail Kotb and Fayoumi Gabbari, the
                            accused, were guilty of the crime imputed to them. He concluded his
                            speech by asking the Coart to pass an exemplary sentence on the men as
                            there was very clear evidence of their guilt. Private O’Brien then
                            related the circum¬stances of the assault, his statements being
                            interpreted to the Court. The donkey boy who accompanied O’Brien was
                            afterwards called and gave his version of the affair, at the same time
                            identifying the prisoners as the culprits. The advocate for the defence,
                            Aly Bey Assem, then rose and asked Private O’Brien, who was allowed to
                            sit down owing to the state of his health, whether he could account for
                            all the money which he had with him when he started on his journey from
                            Alexan-dris. Private O’Brien stated that he gave P.T. 2 to the cabman P
                            T. 3 to the donkey boy, and P.T. 3 to the native who helped him to the
                            camp after he had been attack¬ed. He started with P.T. 40 and arrived at
                            the camp with P.T. 20, but he was quite unable to state how he had
                            disposed of the rest of the money. Counsel then went on to point out
                            that, although the alleged outrage had been perpetrated on Monday
                            evening it was not until Tuesday evening at 10 o’clock that any
                            intimation of the affray reached the caracol. Yet Private O’Brien was
                            quite able on Monday to give a ver ion of the assault to Private Marvill
                            (No. 3,706). In his statement he declared that the donkey boy, prior to
                            the assault, had addressed some remarks to the two natives who were
                            following him. This clearly showed that the donkey-boy, who might have
                            had a hand in the assault, had recognised some others. In regard to
                            O’Brien, he had declared to Blattner Bey, who translated his story, that
                            he was unable to recognise the men who had attacked him. There were no
                            other confirma¬tory witnesses and consequently the pro¬secution broke
                            down on this question of identification. Why did not the donkey boy
                            return to the nearest house and ask for help ? Probably the boy was
                            particeps criminis and was concealing the truth in order to shield some
                            of his friends, who were the actual perpetrators of the crime, O’Brien
                            knew the donkey boy. When asked in hospital by the Chief of the Parquet
                            to identify the accused, who were present by his bedside, he declared
                            that one of them was the donkey boy, who did not happen to be present.
                            On another day the accused together with the boy were con¬fronted with
                            O’Brien at the hospital and he identified the donkey boy and declared
                            that the other two men were his aggressors. This discrepancy shows that
                            he was incapable of identifying his assailants. Moreover, when the
                            coffee-shop keeper at Mex was asked about the accused, who were said by
                            the donkey boy to have been at his cafe op that evening, he said that he
                            had not seen one of them for three months, as he was keeping away
                            because he owed him money. Kotb is in the service of the salt works and
                            counsel asked the authorities to enquire of this man’s Employers as to
                            his character. Kotb had willingly offered to be confronted with O’Brien
                            together with five other natives as he was so certain that O’Brien would
                            not identify him, but his offer was not enternained by the authorities.
                            Counsel then triod to show that O’Brien, who had received his pay, had
                            lingered in the city until 10 p.m. although he had been told to be back
                            at 9 p.m. This point was overruled by the Court as being not pertinent
                            to the case, and counsel was asked to refrain from this line of defense.
                            The trial was concluded at 12.30 p.m , one of the accused, Kotb, being
                            sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment with hard labour and his accomplice
                            to 7 years’ imprisonment with hard labour. A full report of the trial
                            will appear in to morrow’s issue. </p>

                        <p>FRENCH IN EGYPT. CRITICISM OF ADMINISTRATION. </p>
                        <p>The following excerpt from a letter addres sed to “Le Journal” of Paris
                            by “Un groupe de Francis habitant l’Egypte” may be of interest to our
                            readers, who will notice that Judge Tuck is described below as an
                            "English functionary,” and that the British officials of the
                            Auglo-Egyptian Government are accused of a policy of opposition to
                            French interests :— "We cannot admit that Europeans can be judged by
                            natives on criminal charges. This may easily happen now that numbers of
                            Egyp¬tians are trying to become naturalised British subjects (sic). The
                            majority of the judges will certainly be English and the status of
                            British subjects will certainly be safeguarded, but how about the other
                            Europeans ? We have no inten¬tion of attacking England’s role in Egypt.
                            On the contrary, we admire the improvements she has made and we wish to
                            see her continuing her civilising work, but if France, by the
                            con¬vention of 1904, renounced her secular rights in Egypt, it does not
                            follow that French interests should be completely sacrificed. We are
                            sincere partisans of the Entente Cordiale. but this “entente” is only
                            followed loyally at London. Abroad and in the Colonies the British
                            functionary, long since accustomed to oppose French interests, cannot
                            make up his mind tD become the friend of his old foes. We have just had
                            an example of this in the case of the Sucreries Company, in which
                            magistrate began by demanding that the company should be declared
                            bankrupt, only to contradict himself later by demanding of the Court a
                            “concordat judiciaire” on the same basis as that which he had declared
                            inad¬missible three months earlier. This is a strik-ing example of the
                            attitude of British func¬tionaries. "French interests in Egypt are most
                            con¬siderable. It is in France in which lie two- thirds of the Egyptian
                            Debt, nearly all the bonds of the Credit Foncier, and the shares and
                            bonds of the Saoreries and Raffineries. Numer¬ous deposits have been
                            made daring the last several years and the important landed interests
                            are in French hands. The total, at the least, is two milliards and a
                            half, not including the Suez Canal shares, of which a large number are
                            owned by Franca. It is these interests which a change in the regime
                            would most seriously affect. Moreover, we are opposed to any
                            modification or suppression of the Capitula¬tions, which would subject
                            us entirely to the Egyptian Government. Lord Cromer is at present in
                            England ; it is probable that he will ask his Government to call a
                            conference. The interest of the conference would not seem to be great
                            for England, which is mistress of all the wheels of Egyptian
                            Administration. What Lord Cromer would seek is the personal
                            satis¬faction of making Egypt into a British Colony, and so crown his
                            work. "We count upon the vigilance of the French </p>

                        <p>FISHING BOAT DISASTER </p>
                        <p>The efforts to recover the bodies of the five Italian seamen who perished
                            in the fishing boat disaster off the Abonkir coast a fortnight ago were
                            finally crowned with success yesterday. The boat in which the
                            unfortunate men were imprisoned was refloated, and it was thus possi¬ble
                            to remove their bodies from the wreck. Owing to their prolonged
                            immersion the bodies were in a very advanced state of de¬composition,
                            and partly devoured by sharks. They were at once conveyed to the
                            Govern¬ment Hospital, where the legal formalities were gone through
                            previous to their burial, which will take place this afternoon. </p>
                        <p>THE LAW OF TRESPASS IN EGYPT. </p>
                        <p>In the House of Commons, Mr. Pickersgill asked the Secretary of State for
                            Foreign Affairs what was the outcome of the promise made by Lord Cromer
                            in 1901, after the fracas near Cairo between British officers and the
                            watchmen of Mr. Wilfrid Blunt, that he would consult the legal advisers
                            of the Egyp¬tian Government as to the suggested strength¬ening of the
                            law of trespass in Egypt, so as to protect native cultivators from
                            injury at the hands of Europeans ; and whether any¬thing had been done
                            in the premises. Sir E. Grey replied : Lord Cromer consulted the legal
                            advisers to the Egyptian Government on his return to Cairo in 1901, and
                            they were of opinion that no change in the law was necessary or
                            practicable. Nor is there reason to believe that cases of trespass by
                            Europeans are more common than cases of trespass by natives. </p>
                        <p>A CASE FOR ENQUIRY. To THE EDITOR OF THE “EGYPTIAN GAZETTE,” Dear Sir,—I
                            most respectfully beg to inform you that on the evening of the 27th
                            inst., whilst taking my evening walk from the French Gates to Moss
                            Berth, I stopped to watch some native fishermen, 10 in number. Sud¬denly
                            one in particular began up braiding some British sailors belonging to
                            the Moss boats, informing them that in a year or two all Englishmen
                            would be out up, and furthermore the language used was outrageous and if
                            only these men knew what was going on I am afraid it would have ended
                            very seriously. Police Guard No. 215 standing by suggested not in two
                            years but in two months all Christians would be cut up. This looks very
                            good for the Egypt at the same time. From Lord Cromer’s Quays police,
                            however such was the case, and I Report we learn that the Government
                            inspector hope this will be brought to his notice,—I had reported

                        <p>The annual general meeting of the Egyptian Delta Light Railways, Limited,
                            was held on the 24th inst. at Winchester House, Old Broad Street,
                            London, E.C., Sir Auckland Colvin, K.C.S.I., K C.M.C., C.I.E. (Chairman
                            of the company) presiding. The Secretary (Mr. F. J, Horne) having read
                            the notice convening the meeting and the report of the auditors, the
                            chairman said : I presume yon will, as usual, take the re port and
                            accoonts as read. They refer to a period of half a year only, for which
                            I pre pared yon at our last general meeting in January last. This fact,
                            and the inclusion of tbe Helouan line (which, as I also then explained,
                            kept its accounts previously in far less detail than we did) makes it
                            impossible to effect the usual comparisons with the preceding
                            corresponding period, but such as are practicable have been given to you
                            in our report, and will now be so by me. The gene¬ral position is
                            described by our agent in Egypt (Capt. Adams, R.E.) in a paragraph of
                            his report to the Board which I will read to yon : "The net receipts for
                            both the light lines and the Helouan branch are the best on re¬cord,
                            being £6,901 and £5,432 respectively more than the corresponding
                            previous half- year, that is, the results are 25 % better, as the net
                            receipts increased by 28 % whilst the increase in open kilometrage was 3
                            %. It will be seen from the analysis of working that the receipts and
                            expenditure per kilometre per week and per train kilometre, as compared
                            with the previous year’s figures, are very satisfactory, and the
                            proportion of expenditure to receipts for the whole system has it been
                            reduced from 60 % to 55 %. I do not think better results could have been
                            hoped for, and it should be remembered that the cotton crop, on which we
                            depend for so much, was less than in the previous year, and that wages
                            and other expenses, throughout the country, have in the last few years
                            risen considerably.” I am sure you will regard this general state¬ment
                            as satisfactory, and it is completely borne out by an examination of
                            figures in our possession. If we take our light lines alone we find that
                            onr earnings improved by Dearly LE. 10,000 and the expenses increased by
                            rather less than L.E. 3,000 compared to the previous corresponding
                            period. It follows that there was corresponding improvement in the net
                            result, in the ratio of expenses to earnings, in the net receipts per
                            kilometre open, etc., while it is no less satisfactory to reoord that
                            our earnings improved under each main head of account. On the Helouan
                            line our earnings increased by over L E. 6,000, and our expen¬ses by
                            less than L.E. 1,000, so on analysis we get results even more
                            satisfactory than on the Deltas proper, but the records of the previous
                            period were not sufficiently complete same detail. Taking our passenger
                            traffic we find an improvement in every class, giving us receipts 12
                            1/2% better in the case of the Deltas, and 10% better in that of the
                            Helonan line than in the corresponding previous half year. In our goods
                            traffic there was a slight falling- off from the carriage of cotton. We
                            have no reason to regard this as likely to be permanent; on the
                            contrary, we look to increased areas being brought under cotton
                            cultivation, but it is satisfactory to note that, in spite of it, our
                            earnings from oar goods traffic have in¬creased by about 8%, principally
                            doe to bigger business in stone, so called manure, and fruit. The
                            additional mileage opened during the half- year was on the Atfeh Edfina
                            line, in the north of Egypt. We have commenced other extensions in the
                            same part of the country opening op new territory to us. Progress on all
                            the exten¬sions, of our light railways is going on satis¬factorily. On
                            the Helonan line the additions being made take the form of doubling part
                            of the road and providing necessary passenger coaches and goods wagons.
                            During the half-year under review we have placed upon this line four
                            first-class bogie carriages and twenty 15-ton stone wagons, which, I may
                            say, have given entire satisfaction. For our light lines we purchased
                            the rolling stock of the narrow-gauge line which previously existed
                            between Port Said and Ismailia. It became available owing to the
                            extension of the Egyp¬tian State Railways between these places on the
                            standard guage, and we secured it on very favourable terms. As affecting
                            the final result to the company of the half year’s working, I wish to
                            remind you that the accounts we are dealing with are for the best half
                            of a fall year. On the other hand, our expenditure on exten¬sions,
                            mostly unproductive at present, will become productive daring the course
                            of this year. Altogether 564 miles of line were open to traffic daring
                            the six months. From this time we revert to accounts, etc, for the full
                            year, commencing at the 1st April and ter¬minating at 31st March. For
                            the current period the returns received from Egypt show that we have
                            earned £403 more than in the corresponding 14 weeks of last year. I am
                            also glad to say that there is a general expectation of what is called a
                            good Nile this season ; and that there is probability of business
                            continuing brisk in Egypt. On the other hand there has been some
                            recrudescence of cattle plague. Our lines were visited by Mr. F. E.
                            Robertson, C.I.E., C.E., one of our consulting engineers, in February
                            last, and he was able to report favourably on their condition, and that
                            of the rolling stocks ~ Our managing director visited I now wish to
                            refer to what I will describe as the severance of the connection between
                            this company and the Egyptian Delta Land and Investment Company. The
                            Utter com¬pany was formed in April, 1904, under the auspices of our
                            railway company, its operations were confined to lands in the proximity
                            of our railways or their proposed extensions. Our company took up 10,000
                            of the land company’s first issue of shares of one pound each at par,
                            and a similar number of its second issue at a premium of one pound per
                            share, i.e., at £2 per share. As a consequence the direction and
                            management of the land company was placed to a great extent in the hands
                            of the directors and officers of the railways. The land company found it
                            desirable to alter its memorandum of association and have its own
                            management to attend to its important business. Its capita] had grown to
                            a quarter of a million, its properties were scattered and required
                            attention and development. We, of the rail¬way company, had already been
                            asked to very seriously consider whether it was judicious to retain so
                            large a holding in a land company which had gone far beyond its original
                            inten¬tions, and we farther felt that we could not control
                            advantageously the growing ope¬rations of the land company with a joint
                            common staff, and that on the whole we had no right to oppose the
                            reasonable wishes of that company. We were advised by our solicitors
                            that it would not be feasible to alter our own Memorandum of Association
                            sufficiently to enable us to hold shares in an independent land company,
                            although the monies for the purpose were derived from pre¬mium on
                            shares, and were consequently entirely at the disposal of the railway
                            company. In view of all these circumstances we decided very reluctantly
                            to sell our holdings in the land com¬pany and have done so at
                            considerable profit which has been and will be credited to Share Premium
                            Account. In ceasing to be a proprie tor the railway company put an end
                            to such power of control over the land company as it had previously
                            possessed. Your agent and general manager has now again, as his sole
                            duty, to attend to the affairs of oar railways. The services of your
                            former chief engineer (Mr. Peacok) have been placed at the disposal of
                            the land company, for employment as their mana ger. In conclusion I have
                            to refer with the deepest regret to the sad death of Mr. H. Turton
                            Norton the senior of our firm of Solicitors. His assistance was
                            invaluable to as in many difficult questions, and his loss to as is
                            indeed great. THE CHAIRMAN: I now move that the report Of the directors
                            dated 3rd July, 1906, together with the audited statement of accounts
                            and balance sheet for the year ended 31st March, 1906, be and they are
                            hereby approved, con¬firmed, and adopted. This was seconded by Sir Chas.
                            Wm. Fremantle. THE CHAIRMAN: I now move that a dividend ait the rate of
                            5 % per annum for the half year ended 31st March, 1906, on the
                            preference share capital of the company be and hereby is declared to be
                            paid to the shareholders of the preference shares standing on the
                            registers of the company at 23rd July, 1906, and to the holders of
                            preference share warrants to bearer. This being seconded by Mr. Robert
                            Miller and carried the chairman moved that Sir Francis L. O’Callaghan
                            (one of the directors retiring by rotation) be re elected. This was
                            seconded by Mr. Montaga Sharp. Mr. P. W. Carver and Mr. W. Pelizaena
                            (two of the retiring directors) were then re¬elected. THE CHAIRMAN
                            :—Gentlemen, in the report the firm of Messrs. Frank Davies, Meredith
                            and Co. is mentioned as the auditors of the com¬pany offering themselves
                            for re-election. Since the report was issued, that firm has dissolved
                            partnership and the directors recommend that the firm of Messrs.
                            Meredith and Co. be elected, Mr. Meredith, the head of that firm, having
                            undertaken the personal supervision of the company’s accounts since its
                            inception. The necessary resolution being moved and seconded , this
                            concluded the business of the meeting. </p>

                        <p>NEW ABBAS THEATRE, CAIRO. DELLA TERRA ALLA LUNA. </p>
                        <p>The representation of Della Terra alia Luna by the Lombardo operetta
                            company at the New Abbas Theatre, Cairo, leaves so little to be desired
                            that it has been given on three suc¬cessive evenings, of which Friday
                            was the first, before large houses, which on each occasion received it
                            very well. Such a play is, of course an occasion for exceptional
                            spectacular display, and in this Lombardo’s company seems to excel. The
                            plot is known to all and was well carried out, while it is sufficient to
                            say that the music is by Offenbach to convey the idea that it is bright
                            and attractive throughout. The play contains twenty scenes divided into
                            three acts, and the staging of all these was as perfect as we have seen
                            in Cairo. The prin¬cipal characters were also very well given, without
                            exception, and the thorns was dis¬tinctly less harsh and more evenly
                            balanced than is the case usually. Both Signora Baldi and Signora Montis
                            represented the parts of Fantasia and Carpaccio excellently, and Re When
                            by Signor Pirracini and Misorospio by Signor Urbano left nothing to be
                            desired. In fact in all the pieces in which these four artistes have
                            appeared they have been seen to advantage and they are thoroughly
                            deser¬ving of the applause which their appearance invokes. The dances in

                        <p>SPORT AND PLAY. ALEXANDRIA SPORTING CLUB GYMKHANA. </p>
                        <p>A very successful Gymkhana was held on Saturday last on the grounds of
                            the A. S. C. The attendance, which included H. H. Prince Omar Tonssonn,
                            Mr. and Mrs. Gould, etc., was necessarily not large at this time of the
                            year, but the entries were good and the competi¬tions keenly contested.
                            The band of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers, by kind permission of Lt.- Col.
                            Chapman and the officers, contributed to the success of the afternoon
                            with a pleasing selection of music. The following were the events :—
                            TENT PEGGING.—3 runs. 2 points for a hit, 3 for a draw, and 4 for a
                            carry of 20 yards. Com¬petitors must gallop and not drop their lance
                            until within a length of peg. There were ten competitors for this event
                            and some good form was shown. The judges had not, however, any
                            difficulty in awarding the prize to Captain Wilkins, who bad come down
                            from Cairo to take part in the Gymkhana. The winner took all three pegs
                            in finished style and we do not remember to have ever seen a better
                            display of tent pegging at Alex¬andria than he gave. Amongst others who
                            did well were Captain Jeffreys, Mr. Eiken, and Mr. E. A. Beuachi.
                            TROTTING RACE.—For Arabs. To be ridden from Grand Stand round flag and
                            back to winning post. Any horse breaking must pull up and turn round on
                            the spot where be broke. Distance 3 furlongs. A large field started for
                            this race and the lead was soon taken by Mr. J. E. Corniah, who
                            maintained it till well after the turning flag, when unfortunately his
                            pony broke and he had to turn round; Mr. Smithwick then assumed the lead
                            and was never caught, though Col. Chapman might have made a near thing
                            of it if his pony had not broken in the run in. POTATO AND BUCKET
                            COMPETITION. - Each competitor to ride at fall gallop and drop a potato
                            into each of three buckets placed at intervals. Three runs. Any
                            competitor not riding at full gallop will be disqualified. The number of
                            competitors reached its maximum in this event, as many as 22 taking
                            part. The first to try his hand was Captain Jeffreys, who took all three
                            buckets in good style, bat he was unable to keep up the aver¬age and the
                            eventual winner was found in Mr. Jenkinson, who made a possible on each
                            of his last two runs. If we mistake not this is not the first time Mr.
                            Jenkinson has taken this particular event on the A.S.C.grounds. Others
                            who did well were Mr. Eiken and Mr. Stuart. WHISTLING COON
                            RACE.—Gentleman to run 60 yards, whistle tune to lady, who must write
                            the name of the tune on paper, and hand the paper to the gentleman. The
                            latter, whose pony will be held by the sais, will ride round a post to
                            the winning post. The first in with the correct answer wins. This race
                            afforded very considerable amuse¬ment, the efforts of the men after
                            their brisk race on foot up the course to whistle the tones set them
                            being very diverting. Mr. Macaulay was the first to get from his lady
                            the written answer and was never caught, bat alas! the tune turned out
                            to be other than had struck the ear and the winning lady was Mrs.
                            Douglas Allen, for whom her husband whistled and rode away. BENDING
                            RACE.—Competitors to ride their ponies in and out a row of flags,
                            turning round the end one and returning the same way. Heats of 3. From a
                            spectator’s point of view this was probably the most interesting event
                            of the day. The race was run in heats, and the winners of the
                            preliminary heats were Mr. Eiken, Capt. Crawley, and Ibrahim Bey Cherif;
                            Mr. Logan, Capt. Wilkins and Capt. Jeffreys. The semi-finals resulted in
                            Capt. Crawley and Capt. Jeffreys being left in to contest the final. In
                            this Capt. Jeffreys, who bad all through shown the best form and looked
                            like winning easily, unfortunately fouled one of the posts, and being,
                            in consequence dis¬qualified, left Capt. Crawley to come in a winner at
                            his leisure. It seemed to us that several of the competitors would have
                            done better to have taken the race at a slower but surer pace, as the
                            disqualifications were numerous. POLO BALL RACE.—Round a selected
                            course. The last race was rather tedious for the onlookers, as it took
                            the riders some time getting round the coarse, down the polo ground, and
                            up the straight to the goal. The irrigation canal and training track had
                            their fair share of attention and proved as effi¬cient bankers as they
                            are accustomed to do at golf. The winners of the preliminary heats were
                            Capt. Wilkinson, Mr. Stuart Mr. Eiken, and Mr. Jenkinson. The final
                            produced an excellent finish, Captain Wilkinson only just securing the
                            goal from Mr. Jenkinson. At the conclusion of the races Mrs. Gould very
                            kindly gave away the prizes to the winners. </p>

                        <p>LE COMMERCE ABYSSIN</p>
                        <p>De la ,‘Tribnna”: Le commerce de l’Abyssinie avec l’étranger se faisait presque
                            entièrement par la province du Harrar et celui de cette province étant alimenté
                            en très grande partie par les produits Abyssins et les importations destinées aa
                            marché d’Addis-Abbeba on peut considérer l’exposé de la situation commer­ciale
                            particulière du Harrar comme donnant un aperça de tout le mouvement commercial
                            da pays. Da reste, les relations commerciales de l’Abyssinie avec le Soudan,
                            l’Erythrée et la So­malie italienne, malgré de sérieux efforts, se dé veloppent
                            lentement et n’ont qu’une faible importance.</p>
                        <p>Le mouvement qui nous occupe n’a que légèrement progressé dans les quatre
                            dernières années. Eu 1900, les importations et les expor­tations de l’Abyssinie
                            étaient évaluées ensem ble è environ 11 millions de francs; ce chiffre n’a été
                            dépassé en 1904 que d’environ 1 million de francs. La plupart des articles
                            d’exportation sont en augmentation. Sea’s l’ivoire et la ci­vette ont
                            C0nsidérablem:nt diminué. Le chiffre total de ce mouvement en 1904 accuse une
                            augmentation de plus de 2,500,000 franos par rapport à celui de 1900. Mais si
                            les facultés d’achat de l’Abyssinie ont augmenté dans une mesure notable, ses
                            besoins ne semblent pas avoir suivi la même progression. Eu effet, la plupart
                            des articles d’importation progressent péniblement, quelques-uns sont restés
                            station­naires et d’aatres enfin, comme les armes, ont subi une grande
                            diminution.</p>
                        <p>Cette situation tient peut être en partie des causes passagères, mais elle est
                            surtout le résultat d’an régime éîonoarque et d’an état sooial qui semblent pea

                            sorrow in Eng­land, in India, and in America. The death of a beautiful
                            woman in the prime of womanhood is always a sorrowful thing ; but when
                            that woman has, alike by her character, her beauty and her talents,
                            captivated in a few years England, America, and India, the news of
                            her</p>
                        <p>death is something more than that </p>
                        <p>Placed by her husband’s promotion in the posi­tion of wife of the Viceroy
                            of India, she proved no unworthy successor to the great English ladies
                            whose husbands have held that arduous and honourable post, and the
                            brilliant success of his wife was not the least remarkable of the
                            features of Lord Curzon’s historic Viceroyalty. In England Lady Cumn
                            made innumerable friends, and though their sympathy can do little to
                            help Lord Curzon in this moment of trial, it is truly and ungrudgingly

                        <p>(“Morning Post.”) Mr. Haldane’s Strategy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Haldane’s scheme may be good or bad, but, whichever it be, it cannot
                            be considered unimportant. Nor will he persuade anybody who heard or
                            read the elaborate and ingenious arguments which he brought forward that
                            he was not aware of the magnitude of the changes which he was
                            advocating. The Secretary for War is, on the floor of Parliament, a very
                            cunning strategist, but he will not succeed, if he wishes, in explaining
                            himself away. He is a very distinct and tangible personality, and,
                            whether they agree or disagree with his de­signs, all Army reformers
                            must recognise that they have a strong and innovating element to deal
                            with at the War Office. (“Standard.”) Radical Coercion.</p>
                        <p>We do not for a moment suppose that Mr. Haldane desires or intends to do
                            away with our defensive forces, but it is impossible to ignore the
                            inference that the present Govern­ment asserts the privilege to do so if
                            Radical Ministers and Socialist members so desire it. The defence of his
                            own position put forward by the Secretary for War is based on a mere “to
                            queqae,” and is, therefore, absolutely inadequate, since the elections
                            were largely won upon the cry that the late Government had ignored the
                            supremacy of the Imperial Parliament. At any rate, before the Cabinet
                            carry out what they imagine to be Caesar;s will they should appeal to
                            Caesar. (“Telegraph”). Russian Troubles,</p>
                        <p>The maintenance in power of the Goremykin Cabinet seems to be more and
                            more opposed to the dictates of reason. The explanation given is that
                            the Emperor has been profoundly impressed—and very naturally, too-by the
                            murders of Admiral Chuknin and General Kosloff. But however depressed
                            Nicolas II. may be he has no excuse for not being able to make a
                            distinction between two absolutely different orders of ideas. Let murder
                            be pot down with all energy, butt that it is necessary to keep the
                            Goremykin Ministry in power to do the work nobody will admit. To
                            maintain order the Emperor has need of a strong Govern­ment, and M.
                            Goremykin's Cabinet is weak.</p>

                        <p>According to the “Cologne Gazette,” the Tsar has decided to dissolve the
                            Duma, “on the ground that it has gone farther than was ever contemplated
                            in its constitution.” He never expected when he gave the people a
                            Parliament all of their very own that they would actually want to do
                            anything with it. He thought they would simply drag it into conversation
                            in a casual way, and brag about it to their friends. (“Globe.”)</p>

                        <p>Art Advice for the Government.</p>
                        <p>Sir William Richmond, speaking at the archi tects congress yesterday on
                            the relations between the architect and other artists or craftsmen, said
                            that the State did not take much account of art, and education was on
                            all hands superficial. But against official coldness might be set the
                            growing democracy of artists. With a closer touch between the architect,
                            sculptor, and painter, a combined committee could be formed which might
                            in time become an advisory body to the Government and Lon­don County
                            Council, both of which needed education in good taste in all that
                            applied to art. (‘Tribune.”)</p>

                        <p>‘ Of the making of books” on the Holy Land there is no end, thanks to the
                            zeal of the able archeologists of the Palestine Exploration Fand, and
                            others who independently have made the subject of Palestinian
                            exploration their special study. To the credit of the authors be it said
                            that their productions are invariably interesting, for not only is the
                            subject fascinating, but they bring to their task an enthusiasm which
                            enables them to pre­sent th9 story of their discoveries in an un­usually
                            readable form.</p>
                        <p>The latest work on Palestine is that given to os by Mr. Stewart
                            Macalister, Director of Excavations for the Exploration Fund, in which
                            he describes the operations at Gezer. This is the forerunner of a much
                            more ela­borate memoir, now in course of preparation, on the discoveries
                            at the site of the ancient city. It is safe to say that the interest
                            aroused by the present instalment augurs well for the success of the
                            larger work, which we await with pleasurable anticipation.</p>
                        <p>Of course, the one outstanding feature of the result of the excavations
                            in Egypt and the Holy Land is the valuable light they throw upon the
                            historical records of the Old Testa­ment, and the expedition to Gezer
                            has been successful in clearing up several points about which much
                            mystery has gathered. One dis­covery that will probably appeal most to
                            the general reader is that which enables the author to present to ns a
                            new and much more feasible version of Samson’s death. The generally
                            accepted notion is that the Temple of the Philistines was built in the
                            style of a much later civilisation complete with Gothic pillars, which
                            Samson snapped by the act of resting himself upon them. From the
                            discovery of other buildings in the Mound, Mr. Maoalister thinks it
                            probable that the temple was furnish­ed with a portico, supported by
                            wooden pillars, and that it was beneath the portico that Samson was
                            compelled to exhibit his prowess for the amusement of his enemies. When
                            he was tired be was permitted to take bold of the pillars, and this
                            afforded him the opportunity of retaliating upon his persecutors by
                            wrench­ing the pillars from their position, and bring­ing down the
                            portico to the ground, a by no means impossible feat. In this act he
                            destroy­ed those congregated above and below the portico.</p>
                        <p>One of the surprises of the expedition was the discovery of the remains
                            of a cave-dwelling people which seem to bear a striking re­semblance to
                            the description given of a little- known race mentioned in Genesis and
                            Deuteronomy, the Horites, and muoh inte­resting information is afforded
                            of the dwellings of this people, and their probable form of worship. In
                            the last week of the excavations a few graves ot a very remarkable
                            cemetery were found, the bodies in the tombs being of extraordinary
                            size, which leads Mr. Macalister to suggest that they were on the point
                            of ooming into contaot with the Philistine giants David’s men slew at
                            Gtzer, The expiration of the Government’s permit, unfortunately,
                            pre­vented an extended examination of this interesting “find.” It is to
                            be hoped that more information regarding these giants may be obtained at
                            a subsequent date.</p>
                        <p>It is unfortunate that complaint has again to be made of the damage to
                            ancient mona­ments being wrought by marauding natives. It will be
                            remembered that Professor Petrie had much trouble with these vandals in
                            Sinai, and it seems very desirable that some severe steps should be
                            taken by the Government to put an end to this sort of thing. Otherwise
                            the work of exploration will be seriously menaced, if lot actually
                            terminated.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Maoalister’s work is well-written and admirably illustrated by
                            photographs.</p>

                        <p>I he exhibition of the graeco-Roman branch of the Egypt Exploration Fand,
                            which forms the second portion of the society’s exhibition at King’s
                            College, is one which will be found of the greatest interest to all
                            lovers of literature. The work of Drs. Hunt and Grenfell in the Fayoum
                            has resulted in bringing to light a totally undreamt-of wealth of
                            literary material from the rubbish beaps or waste-paper baskets of
                            Greco-Roman Egypt, writes Mr, W. St. Chad Boscawen in the “Tribune.”</p>
                        <p>Although this year we do not find any such grand trouvaille as the
                            “Sayings of Jesus,” there are a number of fragments of the greatest
                            interest to the classical scholar and historian. These fragments come
                            chiefly from Oxyryuchus and from El Hibet, near Beni Souef, the
                            ma­jority of the papyri from the latter having been taken from the
                            cartonage of mummy oases of the Ptolemaio age. Among the classical
                            fragments are portions ot the “Iliad” or “Odyssey” of Homer, of works of
                            Plato and Euripides and several unknown authors. In this section of
                            literature one fragment of especial value is a treatise on musical
                            criticism, whioh with reasonable certainty may be attri­buted to
                            Hippias. It is a most scathing attack on the pedantic school of Damnon
                            the Athenian. In biting sarcasm it is equal to any product of modern
                            journalism, as the following extracts will show. He commences :—</p>
                        <p>“It has often been a surprise to me, ye men of Hellas, that certain
                            persons who make dis­plays foreign to their own arts shoald pass
                            un­observed. They claim to be musical and select, and compare tunes,
                            bestowing indiscriminate praise on some, blame on others. They assert
                            that certain tunes make ns temperate, others wise, others just, others
                            cowardly, 6to.”</p>
                        <p>But, as is often the case, the sting of the criticism is in the
                            tail:—</p>
                        <p>“Such is their confidence that they waste all their tunes upon the
                            strings, harping worse than the worst harpers, singing worse than the
                            worst singers, making comparisons worse than the worst rhetoricians, and
                            in fact, doing everything worse than anyone else.”</p>
                        <p>This is certainly a gem of criticism worth rescuing from the packing of a
                            mummy case. AN ANCIENT POST OFFICE Passing to documents of a more
                            general character, we have one of considerable his­torical value. It
                            relates to the process re­garding the theft of a temple seal by a
                            cer­tain Chesemenis and his son. The high priest who makes the charge
                            accuses the robbers of having taken the seal in order to use it for the
                            letters of a certain Manetho; from the indications of the high position
                            of this latter person and the date 241 b c it woold appear that we have
                            here a reference to the great Egyptian historian and chrono- logist.
                            Another document comes as a surprise as showing the perfect organization
                            of offi oial life in Ptolemaio times, being dated 255 b.c. It is
                            evidently the day-book of the registered letter office of the
                            post-office of the Fayoum. In it are recorded the day and hour at which
                            certain lettters for the King or Government officials reached the
                            office. Herei we have the name of the postman wha brought them, the
                            official who received them,) and, in the case of letters containing
                            money or orders for money or corn bills, the name!) of the money carrier
                            by whom they were dispatched. As Dr. Grenfell says, “The day* book of a
                            modern post-office could be no more aoonrate in its entries.”</p>
                        <p>Among the documents of more human in­terest are letters for money,
                            receipts for rent, records of the payment of the police- tax, and the
                            tax for the district medioalj man. The labour question was then to the
                            fore and we have the letter of an agent to the Governor of the district
                            complaining of a: strike of quarrymen and asking for their arrest. The
                            housekeeping accounts of a steward to his master are full of quaint
                            items—milk for the children, oil for lamps, medicine, string, and
                            vegetables. Then several documents relat­ing to the beer and wine trade,
                            and a curious calendar of the Saite nome, which is of con­siderable
                            value as a test for the wandering year. The collection is one whioh
                            serves to show the immense literary activity in Egypt, and the perfect
                            bureaucratio organisation in the century immediately preceding and
                            following the Christian era.</p>
