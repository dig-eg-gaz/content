Using the XPath Query, I decided to searching nursing under the //div tab because I am currently majoring in nursing. There were 99 results out of all of the files and there were only results from 1905 and 1906, none from 1907. I thought that was very interesting. My results looks plain and simple really. It showed me where I can find any news about nursing and gives a little sneak peak of it. A lot of the searches that came up when I searched nursing was nursing homes. I tried searching nursing homes first but there were not enough results. I have been using the XPath Query a lot when I am trying to find a certain part of my pages in the txt. It really comes in handy when looking for other topics too.
