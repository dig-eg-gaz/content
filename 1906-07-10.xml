                    <head>THE STATE OF THE ARMY</head>
                    <p>The Army is on the point of being submitted once again to a process of
                        reform, but nobody knows for certain what form the new experiments are to
                        take. How many times in the last thirty years has it found itself in the
                        melting-pot? Has it indeed ever in that period been really free from the
                        fames of disintegration? Every new Minister called to Fall Mall since the
                        days of Lord Cardwell has felt that he had a mission to endeavor to create
                        for us a new army on fresh and original lines. What wonder that as a result
                        of all this recasting the last state is admittedly worse than the first.
                        Matters were bad enough before the war in South Africa came to open the eyes
                        of soldiers to the folly of political procedure. They have been rendered
                        infinitely worse since, for change has followed change in quick succession
                        since peace was declared in May, 1902.</p>
                    <p>There is no denying that when the present Secretary of State took charge of
                        his portfolio on the change of Government occurring, the condition of things
                        which faced him on his entrance to office was little short of deplorable.
                        Never before, perhaps, in all its chequered history had the War Office been
                        in such a condition of chaotic muddle. And the same state of chaos prevailed
                        in most, if not all, commands at home and in the colonies. There had been so
                        much rushing of fences that nobody seemed to know what was best to be done
                        or who was responsible for anything, and the officials at Headquarter, when
                        applied to for information, could do little bat shrug their shoulders and
                        admit their own ignorance. It has been left for Mr. Haldane to endeavor to
                        restore harmony, and to his credit be it said he has, to some extent,
                        succeeded. Things are still bad, but they are unquestionably better than
                        they were. But the present War Minister has to deal with a system which,
                        however good it may look on paper, has been found in practice to be the
                        cause of endless irritation and confusion. The idea of the existing
                        administrative organisation was, of course, to promote decentralisation.
                        Experience shows that it has not done this. Indeed, if anything, there is
                        more centralisation than ever; for we are bound to a far greater extent than
                        before to the exigencies of that red-tapeism which all sensible men
                        recognise the folly of, and lose no opportunity of condemning. Of proper
                        military control is scarcely a shred left, or rather there would not ha but
                        for Mr. Haldane’s practical common-sense. </p>
                    <p>There is another feature entirely absent, and that is justice. It is the
                        easiest thing for a Minister sitting in his office to issue mandates
                        affecting services, arms, and departments; to lop off a million of money
                        here and half a million there; to say that this method is old and that man
                        old-fashioned. It not unusually follows that as the result of ill-considered
                        action there is directly or indirectly punishment to be borne which innocent
                        victims are required to grin and submit to. If our Army were officered and
                        recruited under compulsory laws of service, as Continental armies are,
                        change, constant change, would be bad enough. What makes our arrangement in
                        confusion, as we will designate it, so very hard is that officers and men
                        have all come forward of their own free will to render service to their King
                        and country. Having done so; ’tis theirs not to reason why; ’tis theirs bat
                        to do and die.” They surely deserve to be treated, therefore, with some
                        consideration; hot this is the last thing, unfortunately, that they usually
                        receive. Reference is constantly being made, not up direct terms, perhaps,
                        but by insinuation, to the marked tendency which the rising population is
                        evincing not to accept fierce in the Army. Have we not seen lately
                        commissions given in both the cavalry and the Guards to young men who have
                        undergone no examination whatever? Can we wonder at parents displaying an
                        inclination not to send their sons to the Army after all that has happened
                        since the war? Could any other result be looked for, considering the
                        treatment which has been meted out to officers of high rank and distinction
                        ? The Army for the last four years has been handed over bodily to faddists.
                        We trust they are satisfied with their work. Soldiers cannot but regard the
                        situation with feelings of doubt and concern; they would, indeed, be poor
                        soldiers if they did not.</p>

                        Cairo. Telegrams for persons resident in these quarters will henceforth be

                    <p>New Victoria Hotel</p>
                    <p>This new first-class establishment was formally opened last Saturday
                        afternoon, when the manager, Mr. Raisig, gave a "five-o’olock” in honour of
                        the event. A large and distinguished gathering, including H.E. the Governor
                        and Mazloum Pacha, availed themselves of Mr. Raisig’s genial hospitality,
                        and did ample justice to a well-stocked buffet. The band of the Royal Dublin
                        Fasiliers played a select repertoire, and in every respect the inauguration
                        was a brilliant success. The new hotel is certainly one of the best in
                        Alexandria. Its position is unique, both for convenience and scenery, the
                        broad expanse of the Mediterranean, two miles distant, being visible from
                        almost every storey on the north side, while the southern side, where the
                        entrance is, looks on to one of the most fashionable thoroughfares of
                        Ramleh. A special feature of the hotel is the balcony which runs round the
                        building and is so agreeable in this hot season. Light and ventilation,
                        roomy and lofty apartments, an excellent cuisine, and moderate fares, these
                        and many other advantages entitle the hotel to the popularity it has already
                        won. A special feature of the decorations are the carpets, which are genuine
                        Persian antiques.</p>
                    <p>New Books.</p>
                    <p>In order to continually supply the demands of a public anxious to get the
                        most knowledge in the least time, Mr. Berlitz constantly improves his method
                        and is at work on Borne new books. Two have just been published; the second
                        volume of practical French grammar, and commercial French. These books are
                        immediately placed in all branches of the Berlitz Schools, especially at
                        Cairo (1, Sharia Kamel) and at Alexandria (12, rue Rosette), where the
                        number of successes is ever increasing. [Advt.]</p>

                    <p>London, July 9</p>
                    <p>The “Morning Post” and “Daily Telegraph” are alarmed at Mr. Haldane’s schemes
                        for the redaction of the army, and state that they cannot believe that the
                        country will acquiesce. The latter, especially, emphasizes the Moha- medan
                        unrest and concludes that if the present Parliament cannot be checked in its
                        appalling folly and blindness, England may yet find its doom prepared.

                    <head>SIR E. GREY’S SPEECH. </head>
                    <head>MORE NATIVE PRESS COMMENTS. </head>
                    <p>“A1 Zahir” writes: The debate on the Denishwai affair in the British
                        Parliament indicates that British statesmen would take revenge on the
                        Egyptian nation for its collective attachment to the Ottoman Government,
                        which was obviously shown daring the Akaba difficulty. The British Minister
                        has employed the Denishwai incident as a means to create some change in
                        Egypt supported by the argument that the Europeans in Egypt—including the
                        English—have become subject to aggression on the part of the natives. Whence
                        did Sir Grey derive his examples of acts of aggression, except from the
                        Denishwai including, in which the Egyptians were unjustly treated and
                        insulted, we cannot comprehend. Every now and then these English people
                        suddenly suspect us of being very fanatical, that is, when they see the
                        right is on our side, and can find no other means of getting rid of
                        responsibility or blame. They now declare that Pan-Islamic fanaticism has
                        extended to the northern parts of Africa, which declaration will serve to
                        stir the minds of other Governments against us, to put us under a heavier
                        burden, and to disturb our peacefulness,—and all this, with a view to damage
                        our national interests and make the world shrink in loathing from us, and to
                        enable England to enjoy an undisturbed preponderance in our country. From
                        the above considerations we gather that the British people would have liked
                        us to praise the activity and wisdom of that special tribunal which has
                        entirely removed from our hearts all sympathy with and inclination towards
                        the British Occupation. Consequently, all that we desire, under the present
                        circumstances, is to be on good and peaceful terms with England, enjoining
                        her to give us our due and be satisfied with her own, bat not to adopt for
                        us a peculiar and can tempt none treatment, which could never be borne even
                        by dumb animals , not to tread ns under foot, depriving ns of all our
                        rights, and keep the word “fanatical” at the tip of her tongue for instant
                        use if we lift our heads to say we are being unjustly treated,' while she
                        secures all rights and benefits for herself. The Egyptians are known to be a
                        peaceful nation; and it is quite astonishing to see England complain of ns.
                        What were the English complaints based on if not on the foot that they
                        intend to advance to the attainment of their political ends at the expense
                        of our imaginary fanaticism? </p>

                    <head>O'BRIEN QUESTIONED BY PARQUET. </head>
                    <p>Yesterday the Alexandria Parquet authorities went to Ras el-Tin Hospital to
                        hear Private O’Brien’s statements in regard to the attack made against him
                        last week by some natives at Dekhela, near Mex. The soldier’s account of the
                        incident was to the following effect: After receiving his week’s pay,
                        amounting to 5 shillings at Mustapha barracks, O’Brien hired a cab at P.T. 4
                        to drive him to a place near the Mex slaughter-house, where cabs usually
                        stop, as the road further on is very bad. There he alighted and walked on
                        till he arrived at Bab el Arab, Mex, where he hired a donkey, giving its
                        owner who accompanied him P.T. 3 in advance, and went on towards the camp.
                        On passing by a native café at the old Mex station, O’Brien heard the words
                        "Johnny’s there” uttered by a native, bat he paid no attention and continued
                        riding on, till he was at a distance of about 200 metres from the cafe.
                        There he was attacked by two natives, who had followed him from that caft,
                        one of whom stopped the donkey and pulled him down to the ground, while the
                        other began to search in his pockets. But being unable to discover the
                        money, which the soldier had hidden is his cap, the two vagabonds fell on
                        O’Brien, and after beating him very severely and kicking him till he became
                        unconscious, made off. The donkey boy was then following his donkey, which
                        had run away. Five minutes later another native who spoke some English
                        passed by the soldier and asked what was the matter with him. The soldier
                        told him what had occurred and requested him to accompany him to the camp,
                        which the native did. O’Brien gave him P.T. 2 without any demand for money
                        being made on their arrival at the camp, whence the injured man was taken
                        later to hospital. </p>
                    <p>The examination showed that O’Brien had come direct from Mustapha. Tae two
                        culprits were brought before the soldier for identification and he easily
                        identified the man who beat him and knelt on his body, bat was not sure
                        whether the other took part in the outrage or not. The donkey boy, however,
                        identified both. </p>
                    <p>The examination, which was held in the presence of a doctor, lasted an hour,
                        daring which O’Brien spoke without any difficulty. </p>
                    <p>The trial of the criminals will be held on the 2lst inst. at the Native
                        Court. </p>

                    <head>AN INTERESTING REPORT. </head>
                    <p>We have received an interesting collection of statistical tables of the
                        working of railways in various countries up to 1901 which has been composed
                        by M. J. D. Diacomidie, engineer to the Egyptian State Railways, which
                        should be of great value for purposes of reference. In comparing the 1904
                        figures for the Egyptian State Railways with those of other countries one is
                        struck by the large proportion of goods waggons to passenger carriages, 15.1
                        to 1.6, and the high daily average of passengers per carriage on 100 miles
                        amounting to 19 against an average of 8 for France and 16 for the U. S. A.
                        In length of line open the U. S. A. with over 200,000 miles is easily first,
                        Russia, Germany, and British India following</p>
                    <p>The U.S.A. again lead in rolling stock with over 41,000locomotives, 34,COO
                        passenger oars, and the prodigious figure of 1,490,000 goods waggons. Great
                        Britain, with 22,443 locomotives, is best supplied with passenger carriages,
                        of which it has 50,728, with nearly three-quarters of a million of goods
                        waggons; and Germany and Russia—both countries in which accommodation for
                        large numbers of troops and military stores most be considered by the State
                        Railways as well as the commercial capacity of the rolling stock—are well
                        off in both. The cost per mile open is highest in Great Britain and Ireland,
                        where it amounts to £56.044, lowest on the companies’ lines in Egypt,
                        £2,874. The highest interest on capital was paid by the Egyptian State
                        Railways in 1904 and amounted to 8 1/5 %, Japan coming next with 1/3 % and
                        then the two chief Dutch lines with 6 4/5 per cent. Mirabils dictu The
                        highest net receipts per train mile are recorded from four of the foreign
                        lines in the Ottoman Empire, though we imagine that what is known as a
                        kilometric guarantee has something to say to this. Altogether Mr. Diacomidis
                        has drawn up a very interesting and valuable report, which we heartily
                        recommend to our readers. </p>

                    <head>THE COTTON WORM.</head>
                    <head>PROGRESS OF DESTRUCTIVE OPERATIONS.</head>
                    <p>The report which has been issued by the Ministry of the Interior for the
                        seven days from June 28 to July 4, concerning the progress of the
                        cotton-worm, confirms the news which we published a few days ago as to the
                        success with which the work of its destruction is being carried out. Last
                        year the workof the Ministry of the Interior in this direction was appraised
                        throughout Egypt, and this summerit is still more effective, though perhaps
                        less manifest to the general public.</p>
                    <p>From June 28 to July 4 it was found that 41,790 feddans of cotton culture,
                        comprising 544 villages inthe provinces of Menofieh, Sharkieh, Behara,
                        Gharbieh, Dakahlieh, Kalioubieh, Ghizeh, and Minieh were affected and were
                        entirely freed from the worm, whereas there were nosigns of the pest in the
                        provinces of Assiout, Beni-Souef, Fayoum, and Keneh. The method followed has
                        been, as was the case last year, that of hand-picking, and it is doubtful if
                        such a method can ever entirely eradicare the orm-indeed its frequesnt
                        recrudescance is a disproof of such a possibility It is, however, a most
                        excellent means of averting the destruction of cotton crops and must be
                        continued until a more lasting measure has been established.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately we cannot refard the complete disintection which we have
                        recorded above as a sign of the entire disappearence of the worm in thos
                        districts, as it will inevitably be found that other broods will nake their
                        appearance and have to be treated similarly, and, we trust, with the same
                        excellent result. It must be remembered that three broods appear every
                        summer, and that the progency of this first brood has aksi been destroyed is
                        impossible, on account of the method followed, but we can, nevertheless,
                        regard it as likely to have been considerably reduced. The second brood will
                        in its turn be destroyed in the same manner as has been the first, and the
                        third, which is usually the most prolific, will also be materially
                        diminished. We may, therefore, anticipate even less damage to the crops of
                        the country by cotton-worm than was the case last year, and it is most
                        heartily that we congratulate Mr. Machell, C.M.G., and his assistants on the
                        success with which the campaign that they have organised is meeting. The
                        work has been carried on so unostentatiously this summer that many are
                        ignorant of the prevalence of the fatal prodenia littoralis, but until some
                        means for its ultamite extermination has been discovered the fight must
                        continue year by year.</p>
                    <p>The following is the official report:--</p>
                    <p>The operations for the destrution of cotton-wor (prodenia littoralis), which
                        have been undertaken this year, and are similar to those last summer, have
                        been continued during the last week--from June 28 to July 4.</p>
                    <p>The provinces of Assiout, Beni-Souef, Fayoum,and Keneh have not been
                        affected, while the reports from other provinces for that period are as
                        follows:--</p>
                    <p>In Menoufish 1,640 feddans have been affected, including 55 villages, and

                    <head>NEW EGYPTIAN COMPANY.</head>
                    <head>"SUNBEAMS, LIMITED"</head>
                    <p>To the Editor of the “Egyptian Gazette.” </p>
                    <p>Mr. Editor,—I crave a space in your columns to put forth a scheme which I
                        trust may prove of lasting advantage to Egyptian commerce as well as to
                        myself. I was fearing that the recent great influx of capital into Egypt had
                        already reached its anti-climax, and that I should be too late in the day,'
                        when a notice in the “Gazette” of Thursday last that a new company is in
                        course of formation has encouraged me to think that the list of possible
                        concessions is not yet exhausted. </p>
                    <p>Having, after many years’ residence in Egypt a Government official, wasted
                        the small substance I had accumulated at my bank—not in rioting and
                        wantonness, but in the endeavour to meet the ever-increasing demands of
                        avaricious landlords—I am, naturally, looking for any honourable means of
                        augmenting the annuity which may be allotted to me by a benevolent Ministry
                        when the loss of a limb, a broken heart, or a constitution enfeebled by long
                        residence in the East and a daily course of pale pills for pink people,
                        shall have enabled me to make good my claim. As a patriot I am, of course,
                        desirous, as far as possible, of allowing my native country to benefit by my
                        scheme, which aims, at the same time, at ensuring me the possibility of
                        supporting the change of climate following on my quitting the bright skies
                        of sonny Egypt. </p>
                    <p>Oh ! blest Retirement ! Friend to life’s decline, Retreat from cares that
                        some day may be mine ! Tis a sad prospect, days of sunshine past, Home to
                        return and die of cold at last. </p>
                    <p>(I pray that Goldsmith may not “turn in his grave” at this desecration of his
                        immortal verse !) </p>
                    <p>And, now, for my grand project—Beware of forming too hasty a judgment. You
                        will remember that, one hundred and fifty yean ago, when the learned
                        Barnett, Lord Monboddo, astonished the world with his new monkey theory for
                        the origin of mankind, he was received with a howl of derision and
                        incredulity from the whole body of scientists. And, now, what do we see? The
                        entire category of biologists engaged, ever since Charles Darwin’s death
                        twenty-four years ago, in hunting fora sign of a scrap of the missing tail
                        so scouted of yore!</p>
                    <p>I trust that you are, now, prepared to learn that my company will aim at no
                        less thou a further development of the project of the professor at the Grand
                        Academy of Lagodo to bottle sunbeams in order to their being used, as
                        required, to warm the air in raw indent sum men. You will, doubtless,
                        remember that, during his eight unsuccessful years of experiment, the worthy
                        professor’s hair and beard had become long, ragged and tinged in several
                        places, and that his clothes and skin were of the same colour. Even then
                        this brave projector had, by no means, lost hope and doubted not that in
                        another eight years he would be able to supply the Governor’s garden with
                        sunshine at a reasons Me rate. </p>
                    <p>An interesting detail is that the savant was evidently of Egyptian
                        extraction, as he did not foil to ask for and obtain a baksheesh from
                        Captain Lemuet Gulliver. His plan was to extract sunshine from cucumbers;
                        the selection of this plant being due to the fact that in the British
                        climate the fruit is usually grown in hotbeds in which they imbibe, through
                        a glass root such few glimpses of sunshine as an exceptionally warm summer
                        may afford; glimpses all the more valuable and appreciated for their rarity,
                        reminding one of the observation of Sydney Smith in speaking of the
                        brilliant conversation of the eloquent Macao lay, the peculiar charm of
                        which was, he thought, the occasional flash of silence which illuminated it </p>
                    <p>But, here in Egypt, where cucucmbers are famous for their quality— </p>
                    <p>"The blazing sans which dart a downward ray And fiercely shed intolerable
                        day” </p>
                    <p>are so uniformly shiny that the tedious process of extraction may be
                        dispensed with, and we have nothing to do but simply bottle as fast as we
                        can, adopting the months of June. July, and August, tor choice, as the
                        bottling season : this operation once effected, the fortunes of the
                        shareholders will be as good as made. </p>
                    <p>Another point of economy mast be noticed. The cold storage, so necessary for
                        the transport of tropical fruit and so difficult to find in the
                        Alexandria-home trade, will not be required for bottled sunbeams. In feet,
                        quite the contrary ; the nearer the bottles are stowed to the engines and
                        boilers of the ship the better the chance for the contents to arrive in an
                        unchanged condition at their destination. All we require are good bottles
                        and competent bottlers ; these will be advertised for ip the “Egyptian
                        Gazette” the moment the Financial Adviser and the Council of Ministers have
                        granted the concession. </p>
                    <p>The learned professor of the Academy of Lagodo was, probably, weak in
                        horticulture. A member of the A. H. 8. would have had greater advantages in
                        cultivation of cucumbers ; especially now that the society has a large
                        garden allotted to it by the Municipality, with a Ministerial subsidy, in
                        view of future export produce. But, as I said before, the time wasted by the
                        professor over sunbeam-cucumbers in Great Britain will be saved under my
                        scheme, and the society’s garden may be retained for the cultivation of
                        edible ones only. I am told, too, by the secretary to the A.H.8. that my
                        project is somewhat beyond the present horizon of the society, which, from
                        mere timidity, prefers to begin by utilising sunbeams in the ordinary way. </p>
                    <p>My prospectus will shortly be ready for publication; and, in the meantime,
                        Mr. Editor, 1 hope I may count on your valuable aid in making public my
                        design, for the successful issue of which you will have seen that 1 only
                        need a sufficiently credulous and gullible public - in fact, such a one as
                        we are accustomed to see at all times in our own country ready to swallow
                        the fly (with the hook) before it has yet reached the surface of the
                        water.—I am, etc, A.H.S.</p>

                    <head>WORK OF BRITISH COTTON GROWING ASSOCIATION</head>
                    <p>At the concluding sitting of the International Cotton congress at Bremen, the
                        Secretary of the British Cotton Growing Association, Mr. J. t\ Atkins, in
                        dealing with the work of the Association in various parts of the world, gave
                        some useful information regarding the numerous experiments with Egyptian
                        seed in North West India, and Central, Eastern, and Southern Africa. At the
                        outset, he pointed out that the necessity for persevering with the work
                        engaged in by the various associations to enlarge the area of cotton
                        cultivation, and thus increase the supply, was still urgent; in fact it was
                        not too much to say that the position grew more serious each year. At
                        present the yield of cotton was greatly reduced. Thus the outlook for supply
                        was not cheerful, and added to this was the extraordinary increase in the
                        number of spindles all over the world, but particularly in Lancashire, one
                        important feature of the increase being that the majority of new mills were
                        for spinning Egyptian qualities. Another development fraught with great
                        possibilities was that the American planters and merchants were combining to
                        limit wherever possible the area of cultivation, and also to influence the
                        market price. The only effectual remedy against these tactics was to open
                        out fresh fields for cotton growing. The British Cotton Growing Association
                        recognised fully the magnitude and difficulty of the task it had undertaken,
                        but having taken the work in ban, every effort would be move to carry it to
                        a succ38sfal issue. The same spirit animated the Continental associations,
                        and, all working with one common object, difficulties would be overcome and
                        success attained. Daring the past year the subscriptions to the
                        Association's capital amounted to about £30,COO, the total amount subscribed
                        to date being £333,000. Despite many discouragements, progress had been made
                        and the Association felt that success would ultimately be achieved. In
                        giving some account of the work in the various Colonies and Dependencies,
                        Mr. Atkins said the Association had succeeded in arousing the Government of
                        India to the necessity of strenuous efforts being made to improve the
                        quality of the cotton growth, and by means of improved cultivation to
                        increase the quantity. The Agricultural Department had taken up the
                        question--duly qualified men were conducting experiments in various
                        districts, seed farms had been established, and efforts were being made to
                        improve the position of small native planters, and so enable them to avail
                        themselves of anyimproved methods of cultivation, and to secure proper
                        seed.with that objectit was probable an attempt would be made to introduce
                        agricultural banks similar to those which had been such a great success in
                        Egypt. Large experiments were being made with tree cotton, several varieties
                        of which had grown wild in many parts of the country. Owing to adverse
                        climatic conditions no definite results had been secured ; sufficient cotton
                        was grown, however, to give hopes of success in the future. In Sinde (North
                        West India), where the conditions were somewhat similar to Egypt,
                        experi-ments with several varieties of Egyptian seed were being carried on
                        by the Government Agricultural Department. The reuslts were very
                        encouraging; a lot of eleven bales grown last season sent to the Association
                        had recently been sold at 9d. per pound. messrs. Ralli Bros, imported about
                        500 bales of the same cotton, which they valued at 10d. There was therefore
                        every encouragement to push forward vigorously the growth of Egyptian cotton
                        in this province. The Association, in order to assist the efforts of the
                        Indian Government, has agreed to contribute £10,000 towards the expenses
                        incurred in placing the industry on a better basis. Marked success had
                        attended the efforts of the Association in the various West Indian Islands.
                        Although it was only four years since the industry was started it had
                        rapidly developed, and was now on a commercial basis. The cotton was of a
                        very fine quality, and had fetched prices ranging from 12d. to 20d per
                        pound. Several ginning factories had been established with the Association's
                        assistance, and recently a mill had been erected in Barbados for crushing
                        the seed, and if successful would be followed by others. The production of
                        cotton bade fair to bring renewed prosperity to the West Indies. In British
                        Central Africa cotton growing was taken up entusiastically two years ago by
                        the European farmersin the neighbourhood of Blantyre. Unfortunatly in the
                        past two seasons the weather has been very unfavourable, and severla of the
                        plantations were a failure. Some were very successful, and very fine cotton
                        from Egyptian seed had been grown. About 4,000 bales were produced last
                        season, and much more was expected this year. Efforts were being made
                        through the Government to induce the Datives to grow cotton, and large
                        quantities of seed bad been distributed. The Association had spent a
                        considerable amount of money, to start the industry and firmly believed that
                        ultimately success would be attained. In British East Africa it had been
                        proved that good cotton could be grown from Egyptian seed on the coast lands
                        also in the neighbourhood of Lake Victoria Nyanza. It was confidently
                        believed that a profitable industry would soon be established. The
                        Association had erected a ginnery near Mombasa*, and bad under Consideration
                        a scheme to greatly extend the area under cultivation, by encouraging
                        settlers and natives to plant cotton, and by opening baying centres. In the
                        enormous territory of Rhodesia the experiments had proved that good cotton
                        could </p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>be grown. Works on a large scale was about to be commenced by the
                        Association, the British South Africa Company, and others. Here Egyptian and
                        good stapled American cotton would be grown. About 200 bales (Egyptian) were
                        recently sold in Liverpoolat 8d and 9d. per lb. In Cape Colony, Natal, the
                        Transvaal, and Orange River Colonies much interest has been created, and the
                        Association has received samples from many planters who had grown very good
                        cotton experimentally. Every encouragement had been giver, and a large
                        number of band gins sent oat, and who especially selected seed. In those
                        Colonies it was a question if cotton could be produced profitably, owing to
                        the cost of labour. There were great possibilities in Upper Egypt and the
                        Sedan for the growth of Egyptian cotton. The development was retarded by the
                        scarcity of labour and want of water, but both would be remedied in time On
                        the West Coast of Africa we had several colonies where cotton was
                        indigenous, and had been grown by the natives for ages. The cotton was
                        mostly of inferior quality, and had been used locally. The Association had
                        set itself to encourage the natives to grow better cotton, and in increasing
                        quantities. With that object good seed bad been largely distributed,
                        ginneries had been erected, and buying agencies established. A very good
                        quality of cotton could be grown in Q ueensland and in the Northern
                        Territories of South Australia. It was duabtful, however, if it could be
                        profitably grown owing to the cost of labour. The Agricultural Department
                        was taking a keen interest, and was very anxious to introduce cotton as a
                        permanent industry, and every effort would be made to that end. In Ceylon,
                        Cyrprus,BritishGuiana, and many other places cotton was being grown in small
                        quantities and the Association was giving assistance. The association was in
                        communication with almost every part of the Empire, and owing to its efforts
                        attentionhad been drawn to the great advantages to be derived from cotton
                        growing. The successes already achieved had encouraged inquiries with regard
                        to other products, and great development might be expected which owuld
                        resutlt in mutual benefit to the mother country and the colonies. it had
                        been proved that cotton of all grades could be grown within the British
                        Empire. The Association encouraged by the successes, would preserve until
                        the industry was placed on a sound basis in those colonies most suited to
                        the growth of cotton. It was not only necessary to grow cotton, but to
                        produce it at such a price that it might be delivered in England to yield a
                        profit to all concerned. The association was sanguins that this could be
                        done, and firmly believed that the time was not far and distant when a
                        sufficient supply would be obtained to render the cotton trade of England in
                        a great measure independent of America for its raw materials. In conclusion
                        he claimed that the British Cotton Growing Association had justified its
                        existence. It was engaged in a truly Imperial work, and was steadily pushing
                        forward, undaunted by tailures here and there, towards the ultimate
                        realisatin of the most sanguine expectations. </p>

                    <head>THE PERVESITY OF THE SULTAN</head>
                    <p>In the House of Lords, last week, Lord j Newton called attention to the
                        proposed | increase in the Turkish customs duties. He thought the time had
                        come when we ought to make terms Dot only with Germany, but with the Turkish
                        Government At long as the Turkish Customs remained as at present we I were
                        in a strong position. We bad a good card in our hand—we had something to
                        bargain with, but if we surrendered that petition without obtaining a proper
                        equivalent we were to a great extent weakening our bargain, and therefore he
                        urged that a favourable opportunity had now occurred for making a bargain
                        with Germany and Turkey with regard to the Bagdad Railway scheme before we
                        finally assented to an increase of Customs duties</p>
                    <p>MASTERS OF THE SITUATION</p>
                    <p>Lord Fitzmaurioe stated that the question was closely allied to Macedonian
                        reforms. As they were only accpted last December it was our duty to give
                        them some time to operate The Government would not have met with the
                        approval of eith3r House of Parliament if they had not adhered strictly to
                        the policy of their predecessors in insisting that adequate guarantees
                        should be forthcoming that the money wouldfind its way into the Macedonian
                        villagers, and not go to Constantinople to be played with or used for any
                        purpose the Turkish Government thought necessary. The government had shown
                        in unmistakable terms that they had no intention of receding from their
                        demands, but daring the last few days the Turkish Government had sent in a
                        reply which practically placed the negotiations in exactly the same position
                        they occupied when the late Government left office The responsibility of
                        this lay with the Turkish Government. His Majesty’s Government were entirely
                        absolved from those unwarrantable and rather hasty imputations which had
                        been made that the Turkish Government had practically shown themselves to be
                        the masters of the situation. It might be possible that other fands not
                        derived from an increase of the Customs duties might be used for the purpose
                        of subsidising the Bagdad Railway, but what the Government insisted upon was
                        that the proposed increase in the Customs should not be use^ or any other
                        parp036 than that specifiedd in the Note. If the Turkish Government realised
                        that we had gone as far as was possible acceding to their demands, we should
                        be fully justified in telling them that they mustadopt the only other
                        remedy, namely, that they most remedy the enormous military force, which, he
                        thought, they kept up quite. unnecessarily. </p>

                <div type="article">
                    <head>"STIFFEN THE CONDITIONS"</head>
                    <p>The Marquis of lansdowne would have congratulate the Government if they had
                        told the House that they had found it possible make a thoroughly
                        satisfactory settlment to make a thoroughly satisfactory settlement of this
                        most difficult and embarrassing question. It was dear, however, once again,
                        that the perversity of the Turkish Government had made it impossible to come
                        to an arrangement which, upon the whole, would have been very advantageous
                        to Turkey. He regretted the interruption of negotiations the less because he
                        was not without hope that should they hereafter he renewed the Government
                        might find it possible to somewhat stiffen their conditions, sod really open
                        what was described as a new chapter in the lamentable history of these
                        transactions. We had had bitter experience of the value of Turkish promises,
                        and be should be glad if it could be made a condition of settlement that the
                        three per cent. increase of Customs duties should not he allowed to come
                        into operation until by an experience spread over certain time we had become
                        satisfied that the ways of the Turkish Customs authorities had been
                        practically mended. The real return which we expected to get for agreeing to
                        the three per cent. increase was that there should be better government in
                        the Macedonian vilayets. The present condition of Macedonia was a constant
                        menace to the peace of Europe, and it was to the best interests of this
                        country and to the interests of all the civilized Powers that the condition
                        of these regions should be improved. If there was to be a renewal of the
                        negotiations he treated for our own sake that we should read the Turkish
                        Government a lesson which they deserved, and insist upon conditions not only
                        as stringent as those they had rejected, hut impose heavier obligations upon
                        them.</p>

                    <head>THE PORTE'S LAST MOVE</head>
                    <p>The Marquis of Ripon said the Government had endeavoured to lay down
                        conditions for acceptance by the Turkish Government which had been proposed
                        by the late Government, but unfortunately up to the present they had not
                        been successful. The last communication from the Porte led them to think
                        that the negotiations might be considered to have come to an end. If the
                        negotiation failed to bring about a settlement on the lines laid down, the
                        hands of the Government would be freed, and it would be for the Fri, 13
                        Porte to consider whether the rejection of those condition would not entitle
                        this country and the other Powers to pat forward other proposals and impose
                        other conditions in San. 15 order to bring a question which threatened j the
                        peace of Europe to a final and satisfsctory conclusion.</p>

                    <head>THE ETHIOPIAN RAILWAY</head>
                    <p>During the last few months little has happened to remove the doubts and
                        anxieties which surround the relations between the Abyssinian Government and
                        the Ethiopian Railway Company. Urging the importance of England, France, and
                        Italy arriving at an early settlement, the "Morning Post” says :—“There is
                        every reason to suppose that the Emperor Menelik is seriously annoyed by the
                        delay. He has gone so far as to announce that unless the efforts of
                        diplomacy succeed in circum- venting the present impasse he himself will
                        undertake the completion of the line. Indeed, he has at his own expense
                        constructed the preliminary works for some thirty kilometres from Adis
                        Adeba. The question at once arises: From what source is he likelyto obtain
                        the necessary funds? In regard to this matter it is significant that while
                        the governments of the three Powers immediately concerned are still unable
                        to put an end to the deadlock, Germany has already made great strides
                        towards securing a footing at the Abyssinian Court. Without entering into
                        the designs which underlie this movement, it is at least worth pointing out
                        that it would be a sorry conclusion to the labours of the last ten years if
                        the motive power behind the Abyssinian railway were eventually to be located
                        in Berlin. It is carious that no official announcement has been made by the
                        British Government on a subject which so intimately concerns the interests
                        of this country and our relations with France.” </p>
                    <p>The “ Petite Republique ” learns that M. Cambon’s interviews with Sir Edward
                        Grey and Signor Tittoni justify the statement that the period of hesitation
                        and postponement concerning the Abyssinian Agreement is ended. Great
                        Britain, Italy, and France. says the journal, have agreed to maintain the
                        statusquoin Abyssinia, and not to alter it until they have settled the
                        matter among themselves. Other clauses stipulatefor the establishment of an
                        open door and econoic equality for all nations. </p>
                    <p>It is a well-known fact (says the Paris correspondednt of the "standard")
                        that the Ethipoian Railway Company has, to put it mildly, been badly
                        managed. It will be reconstructed and reorganised financially and
                        administratively. In conceding a monopoly to this company, Italy and Great
                        Britain have arranged for the protection of international interests in what
                        is likely to be considered an adequate manner. Exactly what the arrangement
                        is I cannot at this stage of the negotiations say. I can only state that it
                        is fair and necessary in view of the power vested in the company, and that
                        Frenchmen will have no reasonable objection to urge against it.</p>
