                    <head>SPEECH BY MR. BALFOUR.</head>
                    <dateline>London, May 11.</dateline>
                    <p>House of Commons.—During the discussion on the Estimates of the Imperial
                        Defence Com- mittee, Mr. Balfour, in an important speech, said that he
                        considered the invasion of Great Britain impossible owing to increased effi-
                        ciency in torpedo-boats and submarine vessels. It is his opinion that if
                        Russia can be prevent- ed from extending the strategic railways in
                        Afghanistan in time of peace, it is in no way beyond the military power of
                        Great Britain, without a fundamental reorganisation of our forces, such as
                        conscription or similar devices, to absolutely secure our Eastern
                        possessions as well as British colonies. He continued that the question of
                        Indian defence is one of the trans- port of supplies. Any attempt to build a
                        rail- way in Afghanistan in connection with the Russian strategic railways
                        should be consider- ed as the heaviest conceivable blow at the heart of
                        India, and ought to be regarded as a direct act of aggression.</p>
                    <p>He further announced that the Admiralty Defence Committee agree that
                        submarine mines are an inexpedient method of protecting British commercial
                        ports. It is his opinion that the use of blockade mines should be considered
                        by an imnternational tribunal.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Campbell-Bannermann congratulated the Government on the reassuring
                        statement, which removed great apprehensions. (Reuter.)</p>
                    <p>The importance of this speech of the Prime Minister lies, not in the
                        possibilities of inva- sion, which is after all a more or less academic
                        question, but in its statement as to the policy of Great Britain towards
                        Russia. The kernel of the speech, as given in the above telegraphic summary,
                        is that conscription or “similar devices "- whatever they may be — can be
                        warded oil if Russia can only be prevented from, extending the strategic
                        railways in Afghanistan, which would be “the heaviest conceivable blow at
                        the heart of India." Now the problem of the defence of India against Russia
                        has occupied the minds of statesmen and soldiers for many years, especially
                        since the Russian occupation of Khiva in 1873 changed her strategic posi-
                        tion with regard to India ; and our policy with regard to it has been
                        determined by the Anglo- Russian agreement of mat year, made by Lord
                        Granville, by which Russia accepted a theore- tical boundary between the
                        Oxus and the Hari Rud as the frontier of the territory of Afgha- nistan,
                        which was thus constituted a buffer State.</p>
                    <p>Russian treaties, however, have not always proved of much avail in stopping
                        the ap- parently inevitable advance of her armies, and her rapid
                        encroachments in Manchuria have no doubt reawakened in many minds the dread
                        of a Russian invasion of India. The speech of the Prime Minister in the
                        House of Commons last night shows that he also shares in this
                        apprehension.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Balfour bases his anxiety on the trans- port of supplies, on which the
                        question of the defence of India is founded. But recent events in Manchuria
                        should make us realise the euormous difficulties in the way of main- taining
                        a large army at so great a distance from its primary base, whence must be
                        drawn, if not all the food, at least all the clothing, medical comforts, and
                        warlike ma- terial required: we see how the impossi- bility of keeping up
                        the supply of transport paralyses the power of an army for offensive
                        movement, so that it is obliged to keep to the line of railway which
                        supports it Com- pare north-western Afghanistan and Russian Turkestan with
                        Manchuria, and the conditions in regard to supply for the Russian army will
                        be found to be much more favorable in Manchuria than on the Oxus.</p>
                    <p>But the question must be considered on a broader base, for the problem of the
                        defence of Lidia should be regarded as a portion of that greater problem,
                        the defence of the Empire of which it is a part. On the principle that every
                        portion of the Empire should be capable of maintaining itself—that is, of
                        resisting attack, and of even acting on the offensive, it need be, until
                        such time as reinforcements both of men and material can be forwarded to it
                        from Great Britain—India must be made secure, and really independent of
                        reinforcement, until a naval engagement shall have cleared the sea of our
                        enemies; for our communications with India are by sea, and the defence of
                        India, like that of every other portion of the Empire, must first of all be
                        based on sea-power. No statesman can contemplate the despatch to India of
                        large reinforcements, in preparation for an offensive movement against a
                        possible Russian army assembled on the banks of the Oxus, until events hare
                        developed, and the real objective to be aimed at by our Imperial forces in
                        any war has been clearly determined.</p>
                    <p>It is needless to dwell upon the troubles, external and internal, which have
                        fallen upon Russia, and which point to the impossibility of her being in a
                        position to undertake the in vasion of India for many years to come : apart
                        from this, it really seems that the extension of the railway to the Oxus,
                        and the connection of that line with the Siberian system via Samara, which
                        has aroused so much apprehen- sion, may be no more than a threat, perhaps
                        little more than an empty one, which will <cb n="2"/> have fulfilled its
                        purpose if it succeeds in leading our statesmen and soldiers to turn their
                        attention too exclusively in that direc- tion : after all, it is a natural
                        expansion of her railway system. It is a serious question whether we are
                        right in allowing ourselves to be alarmed by the continual extension of Rus-
                        sian railways in Asia. Instead of regarding the extension of railways
                        towards our Indian frontiers as a menace, the true policy is to wel- come
                        them, wherever they run, and to makerail- ways from India to meetall lines
                        that eventually have a connection, with Europe. Let us not forget that,
                        whatever the result may be of the present conflict between Russia and Japan,
                        the railway communication between Europe and the Far East, between Moscow,
                        Port Arthur, and Peking, has been permanently established. Are the
                        inhabitants of India to be denied the opportunities of rapid communication
                        with Europe? and do we imagine that they will remain indefinitely content
                        with such isolation as is at present their lot? Are the Afghan people to
                        remain for all time uncivilised, or the people of Persia to decay, while
                        India looks on and England is indifferent? Have we realised the significance
                        of through-trains from Moscow reaching Port Arthur before the war commenced
                        ? Here lies the fact we have to reckon with. The process of railway exten-
                        sion in Asia will surely continue, and, instead of regarding it with fear
                        and suspicion, we should endeavour to meet it, and secure for ourselves some
                        share of those advantages which will otherwise inevitably fall to Russia
                        alone.</p>

                    <p>Lancashire Cotton Profits. — A cotton spinning company at Rochdale has just
                        de- clared a profit for the past" three months equal to 371/2 per cent, per
                        annum on the share- capital of the concern, alter interest allowed for loans
                        and adequate depreciation. The factory is a large one, but the gain declared
                        does not do more than fairly represent the extraordinary profits of
                        Lancashire. It is said, and there is some foundation for the remark, that
                        many mills dare not declare publicly the large gains coming round this year
                        in both spinning yarn and manufacturing piece goods.</p>

                        Butler was of opinion that this eland was more nearly allied to tho West
                        African form than to that of South Africa, and proposed to distinguish it as
                        Taurotragus derbianus gigas. It differed from the typical T. derianus in its
                        much lighter body-colour (a pale “café-au-lait” fawn instead of a rich ruddy
                        brown), in the greyish white of the black-craned dewlap, and in carrying
                        grander horns.</p>

                    <dateline>Luxor, May 10.</dateline>
                    <p>Luxor,that was bat a short while ago full of life, is now lonely fend
                        deserted, and its princi- pal streets,that were before a blaze of lights,
                        are abandoned to darkness and to the dogs ; not even the Poet Office lights
                        up though it has a lantern by the door, it remains in total darkness, for
                        now there are no tourists, only the local people, and what are they ?</p>
                    <p>Smallpox, of a virulent kind, is also raging; here. Miss Gibson, of the
                        American Mission, is down with it, also two Greek ladies, residents of this
                        place, and two Greek children. Of the natives one cannot get any exact
                        information though we see a lot of funerals going past What we cannot
                        understand is why should the sanitary authorities, or whoever are
                        responsible, have placed the smallpox hospital, or two tents and some huts
                        made of matting, a few yards from the station, in foot I believe in the
                        station ground, and right up against the town t These hospitals are always
                        placed at a dis- tance from towns and villages, and generally to the south,
                        but there it is; right up to the station, the first thing that greets a
                        traveller coming from Cairo. If the sanitary authorities have placed the
                        hospital there for their con- venience, we cannot understand how the Railway
                        Administration have allowed it.</p>

                    <head>FAYOUM BRIGANDAGE CASE. OFFICIAL VERSION.</head>
                    <p>The case of brigandage at Biahmo, in the Fayoum, which was reported in our
                        issues of the 8th and 9th inst by our Fayoum Correspondent, has resolved
                        itself into a case of an armed attack, on the house of one Suliman Said,
                        when the thieves stole a certain amount of gold.</p>
                    <p>It appears that the said Suliman Said had recently dismissed from his service
                        three servants, who are now under arrest for dishonesty, and that one of
                        these servants is strongly suspected of having set the thieves on his track
                        if not of having actually partici- pated in the attack. These men, alone,
                        were cognizant of the change of the place of concealment of Suliman Said’s
                        safe, and it is known that they have recently entertained in Biahmo certain
                        Sudanese whose bad charac- ter is well-known.</p>
                    <p>The house of the omdeh was not oven visited by the thieves, and his inaction
                        at this time is explained by his confession that on hearing the firing of
                        guns he was too frightened to do anything but lie down with his face to the
                        ground. All the men who are under arrest on suspicion of having taken part
                        in the attack are well-known to the police, and several of them have been
                        for- merly under police supervision.</p>
                    <p>An enquiry into the matter is at present being held by Major Elgood,
                        Inspector of the Ministry of the Interior, and the Adviser expect a full
                        report in the course of a day. or two. Two Sudanese men, Farag and Abdel
                        Said, and Mabruk a fellah, have already been examined, whilst Mohamed Shebat
                        and two men from the Ezbet Boghos Pasha are under arrest and will probably
                        undergo exam- ination to-day. Farag at first denied ever having been in
                        Biahmo, but later confessed having visited it three times. Abdel Said, the
                        other Sudanese, admitted that Farag had pressed him to go with him to rob
                        the house of Snliman Said of Biahmo, but that he refused, and he asserted
                        that Fang returned the next morning and related to him what had taken place.
                        He accused Abbas el Zumur of being ringleader of this party and said that
                        the latter, having packed up the stolen gold, rode off on a camel, promising
                        the distribution of the spoil at a later date: Mabruk, the fellah, confessed
                        that he was concerned in the robbery, and said that the two preceding
                        witnesses and also the three other men under arrest were participators in
                        the crime. He stated that he and his companions met Abbas el Zumur
                        /indiscernible/ Kaabe, near Biahmo, and that as they were approaching
                        Suliman Said's house they me two ghaffirs from whom they took sway their

                    <head>ARCHDEACON FOR THE SUDAN,</head>
                    <p>The Bishop in Jerusalem has appointed the Rev. Llewellyn Henry Gwynne to be
                        "Arch- deacon of the Church of England in the Sudan." The appointment is
                        much like that of an archdeacon in India, who is usually a Government
                        chaplain in charge of troops and of the residents in the station, as well as
                        a Division officer. Archdeacon Gwynne has fu - filled these duties at
                        Khartoum for some years past; and has won the confidence and approba- tion
                        of the Government by his tact and dili- gence ; and he has also won the love
                        and trust of the residents at Khartoum. The appoint- ment is a necessary one
                        in the interests of this Bishopric; it is also a popular one with all who
                        know the new Archdeacon.</p>

                    <head>SUDAN IVORY.</head>
                    <p>An important change has recently been made in connection with the Sudan ivory
                        trade. The Government monopoly, which had been previously removed from the
                        Kordofaz Province, has also been removed from the Bahr el-Ghazal and Upper
                        Nile districts. The royalty levied has at the same time been duced from 15
                        to 10 per cent. The result of this change is that the value of the exports
                        rose from L.E. 22,000 in. 1903 to over L.E. 30,000 in 1904. The Sudan
                        merchants and their agents are extending, their operations as far south as
                        the French Congo and as far west as Wadai. The export of immature tusks is
                        stopped, but a small amount is still brought in, cut up and made into
                        ornaments. Whether the production and export of ivory will con- tinue
                        depends, of course, on whether the ele- phants survive the advance of
                        civilisation in the Sudan.</p>

                    <p>In his usual monthly circular Mr. Horn- castle has a good deal to say about
                        the Egyptian mining industry, and refers to the fact that several new
                        ventures may be anti- cipated at no distant date. He remarks: "All the facts
                        to hand are of such a nature that the popularity of this field is fully
                        warranted. The Egyptians are as keen as anybody else to share in what is
                        going, which is a reliable criterion to stand by. They at any rate have
                        falsified the old proverb as to a prophet having no honor in his own

                        is naturally to be assumed that they are thoroughly in the know or they
                        would not be so free in taking advantage of every opportunity that presents
                        itself. It is the general opinion in Egypt that the boom has come to stay,
                        and that we are now only in the initial stage of an era of great prosperity.
                        All the evidence we can collect, every fact of im- portance that has come to
                        light, everything indeed, confirms this opinion.”</p>
