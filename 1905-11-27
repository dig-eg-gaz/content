                            <p>Reports from the provinces show that serious
                                risings of peasants in many country districts,
                                and of strikers in the towns, continue. The
                                employes here are enforcing a combined lock-
                                out because the workmen were practically
                                taking 8 hours per diem work.</p>
                            <p>The results of the congress of Zemstvos
                                appears to be that there is little chance of the
                                chiefs of the liberal party co-operating with
                                M. Witte.</p>
                            <p>The lock-out is rapidly assuming a general
                                character.</p>

                            <p>The sailors and a regiment of troops have
                                mutinied. Rear Admiral Pessrevaki was shot
                                and seriously wounded while haranguing the
                                men, whom he threatened to have shot down
                                by the troops. The mutineers have ordered the
                                Admiral in Chief to leave in three days. The
                                dockers have joined the mutineers and serious
                                rioting has taking place.</p>

                            <p>An official communique ascribes the mutiny
                                at Sevastopol to the Socialist propoganda. The
                                gravity of the situation is admitted, though it
                                is not expected that looting and plundering
                                will take place. It is rumoured that the disaffec-
                                tion is spreading among the naval battalions
                                here.</p>
                            <p>The most serious feature of the mutiny at
                                Sevastopol is the wholesale detection of the
                                troops, who apparently made common cause
                                with the mutineers. Only one regiment
                                remains loyal. Up to the present there have
                                been no excesses. The silence of the offi-
                                cial communique as to measure for the
                                repression of the mutiny is regarded as
                                confirming the rumour that the warships
                                are in the hands of the mutineers. The
                                revolt has been carefully prepared, and
                                deliberately carried out.</p>
                            <p>The Council of Ministers have approved the
                                proposal to grant 15,000,000 roubles to im-
                                prove the condition of the railway men.</p>

                        <p>Suez, Sunday.</p>
                        <p>As I wired you yesterday, the R.I.M.S.
                            Dufferin arrived at Suez in the afternoon
                            flying the Viceroy's flag. As soon as she drop-
                            ped anchor, she was dressed with flags. The
                            director of the Quarantine Office, accompanied
                            by two medical officers, boarded the Dufferin
                            on arrival and practique was given at 3 c'clock
                            when Mr. D.A. Cameron, British Consul,
                            welcomed Lord and Lady Curzon. Shortly
                            afterwards the Governor of Suez, accompanied
                            by the chief of police and others, paid his
                            lordship an official call.</p>
                        <p>At about 5.30 p.m. Lord and Lady Curzon,
                            accompanied by Lord Curzon's secretary (Mr.
                            Nathan), the Governor of Suez, Mr. Cameron,
                            and others, landed at the passport pier, and
                            proceeded to the railway station, where a
                            special carriage had been placed at their
                            disposal.</p>
                        <p>The train arrived at Suez station at 5.50;
                            a guard of honor was drawn up and saluted
                            the distinguished visitors. H.E. the Governor
                            of Suez presented Lady Curzon with a beautiful
                            bouquet of flowers, and at 6 p.m. the
                            train left the station amidst the cheers of the
                            spectators.</p>
                        <p>Lord and Lady Curzon proceeded to Cairo,
                            and, I understand, will join the P. &amp; O. Mon-
                            golia at port Said to-morrow for Marseilles.</p>
                        <p>The rest of the party remained on board the
                            Dufferin, and will be transferred to the

                            proceeded to the British Agency, where they
                            are staying as guests of Lord and Lady
                            Cromer.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday afternoon Lord Curzon went for
                            a drive in Cairo, while those who happened
                            to visit the Zoological Gardens in the afternoon
                            had the pleasure of seeing Lady Cromer and
                            Lady Curzon, looking very well. Lady Curzon
                            looked charming in a cream gown and black
                            picture hat.</p>
                        <p>This morning Lord and Lady Curzon visited
                            the Pyramids, and were expected to pay a
                            visit to the bazaars later. They will leave for
                            Port Said by special train at about 4 p.m.
                            to-day.</p>
                        <p>We understand that Lord Curzon, although
                            still feeling the effects of overwork and anxiety,
                            is in much improved health.</p>

                        of shareholders, called for the purpose of
                        having an account laid before them showing
                        the manner in which the winding-up has been
                        conducted and the property of the company
                        disposed of, and of hearing th explaination
                        of the liquidators, and to determine the

                        documents of the company and of the liquida-
                        tors should be disposed of.</p>
                    <p>The meeting was held at noon at the
                        National Bank of Egypt, Mr. F.T.
                        Rowlatt in the chair. There were fourteen
                        shareholders present in person, representing a
                        total of 645 ordinary shares, while a furhter
                        618 ordinary shares were represented by proxy.
                        The comparatively small amount of captial
                        represented was of course owing to the fact
                        that the great bulk of the shares of La
                        Societe Egyptienne de la Daira Sanieh, its 
                        successor.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rowlatt made a short explanatory
                        speech in the following terms:</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen,- This meeting has been called
                        to comply with the requirements of the Com-
                        panies Acts. It is the last step inthe liquida-
                        tion of the Daira Sanieh Company,- its ob-
                        sequies, in fact. As you are all aware, the Daira
                        Sanieh Company, Limited (which I will call the
                        Enlish company), by an agreement made in
                        March last, transferred to "La Societe Egyp-
                        tienne de la Daira Sanieh" the whole of its
                        assets of whatsoever description, subject of
                        course to its liabilities. In consideration of
                        this transfer, the English company received
                        fully-paid ordinary and deferred shares of
                        the Egyptian company, identical in every
                        respect with those of the English company,
                        and to a like nominal amount. The principal
                        duty of the liquidators consisted in giving
                        these new shares in exchange for the
                        share certificates and bearer warrants of the
                        English company- share for share. This ex-
                        change has been effected, and the shares of the
                        English company duly cancelled, with the
                        exception of a small number which have not
                        yet been presented for exchange. The holders
                        of these shares are, however, expected to come
                        in very shortly, and, until they do so, they will
                        of course receive no dividend. As you will all
                        understand, this transfer from the English
                        company to the Egyptian company did not in
                        itself necessitate the preparation of any
                        accounts, the operation consisting, if I may so
                        describe it, in taking the whole concern
                        out of one box and placing it in another-
                        the whole of the assets of whatsoever nature
                        after deduction of the whole of the liabilities.
                        It was, however, necessary to prepare accounts
                        in order to open the books of the Egyptian
                        company. These accounts, conssiting of a
                        balance-sheet and a profit and loss account
                        as at 8th July last, have been audited
                        by Messrs. Russell and Kerr, and are now
                        placed on the table. I will not read to you
                        the resolutions on which you are asked to
                        vote:</p>
                    <p>1. That the explanation of the liquidators
                        as to the method in which the liquidation has
                        been conducted and the property of the com-
                        pany disposed of having been received and the
                        accounts having been submitted, the same
                        are hereby approved and adopted.</p>
                    <p>2. That the books, accounts and documents
                        of the company and of the liquidators thereof
                        be forthwith handed over to La Societe
                        Egyptienne de la Daira Sanieh.</p>
                    <p>On being put to the vote, both resolutions
                        were carried unanimously on a show of hands.</p>

                    <p>With refernce to the article that appeared
                        in our issue of last Saturday regarding the
                        contract signed at Cairo by Mr. Stangen, local
                        representative of the Hamburg-Amerika Line,
                        and the directors of the Anglo-American Co.,
                        for the amalgamation of their Nile tourist
                        services, we are now informed that to provide
                        the necessary capital to meet the greatly in-
                        creased traffic that is expected from this
                        fusion the latter company has decided to
                        issue 5,000 new shares, which the Hamburg-
                        Amerika Line will take up at the price of
                        £5 each, or £1 premium. Of this sum £5,000

                        has been inserted in the contract as regards
                        the deration of the amalgamation, which is
                        an important point in favor of the Anglo-
                        American Co. After the close of the current

                        vous demander de prendre les mesures ur-
                        gentes necessaires pour empecher la faillite qui
                        equivaudrait pour vous, Actionnares, a une
                        ruine complete et pour les Obligataires a une
                        perte importante.</p>

                        tragiquede votre ancient President, survenue
                        le 27 Aout et les revelations qui s'en suivi-
                        rent? Nous apprimes l'echesnce prochaine de
                        traites pour un montant de 24 Millions environ
                        acceptees par deux des Administrateurs dele-
                        gues. Il fallait eviter a tout prix les protets
                        et la faillite, sauf a etudier ensuite de pres, les
                        consequences de cette charge imprevue.</p>
                    <p>Sur l'avis de nos Avocats a Paris et en
                        Egypt nous demandions a etre admis an
                        benefice du Concordat preventif et le 19

                        ration du Concordat. La Juge-Commissaire
                        nomma trois Controleurs: Sir Elwin Palmer,
                        Gouverneur de la Banque Nationale d'Egypte
                        et Ancient Conseiller financier du Gouverne-
                        ment Egyptien; S.E. Harari Pacha, Directeur

                        Delegue de la Salt and Soda. Il designa
                        aussi des Experts charges d'exeminer la
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>Eu meme temps que les Experts s'occu-
                        perent de l'elaboration de leuf rapport, nous
                        procedions, avec l'aide de specialistes designes
                        par les principaux groupes de creanciers et
                        d'interesses a l'examen des charges et des
                        resources. Les traites dont le decouvert avait
                        necessite le depot du bilan etaient signees a
                        concurrance de 18 millions par un des admi-
                        nistrateur-delegues; a concurrence de 6 mil-
                        lions par l'autre, chacun ignorant ce que
                        l'autre avait signe. Le troisieme Admi-
                        ni trateur-Delegue et tous les membres
                        du Conseil, autre que feu le President,
                        ignoraient tout. Nous decouvrions une contre-
                        partie de ces effects consistant en traites
                        acceptees en blanc par la liquidation H. Say &amp;
                        Co Mais vis-a-vis de tous porteurs, nous
                        etions responsables. Nos avocats ne nous

                    <p>Ce n'etait le qu-une des phases de ce que
                        revela la mort de M. Cronier. On reconnut
                        alors que le groupement des resultats divers
                        de l'industrie sociale avec des operations de
                        commerce et d'arbitrages executees sur une
                        grande echelle par M. Cronier, en dehors de
                        tout controle, et reglees ensemble en fin d'exer-
                        cice, ainsi que le fait que l'ensemble avait tou-
                        jours donne un benefice apparent, avaient

                    <p>Nous nous sommes preoccupes de determi-

                        croyons pourvoir mieux faire, que d'adopter le
                        bilan dresse par Messieurs les Controleurs. Il a
                        ete serieusement etabli en dehors des questions
                        de personnalites et de polemiques irritantes
                        qui interviennent trop souvent dans l'appre-
                        ciation d'une situation comme celle ui nous
                        a ete faite. Nous erons a meme de defendre
                        completement ce bilan et ses bases des discus-
                        sions de detail.</p>
                    <p>Vous avez a decider aujourd'hui s'il y a lieu
                        de laisser declarer la faillite et liquider l'Actif
                        dans des circonstances qui ne laissent absolu-
                        ment rien au capital actions, ou au contraire,
                        de tenter par une reconstitution financiere, et
                        sous une direction sage et ecouome, de rememttre
                        l'affaire sur pied et tout en diminuant la perts
                        actuelle de vous donner les moyens de recupe-
                        rer peut-etre une partie de ce qui a ete englouti.</p>
                    <p>Messieurs les Controleurs ont bien voulu se
                        charger, en attendant que vous ayiez donne
                        pouvoir a vos mandataires, de le faire, de
                        trausmettre certaines propositions au Juge-
                        Commissaire. La base essentielle est que- apres
                        avoir traite avec les creaneiers des diverses
                        categories, vous receviez en echange de trois
                        actions actuelles, une action nouvelle con-
                        courant aux resultats de l'entreprise.</p>
                    <p>D'apres l'etat desnegeciations actueilement
                        en cours a Paris nous pouvons presumer que
                        ce te combinaison sera maintenue de que'que
                        feconque les porleurs des traites Cronier, les
                        Obligataires et la Daira Sugar Corporation
                        fixent, vis a vis les uns des autres, la maniere
                        dont seront reglees leurs creances respectives.</p>
                    <p>Vous recevrez ulterienrement que'que de-
                        tails sur la situation toute speciale de la Daira
                        Sugar Corporation, resultant des contrats
                        passes avec elle.</p>
                    <p>D'autre part les Obligataires concentiraient
                        dans le projet objet des pourparlers actnels,
                        une reduction de ringt pour cent sur le chiffre
                        nominal de leurs titres ce qui constitue une
                        perte inferieure a 20% sur les pius demission.
                        Une reduction analoque est demandes aux
                        porteurs des traites Cronier.</p>
                    <p>D'ailleurs c'est a titre de simple renesigne-
                        ment que nous vous indiquons residonnees. Il
                        ne s'agit pour le mement que de donner mandat
                        d'obtenir si possible un concordat aux meil-
                        eures conditions pour ves creanciere et vouer.</p>
