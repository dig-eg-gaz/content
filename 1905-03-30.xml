                    <head>GERMANY AND MOROCCO.</head>
                    <p>Count von Bulow's speech in the Reichstag yesterday, an epitome of which
                        appear in our telegrams, clearly shows that Germany intends to have a finger
                        in the Moorish pie, and from to-morrow, when the Kaiser lands at Tangier, a
                        note development in the history of Morocco may not improbably be dated. We
                        are also informed in A telegram from Paris that the Sultah is preparing to
                        utilise the visit to the utmost, and has already begun to stiffen his
                        opposition to the French policy. The situation is one which cannot be wholly
                        pleasing to France. She has ear marked Morocco as her own, and she is not
                        prepared to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for Germany any more than for
                        England. Her dissatisfaction will not be diminished by the Kaiser's visit to
                        Tangier, where he is to be received with every official honor, and where the
                        Mi ore will welcome him as a protector against France encroachment- Now, is
                        it too much to say that, before the disaster to the Russian arms, Germany
                        would have been extremely careful how she touched France on a parti­cularly
                        tender spot 1 Is it, again, not clear</p>
                    <p>that it is to interest of Germany to try to </p>
                    <p>make terms with France, who will be asked to buy off German interference in
                        Morocco at the price -of concessions, the nature of which it is not possible
                        to specify, but which may reason­ably be expected to bode no good to British
                        trading interests when France shall be in a posi­tion to give valuable
                        practical support to the trade of ono Power against the trade of another I
                        The incident is not only significant in regard to Morocco, but it is part
                        and parcel of the entire change which must come over the political situation
                        throughout the world from the shrinkage of Russian prestige, and the utter
                        collapse of the military power of the northern giant baa set Germany free to
                        devote her attention— if she sues Hit—to sundry matters of interest to her
                        which, aha could not so well took after while obsessed by the haunt­ing
                        dread of an attack by a France-Russian combination.</p>

                    <p>Count von Billow confirmed in the Reichstag that Germany did not seek any
                        territorial advantage in Morocco. She will simply see to the maintenance of

                    <p>Count von Billow, speaking in the Reichstag, said that Germany's policy
                        regarding the equal rights of all trading nations in Morocco is unchanged,
                        but if an attempt were made to change the international status of that
                        country or the control of the "open door," Germany must take increased heed
                        that her economic interests in Morocco are not endangered. Germany,
                        therefore, intended to enter into communication with the did ten forthwith.

                    <head>THE "HIGHER CRITICISM IN ARABIC.</head>
                    <p>To The EDITOR or THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
                    <p>Sir,— I sympathies with &amp;quot;Grammarian&amp;#39;s&amp;quot; latter
                        published in your issue of the 25th instant. I do not admire Dirr&amp;#39;s
                        Colloquial Arabic Grammar, but nevertheless, the criticism on it was too
                        contemptuous. In the same way, your critic slashed mercilessly into Colon el
                        Green&amp;#39;s Grammar some time ago. and therefore "Grammarian&amp;quot;
                        may bo justified is resenting the autocratic tone of the very superior
                        person who does your criticisms for you. A little humility, a little
                        conciliation would not hurt year critic, who, after all, is bat * foreign
                        student, of indifferent pronunciation, of limited knowledge of the
                        vernacular, who would not hold his own in a friendly conversation among
                        educated Egyptians, His own spoken Arabic would be a confusion of classical
                        and vulgar— oh, ye gods and little fishes, what a confusion!</p>
                    <p>II there is one thing that makes us ridiculous in the eyes of the Egyptians
                        it is our foolishness in trying to write grammars of Arabic, of
                        modem-Arabic, of Arabic as wo think it ought to spoken and written, linage
                        an Egyptian bringing out a grammar and vocabulary of English, London
                        Cockney, of dialects of Lancashire, Essex, Berkshire, Somerset, all muddled
                        op together, as spoken by our railway porters, housemaids and shoeblacks
                        throughout the country, Vulgar Arabic is dreadfully vulgarian, as Mr.
                        Mantalini might say, it is "dem'd low.&amp;quot; Thera is only ORE Arabic,
                        and that is the Classical language. Anything else is anarchy and confusion,
                        each man putting forth his own ideas and talking as if he bad discovered
                        Arabia and had made it his private property. Fence to ail such, just 200
                        years ago, the great Lord Bacon, not yet Solicitor General, came to spend
                        the winter in Egypt, accompanied by a young student of the Inner Temple,
                        John Selden, and many other learned lawyers and future judges.</p>
                    <p>Selden became enamored of the colloquial language, and compiled a thick,
                        congealed book on the subject, of which the MB. may still be found in the
                        Khedivial Library. Bacon was gathering local</p>
                    <p>color for his play of "Antony and Cleopatra,&amp;quot; but he</p>
                    <p>found time to discuss the grammar of Arabic, as he</p>
                    <p>and his learned disciples dwelt together is the</p>
                    <p>desert suburbs to the north of Cairo. Bacon did not</p>
                    <p>believe in modern Arabic, he loved Latin, he had</p>
                    <p>just brought out his &amp;quot;Advancement of Learning,&amp;quot; and</p>
                    <p>he engaged a sheikh to translate it into good</p>
                    <p>classical Arabia. The MB. may be seen in the</p>
                    <p>Khedivial Library, dated. 1605-6. Bacon used to</p>
                    <p>chaff John Selden, and to call him a Daniel come to</p>
                    <p>judgment, a just judge, and eventually persuaded</p>
                    <p>that good youth to abandon the attempt to teach the</p>
                    <p>Arabs their own language. And now, 220 years</p>
                    <p>have passed, and lo I we are at the same old game</p>
