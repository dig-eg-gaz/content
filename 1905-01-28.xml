                        important engagement was proceeding. It was stated that a Russian force had
                        crossed the Hun-Ho on the Japanese left. The Japanese were then attacking
                        the Russians. (Reuter.)</p>

                        advance against the enemy. They argue that now Port Arthur has fallen there

                    <p>Amateur Theatricals.—The date of the performance in Cairo of “The Pirates of
                        Penzance” is fixed for the 14th or 15th of February. It will take place in
                        the Opera House and it is hoped that H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught will be
                        able to be present. The rehearsals promise well and reflect great credit
                        upon Major Delavoye, the stage manager. All the company works with spirit,
                        and both principals and chorus have put in some excellent drill during the
                        last three weeks. The ladies’ gavotte in the 1st act is a very graceful
                        measure and ought to prove one of the successes of the piece. The policemen,
                        with Captain Tucker, R.E., at their head, provide the comic element, and
                        their ‘business’ is very good fun. The box-office will shortly be opened ;
                        the booking is likely to be full, all the baignoires for the first night
                        being already bespoken. The performance will be repeated at intervals during
                        the season.</p>

                        effect that the 8,000 pounds, which had disappeared, have been found again,
                        and that the soldiers, who had been arrested ou suspicion of having stolen
                        the money, have been released, is totally erroneous and has no foundation in
                        fact.</p>
                    <p>It seems that in the specie van the cases containing the money were arranged
                        in three rows, each case having its own number and the amount of the money
                        contained therein marked on it. The cases nearest the sliding</p>
                    <p>door of the van contained sums of about £3,000 in Maria Theresa dollars. The
                        stolen box was in the middle of the second row and the thief, after lifting
                        out the box from among the others, arranged them so as to fill up the gap in
                        their line</p>
                    <p>From this it would seem more probable than ever that the thief or thieves had
                        sometime allowed them lor effecting their nefarious enterprise. It is not
                        considered likely that the thief was a European, but it a Moslem he was
                        evidently one of those to whom the Arab proverb Yiferagu mal en Nebi" is

                    <p>ENORMOUS DEVELOPMENT.</p>
                    <p>The Egyptian Customs returns for December are always of exceptional
                        importance inasmuch as they furnish us with the statistics not only for that
                        mouth, but for the whole year, and enable us to anticipate, in so far as
                        regards the larger totals, the annual report of the Customs Administration,
                        which will not appear tor some mouths.</p>
                    <p>The imports for December have maintained the upward tendency which has been
                        incidence throughout the year, being LE. 638,959 in excess over those for
                        the same month in 1903, and bringing the total imports to the record figure
                        of LE 20,559,588. This is an enormous increase, for we considered the
                        imports for 1903 to be extraordinary, when they showed a total of L.E.
                        16,753,190. That was a record, being nearly two millions 13%, over that of
                        1902, and 1 1/2 millions, or 10% over the total for 1901, the highest
                        touched previously to 1903. Rut 1904, with its increase of nearly four
                        millions, L.E. 3,806,398, over the previous years, is the best on record and

                    <p>Our share in Egypt's import trade for the last few years is as follows :</p>

                    <p>These figures show that our share of Egypt's total trade in 1901 was 37.4, in
                        1909 37.5, in 1903 36.9, and last year 99.8.</p>
                    <p>A full analysis and comparison of our trade with Egypt as compared with that
                        of other countries is impossible without the fuller details that will be
                        supplied by the forthcoming annual returns, so we shall reserve until their

                        chiefly increased. The following figures represent the total increase in

                        was LE 16,702,730, an increase of L.E. 1,025,916. Bean exports rose from
                        L.E. 196,515 to LE. 953,914, onions from LE. 191,158 to LE. 965,974, and

                        H.R.H. tbe Duke and Duchess of Connaught, the improvement in the weather,
                        and the excellent sport provided by the K.S.C. on Wednesday, all helped to
                        attract a very large attendance, and no previous meeting, in the Cairo
                        season of 1904-5, could have rivalled it in the numbers of residents and
                        visitors present. H. R. H. Prince Gustavus Adolphus, H. H. Prince Mohamed
                        Aly Pasha the Earl and Countess of Cromer, the Duke and Duchess of
                        Devonshire, Sir William Gafatin, the Hon. F. O. Lindley and the Hon. Mrs.

                        Parvis, Milhem Bey Shakour and Miss Shakour, Mr. and Mrs. Wylde were there
                        and many others—in fact, almost all the best-known members of Cairo society,
                        and the grand-stand and enclosure presented a most brilliant spectacle.</p>
                    <p>The racing, it less sensational than on Wednesday, presented many points of
                        interest, but it was the greatest of pities that there were such small
                        fields in the second and fourth races. The race of the day was the Paddock
                        Handicap, which resulted in a well-earned victory for Ishak Boy Hussein's
                        Farhan II., which also came home second in the Galloway Handicap. Khalil
                        Pasha Kayat, though be could not repeat Wednesday’s success, did well, and
                        Mr. Lockett had the satisfaction of riding two winners.</p>
                    <p>The starts were managed with the minimum of delay. Shortly after the arrival
                        of the Khedive, escorted by a detachment of his Body Guard and greeted by
                        the strains of the Khédivial Anthem, came the first race. The Duke and
                        Duchess of Connaught arrived after the second race, accompanied by the
                        Princesses, and followed by their escort. They were received with the

                        ahead again ; and Latiff</p>
                    <p>then came up from the crowd and passed Agib, who was done at the corner.

                        Latiff never got very near Farhan II., who got in by 2 lengths. Latiff was
