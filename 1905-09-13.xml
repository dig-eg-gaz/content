                <head>ANTIQUITIES IN THE SUDAN. special number of the " Sudan Gazette "</head>
                <p>which has just reached to us,contains some most interesting new ordinances dealing with a great variety of subjects, which came from cruely interesting new ordinances dealing with a great varety of subjects to the expreportion of rights, andfrom vagabondage to the preservation of an-tiquities. The “Antiquities Ordinance" of 1905 seems to us to have been moat excellently and comprehensively drafted. That its promulgation will delight the scientific world is certain for ita very comprehensivaness makes it possible                               for the Sudan Administration to preserve any
                    1 buildiog* monument* remain* or objects”	
                    we quote the text of the ordinance—“of what¬ever age or people which are illustrative of arts, science, industry, religion, history, litera¬ture, or custom, and were built produced, or made in the Sudan, or brought there into before the year' 1788 of the Gregorian calender." This definition of antiqaitias will preserve the memorials of invading Pharaohs and Ethiopian king* the inscriptions of the Roman officials who guarded the Egyptian frontier near Syena against the invading Ethiopians and Blmnmye* and the rained churches and monasteries of the once Christian kingdom of Dongola Those who fear that interesting memorials of the Sudan wars and the Mahdists domination may be destroyed, should be comforted by the fact that the Governor General of the Sadan ahall have power by publishing a notice to declare any building or any other thing attached to the soil and only removable with difficulty which dates from the year 1788 to after, an                        antiquity within the meaning of the act Areas where antiqoitim exist can be acquired by the Government which becomes by the ordinance the de jure owner of all antiquities movable or immovable and is therefore entitled to punish unauthorised excavators, eehakb digger* or unlicensed vendors of antiquities. The latter clans too prevalent un¬fortunately in Egypt, will be kept under excellent control in the Southern de-pendency. The gentelman who mysteriously produced papyri, statuettes or coins, and con- duots negotiations in a whisper will .have no capitulations to protect him in the Sudan and will only be allowed to sell such objects that have had the refusal of the Coneetwator of Antiquities at Khartoum.
                    Although the Sudan has never the home of any advanced civilivation, its*anti quities deserve perservation and study. The Ethiopian script of the rulers of Napata and the kingdom of Meroe has not yet been deci¬phered, letters from Eyptian Pharaoh to their Sudsnoea vassals or overlords may yet be discovered, and inscriptions yet give us a full knowledge of the history of Sabaoo, who conqoared the Delta or Tirhakah, who fought on the Egypt jr,,. fron- tiere against Sennacherib and JSsaithaddon. At all events we are not likely to hear that antiquities have been rutslessly  destroyed by thieves, unable to obtain the prices they d- mand from hesitating or suspicious pursuits and we hopce that the Sudan Government will show equal wisdom to that manifested in its recent ordinance when consdering applications from would-be excavators

                        Despatches from Bake yesterday afternoon state that the situation is getting worse every minute. The town is full of troops, who have practically destroyed eight quarters by artillery tire. The Tartars and Kurds are still plunder¬ing.
                        A landed proprietor, Prince Tsitsianoff, has been assassinated at Gori in the district of Tiflis.
                        A conference of the leading firms dealing in naphtha has been held and has memorialised the Tsar, stating that they will not attempt to resume the industry, unless solid guarantees be given that they will receive adequate pro¬tection.	(Renter)

                        The Cossacks fired a volley into a meeting of 2,000 Social Democrats here. There are a hundred casualties and many were trampled to death in the ensuing panic.
                        Prince Tumanoff, Inspector of Railways, has been assassinated in a neighbouring station.

                        The Mikasa played a great part in the Russo-Japanese war, being Admiral Togo’s flag¬ship in the autions of August 10,1904and May 27 and 28, 1905 at 1 ort Arthur and Tsushima. She was built at Barrow, being launched on No¬vember 8; 1900, displaced 15,200 tons and did 18.6 knots on trial. Her armour and armament made her a match for any completed war-vessel except perhaps the British ships of the King Edward VII. class, and her loss will be a great blow to the Japanese navy.

                            Great doubts are expressed here as to Marahual Ahmed Faizi Pasha’s recapture of San. It ap-i- pears that the Marshal has telegraphed too Constantinople demanding farther large reiun- forcements immediately, and it is feared thaat after getting into Sand., the Turkish army willl find some difficulty in getting out again.
                            [If our London correspondent is correctly  ini formed, the situation of the Turkish forces ina the Yemen is grave, whether Sana has been' really captured or not. A report, according to which a certain Said Hisham had appeared with a large force in the passes behind the 'Turks, who had been drawn on by the Imam Yehya towards Sand., may explain the situation. In view of the official rejoioings over the vic¬tory in Constantinople the sudden reversal of the situation is rather curious, ED. E. G.]

                        <head>PROTECTION TO BATHERS.</head>
                        <p>We are informed that yesterday afternoon the Delegation of the Municipality decided to recommend the Municipal Commission to open a credit of L.E. 40 for the purchase of life belts and buoys. We referred recently to the propo¬sals laid before the Delegation by the acting Commandant of Police. We now learn that the e proposals have been modified with a view to securing more efficacious means of protec¬tion to bathers
                            Twenty five coast guard posts between Fort Agami and Aboukir are each to be provided with two life belts and a light life buoy, which one be thrown to a distance of 40 metres by a person of average strength, and a considerable length of stout rope or cord. Should any bather he seen in difficulties, it will be the duty of the nearest coastguardaman to inform the post, tie a belt round his body and go in to the rescue, holding another life belt to which a line is attached to pass to the drowning man. The buoys can also be thrown to persons who are in reach of the shore, while the coast guard is putting on his belt and getting the rope and the second life belt ready for use. It is hoped that the supply of life saving material to all the coast guard posts within the limits we have indicated will be effected in the near future, and that the last three weeks of the bathing season will be marked by no more of the fatalities that have been so painfully frequent this summer.
                            We may say that we hear, on what we believe to be good authority, that measures will be taken in the winter which will set Alex andria ahead of any other city, not only in the Mediterranean, but in the world, in all matters connected with life saving, both as regards equipment and regulations for that parpose.

                        <p>Some time back the Sanitary Department elaborated regulations concerning the draining ai d filling up of the village birketa, or marshes, that still exist io many localities, and which are the cause of much sickness. These regula¬tions remained, seemingly, a dead letter, for we hear that new regulations are now being prepared for the approval of Sir Horace Pinching on his return in November, before submission to the Council of Ministers. Accord¬ing to these the birkets will have to be filled up by the present proprietors within three years, in default of which the Sanitary Depart¬ment will proceed to do the work itself, and on its completion will sell the land acquired, by public auction, to defray the expense inourred. The project is still under discussion and all the conditions have not yet been settled.</p>

                            <p>A special issue of the "Sudan Gaietto," dated August 24, contains a series of important ordinances dealing with a great variety of subjects. We refer in our leading article to that ordinance which has the preservation of antiquities for its subject. The remainder deal with "cruelty to animals " "the settle¬ment of rights over waste, forest, and un- occupied lands," and the expropriation of some rights; vagabondage; the demarcation of bound¬aries , and the making of surveys.
                                The seoond of these ordinances, which is of considerable general interest and importance will he published to morrow on our fifth page. These which deal with cruelty to animals, and with vagabondage are admirably worded and the latter is moat comprehensive, imposing penalties on any one convicted as an "idle person"— i.e. any person "who bring able wholly or in part to maintain himself or his family,wilfully neglects or refuses to do so, any person who wanders abroad or places himself in any street or public place to beg or gather alms, or causes or encourages children to do so, anises from age or infirmity he is unable to 'sain his living, and any person who has no i settled home, has no ostensible	of

                       The eclipse of the sun yesterday—which by the way was very clearly observable here —seem to have accentuated the beat wave which set in some few days ago. In the plains there has been a very trying damp heat, though the thermometer has not registered above 100 to 101 Fahrenheit Even on Troodos we hear that the nights this week have been warm, whereas occasional fires had to be in¬dulged in a week or so ago. Picnic and tennis parties have been the order of the day up there, and at present the tennis superiority of Nicosia or of Iimassol trembles in the balance ! In Nicosia all efforts to keep up golf and cricket have been given up, but tennis and croquet can still be enjoyed by the few officials left down there.

It has not, up to the present, produced the good results that were anticipat¬ed from it, hut there is every reason to hope that under the new arrangement—and, per¬haps, it may he added, with a larger share of good luck than has hitherto attended its operations—excellent work may he accomplish ed, both in the way of carring out userul, practical experiments in the production of improved qualities of seed, and also in train¬ing a class of native instructors, who, under the control and supervision of the Agricultural Department, shall be qualified to teach and assist native cultivators in their agricultural operations.</p>

                <head>THE PEACE CONDITIONS</head>
                <p>The following synopsis of the Peace Treat) given by Reuter’s Agency may be accepted as authentic
                    The Peace Treaty opened with a preamble reciting that his Majesty the Autocrat of All the Russian and his Majesty the Emperor of Japan, desiring to close the war now existing between them, and having appointed their respective plenipotentiaries and furnished them with full powers, which have been found to  in form, have come to an agreement as to a Treaty of peace, and have arranged as follows:
                    Article I. stipulates for the re-establishment of peace and friendship between the Sovereigns of the two Empires and between the subjects of Russia and Japan respectively.
                    Article II.

                    Article III.— It is mutually agreed that the territory of Manchuria shall be simultaneously evacuated by both the Rassian and Japanese troops, both countries being concerned in this               evacuation, and their situations being abso¬lutely identical.

                    Article IV.— The rights possessed by Russia in conformity with the lease to Russia of Port Arthur and Dalny, together with the lands and waters adjacent, shall pass over entirely to Japan, but the properties and rights of Russian subjects are to be safeguarded and respected.

                    Article VI.— The Manchurian Railway shall be operated jointly between the Russian and the Japanese at Kouang-Tcheng Tse.The respec¬tive portions of the line shall be employed only for commercial and industrial purposes, is view of Russia keeping her line with all the rights acqnuired by her convention with China for the construction of the railway, Japan ac quires the mines in connection with such section of the line which falls to her. The rights of private parties or private enterprises, however, are to be respected. Both parties to this Treaty remain absolutely free to undertake what they may deem fit on the expropriated ground.
                    Article VII.-—The Russian and the Japan¬ese engage to make a junction of the lints which they-own at Rouang Tcheng-Tse.

                        <head>EARLY DAYS OF BANKING.</head>
                        <p>The founding of the Bank of England is a romance ; success its justification. All over the world, wherever monetary transactions take place, eager minds and eyes are con- centrated upon the every action of its Go¬vernor and Court of Directors. Although it is the pivot of the world’s finance, we are most of us unaware of the great history which this institution has made, does still make, and without doubt will ever continue to make, but the magnificent painting which was affixed last year to due of the historical panels inside the Royal Exchange affords an oppor¬tunity of familiarising our minds with an ontline of the Bank’s career. To the average individual it is principally regarded as a stopping center which the London ’buses serve to make the busiest crossing thorough¬fare ever known to mankind, and beyond this the thoughts of many of ns never seem to go, so immersed are we in our own affaire, the tyranny of habit, and in that feeling of indifference which frequency of sight alone can breed. To relate in detail the Bank's early struggles would involve an entire ac¬count of that wonderful and ever-memo- rable bubble of South Sea notoriety, for the founder of the former—William Pa¬terson—was closely identified with the latter project also ; but for a brief space let us go back to the period which followed the Norman Conquest, for it is to that date to which the earliest signs of banking may be traced. In those days banking, if such it could be Darned, was carried on by “Bills of Exchange”—a method invented by the Jews—and consequen¬tly was at first confined to a mere handful of that sect, who were afterwards expelled from our shores Then came the Lombards, who not only brought with them the knowledge of banking, but many arts and skilled trades in addition As the reward of their enterprise, success in large measure attended their efforts, bat for this no thanks were due to the Govern¬ment. “Persecution” is the word which most fitly describes the attitude of the Government towards the Lombards, who were continually having tines imposed upon them under some pretext or other,and it says much for the enter prise and determined spirit of the latter that they were always able to meet the unjust demands and increase, at the same time, their wealth, power, and position.
                            Other banks were soon established, the rate of interest began to rise in ratio to the spirit of speculation, and gradually the feeling gain ed ground that the establishment of a National Bank was necessary to safeguard the Nation's credit and advance its prosperity. When this proposition was first propounded the private hankers expressed such hostile views that it was feared the project was doomed. Perseve rance, however, and that indomitable pluck which ever characterised our forefathers pra vaifed, and on the 27th day of July, 1694, the Bank of England transacted its first business “over the oounter.” It is this period in the Bank’s career which forms the subject of the handsome painting previously referred to, and which was presented by members of the Stock Exchange. The scene takes place before Sir John Summers, Kt—then Lord Keeper of the Great Seal—in the presence of whom the first Governor, his Deputy, and ten Directors are swearing the oath. The most notable of these were Sir John Honblon, Governor ; Mr. Michael Godfrey, Deputy ; and the fo lowing Directors: Sir John Huband, Bart., Sir William Gore, Sir Henry Pnrnese, Robert Raworth, John Smirth, W. Obadiah Sedgwick, and William Paterson (Founder), Esquires. The difficulties, which they had to encounter were simply tremendous, and in the hands of less capable men would never have been surmounted.
                            From the very day of the Bank's incorpora¬tion the directors had to contend with over-abundance of malicious opposition, and so determinedly was this policy pursued that on more than one occasion it appeared as if no human effort could save the institution from extinction. Within less than a year its first suspension of payment took place—to the great joy of the private bankers—who felt so assured of victory that before the event actually oc- cured many epitaphi ware written and publish ed. Time, the healer of all wounds, soon oblite¬rated the momory of this catastrophe, and shortly afterwards the Bank Stock rose from 50 per oent. discount to 112 per cent. Matters did not continue smoothly for long, as daring the next ten ye trs the credit of the Bank was shaken on no fewer than two occasions. It i only right, however, to state that this was th result of European disturbances. In one instance King Louis, i-i 170 \ seised upon the entire Spanish Monarchy, whilst in the other it was due to insurrection in Hungary and the invasion of Germany by the French.
                            The most deliberate of all attempts to injure the Bank was organised in 1707, but the scheme was speedily frustrated by the prompt action of prominent City merchants, who showed their confidenoe by their support, in which the Nation joined. Undaunted, the wreckers one year later renewed the attack, and on this occasion they had the unanimous approval of the Press Numerous pamphleti were also circulated broadcast to strengthen the fear—already rooted in the minds of many persons—that a dangerous monopoly of banking business was being fostered to the detriment of private enterprise, but in spite of all this malignity the Bank’s Charter was renewed for another twenty-four years.
                            A fresh danger now arose—it was the Sach verell riots. Thousands of the rioters marched to the Beak determined on plundering its contents, and it not been for the self- sacrfices —
                        </p>
                        <cb n="3"/>
                            <p>. When remonstrated with by her Ministerial advisers for her heroic action, the good Queen calmly replied, “God will be my guard !"
                                The Saoheverell riots occurred in 1709, and in 1710 Q ueen Anne marked a great epoch in the Bank’s career by officially recognising its important relationship to the State. This, how¬ever, did not prevent another “ran” taking place twelve years later, has it only resulted in the fall of stock from 126 to 116. About this period (1720) Prance embarked on its “Soath Sea Babble” - otherwise known as “Law's Mis¬sissippi Scheme”—as if to act as a kindly warning of the madness which was destined to sweep Europe. Bat no 1 the “Mississippi” echoes were still resounding when oar madness broke out on exactly similar lines. As with Prance, so with ourselves. Great names were tarnished, repputations were blasted, and half the nations, including many noble families, were wrecked and rained.
                                With theChanoellor of the Exchequer involv¬ed, it is surprising how the Directors of the Bank of England were not seized with the speculative fever, more particularly when it is known that they were only outbid in their eagerness to purchase the " South Sea” Charter from the Government by the promoters of that wild ‘ Bubble.’ Had not a kindly Providence guided the Directors of the former institution, who will gain say that the terrible havoc which ensued would have been exceeded by a national calamity from the effects of which recovery might have been impossible 1

                    <p>PITH OF THE PRESS COMMENTS.</p>
                    <p>THE ANGLO-JAPANESE ALLIANCE.
                        “TIMES.”
                    </p>
                    <p>The renewal and extension of the alliance between this country and Japan is a matter of interest to all civilised nations, but there is one people and ore Government who may be be expected to consider it with particular attention. It affects Russia more directly than any other European State, because she is the only Power who can be supposed to be at all likely in any circumstances to undertake single-handed project incompatible with that maintenance of the status quo in Asia which is the corner-stone of the Anglo-Japanese policy and of the now treaty that embodies it. Some time must elapse before we can be in a position to gauge Russian opinion on the subject.
                        There is nothing to cause surprise in the out-burst of bad temper with which certain Chau-vinist and reactionary Russian newspapers greet the extension of the Anglo-Japanese alliance. They cannot help seeing that it gives checkmate to many of their most cherished plans, from the borders of Korea to the Indian Ocean. They had hoped to renew in other regions the same sort of schemes which in the Far East have ended in dire disaster. The new alliance stands in their way ; for the accom-plishment of such schemes would involve the overthrow of the status quo, which it has been specially extended to uphold. There is a party in Russia which unquestionably looks forward to a war with England as the most promising means of obtaining compensation for the moral and material losses caused by the war with Japan. The discovery that, in future, a war with England would mean a war with Japan also bitterly disappoints them and angers them.
                        “TELEGRAPH.”
                        The best guarantee . of the permanence of the peace of Portsmouth will be the permanence of Japan’s superiority. That, we hope, will be secured to her by the new 'Anglo-Japanese Alliance, one of whose principal objects is to prevent any revision of the treaty terminating the Rasso-Japanese war. The status of Asia as established by that treaty is to remain so long as tie Anglo-Japanese treaty endures. The Far East is to be protected, as tho-roughly as is possible, against surprises and adventures. It deserves to be noted that this view of the extended Anglo-Japanese Alliance is emphasised by the leading St. Petersburg newspaper with Liberal tendencies. The effeot of the treaty, says the “Russ” will be to put a stop to “Asiatic adventures k la Bezobrazoff,” which will become less tempt¬ing owing to the vast responsibilities involv¬ed. Whether this view will be shared by the remainder of the Russian Press and by those who conduot Russian foreign policy remains to be seen.
                        “EVENING STANDARD.”
                        Without dogmatising on the amount of weight which may properly be attached to it, it is permissible to find in the line taken by the “Russ” in commenting on the new Anglo- Japanese Alliance an agreeable symptom of sanity. Frankly recognising facts, the “Russ” concerns itself with their bearing on the future, and finds that the new aliianoe is neither so hateful not so terrible as the unfettered “Novoe Vremya” seems to imagine. It does put a de-finite end to crazy adventures in Asia, but the “Russ” finds this rather comforting thanother- wise. In fact, the alliance, which is acknow-ledged to have been a factor in the production of peace at Portsmouth, is hailed as a guarantee against a waste of force in the Far East, which may help Russia to regain her rightful place in Europe. It all sounds extraordinarily sensible-perhaps almost too sensible to be genuine. But that is, we believe, the view of the matter that must ultimately prevail, and its expression serves a better pur-pose than the “Novoe Vremya’s” ungenerous insinuations coupling France with England as the unjust beast.
                        TIIE “RUSS” (St. Petersburg).
                        The “Russ,” in an artiole sympathetic to Great Britain, recognises that the Anglo Japan-ese treaty is a considerable factor of peace. The journal warns the Russians against nour¬ishing the idea of revenge, for they would be opposed not only by Japan, but also by Great Britain. The treaty guarantees to Great Brit¬ain the possession of India, and any Russian pressure in the direction of Tibet or Afghan¬istan wouid have to be supported by a great and costly concentration of military forces The threaten ng of India, the journal declares, must cease.
                        The “Ross,” referring pointedly to Germany, Hays that certain of Russia’s enemies will now not succeed in urging her to embark on doubt-ful undertakings.
                        THE “JOURNAL” (Paris).
                        The advantage to England is clear. The Japanese army assures the defence of India. German expansion ip the Far East is at once blocked. Russia, banished from Chinese markets, pees the road to the Persian Gulf closed with¬out being able to retaliate against the Power which has assured her an honorable peace. Here is the supreme ability of the British policy. It has thrown Ruesia back fifty years, while not inflicting a painful wound on Russian amour propre. The British fle.it guarantees the Japanese conquests against any attempt at revenge. The Japanese can apply themselves to the exploitation of China. There are trea¬sures there worth £120,000,000.
                        “France is evidently not aimed at direotly in the new treaty. Borne may see in the

                    <p>“DAILY NEWS.”
                        With the close of the war afar, Russia turns with concentrated attention to the war within her own borders. The promised reforms and the rule ot Tsar Trepoff have checked in some degree the disorder that has been raging during the whole of the present year ; bnt the discontents are too widely and deeply spread to be uprooted either by promises or dragoon¬ing. With the return of the soldiery from the Far East, with all their stories of misery and failure, and with the revelation of all that the war has cost the people in new and crushing burdens, the embers of the revolt will be fanned anew.
                        It will be impossible for the authorities to muzzle the returning soldiers as they muzzle their Press, and the Government will have to face a new ornsade throughout the Empire, all the more dangerous because it will be in the hands of the men who, having suffered and having learned the trnth, retnrn to their own villages to impart it to their neighbours and so add new fuel to the flames.

                        <p>If Russia will abandon thoio dream? of expan¬sion in Eastern Asia which have brought such a tremendous retribution upon her, and if the Tsar will open his ears to the just complaints ot his people and shake himself adrift from the odrrupt and incapable clique that surrounds him, his country may once more resume her legitimate place ia the counoils of Europe. But the omens are nnpropitious. It will be a diffi¬cult task to persuade the Russian Chauvinists how absolute is the downfall of their hopes in Furthest Asia. It will be even less easy to convince autoorat and bureaucrats that they can no more hope to reduce internal Russia to the status quo ante helium than to see the pre-revolutionary regime restored in France.</p>

                    <p>To-day (September 4) unless at the last moment the demands of the French Govern-ment are complied with, its representative will take his departure from the Moroccan capital. Nor can the Republic rest satisfied even with this emphatic protest against the dilatory insolence of the Maghzeu. It will be necessary to apply measures of practical coer¬cion. The original offence, the arrest of a French protege, has not been purged by release of the prisoner. M. Taillandier has further in¬sisted that an ample apology shall be tendered to his Government, that the Kaid who was guilty of the outrage shall be pnnished, and that an indemnity shall be paid. Nobody who is acquainted with Moorish methods would ex-pect satisfaction to be given so long as any pretext could be invented for delay. . . . That the Maghzeu would gladly satisfy France, now that she is so evidently in earnest, we may aissume as certain. The only doubt is whether the Sultan can afford to exasperate the fanatics amongst his subjects. There is no Sovereign in the world who is less master in his own house than the nominal Emperor of Morocco.</p>

                    </head>
                    <p>The Portsmouth Treaty of Peace is to be signed this afternoon (September 5) at three O'clock. It was found impossible to do this (as announced) last night, the delay being due (so the “Times” correspondent tells us) to :
                        (a) The microscopic analysis of words and phrases by the Japanese ; and
                        ' (/>) The Russian superstition about Mon¬day.
                        There seem to have been no real hitches—we are not surprised, since the agreement was complete once the indemnity was withdrawn. We are told that owing to the pushfnlness of hho manufacturers of steel pens, all of whom have sent supplies in the hope that their particular pen would be used in signing the Treaty, it has been deoided not to use steel at all. It seems quite right to abandon steel in a peace treaty, and the signatures are to be written by a quill. Even so, however, there will be any number of geese with a grievance.

                        <head>DESERT EXPLORATION</head>
                        <p>The story of the excellent work done by the 8 nrvey parties attached to the Seiatan Bound-ary Commission will probably never be told except in official reports ; hut, the “Pioneer” records one splendid instance of devotion to duty, with a terribly tragio ending. Due east of Seistan, between the Helmand and Rash rivers, lies a desert tract known as the Dasbt- Margo, and it was in the exploration of this that Surveyor Sheikh Mohi-ud Din with three of his khalasis, a guide and two camel-men, lost their lives on Jane 16 and 17, 1903. Mohi-ud-Din was an experienced surveyor, who had won his Khan Bahadurship by frontier service of a fine order in the Survey Department of India and he was particularly anxious to penetrate into the Dasht-i-Margo, which rivals the Registan desert further to the east in its forbidding features. Accordingly, in spite of the extreme heat, he started on the evening of Jane 12 from Puza-i-Msrhi, near Chahar Buijak, on the Helmand west of Rudbar, and struok out a course nearly due north. His party oonsisted of four survey khalasis, four Afghan guides and two camel- men. They marched all night, and a halt was called in the early morning.

                            The fate of the party, with one exception, was a terrible one. After the three guides had

Then occurred a striking example of the strong sense of duty whioh can actuate even a humble “follower.” Saidu, kba- lasi, ent the map off the surveyor’s plane-table and wrapped it about his body in his waist- cloth. He afterwards said that he was afraid to carry it in his hand, lest he should become insensible and lose it. The four men left the esmp and wandered aimlessly through the night. On the morniDg of the 17th they saw a high monnd; and all but Saida lay down in its shade to die. Saidu entreated his companions to make a further effort, but they were too far gone to make the attemptHe himself struggled on the whole day,and he must apparently have become delirious, for he remembered nothing until in the darkness he stumbled suddenly into water. He quenched his thirst and then became insensible ; on regaining consciousness he found himself being carried on a man’s back to Chakansnr. He had been discovered by some otbet plant’ perbap8' h“ 010 P°wer “ e^nal

                        <p>Pitifully enough, the opinion commonly held of a moor is of a waste, bleak and treeless, a drear expanse with “blossomed gorse unpro- fitably gay.” Outside a few enthusiasts, sports-men, and naturalists, with perhaps a stray pedestrian here and there unexpectedly en-chanted, no one seems inclined to think of a moor as a place of entioement, or one of1 Nature’s choicest beauty-spots. Alas ! that so rich a resort and rare a place for obser¬vation, with claims to admiration and wonder whioh the most fertile spaces can scarcely rival, should fall so low in general estimation. We know scarcely anything of the real charms of our country, and deem a fortnight or more at the seaside with a Christy Minstrel delight sufficient to compensate for the year’s dull round of unbroken routine. Any holiday is a refreshment; to sit in an arbour at the end of the garden in the sunlight and melt down hours into moments in delicious in¬dolence, drinking in the fragrance ot the flowers, listening to the cheery confidences of the birds, and watching the dance of the olonds, is an order of release liberally devised.
                            The jaded soul finds its best exhilaration in an intercourse with Nature, in a return to the old  reserve, and the maroh was continued daring only exhilaration, but exaltation, as when one the day.

                            <p>Mrs. W. McRoberts, writes to Dr. Hartman from Delano, Miss., the following:
                                Delano, Miss. Dr. S. B. Hartman, Columbus, Ohio:
                                Dear Sir:—“I feel perfectly well of catarrh. I did as you directed me to and took Pernna and Manalin. The third of March I gave_birth to a ten pound baby girl and we are both well and happy. I am very thankful, to yon and Peruna saved my life. I recommend it to everyone and can’t praise it enough.
                                “I send you my own and my baby’s picture. She is so sweet and good,— she is a Pernna baby. I have such good health now. I do all my house¬work and take care of my baby and feel so good.
                                “There are three or four of my neighbors using Pernna now since it did me so much good. They were Just run down, and they think it is fine, it is so good to give strength’’— Mrs. W. McRoberts.

                            <p>gotten, and only lingers in a vague form, shadowy and indistinct. For no matter how severe has been the environment, Nature has atill a hold over the sous of moo. No one can see the heather without a subtle feeling of loss, and an aspiration to be as it was in the beginning. And it everyone could realise its dumb aspiration, even for a fleeting hoar what a good world it wonld be ! It is blameless at-mosphere where the heather lives. The High-landers, who live the most naturally of any of ns, appreciate most the sway of Nature, without a tincture of sentimentality. And they obtain what they deserve, a life long and free ; it is not the ideal life, for all shoald live ex tempore, but it is the cheerfullest and fullest life we know of. Their veneration for the heather is oomplete. They thatoh their cottages with heather houghs and make their beds of the sprays. All the Scottish poets have with loyalty sung in praise of their native heather :

Sweet molest flower, in lonely desert* dnn,
                                Retiring still for converse with the sun,
                                Whose sweets invite the soaring lark to stoop,

                            <p>The heather has other virtues than a poet¬ical resort for the lark. It is the home of the grousse, and not only shelters it in summer, bnt provides it food in the winter, the seed-vessels being so formed that the seed remains in them a whole year, and out of ixs abundance the birds are fed. Formerly it had another nse. Boethius records that it is very nutritive not only to beasts, birds, and bees, bnt to animals of more discrimin¬ating taste. The first natives of Scotia, the Piots, brewed from it a delioious and whole-some liquor. It is to this remote fact that
                                Leyden refers in the lines :—
                                Though unobtrusive all thy Ixsautiee shine.
                                Yet boast thou rival of the purpling vine !
                                For once thy mantling juice was seen to laugh In pearly cups, which monarchs loved to quaff ;
                                And frequent wake the wild inspired lay On Teviot’e hills, beneath the Pictish eway.
                                The manner of making the precious neotar perished with the extermination of the Piets, for they never showed the craft to any outside their own blood, an act of selfishness it may be no sin to bewail. Historically, the heather is interesting past common expectation, for how it swayed the generations; there it touches the sentiment Its modern office is nobler, for here it touches the heart and spirits us away from the-poor frets of life and its meannesses ; a realm of purple mountain and white mist where only Nature reigns, and is free.

                        <p>Premier Semestre de 1905
                            Pendant le semestre kcoulk, les importations ont prksentk une augmentation de 19,400,000 franco
                            Toutes le3 puissances, sauf l’Espagne, la Hollande et la Suisse ont pris une part plus oa moins grande dans la plus value du Com merce d’importation et dans l’augmentation que nous signalons.
                            La France occupe le ler rang avec L.E. 178.030.
                            Viennent ensuite: L’Angleterre et possessions avec L.E. 145.000 ; la Russie L.E. 76,737 ; laTurquie LE. 55.729 ; la Sude L.E. 54.577 ; l’ltalie L.E. 48.868 ; i’Amkrique L.E. 46,059 ; la Roumaaie L.E. 27.497 ; la Belgique LE. 25.608 ; l’Autriche-Hongrie L E. 17.956 ; l’Al- lemagne L.E. 8.721.
                            Pour qu’on puisse plus facilement se rendre compte de Involution de notre commerce, pendant ie semestre iconic, nous reproduisons le tableau statistique ci-aprds qui indique sur quels articles a portk notre progression, etpour quels montants:
                            Le3 farines L.E. 91.820; les mktaux et machines L.E. 46.323; les bois (meubles) L.E. 17.172; articles divers (colis postaux) LE. 10.530 ; les spiritueux, boissons L.E. 8.222 ; les industries textiles L.E. 4.578.
                            Ce sont les farines qui tiennent le ler rang. Cette importation qui, ii y a qaelques annkes, atteignait de modestes proportions, occupe aujourd’hui une place considerable parmi le * deurkes que l’Egypte demande k i’Etranger. Le ooton kgyptien,; bien qu’il ait ktk toujours apprdcie, ktait loin d’avoir la valeur qu’il a prise depuis 7 ou 8 an§, et le bid oocupait en¬core une place trds etendae dans les cultures de ce pays. Actuellement, les hauts prix, prati¬ques pour les cotons, ont provoque le dklaisse- meut des ckrkales par les cultivateurs, et par- ; tout le ooton a romplace le blk. L’Egypte, qui,. jadis, passait pour le grenier de l’Empire ro- main, ne peut pourvoir actuellement and ses besoins, et elle demande aux autres pays pro
                            ducteurs lea farines qu’elle doit consommer.
                            Parmi ses fournisseurs, la France occupo la premiere place. En 1904, elle lui expedia 55 millions de kilos de farines, et au 30 Juin de la presente aunke, son importatioa a atteint 40 millions de kilos sur an chiffro total de 60 millions de kilos.
                            Apres les farines, les metaux et ouvrages en mdtal (machines) sont inscrits pour 1.200 000 francs. Une foumiture de locomotives, faite au Gonvemement Egyptien par une de nos usines du Nord, entre pour une somme considerable dans ce ohiffre.
                            Los autres articles ont suivi une progression normaie comme elle se produit d’ailleurs depuis quelques annees.
                            Nous constatons cette situation satisfaisante avec grand plaisir, et nous espkrons qae l’ave- nir reservera des rkmltats encore plus apprk ciables. Nous sommes amenes  ce sentiment par notre echange de correspondances plm actif que les annees precedentes ; par 1’aDuonce de la reussite complete de la recolte des coton% laqueile, si aucun evenemeut facheux ne sur- vient, augmentera beaucoup la circulation du numeraire dans ce pays; enfiu par les de marohes de pluaieurs de nos representants qui se sont rendu8 en France  i’eff'et de recheroher de nouvelles maisons.
                            Pour ce qui est de ce dernier point, nous devons dire qu’il s’est constitue ici depuis quelques annees pluaieurs maisons de repre¬sentations parmi le.quelies il s’en trouve de trks honorables. L9ur activitk et leur sollioituda ont beauooup ooatribue k l’amklioration des transactions commerciales avec l’Egypte. En realite elles ‘Constituent le pivot des affaires ; aussi nous nous faisons un devoir de signaler k nos compatriotes l’intkrkt qu’il ont k user de leur intermediaire. Nous ne croyons pas inutile d’entrer, k cet egard, dans quelques explica-tions.
                            Ea general, nos detaillants d’Egypte, k part quelques grosses maisons, sont pen enolins k s’adresser directement au producteur. Habitues k recevoir periodiquement la visite des reprk- gentants, ils leurs rkservent leurs ordres et s’evitent ainsi la peine d’ecrire. Il faut vrai ment qu’ils aient des besoins, bien imperieux et impossibles k remplir sur place, pour qu’ils se dkcident k prendre la plume et k passer leurs commaudes eux-mkmes.
                            On peut done avaucer que le sort d’une maison et sa reassite en Egypte dependent pour ainsi dire de l’activite, de l’experience et de la probite de son reprksaptant. Oelui-ci est au oourant des besoins de ses clients, il con nait le moment;propice pour faire ses effres ; souvent il fait groupeT pluaieurs commande, en une seule expedition pour diminuer les frais de transport; il tegoit'la marchandise et la iivre aux destinataire3. Plus tard, lorsque l’kchkanoe approche, il rafralchit si besoin est la memoire de son client, et mkme quelquetois il paie pour lui s’il est gknk, quitte k se fairo rembourser meme par acomptes.
                            Par cet apergu, on peut juger de l’auxiliaire prkeieux qu’est le reprksentant.

                            <p>Ea resumk, la situation do l’Egyp’e, au point de vae koonomique, est toat-k-fait ^xceptionelle, si on met en regard oelle des autres pays. La libre concurrence s’y exeroe sans entraves oar las droits de douane sont les memes pour tons ; nul traitk de commerce a assure k une nation un traitement plus avan- tageux qu’k ses conourrentes. C’est la parfaite kgalitk pour tons. Le suocka appartient aux plus industrieux et aux plus intelligent^. A ce point de vue, no3 exportateurs frangais n’ont rien k redouter de personne. Tout ce qu’on pourrait leur reprocher, e’eat une timidity qui, heureusement, pen k pen se dissipe et finira par disparaitre en presence des rk3nltats obtenus.
                                La campagne d’hiver, qai s’annonce dans de bonnes conditions et promet d’etre fructueuse pour l’importation et Importation, aidera k dktraire les dornikres apprehensions.

                                        <p>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.)
                                            Paris, September 6.
                                            The Halles Centrales--the large central markets of Paris—are always an interesting sight, but on the 4th inst. they were more than usually so, for the shooting season—“la chasse”—in the departments adjoining Paris opened at daylight on Sunday morning, and before mid-day the first victims of the sports¬men’s guns were visible in the markets. Hares were selling at from 5s. to 9s. 6d. each—that is to say, French hares—while “Germans” could be had at from 5s. to 7s. 6d. Venison was scarce on the market ; and the few rare deer from the French Lorraine were being sold at prices varying from £2 to £2. 8s. Partridges were a rather disappointing feature this year, and for anything worth buying 4s. to 5s. was asked. Prices are not so high to-day, and to morrow they will be more moderate still, while by the end of the week game of all kinds will be plentiful and reasonable in price.
                                            “La chasse” is a great institution in this country. To-day everybody is a “chasseur,” or sportsman, in France, and although the term means less in this country than it does in England the development of the sporting instinct in France within recent years is quite remarkable. Last year ait this time the Pre¬fecture of ,the Seine issued 2,246 shooting icences to aspiring Nimrods, and daring the same five days this year the number was 3,097. In the whole of France, between 450,000 and 460,000 shooting licences are taken out annually. At slightly over a sover¬eign each, this represents a very welcome addition to the revenues of the State and the communes. It goes without saying that very few of the French “hunters” get anything but fresh air and exercise in return for their per mission to shoot at large. Game is not too abundant in this country, except on private estates, where the “chasseur” may not go. But if the French Ximrod does little harm with his gun, he does a lot of good to those who live by providing facilities tor the enjoy¬ment of the shooting season. Gansmiths, am¬munition dealers, and game breeders, tanners, tailors, bootmakers—in France the outfit is the thing—railway companies, have all reason to feel grateful for the growth of the sporting appetite. Experience has shown that every pheasant shot on a preserved shooting costs the proprietor of the estate between a sove¬reign and 25s. For a fifth of that sum, or less, you can buy a pheasant in the Paris markets even when game is scarce. But you lose all the picturesque elements, you forego the fierce delights of the chase, and you have no excuse for putting on your sporting outfit when you are only going to the market. Do you wonder, thus, that every Frenchman’s motto is “Vive la chasse I”
                                            Visitors to Arcachon, which at present is holding its annual regatta, have been much interested lately by the appearance in the streets of that resort of a “pilgrim” of strange and curious aspect, who frequently sits on a bench in the Place Thiers. Of short stature, with long fair hair tied with a yellow ribbon, and wearing a linen robe spotlessly white, the “pilgrim” carries a white wand in his hand, and on his back a knapsack filled with booklets which he offers for sale. The stranger is known by the name of “Merva, the Apostle of the Natural Life,” and is believed to be a Belgian, formerly well known in social circles, and at one time Consul in the Dutch Indies. Five years ago he left everything “to return to Nature.” He has founded a colony on the shores of Lake Maggiore, where the followers of “Merva” subsist on the produce of the soil, contenting themselves with fruit and raw vegetables. Cooked food, Hash, and salt they look upon as unclean ; while their clothing is reduced to a strict minimum. They sleep on the ground or on a wooden platform, wear no head covering, and allow their beards and hair to grow. “Merva” is now making a tour of the fashionable watering-places with the object of making disciples by contrasting his simple garb with the luxury of fashion, but if his success is to be gauged by the number of followers he has secured in Arcachon, then his pilgrimage is not likely to result in very many conversions.
                                            M. Gabriel Vayre, a French engineer who passed some time at the Court at Fez, has just published a book with the title : “Dars Pintimife du Sultan,” in which he tells some amusing stories of the ruler of Morocco. “An inquisitive child,” is M. Veyre’s description of the Saltan. His one desire and object is to be amused, and those who surround him do their best to comply with his withes, knowing full well that he who amuses him best will receive most in return, and that when they ce as to amuse him their places will ba taken by others. After paying with bicycles, auto¬mobiles, toy locomotives, and telephones, someone suggested that the monarch might like to learn photography. At once he desired to be initiated into all its mysteries, and work- (deo hard that he became quite a skilled operator. Bat the best instrument that could be bought was not good enough for him, and he ordered that a verascope in gold should be made for him. It was duly constructed, ac¬cording to his wish, and when the bill was presented it amounted to one thousand pounds! M. Veyre’s judgment on the Saltan is as follows : “I have always seen this spoiled and all-powerful child show himself in all circum- stances the mildest of tyrants. . . This man, to whom none of his subjects dare reply “impossible,” before whom trembles the entire Magbcen if be but seem to frown upon them, is always ready to give way to a plausible

                                            <p>argument. But his Ministers have too good reason to bow their heads before him, even with exaggerated obsequiousness so that they may be allowed to continue—under the shadow of his authorithy—their unworthy trafficking.”
                                                A writer in a Paris contemporary gives seme interesting particulars as to the habits of the German Emperor concerning the distri¬bution of Imperial decorations. Generally says the writer, the Emperor likes to hand the decoration or order decided upon personally to the recipient. In order to be prepared for all emergencies several eases filled with Orders always accompany the Emperor everywhere on his journeys. These valuable cases are en¬trusted to the care of a trustworthy official appointed for the purpose by the Court Cham-berlain. While only a few of the higher Orders are taken, those intended for bestowal on workmen and minor officials number many hundreds. Should it happen that an Order is lacking, the Emperor requests a member of his immediate encourage to lend him his de¬coration, and hands it to the recipient. The person decorated very often requests to be allowed to retain the Order bestowed on him by the Emperor, and in that case the former possessor receives a second Order, which is despatched from Berlin to the Emperor.
                                                The news that a peace settlement has at last been reached has given sincere satisfaction in France. When a country has as many mil¬lions of the national savings invested as France has entrusted to Russia it is the re¬verse of reassuring to see the borrower wasting these millions in a futile struggle. Besides, France felt it as a personal reflection that her ally, whom she had always considered great and powerful, should be unable to hold her own against a little people like the Japanese ; and another reason for desiring the termination of the war was that so long as Russia’s hands were tied in Manchuria she was helpless to as¬sist France—should the occasion arise—by fulfilling her part of the alliance contract. Frenchmen had this very forcibly brought home to them daring the recent Franco- German crisis on the Moroccan question, and they are not likely to forget it. Now that peace has been declared France feels that there is a prospect of her ally some day being useful to her, and that is not the least of the reasons why the Rasso-Japanese settlement has been hailed with satisfaction in this coun¬try. The points in the arrangement that are emphasised here are Japan’s generosity, and a frank recognition that she has attained a fore¬most place among the nations. There is also much praise for President Roosevelt’s heroic efforts, and a feeling of gratitude for the good iDflaenoe which Great Britain and her pacific sovereign have exerted in bringing about a termination of the terrible contest.
                                                Much interest was shown in the eclipse of the sun. The first contact for Paris observers took place at 12.3 p.m., and the final contact was registered at 2.31 p.m. The moon’s shadow at its greatest phase hid 82 per cent, of the sun’s disc. As the eclipse took place during the dejeuner hour, it attracted a good deal of po¬pular attention, and observers at windows and on balconies, with pieces of smoked glass in their hands, were numerous. But the question that Parisians have lately been asking, with somewhat illnatnred curiosity, is whether the eclipse has had anything to do with the recent bad weather. Even since last Saturday, the weather in Paris, at the seaside, and in the provinces of France has been of the most wretched kind, and many people on holiday, who had contemplated staying at seaside and other resorts until the middle or end of Sep¬tember have come back to Paris. It is reported from widely separated districts that rain has fallen in torrents, that large tracts of country have been devastated by cyclones, and now, to crown all, we are informed that snow fell  yesterday in the mountainous district near Albertville (Savoie). Whether we are right in blaming the eclipse for all this disagreeable weather or not, it is carious to note that since it took place this afternoon the weather has been sunny and oheerful, and of a character much more pleasing than previously.
                                                Four duels were fought recently in the Rue du Viroflay, in the Latin Quarter, before an admiring crowd. A number of students, who had been celebrating the eclipse unwisely, quarrelled. Words were exchanged, which French etiquette demanded should be wiped out by blood, and it was decided that four duels should be fought on the spot. Foils were borrowed from a neighbouring studio. The combatants stripped to the waist and the fighting began, An enormous crowd gathered, but no one attempted to interfere with the duellists. Before the police arrived five of the eight combatants had been wounded, three of them severely. All the parties were taken to the police-station, but the Paris authorities are lenient towards students, and the offenders were dismissed with a caution. Three were taken to the hospital.
                                                One of the greatest plagues in this country is the large amount of bad coin constantly in  circulation. Although I know the various  species fairly well, I am taken in every now ! and then; after the Englishman who comes I here for the first time is bound  to have several spurious or out-of-date coins thrust upon him.
                                                Cabmen and the waiters in the cafes are ever  ready to dispose of counterfeit coin on the  ignorant stranger; and, as if there were not  enough Frenchman in the bad money industry in this country, some Spaniards have recently been trying their luck. But the police were successful in operating them red-banded, and they are now reflecting in French goals on the unhappy fortune which led them to desert their own country. Several other offenders would have been taught in Spin if it had not

                                                <p>been that before they would consent to act, the Spanish police demanded a sum of £80 from the French authorities, which was not forthcoming. An amusing incident connected with the arrest of the coiners is that when one of them—a woman named Candet—landed at Marseilles from Barcelona her pockets were loaded with 1,500 spurious one-franc pieces. The Customs officers, however, imagining they had to deal with an eccentric old lady who preferred coin to banknotes, lined up for her to pass and saluted her with profound respect. Another woman, a widow named Fernandez, went into a church at St. Merri, and bought a penny candle to burn to St. Anthony of Padua. But she paid for it with a bad one- franc piece, and made ninepence and the candle over the transaction.</p>

                                        <p>In “Nature,” Dr. C.V. Barton, of Cambridge, describes a form of crystallised carbon which he has obtained at comparatively low tern- peratures and pressures by using a molten alloy of lead and calcium, which is found capable of holding in solution small quantities of carbon, and to contain on cooling the last- named mineral in very minute crystals, which, like the diamond, belong to the cubic system, are transparent and have a very high refrac¬tive index.
                                            The quantities available have not enabled him to determine satisfactorily the density or hardness, bat this, at least, is certain, that he has obtained a mineral which is not graphite (the familiar “black lead,” the common form of crystallised carbon) or cliftonite, the very rare one found by Mr. L. Fletcher, of the British Museum, in a meteorite, so that if not diamond it must be a new mineral. Pro-fessor Moissan, of Paris succeeded a few years ago in making small artificial diamonds, bat thia was accomplished by melting iron with carbon at the temperature of the electric arc.

                                        <p>The mischievous habit encouraged by many women of working hard all day without eating ruins health. Food may seem repulsive to weak anaimic women, but the remedy is not to starve, but to strengthen the digestive system to appreciate food and derive good from it. That strength is generously supplied by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People.
                                            “My daughter would come home from business, having touched no food all day.” said Mrs. Godfrey, of 1 Thomas-street, Colne, Lancashire. “She could not take food, became depressed and spiritless, and wanted to be bothered about nothing. Her nerves were bad, and she was as thin as could be.”
                                            “Yes,” said Mis.' Florence Godfrey, “I was often ill through debility and a weak heart. I went to bed tired and got up tired.

                                            “But my troubles ended quickly when I tried Dr, Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People. I took two boxes and felt a decided improve¬ment. I could eat better and food did not disagree. The pills gave me new blood, and now I have no pains at the heart. I can work without fatigue and never have cause to stay away from business, while I am congratulated on my improved looks. I am deeply grateful, for Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills have saved me from a miserable existence ”
                                            The little help that girls and women so often need to overcome  weakness means all the diffe- rance between misery and happiness. There is just the right kind of help in Dr. Williams’ Pick Pills, which by enriching the blood make cheeks glow and eyes sparkle with health.They have cared thousands of Amumia, Indigestion, Pains in the Back, Consumption, Rheumatism, Sciatica, St. Vitus’ Dance, Paralysis and Loco- tor Ataxy.

                                            <head>THE COMING OF THE GULLS.</head>
                                            <p>Every year, with unfailing regularity, the gulls, towards the end of August, begin to return to their winter haunts in London. About a week ago one or two solitary specimens were to be seen hovering over the river near Black friars Bridge, and, before many more days have passed these stragglers will be joined by others. Soon the surface of the river and the air above will be filled with a noisy, chattering crowd, each individual bird trying to outwit the other in the scramble for the dainty morsels thrown from the bridges and embankments by passers by.
                                                Higher up the river, at Surbiton, Barnes and Richmond, there were quite a number of gulls quite lately, but these were not the regular winter visitors of the metropolis. ’They had not oome leisurely up the river, after the manner of those which make the journey regularly each autumn, bat had been driven inland across oountry by stress of weather, until the sight of the peaceful Thames tempted the tired birds to stay their flight and rest. They hovered around just above the water, picking up unoon- sidered trifles of food here and there, until the sun began to go down Then they faced the gale, and battled their way back to the sea once more, their sea-bred instinct urging on their tired bodies, and proving stronger than their desire to rest again by the way. How the galls know when it is time to return homewards each evening is one of those mysteries of Nature whioh we shall never know, but as the days grow shorter these birds, which in rough weather are daily driven inland in search of food and shelter, leave a few minutes earlier each night, in order to reach home before the last glimmer of daylight has disappeared.
                                                The annual visit of the gulls to London —a feature of their existence which is quite apart from the casual wanderings of the tribe in tempestuous weather - is of compa¬ratively recent origin, though why the gulls took so long, to discover that London was a place where food and shelter was to be found in winter time no one knows. At first only a few stray specimens were to be seen on the lower reaches of the river each au¬tumn, and these wanderers from the main body used to go backwards and forwards to the sea every day. Bat now they come in hundreds and explore the river for miles above London Bridges many of them spending the night on the more secluded waters of the Serpentine and the Long Water of St. James’s Park. And here in the midst of plenty they spend the dark winter days, passing like ghosts to and fro in the fog the: hangs over the river, and seemingly forgetfal of the sea girt cliffs that gave them birth, until one ’ bright morning in the spring one suddenly discovers that they are gone, obedient to the call that bids them return to their nesting places among the rocks.
