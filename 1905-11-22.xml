                    <head>THE SUCRERIES CASE.</head>
                    <head>HEATED ARGUMENTS. </head>
                    <p>The action brought by M. Poutrel against the Hon. A. J. Davey for wrongful
                        dismissal came before Judge Herzbruch yesterday morn ing, as was briefly
                        announced yesterday. The other members of the Court were Judges Vasquez and
                        Goracuchi, Fuad Bey Gross, and Youssef Bey Aziz. The defence was opened by
                        Me. Carton de Wiart, who pleaded with great eloquence and vigour. After
                        declaring that M. Pontrel’s action was inspired by personal malice, he
                        described the proceed- ings of the plaintiff as unfair and disloyal
                        throughout. M. Poutrel, after a violent per- sonal attack on the plaintiff
                        in the columns of the local Press, had left the country, in the possesion of
                        documents that be had secured in the most unjustifiable manner, without
                        daring to prove bis allegations personally. As for his dismissal, that was
                        the act not of the Hon. A. J. Davey, but of the company’s acting manager
                        obeying the orders of his board.</p>
                    <p>Turning to M. Poutrel’s conduct, Me. Car- ton de Wiart pointed out that if
                        the employes of the Sucreries Company had lied to the defendant, they had
                        lied in accordance with the instructions of MM. Poutrel and Ninci Ever since
                        1901 defendant bad complained that no communications had been made to him
                        directly, and it was a striking fact that none of the bills, acceptances,
                        etc., that M. Poutrel concealed bore defendant’s signature. That M. Poutrel
                        had kept the Hon. A. J. Davey in the dark was abundantly proved by certain
                        letters and documents which were read in Court, while his conduct in
                        destroying copies of numerous letters was most suspicious. The late M. de la
                        Bouglise, in a letter written five days before his death, declared that even
                        be did not know why the 18,000,000 fr. of the Cronier bills had been
                        accepted. No one knew fully but Nirci, Poutrel, and Cronier what was going
                        or, and defendant and other mem- bers of the board had been victimised.</p>
                    <p>Me Guilbaumou replied on the same lines as those which be followed in his
                        speech on Tuesday last The Hon. A. J. Davey's igno- rance was assumed—a
                        pose, in fact—and if he had realised a single fact he most have realis- ed
                        the whole situation. His failure was due either to complete ignorance or to
                        the fact that he wilfully closed his eyes to facts. The evidence supported
                        the latter alternative, and that being so defendant had no right whatever to
                        dismiss M. Poutrel. In the course of a question to counsel for the
                        plaintiff, Me. Carton de Wiart made the remark that if M. Poutrel returned
                        to Egypt he would have him arrested within 24 hours. Me. Gailhau- mou
                        replied that he would break the Dews to his client, and shortly afterwards,
                        at 11 am., the Court rose.</p>

                        harbour last Saturday afternoon has been considerably exaggerated. The

                    <p>As the Sardinia was leaving for Liverpool, owing to some as yet unexplained

                    <p>The village of El Atamneh, in the Tahta district, is gaining unenviable
                        notoriety for lawlessness. Cases of assault and robbery are if frequent
                        occurrence, and the prison is full of delinquents. Our Tahta Correspondent
                        re- ports that last week a merchant of that town, while on his way home, was
                        brutally attacked near El Atamneh by two men, who afterwards robbed him of
                        his money and made away, leav- ing him lying senseless. On news of the crime
                        reaching Tahta, the authorities procceded to the spot and opened an enquiry,
                        the result cf which was that the police succeeded in arrest- ing tho robbers
                        while they were trying to hide among some ruins at El Madmar. The stolen
                        money was found on them.</p>

                    <head>VISIT TO ALEXANDRIA.</head>
                    <p>An interesting commercinl experiment is about to be tried by the Americans,
                        who are equipping a large steamer at New York on which American
                        manufacturers will make a display of their products and send them around the
                        world on a 60,000 mile trip, which will take up about 15 months. This
                        itinerary provides for stops at ports of the most import tant commercial
                        countries of the world. The steamer will sail from New York about the end of
                        March and will first visit English, Scotch, and Irish ports, then going on
                        to the Continent, after which she will enter the Mediterranean and call at
                        Alexandria among other ports. A stay of several days is to be made here, as
                        at other ports, for the purpose of permitting examination of the samples, by
                        merchants and others interested in handling American products. Invitations
                        will be sent out to desirable persons to inspect the display. The plan,
                        besides possessing the merit of originality, will comprise a splendid
                        opportu- nity for American manufacturers to bring their goods to the
                        attention of the foreign buying public. The undertaking is likely to create
                        wide interest in the commercial world.</p>

                    <head>BRITISH MANUFACTURERS' EXHIBITION.</head>
                    <p>A meeting was held at H.B.M.’s Consulate, Alexandria, yesterday, in
                        connection with the proposed holding of an exhibition 'of British
                        manufactures in Alexandria and Cairo, Mr. Ambroise Ralli being in the chair.
                        There was a fairly representative gathering present Mr. Naggiar, chairman of
                        the advisory committee, presented the committee's report, which was in favor
                        of the holding of the exhibition, provided a guarantee fund could be raised.
                        The committee had received a large number of responses to the circular which
                        they issued to manufacturers at home, and if a guarantee fund could be
                        raised, and an influential committee appointed to carry it through, the
                        exhibition would, in their opinion, be a suc- cess. The majority of those
                        present, however, did not seem to be convinced, and after some discussion it
                        was decided to call another meeting of the British colony to decide on the
                        question whether or not the exhibition should be held.</p>

                        of the visitors. After tea was partaken of, a good musical programme was
