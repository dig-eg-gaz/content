                        <p>London, November 10. Mr. Balfour, speaking at the Guildhall, made a long
                            statement on the question of the unemployed. He dwelt on the difficulty
                            finding a remedy which wonld not do more harm than good. He appealed to
                            the benevolent support of the pablic, especially those present of aid
                            the Governmeut in the employment he means at its disposal. After having
                            mentioned the appearacoe Japan among the Great Powers he spoke of the
                            internal condition of Russia, and express- ed the hope that the future
                            will not be sullied by the horrible soenes whioh have marked the
                            beginning of the movement in the direction of self-government. He
                            afterwards spoke of the efforts of Great Britain in the oonne of the
                            last ten years to make war impossible, and to develop the field if
                            arbitration. He remarked that now there is no question of a frontier in
                            Afrioa or else- where which might give rise to misundersUnt ngs. He has
                            the firm hope that we shall see 10 war in the fntnre except some ruler
                            should arise to trample on the rights for bis own aggran disement. There
                            is no pro-prot of such a calalamity falling upon Europe. (Reuter)</p>

                        <p>To the Editor or thr Egyptian Gaxbtte Sir,—Your leading artiole on
                            Alexandria’s water supply in yesterday’s issue of the "Gssetta" was an
                            exoelknt pieoe of special pleading for that altroiitio and most phil-
                            anthropic ooncern known as the Alexandria Water. Company, limited. As a
                            matter of fact, however, there were some inaoonraoies, all of which
                            possibly nnoonscionsly were to the advantage of the oompany. In the
                            first place, I should be obliged if you will permit me to point oat that
                            at the time the Alexandria Municipality first attempted to exercise come
                            supervision over the company, it was discover- ed that the ktter were
                            charging the doable of what they were legally entitled to for a girbeh
                            of water. The result was that the poor native who took hk water from the
                            "homes fontainee" bad to pay mnob more than his more fortonste brethren,
                            who oonld afford to subscribe for a permanent supply of water. The
                            Municipality pot a stop to this extortion in the interests of the
                            public. The question of the meters and the monthly subscription were
                            gone into soon sfterwards,and the tariff, whioh is still in vigoor for
                            sn un- limited supply of water, was then arranged. This reform was duo
                            to the Municipality. There is an omission in the article of the name of
                            Amin I aaha Fikry, one of the best Governors Alexandria ever bad, who,
                            during the short time he was Governor, contributed greatly to the work
                            of coming to an agreement with the oompany. The original oontnot was
                            that the Municipality should pay three quarters and the oompany one
                            quarter, with a maximum of LE 10,000: Subsequently the Municipality
                            arranged that they should give a lump sum of LE. 60,00 and that the
                            company should provide the balance. The construction of the filters has
                            been admirably carried out, and this balance paid by the company has
                            exceeded to a certain extent the LB 10,000 calculated upon.—Truly,
                            yours. Alexandrian. Alexaadria, November 10.</p>

                        <p>One of the questions, whioh will have to be settled soon, ia that of the
                            new theatre at Alexandria whioh is to take the plaoe of the Zinnia,
                            which has only a short time to ran before its demolition. The idea
                            prevailing among the leading lights of the Alexandria pkygoen is that
                            tha Municipality should give the site for a new theatre free, and that
                            it should be bnilt by looal capitalists and beoome the property of the
                            Maniaq>*lity after the capital has been amortised. Great divergenoy of
                            opinion exists, firstly, as to what site should be asked for, and
                            second, ly, what sum should be spent on the bnilding. Some ardent
                            pttronc of tha drama want a bnilding of the paktial character of the
                            Paris Grand Opera, while others think £40,CC0 to £60,000 wonld be quite
                            sufficient to spend on saoh a bnilding. Owing to these conflicting
                            opinions, to far no application has been to the Municipality, which is,
                            we believe, quite disposed to favorably oonsider any reasonable
                            proposals that may be made.</p>

                        <p>An interesting visitor to Alexandria has arrived to the person of M.
                            Joseph Gerard, a Frenchman, who celebrates his 84th birthday today, and
                            who started from Bros roll on the 1st March, 1901, on a walking tonr
                            round the world for a wager. Gerard was to have completed his journey to
                            three yean, bnt be was stricken down with fever in Shanghai and had
                            consequently to return to Franoe to reonperate. and tiros lost the bet.
                            He it, however, sn indefatigable traveller, and was not long to Franoe
                            before he staited on his peregrinations again, so that he has been globe
                            trotting more or lees for the last 4 1/2 years, and has more than
                            oomp'eted the tons of the world. The countries ha has visited on his
                            travels are Bulgaria, Germany, Denma k, Norway, Swoden, Finland, Russia,
                            Siberia, Korea, Japan, Chins, Cochin China, India, Franoe, Spain,

                        <p>To THi Editor or thx Egyptian Gaottk. Sir,—Within the last few years, I
                            note with pleasure the increasing nse of the Ktglish kngusge in Egypt I
                            have just been (coking at a new periodioel entitled "The Oriental
                            Truth,” whioh, the editoT says, will ha ran entirely on American lines,
                            and of which the first part k written in what appean at first wight to
                            he English. I do not find any fault with the editor's ideas, and some of
                            the articles are interesting and cheerful hat many of the words he usee
                            on every page are so utterly st variance with three to be found to any
                            English dictionary, that I am led to suppose that the language as well
                            as the lines on whioh the paper is to be run is American. I regret to
                            say that I have but a very alight acquaintance with current American
                            periodics literature, but if this is a specimen of it, our langnage must
                            be fast approaching a line of oleavage ; some such nnoomfortable
                            position as that of Sweden snd Norway. If this fa the care, I wish to
                            ray that the experience of many years in thk oopntry leads me fo think
                            that one of the hardens onder which it kbours k doe to the excessive
                            num- ber of languages used here, and I should like to ask the editor of
                            "The Oriental Truth" to pause and reflect for a little while before he
                            inflicts another on a long-suffering, hot already over-laden
                            community.—I am, etc, Observer Alexandria, 10 Nov.</p>

                        <head>THE SAHARAN OCEAN </head>
                        <head>AN IMPORTANT SCHEME</head>
                        <p>It wonld not.be a very, difficult undertaking to oonvert the great
                            depression of the Sahara into an inland ocean, as once it. was. Such a
                            scheme is already being mooted, and talk is sometimes the prelude to
                            action. It is reckoned that the depression comes up nearest to the sea
                            midway between the twentieth and thirti- eth parallels of latitude on
                            the Atlantic tide, and that a canal sixty miles in length would flood
                            the whole interior with salt water. The result would be both good, and
                            bad. It wonld open op an immense region to shipping communication, and
                            there would be many large islands still above wator-level. It would also
                            obliterate vast realms of barbarism. On the other hand, the vineyards of
                            Southern Europe, which depend much on the hot, dry winds from the
                            African desert, would suffer severely, many even to destruction.</p>

                        <head>THE DAM'S WATER POWER.</head>
                        <p>A curious photograph has been sent home by the engineers of Meseit. John
                            Aird to illustrate the surprising liftirgpower of flowing water, as
                            illustrated by the efffete of water pouring from the aluices of the Nile
                            Dam at Arsonan. The dam sometimes holds up a height of 60ft. of water,
                            but the aluices are of different heights, and give the stream that pours
                            through them a head of no more than 3fft and therefore a velocity of
                            little toon than 30fL a second. Yet the discharge has been able to lift
                            a blook of quarts 17ft -by 12ft. by 7 ft., and weighing approximately 60
                            tone, and fling it took, head over heels, as it Were, on to the masonry
                            of the dam. Such occur- rences are not rare-on sea-walk, where there :
                            is an impact of storm-driven waves. At Wick Harbour, for example, to
                            1872 a monolith weighing 1,870 tons was lilted fay the wave* and later,
                            when thk had been replaced by one of 9,610 tone, the heavier stood was
                            also washed- away. But at Assouan the impelling force was only running
                            water.</p>
