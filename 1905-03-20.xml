                    <head>THE ASSOUAN DAM.</head>
                    <p>The Government has decided not to heighten the <placeName>Assouan
                            Dam</placeName> in the meantime, and as a corollary, not to sell, or
                        grant in concession, any large blocks of free State lands. <persName>Sir
                            William Garstin</persName>, in fall accord with <persName>Sir Benjamin
                            Baker</persName>, has come to a momentous decision, and the Council of
                        Ministers has adopted the conclusions arrived at We are told that scholiasts
                        have evolved new theories to prove that a dam might be safe as regards
                        cracking horizontally, but nevertheless be liable to crack vertically. We
                        are also told that a good deal of protective work must be undertaken
                        down-stream of the sluices. The public have been told all they need know. It
                        is enough to justify the decision arrived at against heightening the dam
                        meantime. Sir <persName>William Willcocks</persName>’ opinion, frankly
                        expressed, can be best described as calling it funk on the part of Sir
                        Benjamin Baker, and in so doing affords a singular instance of freedom from
                        restraints of office. Our excellent confrere the "Phare d’Alexandrie” says
                        people believe that the report of Sir Wm. Garstin conceals an able manoeuvre
                        to check speculation in land,to the encouragement of transport facilities.
                        Government need not employ deep-laid schemes to develop transport. If this
                        were their aim it could be achieved by | less jealous obstacle-raising to
                        the development of the Delta Light Railway, and by respecting possible and
                        past navigation channels for the smaller class of boats. The desire to check
                        land speculation is laudable, but a Government can do much harm by
                        interference with economic laws. The British financial world is casting
                        longing eyes on Egypt, and. will have the land as surely as jt took the
                            <placeName>Transvaal goldfields</placeName>. The prohibition of all
                        Large sales of Government land is too drastic. The result will be increased
                        theft of Mariout lands by fictitious Bedouin sales, and transactions on
                        doubtful title of inferior lands elsewhere at high prices. We are promised a
                        study, of storage schemes other than heightening the dam, and
                        contemporaneously with this study there might be study of reclamation
                        methods on small selected areas. Sir Will Wllcocks advocates small basin
                        reservoirs in the Delta, and there is no earthly reason why he should not be
                        allowed to make the experiment. Other people advocate the use to drainage
                        water for reclamation purposes, and are prepared to back their opinion by
                        costly experiment. Artesian water may yet be found in Egypt, and , every
                        encouragement should be given to those who will undertake such an expensive
                        risk as boring to great depths. There are a million and a half feddans of
                        waste land in Egypt, and Government have a sacred trust in seeing that it
                        does not fall into the hands of capitalists for the mere asking. That trust
                        is equally abused if the talent is tied up in a napkin. It is pusillanimous
                        to stop all advance in reclamation because theorists question formula; for
                        calculating masonry dams, and it is weak to say if Government grant anyone
                        laud for experiment others will expect the same treatment It is in the
                        interacts of Egypt that in anticipation of farther summer supplies of Nile
                        water, lull experiment should meantime be allowed of rival reclamation
                        systems. Then Government will have some data to go on when the time comes to
                        deal with the waste State lands. A Government so desirous to protect the
                        public should see that land is neither given away, nor sold at prices
                        disastrous to the investor. A great deal of the outcry about scanty summer
                        water would cease if the whole of Lower Egypt were not now being put under
                        summer crop. Restriction of rice cultivation, and a permanent decree
                        forbidding the sowing of maize till July 20, would instantly result iu the
                        present summer supply being ample. Gross abuses have crept into file use of
                        summer and should be peremptorily checked. It is a solution of the present
                        difficulty which we submit to Government as an alternative course preferable
                        to stopping all agricultural development in Egypt. </p>

                        years ago in South Africa and was treated with cocaine injections. The drug
                        healed her, but left far worse consequences than any which the malady it
                        cured could have done. Cocaine appears to have entirely mastered her, and
                        she became a helpless victim to the habit. It is evident that while under
                        the influence of the effects of the drug she decided to make away with
                        herself, and made an injection strong enough to kill six men. The inquest

                        Mrs. Pain had passed away, having laid down her life in the work. Her
                        husband, Dr. Maynard Pain, who had been in charge of the <placeName>Prince
                            Alfred Hospital</placeName> in Sydney until he joined the C.M.S., is
                        still a member of the society's staff in Old Cairo, and it was from his
                        friends in Australia and New Zealand that subscriptions amounting to £4,800
                        had been received. No grant has been asked for from the C.M.8. in London,
                        but about £460 has been eeutin donations from England, £127 by residents in
                        Egypt and visitors at the hotels, while the members of the mission have
                        shown their own belief in the value of the work by contributing £76. The
                        money already subscribed is sufficient for ad the building contemplated. The
                        hospital, when finished, will contain beds for about 35 women and children,
                        and the present hospital will then be reserved for men only. There will also
                        be an operating theatre with all the latest improvements, towards which the
                        sterilising apparatus and an operating table have been already contributed.
                            <placeName>Sir Algernon</placeName> concluded by saying that a hospital
                        of this sort was one of the best ways of letting our works testify to the
                        value of the faith which will be proclaimed within its walls. Shortly before
                        six o’clock the company dispersed, and, in response to a stfygestion made
                        during Sir Algernon’s speeoh, contributed P.T.923 to a box placed for that
                        purpose at the gate. </p>

                        occurred at daybreak this morning. Mrs. Boysen, wife of a Suez Canal pilot
                        of German nationality, in a state of mental aberration, threw herself from a

                    <p>WARDAN ESTATE CO. The Wardan Estate Company is bringing out a fresh issue of
                        capital, details of which will be found in an advertisement in another
                        column. We have received a copy of the directors’ report to be submitted to
                        the shareholders of the company at their first annual general meeting to be
                        held in <placeName>Cairo</placeName> to-morrow. This shows that substantial
                        progress has been made towards the reclamation of the company’s lands; 830
                        feddans were levelled by cattle up to the 31st December last in spite of
                        cattle plague and consequent difficulty in obtaining cattle. The difficulty
                        is being got over by the purchase of a pair of Messrs. McLaren’s 20 h.p.
                        ploughing machines; more of these powerful engines are to be employed if the
                        working results of the first pair justify it The directors report that the
                        result of last year’s flood is very satisfactory, notwithstanding the poor
                        Nile flood with which the Wardan Company, in common with the rest of Egypt,
                        had to put up with. Tree planting has successfully passed the experimental
                        stage. Sufficient trees to plant 360 feddans are ready in pots to be planted
                        out this year. Twenty-seven miles of flood canal, representing more than a
                        million oubio metres of excavation, has been completed and has been provided
                        with regulators and sluices. The directors having satisfied themselves by
                        practical experiment that the system, adopted on the recommendation of Sir
                        William Willoooks, K. C. M. G., for reclaiming these lands is sound and
                        practicable, are now calling up the remainder of the unissued share capital,
                        and have engaged the necessary engineering staff so as to complete the work
                        in the oonrae of the next three years. Like all land reclamation
                        undertakings, time is required before dividends can be paid, but we have
                        little doubt that the shareholders of the Wardan Company who can wait a year
                        or two longer will reap a handsome reward. </p>

                    <head>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</head>
                    <p>Sir,The official explanation given in the “Gazette” of Saturday in regard to
                        the strictures of the International Chamber of Shipping on the could not of
                        the Ports and Lighthouses Administration in the case of the foundering of
                        the Florio-Rubattido SB. “Cairo,” does not dear up all the difficulties to
                        the responsibility for the disaster. In the first pis, it is said that the
                        captain of the steamer same within the pivot buoy, and, being an experienced
                        hand at entering the port of Alexandria, he without a pilot on hoard should
                        have either steamed up to the quarantine anchorage or else let go his anchor
                        in the neighbourhood of the pivot buoy. He would then no doufithavejot a
                        pilot within hslf-an-hour or/ say, an hour. Failing that it should have
                        waited until daylight Had he wished to remain outside the harbour, he could
                        have anchored anywhere within half-a-mile of the Bough Pass, by keeping his
                        leading lights in one and steering in that course. The book of Admiralty
                        directions to the port of Alexandria is quite dear to any stranger who
                        approaches the port at night and that coupled with the most excellent
                        leading lights’ and the breakwater fight should have enabled the captain or
                        even a stranger to enter the port without a pilot with the greatest of ease.
                        How the ship managed to fetch up ou the Agame shoal, when the leading fights
                        can be seen on a dark night with a dear atmosphere for seven or eight miles,
                        it is difficult for any navigator to understand. The pilot boats are in the
                        habit of lying on a calm night either at the Tiviot wreck bnoy or else lying
                        well outside in deep water, quite dear of the Agame shoal. There is
                        therefore no excuse for any navigator entering the port of Alexandria at
                        night to mistake probably a fidring boat off the Agame shoal for a pilot
                        boat Another point I should like to point out is that as the Ports and
                        Lighthouses Administration’s powerful.tug “Teir el-Mina” is not fitted with
                        water-tube boilers, it is impossible to raise steam within six hoars unless
                        a great deal of barm be done to the boilers. If the Administration had had
                        any other tog-boats available no doubt assistance would have been sent at
                        onoe. But taking into consideration the state of the sea and swell, it was
                        impossible for any boat, tug-boat or otherwise, to get dose up to the
                        “Cairo” until the morning. In my humble opinion the official who is
                        responsible for the port of Alexandria and the interests thereof is the
                        Captain of the Port I have been informed that this official, on hearing the
                        pews, ordered steam at once to be got up on the “Tdr-d-Mina,” but owing to
                        the state of the weather found that it was impossible to get alongside.
                        However, the next morning the “Teir el Mina,” towing three boats, went out
                        to the soene of the wreck in order to save both passengers and mails, and,
                        if necessary, the baggage. The “Cairo” had a list ot 45 degrees to starboard
                        and it was therefore impossible to save any baggage. One mail-room, on being
                        opened, was found to have had its oontents all washed away. 1 have read a
                        great many allegations in some of the local French papers on the subject of
                        the dangers of the port of Alexandria apropos of the wreck of the “Cairo.”
                        In my opinion as an experienced navigator of this port, and of many other
                        ports also, Alexandria is one of the best-lit ports in the whole of the
                        Mediterranean, and therefore there ought to be no excuse for any man
                        responsible for the navigation of a ship to deviate from his oourse except
                        in oaae of fog. Even in the latter case there is very little margin for

                        oourse, at the same time, pay careful attention to the ohart If this advice
                        be followed, there oan be no possible difficulty in entering the port of

                    <p>Major Scott Elliott, Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders, late second in command
                        of the 2nd Battalion at Pretoria, has been 'promoted Lieutenant-Colonel
                        commanding the 1st Battalion at Dublin. The new chief of. the old 79th is
                        well known in Egypt where he served for a considerable time. He was with the
                        Camerons at the routing of Arabi from Tel-el-Kebir’s trenches, the Nile
                        Expepedition 1884-5, and he commanded the Cameron detachment of the Camel
                        Corps in the operations on the Sudan frontier 1885-6. Captain Bertram W. Y.
                        Danford, Royal Engineers, lately employed at the School of Military
                        Engineering,* has been specially selected for service with the Egyptian
                        Army. There are just a dozen officers of the sappers employed with the
                        Khedivial forces. The report of the Director of the Recruiting and
                        Organisation for 1904, just published, shows that the number of recruits who
                        joined the regular army exclusive of Colonial Corps was 41,279, and the
                        Militia recruits 35,624. pi the latter, 15,648 joined the regular army and
                        792 men who enlisted for Colonial Corps. A total number 71,699 men presented
                        themselves for enlistment, and out of these 24,658 were /ejected18,816 tor
                        various ailments aid 5,842 to poor physique. The report, emphatically states
                        that the regulation requiring a character on enlistment has materially
                        raised the tone of the army and popularised it amongst the better class of
                        the people.</p>
                    <p>Uncle Sam's short ride has also proved a dead failurelike our own. It was to
                        be a lick-creation rifle with the cutest little cleaping rod bayonet ever
                        devised. The lesson in the Far East, where the little Japs have not only
                        withstood magazine ride fire,-but pushed home their assault with cold steel,
                        has not been lost on the Washington officials, who are now devising a longer
                        bayonet. It is to be hoped that our own officials will take the hint It has
                        been decided to increase the Royal-Naval Reserve by permitting seamen of
                        four years’ service to be transferred to it on payment of the proportion of
                        their discharge money. Men of eight years’ service can transfer free. The
                        Royal Marines are included in this but stokers and higher ratings are
                        excluded. The order will remain in force during the financial year of
                        1905-6, at the end of which it will be reported upon. </p>

                    <head>UM RUS Gold Mines</head>
                    <p>The directors of the Um Kus Gold Mines of Egypt propose to issue 30,000 new
                        shares to $1 each, thereby raising the capital of the company to £ 180,000,
                        and in a circular which has been sent out conveuiug the necessary meeting
                        for the consideration of the resolution they express the opinion that the
                        scale of operations should be extended, with the ultimate object of
                        increasing the number of stamps and erecting a cyanide plant for the
                        recovery of the gold from the tailings. These shares will be offered at par
                        in the first instance to the existing shareholders at the rate of one new
                        share for every five shares held, payable as follows :5s. per share on
                        application, 5s. per share on allotment, and the balance in calls not
                        exceeding 5s. per share allotment of not less than three months. The
                        directors hope that each- shareholder will avail himself of this opportunity
                        of increasing his holding in the company. </p>
                    <p>The proposal to increase the capital has been sanctioned by the Egyptian
                        Government. The light railway from the harbour of Imbarak to the mine, about
                        five and a-half miles in length, has been completed, and a locomotive
                        installed carriage of machinery and stores to the mine is much facilitated
                        thereby. The company owns a steamer, which brings machinery and goods from
                        Suez to Imbarak. By this means shipments from England are made expeditiously
                        and economically. To facilitate the landing of goods a* substantial jetty,
                        157 ft. long, has been constructed. A crane has been fixed thereon, and
                        goods are lifted out of the lighters direct into the railway trucks. At the
                        harbour the electrical power station is practically complete. Two 150-k.w.
                        generators have been installed, and power will be transmitter! Then mine to
                        drive the air compressor, hauling gear, and other plant The mill has been
                        erected at a convenient site close to the power station, and necessary
                        boilers to supply the steam required to drive the electrical machinery and
                        mill engine are completed. The air compressor has been designed to work ten
                        rock drills, with the object of opening up the reef with greater rapidity.
                        It is estimated that there are about 9,000 tons of ore already in reserve.'
                        For the purpose of considering the proposals an extraordinary general
                        meeting has been convened at the Cannon Street Hotel to-day. The “St James’s
                        Gazette” remarks : We do not see any reason why the proprietors should rush
                        to take advantage of the ' occasion. The directors are of opinion that the
                        Beale of operations should be extended by an increase in the number of
                        stamps and the erection of a cyanide plant. But there seems no immediate
                        hurry for this, since there are only about 9,000 tons of ore in reserve, or
                        about enough to keep the present stamps going for nine months. </p>
