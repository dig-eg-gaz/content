                    <head> THE ASSOUAN DAM.</head>
                    <p>The Government has decided not to heighten the Assouan Dam in the meantime,
                        and as a corollary, not to sell, or grant in concession, any large blocks of
                        free State lands. Sir William Garstin, in fall accord with Sir Benjamin
                        Baker, has come to a momentous decision, and the Council of Ministers has
                        adopted the conclusions arrived at We are told that scholiasts have evolved
                        new theories to prove that a dam might be safe as regards cracking
                        horizontally, but nevertheless be liable to crack vertically. We are also
                        told that a good deal of protective work must be undertaken down-stream of
                        the sluices. The public have been told all they need know. It is enough to
                        justify the decision arrived at against heightening the dam meantime. Sir
                        William Willcocks’ opinion, frankly expressed, can be best described as
                        calling it funk on the part of Sir Benjamin Baker, and in so doing affords a
                        singular instance of freedom from restraints of office. Our excellent
                        confrere the "Phare d’Alexandrie” says people believe that the report of Sir
                        Wm. Garstin conceals an able manoeuvre to check speculation in land,to the
                        encouragement of transport facilities. Government need not employ deep-laid
                        schemes to develop transport. If this were their aim it could be achieved by
                        | less jealous obstacle-raising to the development of the Delta Light
                        Railway, and by respecting possible and past navigation channels for the
                        smaller class of boats. The desire to check land speculation is laudable,
                        but a Government can do much harm by interference with economic laws. The
                        British financial world is casting longing eyes on Egypt, and. will have the
                        land as surely as jt took the Transvaal goldfields. The prohibition of all
                        Large sales of Government land is too drastic. The result will be increased
                        theft of Mariout lands by fictitious Bedouin sales, and transactions on
                        doubtful title of inferior lands elsewhere at high prices. We are promised a
                        study, of storage schemes other than heightening the dam, and
                        contemporaneously with this study there might be study of reclamation
                        methods on small selected areas. Sir Will Wllcocks advocates small basin
                        reservoirs in the Delta, and there is no earthly reason why he should not be
                        allowed to make the experiment. Other people advocate the use to drainage
                        water for reclamation purposes, and are prepared to back their opinion by
                        costly experiment. Artesian water may yet be found in Egypt, and , every
                        encouragement should be given to those who will undertake such an expensive
                        risk as boring to great depths. There are a million and a half feddans of
                        waste land in Egypt, and Government have a sacred trust in seeing that it
                        does not fall into the hands of capitalists for the mere asking. That trust
                        is equally abused if the talent is tied up in a napkin. It is pusillanimous
                        to stop all advance in reclamation because theorists question formula; for
                        calculating masonry dams, and it is weak to say if Government grant anyone
                        laud for experiment others will expect the same treatment It is in the
                        interacts of Egypt that in anticipation of farther summer supplies of Nile
                        water, lull experiment should meantime be allowed of rival reclamation
                        systems. Then Government will have some data to go on when the time comes to
                        deal with the waste State lands. A Government so desirous to protect the
                        public should see that land is neither given away, nor sold at prices
                        disastrous to the investor. A great deal of the outcry about scanty summer
                        water would cease if the whole of Lower Egypt were not now being put under
                        summer crop. Restriction of rice cultivation, and a permanent decree
                        forbidding the sowing of maize till July 20, would instantly result iu the
                        present summer supply being ample. Gross abuses have crept into file use of
                        summer and should be peremptorily checked. It is a solution of the present
                        difficulty which we submit to Government as an alternative course preferable
                        to stopping all agricultural development in Egypt. </p>

                        musically aud finan oially a decided success. There was a large and
                        fashionable gathering present. Mrs. Willmore again sang aud acted
                        excellently. Mr. Webb performed very fairly as Frederick, considering the
                        strain that had been put on his voice in the last performance. Miss Delanoy
                        and Mrs, Nolan also were greatly appreciated by the audieuce. Mr. Trimeu, as
                        the Major-Ge ueral, gave a very good performance in deed. He was one of the
                        few performers we have seen in amateur operetta who knows how to move about
                        the stage naturally. He was a little confused once, when giving the encore
                        verse of the Major-General’s song, but really the verse in question was a
                        little difficult. Capt. Tucker, R.E., gave a very good performance of the
                        Sergeant of Police, and the two encore verses which he sang were
                        enthusiastically received. He had quite got over any of the nervousness
                        which he show ed in the last performance. Of the others, Mr. Serle Peacock,
                        as Samuel, the Hod. C. James, as the Pirate King, and Mrs Merton, as Ruth,
                        played their parts with great spirit, but we did not quite understand the
                        change in Mrs. Merton’s “make-up” in the second act, which was hardly in
                        accord ance with the spirit of the piece. The chorus performed their part
                        very creditably. To turn to the music, Bimbaahi Franklin had considerable
                        difficulty with his orchestra, but succeeded in staving off disaster, which
                        threatened in the second aofc. Dr. Clark, as prompter, and Major Delavoye,
                        as stage manager, deserve oar congratulations for their energy and success.
                        ENGLISH GIRL’S SUICIDE. TRAGEDY AT ALEXANDRIA. A young Englishwoman, of the
                        name of Dora Blake, recently employed as a governess in an English family
                        resident at Ramleh, committed suicide on Saturday at “ Ipswich ” (formerly
                        known as Johnson House), Alexandria. The story of the suicide is a sad one.
                        Miss Blake fell ill a few years ago in South Africa and was treated with
                        cocaine injections. The drug healed her, but left far worse consequences
                        than any which the malady it cured could have done. Cocaine appears to have
                        entirely mastered her, and she became a helpless victim to the habit. It is
                        evident that while under the influence of the effects of the drug she
                        decided to make away with herself, and made an injection strong enough to
                        kill six men. The inquest and funeral took place yesterday. THE NEW HOSPITAL
                        IN OLD CAIRO. An interesting service took place on Friday afternoon, 17 th
                        inst, when the foundation-stone of the “Ethel Pain Memorial Hospital” was
                        laid in the Church Missionary Sooiety’s compound at Old Cairo. About 160
                        people were present, and, after partaking of tea in the garden, assembled at
                        the spot ohosen, at the south-west oomer of the new building. The Rt. Rev.
                        the Bishop in Jerusalem and the East was present, and, after robing, was
                        preceded to the site by his chaplain, the Rev. N. Odeh, Archdeacon Potter of
                        Cyprus, Dean Butcher, and the.C.M.S. clergy. The Bishop conducted the
                        servioe according to a form whioh had been specially prepared for the
                        occasion, and several of the other olergy took part The actual oeremony of
                        laying the stone was performed by Sir Algernon Coote, Bart (President of the
                        Hibernian C.M.8.), who used in the process a handsome silver and ebony
                        mallet and trowel which had been presented to him by the architect, Mr. A.H.
                        Skyuder, M.S. .C.F. In a short speeoh Sir Algernoon expressed his pleasure
                        at having been asked to lay this stone, and his interest, as an Irishman, in
                        finding that the oeremony was to take place on St Patriok’s Day. He then
                        described the lack of room in the present hospital, the large number of
                        patients, both paying and free, who are treated in it every year, and the
                        circumstances which led to the building of the new memorial wards. Less than
                        two years after her first arrival in Egypt Mrs. Pain had passed away, having
                        laid down her life in the work. Her husband, Dr. Maynard Pain, who had been
                        in charge of the Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney until he joined the
                        C.M.S., is still a member of the society's staff in Old Cairo, and it was
                        from his friends in Australia and New Zealand that subscriptions amounting
                        to £4,800 had been received. No grant has been asked for from the C.M.8. in
                        London, but about £460 has been eeutin donations from England, £127 by
                        residents in Egypt and visitors at the hotels, while the members of the
                        mission have shown their own belief in the value of the work by contributing
                        £76. The money already subscribed is sufficient for ad the building
                        contemplated. The hospital, when finished, will contain beds for about 35
                        women and children, and the present hospital will then be reserved for men
                        only. There will also be an operating theatre with all the latest
                        improvements, towards which the sterilising apparatus and an operating table
                        have been already contributed. Sir Algernon concluded by saying that a
                        hospital of this sort was one of the best ways of letting our works testify
                        to the value of the faith which will be proclaimed within its walls. Shortly
                        before six o’clock the company dispersed, and, in response to a stfygestion
                        made during Sir Algernon’s speeoh, contributed P.T.923 to a box placed for
                        that purpose at the gate. VENETIAN FETE AT MENA HOUSE. The Mena House trams
                        were orowded on Saturday evening with residents and visitors on their way to
                        the Venetian, whioh proved a brilliant success. The hotel and the gardens
                        were illuminated with hundreds of Chinese lanterns; there was a fine display
                        of fireworks, and the Bedouin fantasia which took place by the police
                        station was greatly appreciated. The dining-room was crowded, and many
                        parties were given before the fete began. Among those who gave dinner
                        parties were H.H. Priuoe Haidar, who had a party of 12, Sir John and Lady
                        Sterling-Maxwell, Mr. Uunard, who had a party of 8, Count Wuls-burg, the

                    <head>NOTES FROM PORT SAID.</head>
                    <p>GERMAN LADY’S SUICIDE Port Said, Saturday. A very sad and distressing suicide
                        occurred at daybreak this morning. Mrs. Boysen, wife of a Suez Canal pilot
                        of German nationality, in a state of mental aberration, threw herself from a
                        second-floor window in the Maison Slavick, on the Quay Francois Joseph,
                        killing herself instantly. The deceased, who had been suffering from typhoid
                        fever and pneumonia, asked the nurse in charge to awaken the servant, and it
                        was during her temporary absence for this purpose that the terrible deed was
                        committed. The body was removed to the mortuary at the Egyptian Government
                        Hospital for the enquiry. The funeral took plaoe at 4 p.m. The greatest
                        sympathy is felt for the husband, who is left with four young children. </p>
                    <p>A NEW DREDGER The “Hastings,” a new dredger built on the Clyde for Rangoon,
                        arrived at Port Said on Friday and left on Saturday morning for her
                        destination. </p>
                    <p>THE BALTIC FLEET. Port Said, Sunday. Contrary to the expectations expressed
                        in my notes in your issue of yesterday, the Baltio Fleet has not yet arrived
                        here, nor is there any further news of it,' but the general opinion held
                        here is that both the third squadron and the hospital ship “Kostroma,” which
                        passed through the Dardanelles five days ago, have gone to Soda. The
                        proximity of this squadron is evidenced by the presence in our town of the
                        chief Russian secret agent, who arrived from Cairo at 3.30 p.m. to-day. </p>
                    <p>THE S.8. “PLANET VENUS”. Sues, Saturday. The British steamer “Planet Venus,”
                        whioh grounded in the Suez roads last Wednesday morning, was refloated
                        yesterday evening with the assistance of the tug ‘Titan,” after having
                        discharged several hundred tons of cargo into lightera/which she is to-day
                        reloading. Apparently, the vessel sustained no damage. </p>

                    <p>WARDAN ESTATE CO. The Wardan Estate Company is bringing out a fresh issue of
                        capital, details of which will be found in an advertisement in another
                        column. We have received a copy of the directors’ report to be submitted to
                        the shareholders of the company at their first annual general meeting to be
                        held in Cairo to-morrow. This shows that substantial progress has been made
                        towards the reclamation of the company’s lands; 830 feddans were levelled by
                        cattle up to the 31st December last in spite of cattle plague and consequent
                        difficulty in obtaining cattle. The difficulty is being got over by the
                        purchase of a pair of Messrs. McLaren’s 20 h.p. ploughing machines; more of
                        these powerful engines are to be employed if the working results of the
                        first pair justify it The directors report that the result of last year’s
                        flood is very satisfactory, notwithstanding the poor Nile flood with whioh
                        the Wardan Company, in common with the rest of Egypt, had to put up with.
                        Tree planting has successfully passed the experimental stage. Sufficient
                        trees to plant 360 feddans are ready in pots to be planted out this year.
                        Twenty-seven miles of flood canal, representing more than a million oubio
                        metres of excavation, has been completed and has been provided with
                        regulators and sluices. The directors having satisfied themselves by
                        practical experiment that the system, adopted on the recommendation of Sir
                        William Willoooks, K. C. M. G., for reclaiming these lands is sound and
                        practicable, are now calling up the remainder of the unissued share capital,
                        and have engaged the necessary engineering staff so as to complete the work
                        in the oonrae of the next three years. Like all land reclamation
                        undertakings, time is required before dividends can be paid, but we have
                        little doubt that the shareholders of the Wardan Company who can wait a year
                        or two longer will reap a handsome reward. ALEXANDRIA CENTRAL BUILDINGS CO.

                    <head>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</head>
                    <p> Sir,—The official explanation given in the “Gazette” of Saturday in regard
                        to the strictures of the International Chamber of Shipping on the could not
                        of the Ports and Lighthouses Administration in the case of the foundering of
                        the Florio-Rubattido SB. “Cairo,” does not dear up all the difficulties — to
                        the responsibility for the disaster. In the first pis—, it is said that the
                        captain of the steamer same within the pivot buoy, and, being an experienced
                        hand at entering the port of Alexandria, he without a pilot on hoard should
                        have either steamed up to the quarantine anchorage or else let go his anchor
                        in the neighbourhood of the pivot buoy. He would then no doufithavejot a
                        pilot within hslf-an-hour or/ say, an hour. Failing that it should have
                        waited until daylight Had he wished to remain outside the harbour, he could
                        have anchored anywhere within half-a-mile of the Bough Pass, by keeping his
                        leading lights in one and steering in that course. The book of Admiralty
                        directions to the port of Alexandria is quite dear to any stranger who
                        approaches the port at night and that coupled with the most excellent
                        leading lights’ and the breakwater fight should have enabled the captain or
                        even a stranger to enter the port without a pilot with the greatest of ease.
                        How the ship managed to fetch up ou the Agame shoal, when the leading fights
                        can be seen on a dark night with a dear atmosphere for seven or eight miles,
                        it is difficult for any navigator to understand. The pilot boats are in the
                        habit of lying on a calm night either at the Tiviot wreck bnoy or else lying
                        well outside in deep water, quite dear of the Agame shoal. There is
                        therefore no excuse for any navigator entering the port of Alexandria at
                        night to mistake probably a fidring boat off the Agame shoal for a pilot
                        boat Another point I should like to point out is that as the Ports and
                        Lighthouses Administration’s powerful.tug “Teir el-Mina” is not fitted with
                        water-tube boilers, it is impossible to raise steam within six hoars unless
                        a great deal of barm be done to the boilers. If the Administration had had
                        any other tog-boats available no doubt assistance would have been sent at
                        onoe. But taking into consideration the state of the sea and swell, it was
                        impossible for any boat, tug-boat or otherwise, to get dose up to the
                        “Cairo” until the morning. In my humble opinion the official who is
                        responsible for the port of Alexandria and the interests thereof is the
                        Captain of the Port I have been informed that this official, on hearing the
                        pews, ordered steam at once to be got up on the “Tdr-d-Mina,” but owing to
                        the state of the weather found that it was impossible to get alongside.
                        However, the next morning the “Teir el Mina,” towing three boats, went out
                        to the soene of the wreck in order to save both passengers and mails, and,
                        if necessary, the baggage. The “Cairo” had a list ot 45 degrees to starboard
                        and it was therefore impossible to save any baggage. One mail-room, on being
                        opened, was found to have had its oontents all washed away. 1 have read a
                        great many allegations in some of the local French papers on the subject of
                        the dangers of the port of Alexandria apropos of the wreck of the “Cairo.”
                        In my opinion as an experienced navigator of this port, and of many other
                        ports also, Alexandria is one of the best-lit ports in the whole of the
                        Mediterranean, and therefore there ought to be no excuse for any man
                        responsible for the navigation of a ship to deviate from his oourse except
                        in oaae of fog. Even in the latter case there is very little margin for
                        exouse when the hand lead can be used within seven mil— of the ooast between
                        Marsa Matrouh and PortBaid. I may oonolude the—- few remarks by., expressing
                        a wish that in future navigators, when entering the port of Alexandria by
                        night or by day, will read, mark, learn,and inwardly digest the book of
                        Admiralty directions, which every efficient navigator ought to have, and of
                        oourse, at the same time, pay careful attention to the ohart If this advice
                        be followed, there oan be no possible difficulty in entering the port of
                        Alexandria or any other port—I am, eto, “Navigator.” </p>

                    <p>Major Scott Elliott, Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders, late second in command
                        of the 2nd Battalion at Pretoria, has been 'promoted Lieutenant-Colonel
                        commanding the 1st Battalion at Dublin. The new chief of. the old 79th is
                        well known in Egypt where he served for a considerable time. He was with the
                        Camerons at the routing of Arabi from Tel-el-Kebir’s trenches, the Nile
                        Expepedition 1884-5, and he commanded the Cameron detachment of the Camel
                        Corps in the operations on the Sudan frontier 1885-6. Captain Bertram W. Y.
                        Danford, Royal Engineers, lately employed at the School of Military
                        Engineering,* has been specially selected for service with the Egyptian
                        Army. There are just a dozen officers of the sappers employed with the
                        Khedivial forces. The report of the Director of the Recruiting and
                        Organisation for 1904, just published, shows that the number of recruits who
                        joined the regular army exclusive of Colonial Corps was 41,279, and the
                        Militia recruits 35,624. pi the latter, 15,648 joined the regular army and
                        792 men who enlisted for Colonial Corps. A total number 71,699 men presented
                        themselves tor enlistment, and out of these 24,658 were /ejected—18,816 tor
                        various ailments aid 5,842 to poor physique. The report, emphatically states
                        that the regulation requiring a character on enlistment has materially
                        raised the tone of the army and popularised it amongst the better class of
                        the people.</p>
                    <p> Uncle Sam's short ride has also proved a dead failure—like our own. It was
                        to be a lick-creation rifle with the cutest little cleaping rod bayonet ever
                        devised. The lesson in the Far East, where the little Japs have not only
                        withstood magazine ride fire,-but pushed home their assault with cold steel,
                        has not been lost on the Washington officials, who are now devising a longer
                        bayonet. It is to be hoped that our own officials will take the hint It has
                        been decided to increase the Royal-Naval Reserve by permitting seamen of
                        four years’ service to be transferred to it on payment of the proportion of
                        their discharge money. Men of eight years’ service can transfer free. The
                        Royal Marines are included in this but stokers and higher ratings are
                        excluded. The order will remain in force during the financial year of
                        1905-6, at the end of which it will be reported upon. </p>

                        shares to $1 each, thereby raising the capital of the company to £ 180,000,
                        and in a circular which has been sent out conveuiug the necessary meeting
                        for the consideration of the resolution they express the opinion that the
                        scale of operations should be extended, with the ultimate object of
                        increasing the number of stamps and erecting a cyanide plant for the
                        recovery of the gold from the tailings. These shares will be offered at par
                        in the first instance to the existing shareholders at the rate of one new
                        share for every five shares held, payable as follows :—5s. per share on
                        application, 5s. per share on allotment, and the balance in calls not
                        exceeding 5s. per share allotment of not less than three months. The
                        directors hope that each- shareholder will avail himself of this opportunity
                        of increasing his holding in the company. </p>
                    <p>The proposal to increase the capital has been sanctioned by the Egyptian
                        Government. The light railway from the harbour of Imbarak to the mine, about
                        five and a-half miles in length, has been completed, and a locomotive
                        installed carriage of machinery and stores to the mine is much facilitated
                        thereby. The company owns a steamer, which brings machinery and goods from
                        Suez to Imbarak. By this means shipments from England are made expeditiously
                        and economically. To facilitate the landing of goods a* substantial jetty,
                        157 ft. long, has been constructed. A crane has been fixed thereon, and
                        goods are lifted out of the lighters direct into the railway trucks. At the
                        harbour the electrical power station is practically complete. Two 150-k.w.
                        generators have been installed, and power will be transmitter! Then mine to
                        drive the air compressor, hauling gear, and other plant The mill has been
                        erected at a convenient site close to the power station, and necessary
                        boilers to supply the steam required to drive the electrical machinery and
                        mill engine are completed. The air compressor has been designed to work ten
                        rock drills, with the object of opening up the reef with greater rapidity.
                        It is estimated that there are about 9,000 tons of ore already in reserve.'
                        For the purpose of considering the proposals an extraordinary general
                        meeting has been convened at the Cannon Street Hotel to-day. The “St James’s
                        Gazette” remarks :— We do not see any reason why the proprietors should rush
                        to take advantage of the ' occasion. The directors are of opinion that the
                        Beale of operations should be extended by an increase in the number of
                        stamps and the erection of a cyanide plant. But there seems no immediate
                        hurry for this, since there are only about 9,000 tons of ore in reserve, or
                        about enough to keep the present stamps going for nine months. </p>

                        noticed, however, that there w is a great difference in age between the hoy»

                        while those >of Minieh had amongst them some ot 20 and 24 years. One of the
