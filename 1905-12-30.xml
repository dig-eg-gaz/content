          <head>The Past Year</head>
          <p>It is ever the tendency of journalism to exaggerate and to attach an absurd importance
            to the ephemeral matters which come within its province. The overweening attribute of
            "speech-making" is applied to merely sensa- tional events, for the horizon of the
            comment- ator on daily occurrences must necessarily be limited in a great measure by
            having no stable basis for dealing with the patches of complicat- ed events which are
            brought day to day within hi ken, and the continuity of the world's development is
            obscured behind a mass of scare headlines. When therefore we have to review the salient
            points of the past year, it is very difficult to avoid unduly dwelling on what merely
            appears to loom large not because it is important but because it is recent, and through
            an excessive desire for picturesqueness, or sen- sationalism, as many would prefer to
            term it, to present a purely external view of the course of affairs. But we do not think
            there will be many among our readerswho will venture to deride us if we hazard the
            statement that the year, which ends to-morrow, will ever be reck- oned as one of the
            cardinal dates in modern history, and that 1905 will hold a permanent niche in Universal
            History as the starting point of events which will exert an incalculably important
            influence on the destinies of man- kind, for in the sequence of those world-histor- ical
            occurrences which link all nations together, and control their destinies, the historian
            of the future will assuredly give a place to that deci- sive naval battle which gave
            Japan a foremost position among the great Powers of the world, and will ever reckon
            1905, which saw the beginnings of the Russian revolution, as im- portant a date as the
            year which saw the meet- ings of the States-General and the storming of the
              <placeName>Bastille</placeName>. All the other events of the year sink into utter
            insignificance before such colossal facts, whence the beginnings of new eras in the
            history both of Europe and of Asia will be dated.</p>
          <p>It is true that the revolution may even at this hour be checked, but its advance will
            only be stayed temporarily. It must be remembered that there is probably no people which
            has such a strong historic consciousness as the Russians. There has been no great break
            in their deve- lopment, no new object of their common effort. They have not undergone
            the transformation from an agricultural to an industrial civiliza- tion, which puts much
            into the background, and fills men's minds with new problems. There has been to them no
            sudden extension of boundaries. In their vast plains they always knew the world was
            large, and that numbers of their brethren might be added to their family - brethren
            already like-minded with themselves. Their past history is a long record of struggles
            after union, which might make them strong against barbarous invaders, of untold
            sufferings endured with patient perse- verance, of monotonous surrounding and con- stant
            conflict with churlish nature, In all this there are but two things that helped them-
            their Church, which bound them together and gave them courage to endure; their national
            leaders, who trained them into strength, drove back their foes, and welded them into a
            mighty nation. Indeed, there were not two but one, for Church and State are indissolubly
            connect- ed. There was no ecclesiastical system with an independent head whose claims
            might divide their allegiance. They received their Christia- ity from
              <placeName>Byzantium</placeName>, not from <placeName>Rome</placeName>. Their ruler
            inherits the claims of no Holy Roman Emperor crowned by a Pope, but is the repre-
            sentative of the rulers born in the purple chamber of the Bosphorus, and has never has
            to divide his authority with a bishop whose sway extended beyond his realm.</p>
          <p>When this perople, so strong in their historic consciousness, determine to break with
            their past, we may be sure that the emancipation of the Slavs will be thorough. But the
            emancipa- tion of <placeName>Japan</placeName> from Europe may even be more far-reaching
            in its results than the Russian revo- lution, and the sudden apparition of an Asiatic
            state continuously triumphant over a European adversary is enough to give the boldest
            pause. It is for the men of this generation, nay, of the last two centuries, and
            unexampled pheno- menon. Not for more than a hundred years has any single Asiatic state
            taken the ini- tiative of making an attaach upon a European foe and achieved any success
            thereby. An unbroken series of campaigns waged by Europeans against Asiatics has led to
            the establishment of the fixed idea in the Euro- pean mind that Asia was the natural
            heritage of Europe, that the Asiatic was the natural prey of the European, and that
            whenever Asiatic and European met in battle, the Euro- pean inevitably and always came
            off victor, although the odds agasint him were ten or twenty to one. Numbers did not
            count in such contests. So it came to pass that, secure in the memory of innumerable
            victories in each of which this convenient working hypo- thesis was put to the test and
            verified by experiement of blood and fire, the European no more conceived of the
            possibility of a success- ful Asiatic revolt against his domination than the cowboys on
            the ranches conceive of the possibility of a revolt of the herds which they rule from
            the saddles of thie broncos. Now and then the European, like the cowboy, may get jammed
            in an ugly rush or unexpected stampede of his dumb-driven cattle. But it is only doe the
            moment, Europle always asserts herself and exacts terrible vengeance for her temporary
            discomfiture. So invariably has this been the rule that at this moment 70,000 armed
            white men suffice to garrison the whole of Asia south of the
              <placeName>Himalayas</placeName> from the Khyber in the west to the forest frontier of
              <placeName>Burmo-China</placeName>, a vast and caried region inhab- ited by more than
            300,000,000 of human beings. That gives over 4,000 Asiatics to each white soldier.
            Cattle on the Western ranches require a greater proportion of cowboys per 1,000 head. It
            is not necessary to conjure up dread imaginations as to another invasion of Europe. It
            is enough to realise that Asia is at present parcelled out among European Powers who
            exist solely by the prestige of a success achieved by use of European weapons and by the
            despair engendered in the hearts of Asiatics by their long-continued defeat. The
            victories of <placeName>Japan</placeName> will change all this. Even if
              <placeName>Japan</placeName> does not Japanise <placeName>China</placeName>, she will
            establish her position as paramount sea power in those Eastern waters. Suppose that she
            confines herself to the sea, it is obvious even to the meanest understanding that the
            whole political situation in Eastern waters, including <placeName>Australia</placeName>,
            will be revolutionised if she can maintain her present ascendancy. All islands will be
            held at her mercy- the <placeName>Philippines</placeName>, the <placeName>Netherlands'
              East Indies</placeName>, <placeName>New Zealand</placeName>, and
              <placeName>Australia</placeName>. The Japanese are 40,000,000 strong. Like the brave
            men of <placeName>Marseilles</placeName>, they know how to die. The story of their
            suicidal valous recalls the me- mories of the early days of Islam, and it is only
            rendered the more remarkable by the fact that their readiness to sacrifice their life
            does not appear to be sustained by any faith in the next. They have shown themselves to
            be quick to seize the advantaged offered by the weapons and the craft of the West. They
            have not studied in vain in the head- quarters staff of <placeName>Germany</placeName>
            or in the schools of the British navy. They are like other human beings, subject to the
            temptation of vanity, and they are not immune against the promptinfs of ambition. In the
            watchword, "Asia for the Asiatics," they have a weapon which may be used in a hundred
            centres at once, and which has already toused echoes beyond the
              <placeName>Himalayas</placeName>.</p>

          <head>LA DOGARESSA.</head>
          <head><persName>M. SINADINO</persName>'S FIRST OPERA.</head>
          <head>YESTERDAY’S DRESS REHEARSAL</head>
          <p>It was yesterday our privilege to attend the dress rehearsal of La Dogaressa, a 3-act
            opera composed by <persName>M. N. Sinadino</persName>, with the book by <persName>M. V.
              Sinano</persName>, both such promi- nent members of Alexandrian society as to need no
            farther introduction on our part. This being as we understand, the composer’s first
            opera, it was scarcely to be expected that the result would be epoch-making and, while
            the work shows no mean talent for compilation, there is certainly a falling away on the
            side of creative genius. We have here a produc- tion replete with all the " outward and
            visible signs ” of grand opera, its church scene with the inevitable bells, its
            triumphal march, its interspersion of ballet, and its tragic finale; but all these
            ingredients are such as require to be scored with sweeping power and vivid contrast, and
            we venture to think that <persName>M. Sinadino</persName> does not altogether meet these
            require- ments. He has given us a wealth of dainty music, full of delicate nuances and
            pleasing romances, but it is clear that he has yet to learn how to make full use of his
            orchestra and how, in the heavier movements, to stimu- late the senses and impart his
            message in crisp and penetrating outbursts. He leads up very well to the more involved
            passages but has evident difficulty in sustaining the " ensemble. " This feature is
            especially no- ticeable in the first act, which to some degree may be said to want life
            and firmness of pur- pose ; it elicits some fair opportunities, inclu- ding a quartet of
            marked merit, and introduces the meeting and subsequent mutual passion of tho Dogaressa
              (<persName>Signa. Bellincioni</persName>) and Stellio, the Pisan Ambassador to
              <placeName>Venice</placeName> (<persName>Sig. J. Palet</persName>).</p>
          <p><persName>M. Sinadino</persName> is strongly imbued with a Wagnerian tendency, and this
            influence is displayed particularly throughout Act II, which, while being unquestionably
            the best act of the opera, is far too redolent of Tann- hauser and Lohengrin to be set
            down as purely intuitive; the distant trumpets and the heralding of the Doge’s approach
            follow too closely the huntsmen’s horns (Act I, Sc. 2) and the clarions (Act III) in
            Tannhauser. Then the chorus of Venetians denouncing Stellio is very much on the lines of
            the climax of Act III of the same opera, even to the positions taken up by the
            performers. All this, however, in no way detracts from the many exceedingly good effects
            which <persName>M. Sinadino</persName> obtains in this second act. The curtain rises to
            a graceful minuet air, but with the appearance of the Dogaressa, who has a pretty solo,
            the music becomes more complex, with an undercurrent of strong motif. The entry of the
            Doge (<persName>Sig. Nicolay</persName>) is scored with much grandeur and expression and
            requires only to be original to be a true masterpiece. The scene, however, is much too
            protracted; the populace start to welcome their chiefs when he must be an unconscionable
            distance off. There follows then a sort of allegorical ballet, danced to a valse
            movement and savouring somewhat of Drury Lane. The act proceeds with the discovery of
            Stellio’s indiscretions and his consequent disgrace, and terminates with the flight of
            the Dogaressa after her lover.</p>
          <p>To Act III, there is a very beautiful over- ture, exquisitely rendered under
              <persName>Sig. Zuccani</persName>’s bâton. It is well orchestrated and proved one of
            the finest portions of the opera. The scene is now laid on the terrace of a Pallazzo by
            night and we find the Dogaressa awaiting Stellio, who arrives, rather tardily, and his
            retreat having eventually been discovered, he is stabbed by order of the Doge's men. To
            build a whole act on such meagre foundations must, not un- naturally, have taxed
              <persName>M. Sinadino</persName> to the utter- most and, although he makes good use of
            a very Wagnerian motif on the string instruments, there are several drags, which not all
              <persName>Signa. Bellineloni</persName>’s efforts, with the valuable aid of
              <persName>Sig. Palet</persName>, could eliminate. True, each of them have pleasing
            arias and the love duet rises to a high pitch of efficiency ; but on the whole (and this
            applies throughout the opera) the situations are too thin and few to justify the length
            of the action, and either big cuts or an elaboration of the plot are needed before the
            intrinsic value of the work is to be gauged. <persName>Signa Bellincioni</persName>,

              Pasquale</persName> were well cast for the respective roles of Bellarmo and Bianca,
            the confidante. The chorus have not ( very lengthy work but what there was of it was
            hard and proved rather too much for them. We have no fault to find with the ballet,
            whose dancing was as graceful as their appearance. The mise-en-scene was very good,
            though rather too ambitious for the interior of St. Mark's (Act I) and the full expanse
            of the Piazzetta (Act II) looks palpably unreal when set in miniature on the Zizinia
            stage.</p>
          <p>There was a large number of guests at the rehearsal, and to judge by the warm approval
            they expressed, we may safely forecast a big success for to-night’s premiere.</p>

          <head>HOW 'XMAS WAS SPENT.</head>
          <head>GREAT CHANGE IN CLIMATE.</head>
          <p>(From our Correspondent). <placeName>Port Said</placeName>, Thursday. Asked his opinion
            of <placeName>Port Said</placeName>, <persName>Mark Twain</persName> once remarked, "It
            is a good town—to be out of !" This appears to have been the opinion of many of the
            English residents during the celebration of ’Xmas. For those who did not leave the town
            for the gaieties of <placeName>Cairo</placeName>, there were the usual dinners, smoking
            concerts, dances, 'Xmas trees, and children’s parties.</p>
          <p>Services were held on 'Xmas morning at the various churches in the town. In the
            afternoon, the patients of the Lady Strangford Hospital were entertained by a conjuring
            performance and variety concert, at which many of the English residents were
            present.</p>
          <p>The football match, Mr. Chessman’s Eleven v. Maltese, ended in a draw, no goals being
            scored on either side.</p>
          <p>Following the spell of wet weather last week we have experienced what might be almost
            termed an English 'Xmas. <placeName>Suez</placeName> has had an even more unique
            experience in having snow on <placeName>Mount Attaka</placeName>. Old European residents
            in the Canal say that there has been a great change in the climate during the last
            twenty or thirty years. Passengers coming from <placeName>India</placeName> and
              <placeName>China</placeName> have been very much struck with the change in the
            temperature, and not a few have remarked that it is a foretaste of what they will find
            in England.</p>

          <p>Never before at this time of the year has <placeName>Luxor</placeName> been so fall of
            visitors.</p>
          <p>On Sunday, 24th inst., the English Church was well attended, and a most interesting
            sermon was preached by the Rev. Professor Sayce on 1 Cor. XIII. 9. "We know in part."
            There were forty communicants on Christmas Day at the two celebrations, and the preacher
            was the Rev. A. W. Gross, chaplain, and the offertory for the Luxor Hospital for Natives
            amounted to 11.13.10. Bishop Potter, of New York, celebrated on Dec. 27 (St. John’s
            Day). Over one hundred visitors sat down to the excellent fare provided at the
              <placeName>Luxor Hotel</placeName> on Christmas Day, and the "small dance" in the
            evening was well attended, and very enjoyable.</p>
          <p>The Sporting Club held its first Gymkhana of the season (in aid of the local charities)
            to-day, and 80 Europeans paid for admis- sion, while the natives from the town and
            neighbourhood came, as usual, in great force. The racing was excellent, and the
            committee are to be congratulated on the arrangements made for the amusement of guests
            and the benefit of several worthy objects. The local police, , under the superintendence
            of the mrowan, preserved the usual good order on the course and its approaches.</p>
          <p>The following was the programme:- 1 Bishareen Arab Race (Sack) 2 Native Water-Carriers’

          <p>The Sucreries case came up before the Chambre des Faillites of the Cairo Mixed Tri-
            bunal today. The Court was composed as follows; president, <persName>Judge
              Tuck</persName>; assessors, <persName>Judge Coghlan</persName>,
              <persName>Wierdels</persName>, <persName>Youssef Bey Aziz</persName>, and

            assessor and the Government was represented by <persName>Bairam Bey</persName>.</p>
          <p><persName>Maitre Carton de Wiart</persName> informed the Tri- bunal that the following
            proposal had been accepted by the shareholders of the Sucreries:—</p>
          <p>"All Creditors, except mortgaged and pri- vileged creditors, are to get 80 per cent. of
            their claims, payable in debentures, bearing 5 per cent interest from January. 1, 1910,
            and redeemable in 60 years at 25 per cent. premium. Up to January 1, 1910, the debenture
            holders are to receive a minimum of 2 per cent interest, guaranteed by sums deposited at
            the Banque de France.”</p>
          <p>Some discussion followed, the Court remark- ing that these proposals had not been
            formally put before it, and that the question of the railway, etc, had not bean
            touched.</p>
          <p><persName>Maitre Carton de Wiart</persName> applied for a special meeting of creditors
            to deal with these points, and after further discussion the hearing was postponed for a

          <p>This hotel gave its first small dance of the season on Thursday night, and despite all
            the disadvantages of cold and distance, many people braved the elements in order to be
            present. The Ghezireh Palace has a great re- putation for its dances and entertainments.
            Indeed, no better background oould be found for pretty frocks and uniforms than its gor-
            geous halls and salons. Many dinner parties had been arranged for Thursday, and covers
            for over a hundred and twenty people had been laid. <persName>Mr. Curphy</persName> was
            host to fourteen guests, including the <persName>Hon. F. Morgan</persName>, the
              <persName>Hon. and Mrs. C. James</persName>, <persName>Mr. and Mrs. Heller</persName>,

            guests arrived after dinner, and by ten o’clock dancing was in full swing to the strains
            of most seductive music.</p>
          <p><persName>Mrs. Rom</persName> was looking her best in white net, the skirt having a
            deep flounce of white satin, and a trimming in which silver tinsel played an important
            part. The foil net bodice terminated in a folded corselet and sash of white satin.
              <persName>Miss Begg</persName>, who always has the best of times, was wearing very
            pale pink with lace insertions run through with pink ribbon. <persName>Mrs.
              Rome</persName>, whose wedding made such a sensation in the autumn, was in an artistic
            frock of soft blue, with a touch of the same colour in her hair. <persName>Mrs.
              Bailey</persName> was in pink, with an old-world tucker in the corsage, and
              <persName>Mrs. Heller</persName> was wearing a most becoming empire gown of black
            chiffon with appliquées of shad- ed pink roses on this skirt, and pink ribbons threaded
            in the lace decollatage. <persName>Mrs. Winn</persName> was in white, with many
            rufflings of ribbon and much fine lace, and had a pink rose tucked in her hair.
              <persName>Mrs. C. James</persName> was in turquoise blue silk with a sash of shaded
            chené ribbon, with a twist of blue threaded through her coiffure. <persName>Mrs.

              Joseph</persName> brought <persName>Miss Joseph</persName> and her two girl friends,
            the latter both in white, while <persName>Miss Joseph</persName> was in pink crêpe-de-

          <p>A new steamer, the Devanha, has just been successfully launched from the yard of
            Messrs. Caird and Co., Greenock. She is one of four new twin screw vessels, each of
            8,000 tons gross, built for the P. and O. Company’s Bombay China mail and passenger
            services. Having regard to the fact that these ships almost continually employed in
            tropical waters the cabins, both first and second class, are placed all upon the upper
            or hurricane deck and are unusually spacious and well ventilated, all being what are
            known as “outside" cabins. The Delta, the first of these vessels, recently arrived at
            Bombay, and, although very rough weather was experienced on the voyage, she was found to
            be exceptionally steady.</p>

          <p>In the latest volume of the journal of the Anthropological Institute (vol. xxxv, part
            i) M. C. S. Myers continues his contributions to Egyptian anthropometry by an
            investigation the compantive anthropometry of the ancient and modern inhabitants, in
            which he arrives at a different conclusion from that announced by <persName>Miss C. D.
              Fawcett</persName> in Biometrika for 1902. He considers that there is no evidence that
            the prehistoric and modern population of Southern Upper Egypt differ in physical mea-
            surement, and that the homogeneity of the prehistoric, as determinable by standard de-
            viation, is the same as that of the modern population inhabiting like regions of the
            Nile valley. He finds that the relative correlation of cranial measurements in the
            prehistoric and modern papulation shows great irregularity and that much caution is
            needed in basing general conclusions as to the relative closeness of correlation on a
            few coefficients only.</p>

          <head>REVUE COMMERCIAL</head>
          <head>Coton</head>
          <p>Les changements dans la cote d'Amérique indiqués par la clôture de vendredi dernier
            ayant été insignifiants, la séance écourtée de la matinée de samedi, qui a été presque
            jour férié, n’a eu aucune importance et après les rares transactions traitées, on a
            affiché des cours absolument égaux à ceux de la veille.</p>
          <p>Le repos a duré juequ’à mercredi. Cé jour là quoique l^Amérique ne nous ait apporté que
            deux points de baisse, l’ouverture a été calme et la finale faible et en baisse de près
            de 1/8 de tallari en moyenne sur toutes les échéances de la vieille receite. Mais la
            véritable surprise pour notre marché a été celle que nous ont servi New York et New
            Orleans venues respec- tivement avec 22 et 35 points de baisse et qui nous ont fait
            reculer jusqu’a près de 15 1/8 pour le janvier. Toutefois, dans la soirée, la tenue a
            été quelqae peu meilleure et à la clôture on a remarqué que chacun partait avec un peu
            plus d'espoir pour la lendémain, espoir basé sur le pressentiment ou plutôt l'intérêt,
            mais qui s'est, heureusement pour les haussiers, quand même réalisé. Eu effet, la
            reprise d'une quinzaine annoncée ce matin par les marchés américains et qui a été un
            fait aussi inattendu que la baisse d’hier, a été nn véritable beaume pour notre
            corbeille et ce revirement de New Orléans a fait profiter nos prix d'une amélioration de
            1/8 de tallari.</p>
          <p>En résumé, la semaine a fini sur la cote de 15 11/32 pour le Janvier et de 15 23/32
            pour le Mars, ce qui représente en définitive, sur la clôture dp vendredi passé, une
            perte de 1/4 pour le premier mois et de 3/16 pour le dernier, tandis que dans le même
            laps de temps l'Amé- rique a reculé, d’après les cotes qui nous sont connues ce soir, de
            17 points environ.</p>
          <p>Le Novembre, par contre, s’estenn peu mieux comporté, car la perte pour cette échéance
            n'est que de 5/32 et ce fait est dû à l'élargissement du report sur les mois rapprochés
            et au désir que montre la spéculation de se jeter sur les dates éloignées, ce qui est
            toujours un signe de la faiblesse du détenteur des contrats.</p>
          <p>Quoique réduite à presque trois journées de travail en tout, la semaine que nous
            passons en revue n’en a pas moins été intéressante sous le rapport des fluctuations; il
            n’en est cependant pas moins vrai aussi que, comme activité, le marché a laissé et
            laisse encore beaucoup à dé- sirer : les continuels changements subits et rarement
            justifiés désorientent la spéculation de notre place et ont fini par la fatiguer et
            c'est tout aussi bien à cette circonstance qu'au man- que de contre-partie sérieuse,
            quand les haus- siers veulent réalises, qu’il faut attribuer l’hésitation qui se fait
            remarquer et qui rend ou fait parsitre notre marché comine icchabile à réagir par
            lui-même. II est certain que cette situation ne s'éternisera point, mais pour le moment,
            cela est incontestable, la tendance n'est guère favorable.</p>
          <p>Le mouvement de baisse qui avait commencé en Amérique et qui s'est arrêté, va probable-
            ment reprendre; dans tous les cas, il ne constitue pas un fait nouveau, car il y a long-
            temps déjà qu’on le prédisait ou prévoyait. Et quant aux causes qui l'ont engendré,
            elles consistent, au dire des dépêches qui depuis quelques jours nous viennent de New
            York et de Liverpool, en plusieurs faits qui ont leur importance et qui méritent d'être
            retenus, soit, notamment, arrivages dépassant toute attente, pronostics comme recettes
            pour les deux prochains mois supérieurs à toute idée qu’on s’en faisait, situation
            politique inquié- tante et desir intense du Sud de yendre. On a parlé en outre de la
            liquidation des positions des Outsiders de Wall Street, largement inté- ressés dans les
            cotons et que le resserrement d’argent sur la place de New-York oblige aujourd’hui à se
            débarrasser de leur marchan- dise, ainsi que de la réserve de Manchester qui, quoique
            engagé pour de longs mois encore et quoique soutenu, ne trouve pas moyen d'entamer de
            nouvelles affaires importantes.- On ne peut certes discuter ce qui est avancé sur la
            question de la récolte et qui peut être tout aussi vrai qu’entâché d'exagération, mais
            les deux derniers points sont à examiner: La position de Wall Street constitue au fond
            le point de départ, car c’est elle que l'on visait et rien ne nous dit que le jour où,
            par suite de la baisse, elle aura entière- ment disparu, nous ne verrons pas les chefs
            des clans baissiers actuels tourner casaque dans l’espoir de réussir un mouvement dans
            le sens opposé ; quant à l'abstention de la filature, ne serait-il pas logique de penser
            que ce qui lui fait défaut aujourd'hui, c'est-à-dire les nouvelles commandes, affluera
            chez elle quand la véritable consommation croira que la baisse a dit son dernier mot?
            Les situa- tions, tout naturallement, changent suivant les circonstances et surtout
            suivant les prix!</p>
          <p>Maintenant, comme résumé de l’opinion qui prévaut même parmi quelques-uns de ceux qui
            ont été les plus assidus à prêcher la baisse, on dit que si les cours sont
            inévitablement desti- nés a tomber encore, celane signifie pas que l'on doive désespérer
            de l'avenir, mais que ceux qui seront entrés dans l’article à un niveau modéré,
            comparativement aux prix que nous avons eus eu dernier lieu, auront pour eux toutes les
            chances de réus ite : la consommation actuelle est forte et, à tout prendre, elle
            continuera a l'être, can pou plus tard, il y aura sur le tapis la question de la laine,
            chère et n'offrant pas un approvisionnement sufficant, sinsi que le déficit, désormais
            constaté, des récoltes du Lin et de la Jute qui nécèssiteront des remplace- ments
            partiels en cotons.</p>
          <p>Le marche du disponsible est lolu d’avoir été brillant : il a non seulement souffert de
            l’inter- ruption des affaires es contrats, mais la de- mande en ellée-même du duhors et
            de la part de nos exportateurs a été leute et peut-être plus lente que ce n’est
            généralement le cas à l’épo- que des fêtes de fin d’année. Et pour ce qui est des prix
            qui avalent fléchi en sympathie avec les futurs, ils se sont relevés aujourd'hui et
            finissent à la même cote que vendredi dernier.</p>
          <p>Les exportations de la semsine ont constitué une petite: désillusion pour les
            intéressés à la hausse avec leur total de Balles 16,000 contre Balles 22,000 pour la
            même huitaine en 1904. On s’attendait à mieux, mais l’on espère main- tenant une
            compensation pour la semaine prochaine, qui est la première du mois, d’au- tant plus que
            pour l’année passée pour la même période il n’y a eu que 16,000 Balles.</p>
          <p>Le mouvement de b récolte, eu égard à son importance, continue dans des conditions nor-
            males, l'avance dans les recettes étant de Can- tars. 180,000 et dans les exportations
            de 150,000 Cantars. Quént au stock, il n’est que de 31,000 Cantars en moins. Comme
            retraits, le surplus des expéditions à cette date se partage en parts égales entre
            l’Amérique et l’Angleterre.</p>
          <p>Réduite à la portion congrue, la semaine n’a pas pu être trop favorable à Liverpool
            pour nos cotons ; aussi tout ce que l'on peut dire est que les ventes ont été
            insignifiantes, que le disponible est resté invariable et que les futurs se présentent
            en définitive avec cinq points de baisse.</p>
          <p>L'Américain n’a pas été mieux traité sous le rapport de l'aotivité, et pour ce qui est
            des prix les variations sont égales à peu près aux diflé- rences enregistrées en
            Amérique soit en tout 10 à 12 points de baisse.</p>
          <p>Graines de Coton</p>
          <p>La semaine a été favorable au disponible tant par suite de la demands, que de la
            meilleure tenue des contrats. Le fait est que les cours en ont profité et que ce matin
            ils ont fini à 58 1/2.</p>
          <p>Les exportations sont restées inférieures aux prévisions et cela à cause des iêtos et
            de quelques retards de la part de certains bateaux à charger, mais ce qui est différé
            n’est pas perdu.</p>
          <p>L’Angleterre semble toujours bien disposée pour nos graines et n’edt pas du tout récal-
            citrente à répondre à tout raffrrmissement de notre marché. Hull paierait aujourd'hui 5
            16/3.</p>

          <head>FIRST WINTER MEETING.</head>
          <p>Fine, clear weather and a warmer sun than had been felt for weeks past marked the first
            Winter Meeting of the H. S. C., and it was not surprising that the races were capitally
            attended, while the sport itself was very fair, though there were no peculiarly exciting
            finishes, and the Pari Mutuel did not pay wonderfully well for places, though the
            backers of Lakik (ex Rais) for a win in the third race were well rewarded. Among those
            present we noticed <persName>H. H. Prince Mohamed Ibrahim</persName>, <persName>Lieut. -
              Gen. Lance</persName>, C.B., <persName>Capt. Gillson</persName>, <persName>Mr.

          <p>The railway communications worked very well this time, contrary to certain experiences
            of last year, and but for a trifling delay on the return journey there was nothing what-
            ever to criticise in the railway arrangements. The Band of the 1st K. R. Rifles played
            selections during ths afternoon which were much appreciated. The following are particu-
            lars of the racing :</p>

          <p>There was not much in this race, <persName>Hussein Bey Sioufi</persName>'s Abou Nadara,

            only a moderate third.</p>

          <p>Atragak was a strong favorite, but some of the knowing ones backed Lahik and did well,
            for the chestnut got off ahead at once at a great pace and never losing his lead, though

          <p>Alarm led at the start but was soon chal- lenged by Aida, and after shaking off his
            opponent once had to take second place on coming into the straight. Aida won comfort-
            ably by quite 3 lengths, Jupiter just failing to come up with Alarm.</p>

          <p>The weather was uncommonly kind to all those who journeyed out to the Helouan race
            meeting yesterday, and a brilliant sun shone brightly all the afternoon, much to
            everybody’s satisfaction. A good number of Cairo people were present, and nearly all the
            ladies were in cloth tailor-made suits, though a certain num- ber took advantage of the
            sunshine and donned more summery attire. <persName>Captain and Mrs. Wilson</persName>
            were there receiving the congratulations of their many friends, <persName>Mrs.
              Wilson</persName> wearing a pretty pale blue frock and black hat with many roses
            tucked under the back of the brim. <persName>Mrs. Claude Lome</persName> looked well in
            a smart black and white check suit, the belted coat having a short barque and pale blue
            embroidered revers, and round her shoulders a beautiful sable boa. Sable was also worn
            by <persName>Mrs. Somers</persName> over a perfectly fitting frock of palest grey cloth.
            Her toque was of the same fur. <persName>Mrs. Winn</persName>, who is always a striking
            figure, was gowned in white cloth with a sable stole. Her small toque of vivid green
            with one white camilla was draped with an enormous flowing veil of green. <persName>Mrs.
              Stout</persName> was in a very neat coat and skirt of grey cloth with cuffs and revers
            of black velvet, and <persName>Mrs. Spong</persName> was in white with much brown tulle
            in her hat. <persName>Mrs. Nungovich</persName> was wearing black doth inlet with pale
            blue, which blue toned in with the superb engraved turquoise on her chain and in her hat
            of ermine. <persName>Miss Nungo- vich</persName> was much admired in her soft grey suit
            with a large white fox around her shoulders. <persName>Mrs. Herrling</persName>, who was
            with her, was in white with a pale blue chiffon hat.</p>

          <p>11, Kitchener Terrace, Tynemouth Road. <placeName>North Shields,
            England</placeName>.</p>
          <p>For the sake of other mothers, I must tell you how your Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
            have helped me.</p>
          <p>I have never been strong, and can trace my kidney trouble back to the days of my
            childhood: Even when a girl in my teens, I was.tired and drowsy all the day, and didn't
            get restful sleep at nights. As I grow in years, I seemed to get worse, being irregular,
            and having attacks of palpitation and nervousness. Between 16 and 17 years of age I
            couldn’t go up half a dozen stops without resting; if I attempted to, I fell down. About
            this age, too, I began to be troubled with sharp pains in the small of the back, and was
            sometimes taken with dizzy spells.</p>
          <p>Time after time I had medicine from the doctor, but it didn’t seem to help me at
            all.</p>
          <p>After my 21st birthday, I became more regular, and my health improved, although I still
            suffered now and then from backache, headaches, and dizziness, and the secretions werfe
            irregular in passing. I married when I was 24 years of age, and have had, in all, six
            children, the five born before I began with Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills being
            premature. The first lived only 11 months, the second and third are still living ; the
            fourth lived only 24 hours, and the fifth died within three weeks.</p>
          <p>It was about 12 months ago that I began taking Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, having
            heard them spoken highly of. The first box relieved me a good deal, and I bought some
            more which considerably eased my back and improved my appetite. By keeping on with the
            medicine, I grew better in every way. Shortly after this, I gave birth to my sixth child
            ; it is the only child not prematurely born, and is going on splendidly—better, in fact,
            than the other two who survived. It it just two months old now.</p>
          <p>Altogether I have used six boxes of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and they have done me
            more good than all the doctors’ medicine. I sleep better at nights, my appetite is im-
            proved, and I am a healthier woman now than I have been for many years.</p>
          <p>You are weloome to publish these facts, and I shall be glad if my experience proves
            helpful to other mothers.</p>

          <head>THE ABBASSIEH OASIS</head>
          <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
          <p>Sir,—The remarks of the Financial Adviser on speculation in land are of some interest,
            but it is strange that there is no allusion in this part of his Note to tbhe Abbassieh
            Desert affair. <persName>Sir Vincent Corbett</persName> states with a full sense of the
            responsibility attaching to his opinion that Egypt is not an El Dorado for investors.
            If, however, the Egyptian Government, advised by him, is prepared to offer any more land
            on similar terms to the Ahhassieh deal, there is still an El Dorado in this country,
            richer than the wildest dreams of a varice. The public still await an explanation of the
            Abbassieh Desert Oasis affair, and also some information as to the prices already being
            asked by the happy con- cessionnaires for plots of this land.—I am, etc.,</p>

          <head>THE INCIDENT OF DECEMBER 10.</head>
          <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
          <p>Sir,—I have read with much interest, in your columns, the opinions expressed by several
            correspondents at to the cause, effect, and importance, of the row which occurred in
              <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> on the 10th inst. According to some, it was a
            premeditated outbreak of some importance whereas others affect to regard it as little
            more than a Sunday afternoon’s amuse- ment ; others again fancy that it was due to
            turbulent foreigners, and others say that it was an expression of native discontent.</p>
          <p>Your most recent correspondent on the subject, who hails from <placeName>Port
              Said</placeName>, regards it with mixed feelings, for within the limits of the same
            column be admits that it might be a blessing in disguise, and then goes on to speak of
            it as the disaster which we have to deplore. This gives evidence of a lack of logic not
            often to be found in your paper; many of the opinions expressed in this letter are quite
            irrelevant to the subject, and show so little knowledge of <placeName>Egypt</placeName>,
            that I should recommend your correspondent in future to confine his observations to
              <placeName>Port Said</placeName>.</p>
          <p>However much opinions may vary about the incident of the 10th December, the fact still
            remains, that it was sufficient to justify the authorities in arresting several hundred
            people, and it has entailed no small amount of work and responsibility on the judges of
            the Native Tribunals, who appear to have acquit- ted themselves of their difficult task
            with laudable impartiality.</p>
          <p>While it is useless to deny that the incident was of some importance, it is equally
            pleasing to note, that although all sorts of rumours were current that there would be a
            renewal of the disturbance, all the European colonists here were able to go about their
            business or their pleasure much as though nothing had happened. Some of us know from sad
            experience that such is not the case in a neighbouring country when such incidents occur
            —why did we have this feeling of security? The answer to this question is clear : it is
            because the British flag flies on the <placeName>Kom el-Dik Fort</placeName>, and the
            White Ensign in the harbour of <placeName>Alex- andria</placeName>, and if the latter is
            not always there it is not far to seek.—I remain, etc.,</p>

          <head>SYSTEMIC CATARRH SO LITTLE UNDERSTOOD Claims Many Thousands. A Tregedian's Thanks to
            Pe-ru-na.</head>
          <p>Robert Downing, The Famous Tragedian.</p>
          <p>In speaking of Paruna, <persName>Robert Down- ing</persName>, ths famous tragedian,
            says: “You may notice that persons in poor health always find the heat most intol-
            erable; this I avoid by using Peruna. 1 know by the thermometer that the weather is hot,
            yet I have felt the heat less this summer than ever.</p>
          <p>"I find Peruna a preventative against all sudden summer ills that swoop upon one in
            changing climates and water. It is the finest traveling companion and safeguard against
            malarial influence.</p>
          <p>“The cooling action of Peruna on the mucous membrane makes it invaluable to actors and
            singers, as it does away with that tendency to sudden hoarseness so apt to overtake one
            on emerging from a hot dressing room to a draughty stage.</p>
          <p>“To sum it up Peruna has done me more good then any tonic I have ever
              taken,"—<persName>Robert Downing</persName>.</p>
          <p><persName>Dr. Hartman</persName> was the first physician in the <placeName>United
              States</placeName> to accurately de- scribe systemic catarrh. His remedy, Peruna, the
            only systemic catarrh rem- edy yet devised, is now known all over the civilized
            world.</p>

          <p>Bien que nous soyons un samedi, la cor- beille des valeurs a présenté une animation
            exceptionnelle,en prévision sans doute des deux jours de chômage qui vont suivre et de
            la brièveté de la séance de ce matin qui a olôturé à 11 heares et demie.</p>
          <p>L’activité a porté sur toute la ligne, mais principalement sur la National Bank,
            l'Agricole les Estates, la Salt &amp;Soda et la Nungovich.</p>
          <p>La hausse inauguree hier en Obligations Crédit Foncier s'accentue aujourd’hui de 325 à
            332. On a même fait à un moment donné 334.</p>
          <p>Un engouement semblable a eu lien pour la Banque d'Abyssinie qui a ouvert à 7 1/4 soit
            en hausse d'une demi-livre sur le prix de clôture d'hier. Vers la fin, cependant, le
            cours a fléchi à 7 1/16 vendeurs.</p>
          <p>La Nungovich gagne toujours du terrain. Elle s'avance de 11 1/2 à 11 9/16, avec de
            nombreuses transactions.</p>
          <p>De 9 5/16 l’Agricole remonte aussi à 9 3/8 et la Cassa dî Sconto de 213 1/2 à 215.</p>
          <p>Et les petites valeurs ne sont pas moins favorisées ; l'Investment reprend de 1 5/32 à

          <p>Les Estates, continuant leur mouvement ascensionnel, atteignent le cours de 1 9/16
            vendeurs.</p>
          <p>Eu revanche, les Markets fléchissent de 26 à 25/9, la Nile Cold Storage de 11/16 à 5,8
            et la Banque d'Athènes de 130 à 129 1/2.</p>

          <p>Caire 29 Décembre.</p>
          <p>Le taux d’escompte à Londres vient d'être de nouveau élevé à 4% ce qui doit, assuré-
            ment, être attribué aux besoins considérables d'argent qui se manifestent d'habitude
            dans les derniers jours de l’année. Le Consolidé anglais est renseigné invarié, de même
            que toutes les valeurs égyptiennes.</p>
          <p>A Paris égalemént, l’action Crédit Foncier est signalée stationnaire à 778. La Banque
            d'Athènes est en hausse de 2 francs à 126.</p>
          <p>Ici, le marché des valeurs a été, ce matin, tort animé et en- excellente tendance. Ces
            bon- nes dispositions font espérer que, les fêtes pas- sées, janvier donnera plus de
            satisfaction.</p>
          <p>Les transactions out été très nombreuses en National Bank et en Agricole; la première a
            clôturé en hausse d’un 1/4 de livre à 25 7/16 ; la seconde à 9 5/16. La Cassa di Sconto
            a gagné 6 francs à 214. L’action Crédit Foncier, en bonne demande, s’est inscrite à 781
            ; l’obliga- tion à lots 1886 a haussé de 6 francs à 325.</p>
          <p>L'Immobilière a avancé de 330 à 338. Le projet consistant à construirs la nouvelle
            Bour- se du Caire sur un des terrains de la Société n’est peut être pas stranger à ce
            mouvement.</p>
          <p>Dans le groupe des Hôtels, les Nungovich out ouvert à 11 3/8 pour clôturér à 11 1/2 sur
            de forts achats. Les Upper Egypt ont clôturé à 5 5/32. Les National Hotels se sont
            maintenus à leur prix précédent.</p>
          <p>Parmi les petites valeurs, les New Egyptian sont soutenues à 29.6 acheteurs. Les
            Estates, très mouvementés, ont clôturé à 1 17/32. Les Salt and Soda ont gagné 1 shelling
            à 21.3.</p>
          <p>Les Sucreries d'Egypte ont, elles mémes, haussé de 5 francs à 30.</p>
          <p>Alors qu’on s’attendait à une accentuation de la baisse sur le coton par suite dee
            nouvelles d’hier, les marchés d’Amérique nous transmet- tent, au contraire, des cours en
            hausse; le spot a gagné 5 points, le Janvier et le Mai 14 point respectivement.
            Liverpool est également plus ferme.</p>
          <p>Ici, ce matin, le Mars a ouvert à 15 3/4 pour clôturer au même prix.</p>

          <p>(From our Correspondent).</p>
          <p><placeName>London</placeName>, December 21</p>
          <p>Quem Jupiter vult perdere—whom Jove would destroy he first deprives of reason. The
            saying’s worn, but no other meets the case of C.B. With inconceivable candour and self-
            destructive obstinacy he outlined at the Albert Hall last night such a policy as the
            British Empire has never been asked to consi- der, save in nightmares. This Liberal
            programme is simplicity itself. Our arma- ments, the pledges of peace which the strong
            man armed can provide, the means which made possible the successful foreign policy of
              <persName>Lord Lansdowne</persName> (which C.B. finds so "pleasant" an outlook) and
            the many arbitra- tion treaties concluded by the Unionist Admi- nistration, are to be
            reduced. Free Trade is to take their place, and war is to be avoided, not by the
            knowledge that we can defend onr own interests, but by our power to buy off our ene-
            mies with enlarged opportunities for "dump- ing.” And. this is C.-B.’s answer to
              <persName>Mr. Balfour</persName> and <persName>Mr.Chamberlain</persName>:</p>
          <p>After this it need surprise no one to know that <persName>Lord Kitchener</persName> is
            directly threatened, that trade onions are to be granted immunity from the legal
            restrictions placed on the con- duct of ordinary mortals, that economies are to be
            effected hy the Gilbertian process of removing all checks upon municipal enterprise and
            extravagance, that farmers are to he benefited by imposing fresh burdens on land so
            overburdened as to be already unprofitable, that the ratepayer is to be mulcted for a
            sop to the educational Cerberus, that the publican is to be robbed in the sacred name of
            intemperate Temperance, and that local control of its own affairs is to lead
              <placeName>Ireland</placeName> by swift steps to that separatist haven which is Home
            Rule.</p>
          <p>With excellent judgment and good taste <persName>Lord Curzon</persName> has declined
            the invitation to stand for the City. It was conveyed to him in terms of the highest
            compliment, and was backed by the signatures of men whose names speak for themselves, as
            rrpresenting the finance and commerce of <placeName>London</placeName>. It was, indeed,
            a great temptation, but <persName>Lord Curzon</persName> has, as might have been
            expected of him, risen superior to it, and has set an example which lesser persons would
            do well to follow. Rather than that his action should be a source of embarrassment to
            political parties, or "accen- tuate differences" which it would be his "single aim to
            unite,” he forgoes a unique opportunity of returning to public life, under conditions so
            appreciative of his character as a man and a high official.</p>
          <p>I am not surprised that <persName>Lord Welby</persName>, when questioned on Tuesday as
            to the fall in County Council stocks, replied that "he could not give a satisfactory
            answer.” While Consols have fallen 1 3/4 percent in the last nine months, London County
            Council securities have dropped 4 1/4, and the explanation, while very far from
            "satisfactory," is even to the financial use phyte, sufficiently obvious. It was
            illustrated in a timely fashion by the proceedings of the Council itself yesterday
            afternoon. The sums voted at this single sitting included £139,000 for tramways,
            £110,000 for workman's dwellings, £111,000 for a school training college, and £10,000
            and £25,000 for other educational buildings—making, with odds and ends, a total
            disbursement of £700,000 for one afternoon. And this takes no account, of course, of the
            weekly £2,500 spent upon the steamboat procession. It is not surprising that the judi-
            cious investor should look shyly at the scrip of a municipality which is only happy when
            it is throwing money about.</p>
          <p>In an interesting report, just published by the Foreign Office, on the trade of
              <placeName>Switzerland</placeName>, some striking figures are given with regard to the
            travellers, commercial rather than globe- trotting, who visited the pleasure-garden of
            Europe during 1904. In the course of last year no fewer than 4,800 representatives of
            German houses obtained the requisite licences, whereas only 41 travellers from the
              <placeName>United Kingdom</placeName> made application for permits to solicit business
            in the various cantons. It is a notable fact, however, that although there were more
            than a hundred German travellers to our one in <placeName>Switzerland</placeName>, the
            totol imports from the Fatherland were only seven times the volume of British trade,
            which proves that our goods are in demand, despite our sad lack of enterprise.</p>
          <p>From the standpoint of the picturesque, it is excellent news that the roof of Chariot
            Cross Terminus is to be considerably lowered in height. That should render the hideous
            eyesore somewhat less obtrusive, and it may even be hoped that while reconstruction is
            in hand, the owners will take advantage of the opportunity to impart some architectural
            merits to the structure. But aesthetic improve- ment fades into insignificance,
            important though it be, compared with the revelation of public peril from the growing
            use of iron and steel, cast or wrought, in buildings. Such a wide variety of antagonists
            pronouncements from experts is appearing that no definite con- clusion can be drawn from
            their dogmas.</p>
          <p>The announcement that <persName>Mr. Beerbohm Tree</persName> will shortly take a
            touring company to <placeName>Ger- many</placeName> with a Shakespeare repertoire is one
            that wilL meet, of course, with an extremely cordial weloome from English residents in
            the Fatherland. But the significance of the visit goes further than this. It is, in a
            way, a return visit to that of the German Theatre in <placeName>London</placeName>, and
            an important item in the free interchange which is so valuable a stimulus of the world's
            art.</p>
          <p>It appears that the most terrible consequences of the Boer War have been overlooked.
            Many reputations were lost during the fighting. They were inconsiderable in comparison
            with the reputations that have taken flight since. The first were professional, and
            concerned only the national safely. The others are sartorial, and strike at the roots of
            the national beauty. In plain—awfully plain—language, the British officer who used to
            set the fashion in dress— where silk hats and frock coats were as near perfection as
            mortals could expect—returned from <placeName>South Africa</placeName> with a lowered
            sense of social demands and-his own personal respon- sibility. What <placeName>South
              Africa</placeName> began the develop- ment of the motor-car is completing. The
            “Outfitter” is almost in tears over the shame- ful carelessness now manifest in the beat
            circles. A Norfolk jacket and riding breeches, accom- panied by a cap and gaiters, are
            accepted “even on Sundays.” Carelessness in dress has become "firmly rooted” in the
            minds of the "gilded youth of this country," and if things go on as they are now going
            the "smartly groomed man will be as extinct as the dodo.” It is deplorable.</p>
          <p><persName>Mr. George Herring</persName>’s gift of £100,000 will enable the Salvation
            Army to work out an experiment in "farm colonies" which should prove of the highest
            importance. It is of much significance that the money is only a loan as far as the
            Salvation Army is concerned—being ultimately payable by instalments to the King’s
            Hospital Fund—for this implies that it is hoped to conduct the undertaking on com-
            mercial lines, and to replace the capital intact after setting the scheme in operation.
            If this programme can really be fulfilled, it will mark a great advance in practical
            sociology.</p>
          <p>We must adapt Macaulay's famous conun- drum and inquire to-day whether, as
            civilisation advances, fecundity declines. According to <persName>Drs.
              Newsholme</persName> and <persName>Stevenson</persName>, who discoursed on the subject
            of birth-rates to the Statistical Society on Tuesday, the augmentation of the race is
            slowing down nearly everywhere. Ireland is the only country in which the cradles are
            being kept more busy than formerly, while the rest of the world is applying the
            philosophy of "comfort” in a way that has a marked influence upon statistics. It is some
            consolation to know that, while the English birth-rate is 17 per cent lower than
            twenty-two years ago, that does not represent an extreme retrogression, for
              <placeName>Belgium</placeName> and <placeName>Saxony</placeName> have each got a
            decrease of 24 per cent. against them.</p>
          <p>It is interesting to note that the <placeName>Ireland</placeName> and Craven scholar
            for this year at <placeName>Oxford</placeName> is a Rhodes scholar. It is a proof of the
            soundness of <persName>Mr. Cecil Rhodes</persName>' scheme, and of the excel- lent
            material hitherto lying dormant in the outlying parts of the Empire Indeed, efforts are
            already being made in other Universities to give encouragement to colonials to graduate.
            That they will hold their own in the athletic world may be deduced from the fact that
            three of the Oxford fifteen in the Varsity match of this year were from <placeName>South
              Africa</placeName>. Indeed, from the extraordinary success of the New Zea- landers, it
            is probable that undergraduates will come from the colonies to teach; not to learn, in
            this respect.</p>
          <p>In common with all who are interested in the genuine progress of the motor-car, I
            rejoice at the decision of the International Association of Automobile Clubs that there
            shall be no Gordon Bennett race next year. Nor, I understand, in any future year. While
            the motor car was still merely a new toy for a few rich men, the existence of such a
            competition was at any rate comprehensible. Its continuance now would be pointless and
            inexcusable. It is universally realised that the motor-car has a serious future before
            it, and that its development lies on the lines of reliability rather than of speed. But
            the fixture is not merely to be dropped ; it is proposed to substitute for it a
            competition of a practical kind for touring cars. The inter- national element, so
            valuable for purposes of comparison and improvement, will thus be preserved, but now at
            last it will directed to its right and proper channel.</p>
          <p>There is a locus classicus of a reporter, hav- ing to transcribe his notes on a speech
            on education at great speed, writing “kids” throughout instead of "children." As is very
            commonly done, he had used the shorter term through his notes to save time. Exactly the
            same thing has happened in the last speech of <persName>Lord Durham</persName>'s. He
            describes his horror at finding himself reported as referring to <persName>Mr.
              Chamberlain</persName> throughout as “Joseph" and "Joey.” It was explained that the
            reporter had written "Joe," and a sub-editor added the “y.” A somewhat similar mistake
            has sometimes been made in mentioning the names of speak- ers. A reporter, ignorant of
            the names of those on the platform, often pats down some personal characteristic or
            feature, and inquires the name afterwards. A reporter recently forgot to make the
            inquiry, and the speaker figured as "Mr. Clubfoot."</p>

          <head>MOSLEM INSTABILITY.</head>
          <p>The following article on some characteristics of present-day Moslems appears in "Al
            Moayad." The author is <persName>Mohamed Effendi Kurdali</persName>, the popular and
            well-known Da- mascene writer and editor of "Al Moktabas," a review which has recently
            made its appear- ance in Cairo:-</p>
          <p>"Our society is in a state of dissolution and a condition of despair prevails among all
            classes, who give way to a belief in destiny. This lack of any strength of will and this
            want of confidence in the future are great mis- fortunes for the land. Had our great
            fore- fathers developed th' same characterisitcs as we have, they would have been as
            full of fear and as poor of spirit even as we are. But on the other hand they
            strengthened their charac- ters and enlightened their minds by learning, and trampled on
            all feelings of despair by their zeal and understanding. When any one of our leading men
            follows a fearless and upright line of policy he is accosted by his fellows with the
            question, Are you trying to make your nation live for a hundred years while we have
            enough to do to keep the race going for an- other ten years ? What a difference is there
            between this fatalistic point of view and the English outlook on life. The people of
            that race act to-day so that their deeds may bring forth fruit hundreds of years hence.
            Had you looked back on your history would you have thought it possible that the men of
            the Crusades, men of a united Christendom, who conquered <placeName>Jeru-
              salem</placeName> and held the coast of <placeName>Syria</placeName> and
              <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, would have been forced to withdraw from these lands? Who
            would have thought that the Moslems would have been strong enough to force them to go
            away from those countries, which they had ruled for two hundred years? The future should
            ever be considered by those who take though of the passing day. Had the Moslems in those
            bygone days given themselves over to despair and placed their hopes solely on divine
            succour,they would have lost their position and God alone knows what would have beoome
            of <placeName>Syria</placeName>, <placeName>Palestine</placeName>, and
              <placeName>Arabia</placeName>. <persName>Saleh-ed-Din el Ayoubi</persName> and his
            statesmen were not acting in accord- ance with the advice of scatter-brained council-
            lors when they gave up the policy of hope- lessness and by their zeal and foresight
            wrought those mighty deeds, the fame of which still re-echoes in the East. How can we
            compare the present with those days of old and still believe that heaven snd earth stand
            yet where they did aforetime? Now-a-days our motto is 'Everything by starts and nothing
            long.' The best and only line of policy for us, whether for the farmer in his farm or
            the great man in his palace, is to develop strength of will and firmness of purpose.
            Education and culture should be our aims, and indifference and hopelessnees should be
            ruthlessly uprooted from our sentiments, for to fail after a struggle is better for the
            develop- ment of character than to gain success without work."</p>
          <p>In reading this description of the defects of the Arab character we are reminded of the
            recently published and remarkable work of <persName>Mr. Phillips</persName> on the
            desert, with its subtle analysis of the Arab. The Arab is the eternal individualist, the
            antithesis of the citizen. He is terrible in his sudden explosions of nervous energy,
            terrible as the desert, he he cannot endure, and, like the desert, he can destroy but
            never build. His mind has brilliance and swiftness, but neither profun- dity nor
            coherence. Sometimes in bis paral- lels <persName>Mr. Phillips</persName> is farfetched
            and fantastic, but in the main his brilliant analysis carries oonviotion, when he traces
            throughout the history of Mohamedanism the desert spirit which stops short of all
            complete achieve- ment and endaring civilisation. It has the force of a destroying
            angel, but it goes as suddenly as it comes:-</p>
          <p>"Orthodox Mohamedanism, reeking as it does of the desert, energetic and militant, yet
            failing in just the qualities which give depth to thought and coherence to society, is,
            after all, the best clue to the Arab's character and history. It explains both his
            successes and his failures. It explains the fury of his attacks, the rapidity of his
            conquests, and his success in destroying and consuming all that is rotten, effete, and
            worn out in the world. It explains the lack of definite pur- pose in all his
            undertakings, and his failure to build up anything durable and solid of his own. It
            explains why in the twilight of the middle ages he was so prominent and terrible a
            figure, and why to-day he is back in the desert once more.</p>
          <p>This Arab strain in the Egyptian character probably explains the complete failure of
            all attempts to run native limited liability com- panies.</p>

          <p>Letter from Sir Rudolf von Slatin.</p>
          <p>Dear Mr. Ward,-Your delightful and most interesting book on the Sudan has reached me. I
            congratulate you heartily on the excellent manner in which the work is written and
            illustrated. All of us who havedone our little best to regenerate the country, after its
            terrible misfortunes, have received more than kind treatment at your hands... I don't
            suppose anyone realises more than I do the change that has come over the Sudan since my
            old and tyrannical master the Khalifa disappeared from the scene. Your description of
            the 'Peace and Progress' is, in fact, a sequel to my 'Fire and Sword in the Sudan.'</p>
          <p>With kindest regards, believe me, yours sincerely, Rudolf V. Slatin.</p>
