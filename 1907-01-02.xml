                        <p> NEW YEARS EVE AT SIIEFHEA RD S </p>
                        <p> It iB difficult to write with any accuraoy of the doing! of gay Cairo on
                            New Year’s Eve, and the impressions left on tho ’mind after the hall at
                            Shepheard’s was emptied of its revellers were of the moBt varied and
                            chaotic description. The evening had started sedately enough, a large
                            contingent of the brightest and best of Savoyards, a number of officers
                            in uniform, and many of the residents swelling the numbers already
                            assembled in the hall and ball-room. Inspiriting musio and a perfect 11
                            ior inspired people to "chase the Hying hours with glowing feet ; ” and
                            it was dose on midnight when the doors of the supper room were opened.
                            Hardly ha I the many merry parties taken their seats before the hour
                            sounded, and every one sprang again to their feet to join in sinking the
                            National Anthem Toasts naturally followed, and an indescribable medley
                            of voices and musio filled the air. The orohestra, which bad taken its
                            place near the door, w .s violently bailed into a more prominent
                            position where one of Cairo’s leading finanoiers oould yersonally
                            superintend its efforts; and as popular airs flowed from the nimble
                            fingors of the mnsioians so merry voioes were lifted in chorus till
                            nearly the root was lifted also. The strains of "Auld Lang Syne’’ again
                            oarried people to their feet and planted most cf them in orthodox
                            fashion standing on their chairs. Over the remain­ing hours of the
                            evening let us draw a kindly veil. Somebody must have had a heavy bill
                            to pay for broken glass, and if sore heads were rare next morning-the
                            credit most be given to the excellence of the ohampagne provided. The
                            dancing which continned after supper was of that violent order whioh
                            baffles descrip­tion—bat the luck on such occasions is pro­verbial, and
                            perhaps the season was its own exouse. </p>

                            owing to the derail­ment of a goode train between Sahali and Damaohour
                            stations, causing both lines to be blooked. Assistance was promptly
                            rendered from both sides of the aooident, the down line being cleared by
                            11.5. a.m., and traffio is being worked in both direotiona on the single
                            line until the other one is oleared. The derailment appears to have been
                            caused by the presence of a fallen ootton bale on the track. The driver
                            and fireman of th9 goods train were slightly injared. No other

                            sa'ini, who was reosntly expelled from Tangiers and from Tonis by the
                            Frenoh, and who had to depart from Malta in Ootciber by order of the
                            Governor, arrived at Alexandria on Monday, after journeying overland
                            hither from Benghazi by way of Jarabnb. This we'l-knowa political
                            intriguer, who is the president delegate of the central com­mittee of
                            the Islamic Union and was formerly a "ohargd de mission” in the servioe
                            of the Frenoh Foreign and Colonial Offices, has not, so he informs ns,
                            come to Egypt on any political mission, but simply as a travel­ler. As a
                            member of the sect of the Se- noussi he was enabled to travel through
                            Tripoli to Egypt with great faoility,.and he gives an interesting
                            aooonnt of ’La present state of the Senonssi and of Jarabnb. That town

                            excitement prevails there and throughout all Cyrenaioa, as the. news has
                            recently arrived from Kufra that the Mahdi is not dead. Four years ago
                            it was believed that the head of the Senouesi had died, and now it is
                            stated that he has merely been wandering about as a dervish all this
                            time and has now appeared to start a Jehad. </p>

                        <p> Mustapha Pa9ha Kamel writes as follows to the “Times" :— I was
                            surprised, as were all the Egyptians surprised, to read your
                            Correspondent’s mes­sage as well as the article yoo published in your
                            paper with referenoe to the "Egyptian Standard" instituted under the
                            auspices of a company wlrob appointed me as editor and manager. I am
                            perfectly aware that truth may, for political reasons, be sometimes
                            oonoealed, hut I never thought for one moment that jour­nalism, in the
                            high and honourable sense of the word, is liable to untruths or
                            falsehoods. It has always been my deoided oonviotion that true
                            journalists are above oombating their political antagonists by such
                            means as are oondemued by true honour and irreproaohable demeanour. It
                            iB, no doobt, astonishing to find English newspapers at one time
                            unanimous as to the magnitude of the status of the national party in
                            Egypt and the influence it exercises through­out the valley of the Nile
                            in regard to all kinds of movements of which it is deemed the author,
                            and at other times find suoh papers alleging that the party in question
                            is not in a position to institute a company with such a small capital as
                            £20,000. How oan “The Times" ignore, or attempt to ignore the fact that
                            I kept aloof from his Highness the Khedive ever sinoe October 25, 1904 ?
                            Suoh separation was then published in "A1 Lewa" newspaper and
                            subsequently quoted by several other papers. I am in a position to state
                            openly that ever since my deolaring my separation I never met, nor did I
                            ever intend to meet'hie Highness. Sach a policy was inten­tionally
                            pursued by me, because I wished to follow aa independent course of
                            conduct not conneoted in any way with offioial oiroles. Snoh a polioy,
                            aa you would no doubt agree with me, would leave no doubt as to the
                            honesty of my intentions and would permit no one to Buspeot my position.
                            It is, moreover, to be born in mind that snoh a step as I have taken in
                            connexion with my relationship with bis High­ness would prevent my being
                            the oause of any political trouble arising between him and his Britannic
                            Majesty’s Government. “The Times” would be much mistaken in imagining
                            that I intend to instigate trouble or dietnrbanoe in Egypt, my true
                            intention being to direct all my endeavonrB towards scouring for Egypt a
                            oonstitational Government, true liberty, and the evaouation of British
                            troopp, as waB promised by the late Qieen, Lord Salisbury, Mr.
                            Gladstone, and several other eminent English diplomatists. The English
                            nation bears a great deal of what Lord Cromer writes or says abont
                            Egyptian affairs. This is only the English side of the question, bnt ont
                            of justice the English nation should a ho know the Egyptian side as
                            well. I venture to state that Egyptian opinions, aspira­tions, and
                            sentiments are very little known in England. The objeotof the
                            “EgyptianStandard" is to supply this want by imparting first-hand
                            knowledge in all matters relating to Egypt and its varied affxirs. This,
                            in my opinion, would be most valuable, as it would help enormously to
                            prevent all misunderstandings between the two nations. The Pasha then
                            gives the list of the foun­ders of ’he “Standard." </p>

                            <p> Sir,—While heartily opposed to a polioy of oonoealment of
                                disagreeable political faots, I have always been anxious to
                                depreoate scares, more espeoially when oreated by misinformed
                                correspondents of European and American news­papers. A Cairo
                                contemporary recently gave publioity to oertain amazing statements
                                made by the correspondent of an American joarnal. My only wonder is
                                that anyone oan take such exaggerations seriously. SoaremongeriDg,
                                however, is not the only error of which the Egyptian ooyrespondents
                                of important jonrnalB are occasionally guilty, and I must confess
                                that it was with genuine sur­prise that I read your recent exosrpt
                                from the ' Daily Telegraph." That Mr. Dioey, of all men, the
                                historian of the Khediviate, the contributor to Heaven knows how
                                many journals and magazines, should make error* oomparable to those

                                eyes when 1 read yonr excerpt and the original letter in the "Daily
                                Telegraph.” Have 1 yonr per­mission to point out a few of the
                                mistakes it contains ? First comes the reproduotion of a rnmour
                                anent Mr. Mitohell Innee, a rumour obviously started by some
                                farceur—too obvious­ly impossible for the belief even of the
                                Egyp­tian public. I grant that it is given as a rumoor, but there
                                are rumours and rnmonrp, e.g., the story published in an Italian
                                contem­porary a conple of years ago of aoonple of young girls
                                reported to have been devonred by oro- oodiles a few miles S. of
                                Roda Island, or the rnmonr which 1 am quite ready to start that M.

                                those posts. Again, we have Saad Pasha Zaghloul described as an ex
                                president of the committee for the creation of a National University
                                which was started by Mnstapha Kamel Pasha ! The Minister of
                                Eduoation is therefore one ot the Nationalist leader’s followers 1
                                Wonderful I So wondertal that one wonld be inolined to imagine—if
                                another than Mr. Dicey had written the article commented on—that the
                                correspondent had been supplied with in­formation by one of Saad
                                Pasha’s most vigo­rous critics. As it is, the correspondent of the
                                "Daily Telegraph" has obviously confounded Mustapha Pasha Kamel,
                                editor of "A1 Lewa,” Tribune of the people, and what not in the way
                                of self-oonferred titles, with the originator cf the University
                                soheme, Mustapha Kamel Pasha El Gamrawi, a notable of the Province
                                of Ghirgoh. Theu we have Yaooub Artin Pasha desiring to resign
                                beoause an English official, young enongh to be his son and unversed
                                in ednoa- tional matters, is promoted over hie head. Well, only Mr.
                                Dnnlop oan here be referred to, and Mr. Dunlop has been twenty years
                                in Egypt engaged from start to finish in educa­tional work, it ie
                                taking rather an extreme view, is it not, to suggest that Mr. Dnnlop
                                has had no experience after all that time? As for Saad Pasha in the
                                gnise of a follower ot Mustapha Kamel Pasha, the idea is too absurd
                                for anything. Where oan the correspondent of the “Daily Telegraph"

                            <p> To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazettb. </p>
                            <p> Sir,—I came to Egypt in October and have lived in some of the best
                                hotels in Upper and Lower Egypt. Their great reputation is well
                                deserved ; bnt before leaving the country I wish to protest against
                                the nnpunotuality in aetving the principal meals. In no instance did
                                I ever find any negleot in the bedroom attend­ance. Tha ohoioe of
                                the menu and the oooking were generally excellent ; but 1 cannot
                                reca'l a case in which lanoheon or dinner was served at the hour
                                stated, or carried on with reason­able Bpeed. If the first oonrse
                                was banded round soon after a goest wsa seated he bad simply to wait
                                all the longer for the second. If the system of serving a gues’ q
                                iiokly with the menu for tha day between certain hours, as in London
                                hotels, cannot be followed in Egypt, one might at least expeot that
                                if he sits down at the hours announced he should not require to
                                await the arrival of late comers. Of oonrse 1 know that the blame is
                                laid upon the guests ; but finding that there is no advantage in
                                taking their seats at table they naturally prefer to lounge in the
                                ball until ^ooh time as experience has taught them they may expeot
                                to be served promptly throughout the meal. They will be able to
                                finish along with those who sat down in time. This should not be ;
                                and late comers should either have to oontent themselves with the
                                portion of the meal coming on after they have taken their Beats or
                                be served after table d’hAte was over at an extra oharge. This
                                oonrse wonld meet the wishes of nineteen out of twenty of the
                                visitors. Indeed many complained strongly in my hear­ing of the
                                present system,or want of system; and all have agreed that they
                                wonld mnob prefer to lose pnrt of a meal than to be under the
                                neoessity of sitting so long over it as at prepent. Thero is no
                                doubt that if the management wonld exeroine a little firmness the
                                gaests would soon adapt themselves to the altered circumstances,
                                much to the inoreaseof comfort of all oonoerned, both visitor and
                                staff. Your obedient servant, A 8UFFERBB. Cairo, Deoember 81. </p>

                            oomes of a distinguished old Greek family of Athens. He lately married
                            Athena Phasali, niece of M. Merkurios, Mayor of Athens. He is very
                            popu­lar at the Ethiopian Conrt, and he has several Abyssinian
                            deoorations. Mr. Davies, the newly appointed chief- engineer to the
                            Alexandria Municipality, is expected to arrive here to-morrow. In
                            another oilumn we announce the retire­ment of the managing director of
                            the Alex­andria Water Co., Mr. Cornith, C. M. G. The year 1841 saw the
                            birth of the King, Lord Cromer, and Mi. Cornish, who came to Egypt first
                            in the employment of the well-known engineering firm of Eiston Anderson
                            &amp; Co., at that time (the early seventies) mach oc­cupied in potting
                            up maohinery oonneoted with Ismail Pasha’s sugar faotories in Upper
                            Egypt. The same firm had to do with the water works at Beyront in Syria
                            and also with those in Alexandria. After some yoars in the npper
                            country, Mr. Cornish was trans­ferred by the firm to Beyrout in oharge
                            of the water works of that tow^. About 1879 he was appointed manager of
                            the water norka at Alexandria, and although the company has changed
                            hands sinoe then, Mr. Cornish always continued to fill this post, the
                            value of hia servioes having always been fully recognised. During the
                            troublous summer ot 1882 Mr. Cornish's devotion to duty, as well as hia
                            most olever and able arrangments for the defenoe of the W3ter supply of
                            Alexandria, have always elicited the warmest acknowledgment from hie
                            follow oitizens, and, at the time, won for him the honour of a C.M.G.
                            from the British Government. After the maasaore of June 11 Mr.-Cornish
                            despatched his wife and family to Syria, and then, fearing that in the
                            utterly lawless Btate of everything, an attack might be made on the
                            water works, he proceeded to put into effeot a plan of defenoe. Hia
                            first step was to weed out and get rid of all employes on whom he couid
                            not depend—and then he set to work. The defences were arranged by means
                            of hot water and steam pipes, so that, on any attack beiLg made on the
                            building, the defenders conld work those jets and streams of boiling
                            water and steam on their assailants in a manner that wonld ensure
                            preoipitate retreat. After a few days Mr. Cornish beoame suspicious of
                            one of his men, a Maltese, and a very capable workman. The man was
                            despatch­ed on some errand, and daring his absence Mr. Cornish
                            discovered hidden in hie tool-box a min a to and oarefally drawn plan of
                            the bnilding with all its defences I On hia return, the man was met at
                            the gate by the foreman, who paid him his wages, handed him hia
                            tool­box, minos the plans, aioompanied with a few words better imag-ned
                            than expressed ! Next day, during the temporary absence of Mr. Cornish
                            at an out-lying station, the water works reoeived a visit from Arabi
                            Pasha himself, who demanded to be shown over the whole works, and
                            good—naturedly enough, obliged the foreman to take him up to the room in
                            which the deadly hot-water appa­ratus was arranged. Arabi wanted to be
                            shown how the different things worked, but was put off by some exoase by
                            the foreman—happily, perhaps, for his own skiu ! After this, Mr. Cornish
                            kept the big ga'ea closely shut, and forbade any one bring ad­mitted
                            daring his absence, or without hie permission. Probab'y the alarming
                            aooounts of the preparations made to repulse any attack spread amongst
                            the Arab?, for anyhow the water works esoaped unsoathtd amongst the
                            general destruction that ensued after July II, 1882 ; but that the water
                            supply was preserved to the people and oity of Alexandria daring all
                            that terrible summer, was dae solely to the ability, energy, and
                            dpvotion of Mr. Cornish, who so bravely stuck to his post throughout the
                            whole time. Mr. Cornish’s career throughout all those years in
                            Alexandria hae been marked by uprightness, ability, and hard work ;
                            whilst his genial, gentle, and absolutely unassuming oharaoter, combined
                            with a most kind and friendly manner, have won for him the regard and
                            friendship of all olassea of hie fellow-citizens. </p>

                        achievements have a very pro rninent place in any sooiai history of the
                        Victorian Era. In the year of Queen Victoria's aocession, MissBurdett,
                        “theyoungestdanghter of a youngest daughter,” inherited the great fortune—a
                        fortune almost unprecedented at that day—of her maternal grandfather, Mr
                        Thomas Contts, under the will of his second wife, who after the death of her
                        husband had married the Duke of St. Albans. Tbriughout the reign of Queen
                        Victoria her life is a story of philanthropy aod charitable work, op a scale
                        such as it has very rarely fallen within the means of any private citizen to
                        attempt There have been few more notable women in oar time than she who
                        shared the fame of Queen Victoria in 1837 ‘What will they do with it 1”
                        people were asking in that year of two young women—Priuoesi Vototiq who was

                        inherited thirteen tons of English sovereigns. How well the Pnooess Viotoria
                        discharged her heritage all the world knows, and the fame of the .Barouess
                        is scarcely les w .rld-wide. There is hardly a oorner of the Empire in wh:ch
                        she had not oarried her open purse, and where she had not built cathedrals
                        or sent ont emi grants, her work had not been less effective because it had
                        not been advertised to the worl I. She was one of the first Imperialists,
                        and long before it Was fashionable to take an interest in the Empire the
                        Baroness Bardett-Coutts helped to build tip oar Colonies and make the
                        Colonists feel at home. She was a generous friend of General G irdon. and it
                        was through her enterprise that Gordon received his last batch of letters
                        from home The Baroness engaged a Morocco trader to deliver them in disguise,
                        and he reached Khartoum safely. Indireet'y, therefore, the Baroness may be
                        said to have been the last friend in England to oommanicate with Gordon She
                        was oertainly one of the last friends to see him in England. Before going to

                        letter-case lying on the table, and, little guessing that it would be the
                        last request he would ever make to her, the Baroness allowed him to take it
                        away. “I have received the most indisputable proof,” she said, "that Gordoa
                        carried ttyis simple gift in his breast-poeket to the day of his death/' In
                        his own sphere Mr. Burdett-Coutts has achieved a fame not so far-reaohing,
                        bat pot less well earned than that of his wife There is a pretty story
                        whioh, if it ware true, would make the marriage qnite rowaptio -and ro
                        .nantic indeed it was. But it is not trne, as wo have been told so often,
                        that when many years ago the Baroness invited the boys of a school fo lanoh
                        with her only one oalled, and that boy was to be her husband. It is a pretty
                        fiction. Nor is it trne that Mr. Bardett Coatts had a situation in Contts’
                        Bank, or that he was ever in any sense the Baroness’s secretary. As Mr.
                        William A-ihmead-Bartlett he had long been the friend ot the Baroness before
                        they became partners in life, and his visit to Tnrkey daring the war, when
                        the Barone-s raised £30,000 in a few days for the distressed peasants, was a
                        purely voluntary and frier d'y undertaking, and not, as it has been repre
                        seated, io the oapaoity of an ''almoner.” So, too, was his toar in the West
                        of Ireland, when the Baroness did so muoh to relievo the suffering through
                        the famine. Few women refused more proposals of marriage in their youth than
                        the late Baroness. “Miss Coatts likes me,” Lord Hoaghtou once said, “because
                        I never proposed to her. Aim *t all the young meu of good family did ; those
                        who did their duty by their family always did. Miss Browne (Miss Coutta’s
                        companion) used to see it ooming, and took herself out of the way for ten
                        minntes, but sbe only went into the next room, and left the door open, and
                        then the proposal to >k place and immediately it was done Miss Contts
                        oonghed, and Miss Brown came in again.” There is a good story of the Duke of
                        Wellington which oomes to mind. It was rnmourei soon after Mss Bardett hail
                        oome into her inheritance that the Duke of Wellington was to make her his
                        bride, Bnd an old friend asked the Dnke if the rnmonr hid any foundation. “I
                        said she deserved to ba a Duchess, not that I wonld make her one,” the Dnke
                        replied; and when the story was repeated to MLs Coatts Bbe remarked, ‘I
                        think the Duke should have said ’could,’ not ’woald.’ ” As is natural with
                        advancing years, she had of late led a retired life ; hat the house in
                        Stratton-street was as hospitable as ever,and its hostess was always glad to
                        welcome her more intimate friends at the informal luncheons for ‘Which she
                        was famoas. There was nothing either of the recluse cr invalid about her,
                        and her interest in pnblic affairs was as keen as it ever had been. Her
                        leisure was fully oooupied in attending to her private charity, the extent
                        and usefulness of which will never be known, because she was the last to
                        allow them to be made public. ' Great as have been the intiinsio benefitp,”
                        the late Duohes of Teok onoe wrote, “that the Baroness has conferred on
                        others, the most signal of all has been the power of example—-an

                        Lieutenant P.B. Joyce, 1st Battalion Connaught Rangers, Mfl Hi agar. Mr.
                        Jayoe is a smart young subaltern of six and a-half years’, experience, and
                        he has had the farther advantage of haviBg seen service in Sonth Africa. He
                        received bis commission in the Rangers in Apiil, 1900, from the Militia, and
                        joined the 1st Battalion in the field the following July, sharing in the

                        Cameron Highlanders, on oeaHog to be employed with the Egyptian Army, has
                        been posted to a company in the 1st Battalion at Dublin. On the 3rd January,
                        Lord Manner , D.S.O., King’s Royal Rifle Corps, will complete his three

                        the Egyptian Government, io connection with the State RAILWAYS, has been
                        placed on the reserve list. The seutenee of five years' penal servitude
                        paused by a naval oonrt martial on James Abbott, seoond yeoman of signals on
                        II.M.S. Amphitrite, for the theft of a boat’s signal book, will no doubt
                        have a salutary effect on any erring official who^pay have a leaning in that
                        particular direction. The actual crime itself was au aimless one, aud
                        apparently without motive, butau example was necessary, for saoh an i ffeoce
                        in time of war might be attended by the gravest oonseqaeuoes. Before leaving
                        the Mediterranean, Rear Admiral Prinoa Louis of Bajttenberg reoeived the
                        oongratulatious of Lord Charles Beresford on the magmfijent performance of
                        his flagship, the Drake, at gunnery, whereby she stands a' the tQp ff( the

                        meeting of the Khédivial Geogra ph Oftl Sooie‘y in Ca'ro on 25th March,
                        1903. Tue w irk now before jus oontains valuable contributions in the form
                        of appendice* by other authorities, each eminent in his own sphere. Sir John
                        BBiut, director general of the Meteorological Dept, of tho Indian
                        Government, writes on the Meteorology of Mesopotamia. He nukes a statement
                        of vital importance in writing : “It is my impression that there has been
                        practioally no obaDge in the meteo-ologioal oondition of Mesopotamia.” Such
                        an opinion is wvrrantably tenable by examination of the tables of rainfall,
                        tern- perature?, etc., and Mr. Foaden, of the Khédivial Agrionltaral
                        Sooiety, writes : ‘‘A brief examination of the climatic conditions of
                        Mesopotamia leads one to the conclusion that with a kind soil and an
                        efficient system of irrigation, pnotioally all those crops which llmrish
                        under a subtropical son might be successfully grown,” Land has largely gone
                        oot of cultivation, reverting iD certain districts to swamp or salt tracts,
                        bat granted drainage ard irrigation the country would easily and rapidly be
                        reinstated to its former oondition of noted fertility. It is the weary story
                        of neglect of the msgniSoent irrigation works of antiquity, regulators and
                        canals on a scale unknown in ancient Egypt, «bioh depended on a basin system
                        far inferior to the system of perennial irrigation beg; nas late as ‘he time

                        still be saved, though much is irretrievably mined. The Nile is four times
                        the s’sn of the Euphrates and twice the size of the Tigris. Those two
                        rivers, snow fed from the Armenian mountains, approach each other to within
                        a distance of 30 miles at Bagdad, follow a Deltaio oourse of aboot.500
                        miles, till they unite at Kama, from which point they continue nnder the
                        Dame of the River Basra, till in another 100 miles of oourse the Persian
                        fruit is reached. The Deltaic area rf the two rivers is 6,ijOQ,OQO hectare®,
                        oonsj: derably qaore tfian t>vice the cultivated or cultivable area of
                        Egypt. This enormous ooun- try is divided by Sir W- Wdicocks into 15
                        proposed Motions, seven on eaoh river and one on the Basra. The figures
                        given for one ot those «dotions, B^gdad-Setenola, are very interesting. The
                        aiea to be irrigated is 267,000 heotares ; estimated oo6t, including
                        interest oharges, £1,000.000, and estimated return on this capital 19 % per
                        annum. The estimates appear reasonable : £2,000,00 for main works and
                        barrages, £1,500,000 for minor oanals and agricultural development, and
                        £600,000 for interest charges. Egypt has a population of about two souls to
                        tfie aore, and fienoe the enormous valae of its agricultural land, bat lack
                        ;of population must form a weak point in deaTing wifh Mesopotamia. The
                        vilayet of Bagdad h^a estimated population of «50,00 U. The tovfn pf Bagdad
                        oRims 100,000 inhabitants. The other principal towuc on the Tigris vary from
                        a fçw hundred inhabitant to Rj.OOO for ^mara. Ou tfie Euphrates the towns
                        are net much better, varying fiom l.OfUinbabi tants to 30,000 for Sliera.
                        Land values must inevitably be restricted by limited population, aud cost of
                        extensive worfcs mnob enhanced by lack of bands. A detailed plan of the
                        Bagdad Sefeucla seo tion is giver, and what strikes one is that the proposed
                        main OAnals aud drains run at right angles to the rivers Iu Egypt, where the
                        slope of the ecu.itry is from santh to north, the main oanals and drains run
                        parallel to the Nile. The slope of Mesopotamia is stated to be the same as
                        Egypt—1/13,000. Every advantage has to be taken of that slope, and channels
                        running at right angles to it mnst be deepened to the tail eüd to produce
                        the necessary fi .-w. There may be unstated reasons f r the proposed
                        alignment. Deeply interesting as theremsk'ng of an ancient oountry must be,
                        one is forced to consider what chance th re is of the Turkish Government
                        ever allowing the work to be undertaken. That Government has displayed
                        unwonted energy in pushing on the railway to Mecoa. They are doing something
                        with the Hindia Barrage on the Euphrates, but in developing the oanal they
                        have lost the rivet. One would fain see a comprehensive scheme carried oot
                        actively by snob a master of his profession as Sir Wm. Willcocks, llj^the

                        <p> Voici les faits : </p>
                        <p> Un entrepreneur de Damiatte avait envoyé, il y a quelque temps, à la
                            National Bank, au Caire, one lettre assurée contenant 10 bank- notes de
                            10 livres égyptiennes, soit une somme de 100 LH. Le soas-ohef oomptablfl
                            le la Na tional Bank, M. Hioks, ouvrit le pli en qoer- tion, et y
                            trouva, en guise de bank-notes dix feuillet» de papier blanc. </p>
                        <p> La Banque réclama la somme k l’expéditeur et k l’Administration des
                            Postes. On fit des enquêtes, mais on ne put retrouver les bank- notes
                            disparues. L’entrepreneur avait assigné la National Bank et
                            l’Administration des Postes égyptiennes en paiement dudit montant.
                            D’après lui, la responsabilité de la Banque ne saurait être mise en
                            doute. Ou a négligé de vérifier l’enveloppe avant de la décacheter, et
                            cependant oette enveloppe portait des traoes d’effraotion, qui furent
                            constatées au cours de l’enquête. Si la National Bank avait fait cette
                            vérification, elle eut, elle aussi, constaté l’effraction, et alors elle
                            ne devait ouvrir le pli qu’en présenoe de l’employé des postes préposé à
                            la distribution des plis assurés. La National Bank répond qu’elle
                            n’avait pas k s’occuper de tout oela; une lettre éta:t arrivée, le
                            sous-oomptable l’ouvrit et ayant oonstaté l’absence de tous billets il
                            fit iœmé diatement la réclamation à la poste, laquelle s’empressa
                            d'ouvrir une enquête. Il y eut, au contraire, ajoute t i',
                            fautefj^expéditeur pour n’avoir pas expédié sa lottw^nians des
                            conditions de séourité plus grandes et n’avoir pai mis lea billets de
                            banque dans nne double enveloppe intérieure. Sa faute est enoore plus
                            grande de n’avoir pas indiqué dans sa lettre ou tout au moins oonservé
                            cüez lui les numéros des billets. L’Administration des Postes, k son
                            tou.-, ne voit pas pourquoi sa qualité d’intermédiaire l’engagerait k
                            nnerespoDsabilitéqueloor.que.ELle a reçu une lettre assurée qui fut
                            régulièrement livrée au destinataire moyennant déobarge. La Poste ignore
                            le contenu des lettres, même assurées, et il aurait fallu que la
                            National Bank fassn la constatation au moment de la ré oeption. Qui, des
                            trois plaideurs, paiera les 100 LE î c’est oe que nous saurons jeudi

                            généraux indus ; cette somme est de droit destinée k l’amortissement.
                            L’exeroico ne permet pas de distribuer on dividende ; l’Ibrahimieh
                            Ploughing va faire appel k la garantie que la Société des Sucreries loi

                            de nommer des arbitres. La faillite des Sucreries a amené celles-ci à

                            la Deira Sanieh. L’ Ibrahimieh Ploughing y perd une partie des faoilités

                            moment, M. G.iilhaumon exposa que, d’après loi, il n’était pas opportun

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                    <head>SWITZERLAND.</head>
                    <p>Switzerland, the heart of Europe, has been described as "A cluster of
                        delights and grandeurs."</p>
                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M. de Caprino.and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO, may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town, situated at the top of lake Maggiore has a mild climate and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, “Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and ‘Tho Flight into Egypt,” by Bramantion.</p>
                    <p>LUCERNE—A striking picture on the Lake of Lucerne facing the Rigi and Pilatus
                        and the snow-clad Alps.</p>
                    <p>In and around the town the walks are charming, and the excursions to be made
                        from Lucerne by boat, rail, etc., are very numerous.</p>
                    <p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful excursions, those to the Rigi,
                        Pilatus, Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other
                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of
                        Lucerne, commands magnificent views of lake and mountain scenery. Along the
                        Lake of Uri from Brunnen to Fluelen runs the famous Axentrasse</p>
                    <p>A delightful exeption from Lucerne is that to ENGELBERG. Take boat to
                        Stansstad and from Stansstad it is about 1 hour and 40 min. by Electric
                        Railway, with delightful scenery en route. The ascent of Titlis, is made
                        from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps is grand; extending from Monte

                        <p>n'hésitent pas à se purger, quand elles en ont besoin. Elles ne craignent
                            ni le dégoût ni la fatigue, parce que, à l'opposé des autres purgatifs,
                            celui-ci n'opère bien que lorsqu'il est pris avec de bons aliments et
                            des boissons fortifiantes, telles que vin, café, thé. Chacun choisit,
                            pour se purger, l'heure et le repas qui lui conviennent le mieux, selon
                            ses occupations. La fatigue de la purgation étant annulée par l'effet de
                            la bonne alimentation, on se décide aisément à recommencer autant de
                            fois que cela est nécessaire.</p>
