                    <p>Aujourd'hui les valeurs égyptiennes sont en baisse à Londres. La Banque
                        Nationale, entre autres, perd 1 livre en tombant d'un seul coup de 28 1/4 à
                        27 1/4. La raison de cette dégringolade provient d'importants ordres de
                        ventes transmis du Caire à Londres. On veut,parait-il, se défaire ici des
                        titres égyptiens pour em­ployer ses capitaux en fonds d'Ètat Étrangers qui
                        vont sûrement hausser en prévision de la paix.</p>
                    <p>Aussi toute la cote est-elle en baisse sur notre place. Pour ne citer que les
                        principales valeurs, la Banque Nationale tombe à 27 3/16, l'Agricole à 11
                        1/4, la Daïra à 25 1/16, la Delta Light à 14 3/8...</p>

                    <head>The Best Remedy for A Heavy Cold</head>
                    <p>As soon as you feel a cold coming on begin at once with Angler's Emulsion in
                        doses of two teaspoonfuls every two or three hours. Take no other medicine–
                        it is not necessary. Within twenty-four hours, cough is lessened, bronchial
                        distress and soreness are less pronounced and expectoration easier. In most
                        cases it requires but a few days' use of Angier's Emulsion to completely
                        cure a case of "cold." It is pleasant to take, aids digestion and builds up
                        strength.</p>
                    <p>Angier's Emulsion </p>

                    <p>In three sizes; of Chemists and Bazaars.</p>
                    <p>Avoid imitations– all of which are made with ordinary petroleum. Be sure to
                        get Angler's.</p>
