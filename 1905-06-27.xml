                    <p>An artistic wall covering.</p>

                        tastefully furnished homes. It is made in 70 artistic tints, and only requires
                        the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is quickly and easily applied
                        with a whitewash brush, with half the labour and at one third the cost of paint.
                        HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures cleanliness, and is pleasing to the eye. It appeals
                        alike to artistic and practical house decoration.</p>

                        colours, great weather-resisting and germ-destroying properties, it lends itself
                        to every kind of wall, wood, brick or stone coating, possessing all the
                        advantages of paint, colour- wash, and disinfectant at one third the cost of oil
                        paint. It never blisters in the hottest sun, and the fact that it can be washed
                        adds greatly to its sanitary advantages.</p>

                        service in Egypt The debt of gratitude due to him by Egypt might be
                        illustrated by one example out of many. Of the nine millions borrowed by
                        Egypt in 1885, one had been devoted by him to new works of irrigation, which
                        had brought in cent, per cent, and had proved tie financial salvation of
                        Egypt Even the victories won in war by the forces of England and Egypt ho
                        continued, haul owed much to his far-seeing forethought. By tho arts of
                        peace this distinguished native of Eastern England had won fresh fame from
                        tho bonks of the Nile, even as the arts of war had in the region of the same
                        river, and at an interval of exactly a century, added a new glory to the
                        names of Horatio Nelson and Horatio Herbert Kitchener. The recent agreement
                        between Great Britain and France and happily removed all the difference
                        between those two greet Powers in respect to Egypt, End had thus enhanced

                    <head>FRENCH AND ENGLISH INFLUENCE IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>The Cairo correspondent of the "Globe" ’ writes as follows The recent
                        examinations of Egyptian students in Cairo for tho secondary ® education
                        diplomas are of interest as denoting T the trend of educational aspirations
                        among the 0 growing generation of Egypt. The (comparison t between tho
                        French and English classes of the Government and private schools naturally 1
                        forms the true criterion of the relative social s influence of the two
                        nations in the country. In the first place, it is made evident that French
                        no longer retains the pre-eminence it long held in Egypt This year it has
                        fallen to a second place ; yet, notwithstanding tho increasing im- portance
                        of English, which was in the middle of May admitted to the international
                        courts as one of the judicial languages, French still num- bers a strong
                        following. In all, 447 candi- dates presented themselves for examination. Of
                        this number 195 were pupils of the Government schools ; 239 elected for the
                        1 English examination, which 116 passed suc- cessfully. The French section,
                        on the other hand, numbered 208 candidates, of whom only 61 were agrees.
                        While, therefore, the English section exceed- ed the French by only thirty
                        one candidates, it will be seen that the passes were strikingly more
                        numerous. Probably this result in part was caused bf the greater severity of
                        the French test, but a more valid reason is, I think, that the Government
                        institutions are giving less instruction in French, whether in language or
                        law. During the past year or two the Khedivial schools have been almost
                        entirely re-manned on the professional staff by the in- troduction of' a
                        large body of new English masters. The French, or French speaking, staff has
                        naturally diminished in proportion. It goes without saying that the youthful
                        Egyp tian whose perceptions are sufficiently sharp by nature, labours the
                        most assiduously at that language which stands to advance him with the
                        greatest certainty in his career. English methods of education, with their
                        inseparable concomitant of sport, have risen into extraordinary popu- larity
                        among the well-to-do classes of Egypt, to whose sons in many cases school
                        life is only the prelude to an English university career. It cannot,
                        however, be denied that French social influences, which are so peculiarly
                        adapted for the peaceful conquest of other nations, remain a power in Egypt,
                        and the French language is likely long to co-exiat with English as one of
                        the two polished and official languages of cosmopolitan intercourse.</p>

                    <p>The "Financier" says : — Interest in the land of the Pharaohs has shifted
                        from the Government bonds to gold mines, and Egyptian Unified, formerly
                        freely dealt in here and special favorites on the Paris Bourse, are now
                        mentioned only once in a blue moon. Thanks to the beneficent British rule,
                        further consolidated by the Anglo- French agreement, Egyptian bonds have
                        joined the gilt-edged list, and although the rates of interest are nominally
                        higher than those on the beet European Government securities, the return on
                        tho money is so low as to appeal only to the non-speculative investor.
                        Accord- ing to the report just issued by the Public Debt Commission, an
                        additional earn it I L.E. 780,000 per annum bas been awarded to it for
                        amortisation purposes, leaving intact the ' reserve fund of L.B. 1,800,000
                        available in case of need. The amount of the Three per Cent Guaranteed loan
                        outstanding on March 1st was £7,915,200, of the Three and a-Half per Cent.
                        Preference loan £31,127,780, and of the Unified Four p4r Cent loan
                        £58,971,960. Considering that, alter attending to the service of the debt,
                        there was a surplus of L.B. 3,640,516, of which half is re- tained by the
                        "Caisse," the question is whether Egyptian Unified are not worth even more
                        than their present price of I80f The scaling down of the interest at one
                        time feared is no longer i a practical question in view of the aforesaid r
                        agreement with France, and the security is non pins ultra. Egyptian darkness
                        is a thing of the past.</p>

                        present owing, to the strong khamseen Winds. There are several cases of
                        fever, chiefly amongst the Europeans, but none are serious. Mr. Smart, chief
                        storekeeper of the Railways, is now practically out of danger. He will
                        probably go for a change of air for a few months shortly. I regret to say
                        that Mohamed Bey Ahmed, our popular commandant of police, is also laid np
                        with influenza. Mr. Moss is the acting commandant now. Kaimakam Drury Bey,
                        R.N., Controller of Sudan Ports, will shortly leave for tho Bahr ol Gbazal
                        on special duty in connection with tho sudd cutting. Ho is) now waiting for
                        his relief to come. Locusts have made their appearance in great numbers both
                        at Tokar and Snakin, but the damage done op to the present is very slight.

                <p>SECRETS OF ANTIQUITY. I-KOF. PETRIE INTERVIEWED. BRITISH SCHOOL OF ARCHAEOLOGY
                    FOR EGYPT.</p>
                <p>Professor Flinders Potrio has revoalod tho hi-tory of “prehistoric" times, and
                    made the word look ridioulous. Wo now know what was happening in the world eight
                    thousand years lie has unriddled the ancient secrets of Egypt, whilo Mr. Arthur
                    Evans and others were delving into tho Greece of long ago. The two sots ot facts
                    have dovetailed in*o a com- prehensive knowledge of tho rise of Medi- terranean
                    civilisation—into a new conception of Europe at its beginning.</p>
                <p>in that history of antiquity there aro miss- ing chapters. But some pages that
                    last autupin were blank are now inscribed with revelations of deep interest.
                    This spring, working with an army of trainod excavators. Professor Petrie
                    unearthed a groat temple in Sinai—a discovery that has taught us many things we
                    were pre- viously the poorer for not knowing. The main points of that new
                    knowledge were—but no ; this is an interview, and tho reader shall re- ceive the
                    instruction later in the Professor's own words.</p>
                <p>Wo had oor chat at University College, among the picturesque spoils of his toil
                    Inci- dentally, 1 asked Professor Petrie what new ground he proposes to open
                    next spring, His reply will be deeply interesting to all archivo- logists, and
                    specially to students of Bible his- tory. Bat the project hangs upon an "if'— a
                    deplorable, humiliating “if." Perhaps, indeed* there will be no more
                    exoavations. It is a ijtu'ition of money. The issue is concerned with the
                    relative values in the nation's estimation of i l.oOO and a lurthor insight into
                    the history t.j mu-out civilisation.</p>
                <p>“But," 1 asked the Professor, at his first hint that something was amiss, "has
                    there beeu a stoppage of the revenues that have hitherto supported your
                    excavations t” "Yes," he replied, "the resources of the Exploration Fond, lately
                    much diminished, are : .w allocated to work quite distinct from my own. So new
                    financial support ‘must bo foand, ,.r the work will cease.”</p>
                <p>“What annual outlay is involved 1" "Only about £1,000, or possibly in some
                    seasons £1,500. Wo have a basis in the Egyp- tian Research Account, which sends
                    out students from here to work with me in Egypt. They have constituted, in fact
                    though not in name, a British School of Archeology in Egypt. To simplify the
                    present situation, we now propose to define that work by giving it that name.
                    This school, which will form a branch of the general development of research
                    work in the expansion of London University, will carry , on our course of
                    discoveries and continue to train students in tho historical researches that
                    have won a dozen of their predecessors official and other positions identified
                    with antiquities. To support ‘In* school an intluential committee will appeal to
                    the public for subscriptions.”</p>
                <p>NO HELP FROM THE GOVERNMENT. "But have you no Government grant—dc not the learned
                    societies assist yon—and the museums, don't they contribute i" Professor
                    Flinders Petrie smiled bitterly. "Tho German Government assists soch work, and
                    so do some other Governments, but tho British Government does not give a penny
                    to Egyptian exploration. No learned society assists ns. We have received sums
                    from museums in 'America and at Berlin and Brussels, but hardly any English
                    mnsenm has given us a penny. They take the specimens we present to them.”</p>
                <p>“Well," 1 said, “the money must be foand, for it is unthinkable that the work
                    should stop. If, indeed, yon needed £2,000 per annnm, the English nation would
                    have to scrape together that sum. And now will yon please tell me something
                    about your great work of this year I”</p>
                <p>“The Semitic Temple of Sinai Ah 1 Come and see the model” He led me past several
                    glass-cases full of Ancient Egypt, and we came to a table whereon lay a plaster
                    miniature of the instructive ruin, which, until the professor discovered it a
                    few months ago, lay buried in sand and oblivion.</p>
                <p>He told me of the wonder in qoiok, enthusias- tic sentences. "It is entirely
                    Samitio—not Egyptian—the first temple of the kind we have had. It was built from
                    about 2500 B.C. down to 1150 B.C. An essentially Semitic feature is that the
                    neighbourhood is crowded with pilgrims' rest- .ug places. See these small
                    chambers for the pilgrims. In front of this shrine we found a great space of the
                    hill oovered with burnt offer- ings. Nothing ot the kind had been found in
                    Egypt. Here"—for the professor's pointing finger moved rapidly over the
                    model—“were mrts with tanks in the middle, prototypes of tin) modern mosque, but
                    dating 2000 years before Mohamed.”</p>
                <p>‘ What is tho name of this place 1” 1 Sarabit-el-Khadem. It is five days’ journoy
                    semis the desert from Suez. It is three days’ journey, or sixty miles, from the
                    monastery of i Mount Sinai. We had a camp of thirty-four jersons. We had to
                    carry with ns all the necessary food and water. We copied all the inscription*.
                    The Egyptians went there to mine for tnrqaoises.”</p>
                <p>“Are. there any there now 1" "Yes, bat the mines are not worth working. The
                    Indian turquoise hss supplanted the Egyp- tian turquoise, in the seme way that
                    the copper [ has been supplanted by Canadian and Russian * copper. We were on
                    very good terms with the ! Bedouins. The men live in the open always. | We found
                    the old Sheikh sleeping ont in a hard frost He is 50, which is eqnal to 70 in |
                    England. He wee out during 24 hours of! drenching rain. The tents are only for
                    the Women and children. ”</p>
                <p>WHAT £100 DID. "And did it cost only £1,000 to excavate that temple f" “£1,000!
                    Why I tamed it ont for £100 and wo did much other work. Tho fellaheen aro very
                    hardworking, much better than tho Greeks, but yon have to pay them well. In
                    addition to his wages I allow every man tho local value of what he finds. For
                    gold ho re- ceives tho weight in sovereigns. That is why I find gold articles
                    and other excavators don’t At Wadi-Maghara we had a groat many inscrip- tions to
                    copy.”</p>
                <p>“Do yon tam aDy of your finds into cash ?" "No. Halt go to tho Cairo Masonm. The
                    remainder aro presented to other collections. Wo have to depend entirely open
                    subscriptions. It is very unpleasant for me to have to urge tho public. At
                    present tho financial question is keeping me from my proper work. We merely
                    require tho cost of two or three motor-cars—less than tho prico of a yacht. See
                    how in all directions monoy is spent on objects that benefit nobody. And to
                    postpone these re- searches is fatal, for the sites aro being igno- rantly
                    ransacked. Once these scientific oppor- tunities pass away thoy can never
                    return—the evidence has vanished for ever.” "What did yon hope to aooomplish
                    next season V</p>
                <p>“1 want to got to work in tho Delta. For some time nothing has boon done in
                    working np the Semitic period—one of the darkest points. In connection with the
                    Israelites we have little bnt uncertainty. Now that all the stages in the rise
                    of civilisation have been worked ont, the greatest interest is in filling np
                    some of the worst gaps in historic time. There is no worse gap than at 2000
                    B.C., when the country was under Asiatic inva- ders. Tho great tablet of
                    Merenptah that I found, dating about 1200 B.C., mentioned the oonqueat of some
                    people of Israel in Palestine, and settled an important point I want to go
                    farther. Already I have made preliminary observations bearing upon tho history
                    of the Exodus, but I cannot expect to find any further direct evidenoe until I
                    disinter actual remains in the oountry.” Wake up—ye people of means ; write
                    cheques, and rejoice in your noble opportu- nities. (A. E. C. in the "Daily
                    News.”</p>
                <p>RIFLE CLUBS. A stirring appeal to the nation for funds for tho establishment of
                    rifle clnbs throughout England has been made by Lord Roberts. Acknowledging
                    that' courage and discipline are as necessary as ever,” his lordship says that
                    “these qualifications will not enable us to win battles nowadays unless we can
                    shoot as well as, or better than, oar adversaries." After stating that he agrees
                    with the finding of the Royal War Commission that "the tree lesson of the war,
                    in onr opinion, is that no military system will be satisfactory whioh does not
                    con- tain powers of expansion outside the limit of the regular forces of the
                    Army, whatever that limit may be," Lord Roberta procoeds to show that the
                    present military organisation is not sufficient in case of a war, adding that
                    "... In the last resort the independence of a State depends not only on the
                    willingness, but the ability, of the nation as a whole to take up arms in
                    self-defenco. Even for the South African War we had to look for help outside the
                    regular and auxiliary forces of the Uuitod Kingdom and the colonies, and were
                    forced to hastily organise an Army composed of men who possessed no previous
                    military training, and had never before bandied a rifle. This fact was the cause
                    of many of the disas- ters that occurred in the later stages of the war, and
                    tended materially to prolong military operations.”</p>
                <p>Coming then to the point of his appeal. Lord Roberts points ont that he is
                    convinced that</p>
                <p>“It is a matter of the highest importance, pot only to the regular Army and the
                    aux- iliary forces of this country, bat to tho Empire at large, that rifle
                    shooting should be made a national pursuit, and skill with the rifle a national
                    accomplishment, in the same manner that archery and skill with the long-bow were
                    so considered in the olden days in England." By this means the country would
                    secure a potential reserve without haring recourse to oonscription, "a measure
                    whioh is so distasteful to the majority of the people of this oountry that its
                    adoption is gieatly to be deprecated except under the pressure of an
                    overwhelming national emergenoy.” Continuing, his lbrdship adds:— “At the same
                    time i am satisfied that nnlesa some system of obligatory pbysioal training and
                    instruction in rifle shooting be enforced in all schools and colleges and among
                    the yonth of the oountry generally up to the age of eighteen years, we shall be
                    oompelled to resort to oonscription in some form or other.</p>

                    been in very bad health, and had entirely withdrawn from pnblio life.</p>
                <p>Hermann Wissmann—the most distinguish- ed name in tho history of German colonial
                    enterprise—was bom at Frankfurt on tho OJer in 1853. He was odneated at the
                    College for Military Cadets in Berlin and at the Uni- versity (1 Rostock, and
                    began his military careor in a regiment of Mecklenburg Fusiliers. His African
                    travels and explorations were due to his acquaintance with the African traveller
                    Dr. Pogge, to whose expedition he attached himself in 1880. The expedition
                    started from Loando, on the west ooaat of Africa, and when it reached Njangwe,
                    Wissmann separated from his companion, and, emulous of the achieve- ments of
                    Stanley, set out to traverse the African continent from west to east In tho
                    course of his successful advance he discovered tho river Sankuru and the
                    shortest route between the upper reaches of the Kaasai and the Upper Conga At
                    Tabora he met Tippoo Tib — whose death was anuounoed recently — and accompanied
                    the Arab slave dealer to Ugoga 'l’henoe he proceeded alone eastwards, and
                    reached the coast at 8aadani on Novomber 14, 1882. In the following year he
                    undertook a Congo expedition at the instanoe of tho King of the Belgians, with
                    the object of investigating the coarse of the Kassai river. This task he only
                    completed, however, daring his third journey, which he undertook in 1886 and
                    which, after groat privations, lod him, by way of Lakes Tangany- ika and Nyasa,
                    to the Zambesi and Mozam- bique, so that ho had succeeded in crossing Africa
                    froju-west to east for the sooond time. WLstnanu’s official connexion with the
                    Germau Government began in 1888, when his services were secured by Prince
                    Bismarck lor the task of quelling the insurrection in tho territories of the
                    Gorman East African Com- pany, now German Rost Africa. He was at the the time
                    under contract to lead the socalled German Emin Pasha relief expedition whioh
                    was subsequently organised by Dr. Karl Peters. Prince Bu-marck Baw clearly
                    enoogh that the expedition was intended by its promoters to be a filibustering
                    incursion into the British sphere of interest in Uganda and on the Upper Nile,
                    and from first to last the Imperial Chan- cellor, who declared that the goodwill
                    of England was "worth tho whole of Africa,” discoun- tenanced and disavowed the
                    enterprise. On the other hand, the appointment of Wissmann to the offico of
                    Imporial Commissioner for Gorman East Africa came as a surprise to most English
                    students of German colonial polioy, and re- presented the determination of the
                    German Government to establish itself territorially in the east, as it had
                    already done in the west, of the African centre ant Wissmann organised a native
                    force of 1,000 men, with Germau officers and r on-commissioned officers, and,
                    after a campaign which lasted over a year, aooceeded in quelling the
                    insurrection of the East African tribes, lu 1890 tho international position and
                    tho frontiers of tho new territory were regulated by an Anglo German agreement.
                    Wissmann's services were recognised by the Emperor, who bestowed upon him the
                    rank of nobility. In 1891 he resigned his Commissionership ; bat after an
                    interval of four years, in the course of whioh he carried out the task of
                    oonveying to the Victoria Nyaozx the steamer named after him, which was built at
                    the oost of the German "Anti-Slavery Committee," he returned to Bast Africa in
                    1895 as holder of the new offioe of Imperial Governor. In 1896 he finally
                    retired, owing to ill-health, and has since resided on an estate which he
                    purchased in Styria and where he has just met his death under tragic cir-
                    cumstances.</p>
                <p>Of Wissmann, Bismarck spoke as the Ger- man African official of that epoch who
                    had “rotamed with a spotless white waistcoat” He had more Inins and a more
                    conciliatory disposition than most of his rivals, and, in particular, he never
                    indulged in any of those Chanvinistio tirades against the British Em- pire which
                    were so common daring the "Starm and Drang” period of the German oolonial
                    movement. He was wont to acknowledge in the most unreserved way the achievements
                    of his great British predecessors, like Livingstone, Stanley, and Thompson. He
                    himself possessed neither the iron nerve nor the tough constitu- tion of some of
                    these African pioneers, and the breakdown of his health was largely dne to a
                    nervous restlessness which ultimately in- capacitated him for official or public
                    life. For the last seven or eight years his name was seldom, if ever, heard in
                    connexion with\ oolonial matters.</p>

                <p>A SPURIOUS UTOPIA. THE PITCAIRN ISLANDS. 8even years ago, in the "Pall Mall
                    Gazette," the svriter, nnder the title of "A Spurious Utopias" told the tree
                    story of the “good and pious people of Norfolk Island—the descend- ants of the
                    original Bounty mutineers," and now we have in “Parliamentary Report 30” the
                    story of the other branch of those pioos people settled in their old home on
                    Pitcairn Island.</p>
                <p>For thirty years generous and well-meaning people in England have been grossly
                    imposed upon by a lazy community of can ting hypocrites, and the ex tracts from
                    Mr. Simon’s report printed some time back in the “Pall Mall Gazette" will
                    enlighten the pnblio as to the real character of the Pitcairn Islanders aa did
                    the report of the New Booth Wales Commission on Norfolk Island in 1895, when
                    that oolony assumed control of the island,.-and cleansed it of its rampant
                    corruption.</p>
                <p>Let me quote from my first article in the "Pall Mall Gazette"— “For a fortnight
                    the Commiasion held nearly daily sittings, and examined a great number of
                    witnesses, and then, at the oonclnsion of ita labours, the President, Mr.
                    Oliver, called a publio meeting of the male inhabitants and addressed them very
                    eloquently. He pointed out to them that they had no power to disregard the laws
                    made for them by the former Governors of New South Wales and substitute laws of
                    their own, and that their oontinoal maladministration, even of their own
                    so-oalled laws, had at last brought trouble upon them. He did not want, he said,
                    to say hard things, "but," he continued, “you have been sadly misrepresented by
                    people who have visited you fir a short time, due, no doubt, to your hospi-
                    tality to them.” And then he told them something more unpleasant still... "The
                    rottenness of their oondition was very evident... The island is in a boost
                    deplorable oondition .... crime ia rampant and unchecked .... the morals of the
                    younger people are as low as they can poasibly be.” The island, he pointed out,
                    was supposed by the world generally to bo a home of smiling plenty, and that the
                    moral and social oondition of ita people hod no parallel; whereas the very
                    reverse was the case. Their lazy habits had been a curse to the island, and the
                    oondition of the land, aa com- pared with what it was when the place was turned
                    over to them in 1866, was deplorable indeed; it was simply becoming the home of
                    the poison bosh and the wild tobaooo plant. They imagined—and had imagined for
                    forty years—that their proper polioy was to exolnde strangers, aa they had done
                    at Pitcairn Island. But that was a mistake. They were not capa- ble of taking
                    oare of themselves, "and for their own welfare it was eminently desirable that
                    oolonists should be admitted to the island.” During the past few years many
                    appeals have been made in England from the pnlpit and by pamphlets asking for
                    gifts of food, clothing, tools, fishing gear, seeds, and "reli- gions books" for
                    the Pitcairn Islanders. They (the islanders) are in most cases utterly unde-
                    serving of help. They do not need it They have been enoou raged to beoome
                    hardened, practised, and shameless loafers and spongers, using their cloak of
                    piety to gall the oatside world. Mr. Simon remarks that “happily they do not use
                    intoxioanta.” That is beoause they cannot get them. Many years ago one young man
                    told me frankly, "If we only had plenty of ooooannt trees on the island we oould
                    soon make tuiarurv (toddy) and have some good old drunks.”</p>
                <p>In oonolusion, it wonld be well for those pions gentlemen and elderly maiden
                    ladies who bave so long worshipped the andean fetish of the godly Pitcairn
                    Islander to stndy in Report 30 Mr. 8imon’« crisp remarks. With regard to the
                    morals of the islanders, in the aggregate be "can say bnt little in their favor.
                    Illegitimate children, petty thefts, trawls, bad language, eta, are oommon." And
                    lie might have added—what is well known to the masters and orews of trading
                    ships in the Padfio Island#—that their Utopia is a by-word and reproach from one
                    end of the Pacifio to the other. (“Pall Mall Gosette.”</p>
