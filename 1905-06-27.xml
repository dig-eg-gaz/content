but little difference, and though the difference
between the readings at Rosaires is often
considerable too much stress must Dot be laid
on the fact. The readings at this station are
very variable and often show snob remarkable

there readings with the same regularity as
thoy receive those from the other sta-

understand that the Assouan gauges are
daily forwarded by telegram, and we would
therefore suggest that a slight protest on the
part of the public to the department at fault,
whether it bo tbe Telegraph Administration
or the Pablic Works Department, might
cause these readings to be received more
promptly</p>

<head>LORD CROMERS HONORARY LL.D</head>
<p>On the occasion of the conferment of the
degree of Doctor of Law, honoris causa, upon
the Earl of Cromer at Cambridge University,
the public orator, in a Latin speech, referred
to Lord Cromer's many years of beneficent
service in Egypt The debt of gratitude due to
him by Egypt might be illustrated by one
example out of many. Of the nine millions
borrowed by Egypt in 1885, one had been
devoted by him to new works of irrigation,
which had brought in cent, per cent, and had
proved tie financial salvation of Egypt
Even the victories won in war by the forces
of England and Egypt ho continued, haul owed
much to his far-seeing forethought. By tho
arts of peace this distinguished native of
Eastern England had won fresh fame from
tho bonks of the Nile, even as the arts of
war had in the region of the same river,
and at an interval of exactly a century,
added a new glory to the names of Horatio
Nelson and Horatio Herbert Kitchener. The
recent agreement between Great Britain and
France and happily removed all the difference<
between those two greet Powers in respect to
Egypt, End had thus enhanced the pleasure
with which the University now paid the
honor that was due to a minister of peace
who, to England and Egypt alike, was a pillar
of strength.
Tho ceremony was attended by the Duchess
of Albany.</p>

<head>FRENCH AND ENGLISH INFLUENCE
IN EGYPT.</head>
<p>The Cairo correspondent of the “Globe" ’
writes as follows The recent examinations of
Egyptian students in Cairo for tho secondary ®
education diplomas are of interest as denoting T
the trend of educational aspirations among the 0
growing generation of Egypt. The (comparison t
between tho French and English classes of the
Government and private schools naturally 1
forms the true criterion of the relative social s
influence of the two nations in the country. In
the first place, it is made evident that French
no longer retains the pre-eminence it long held
in Egypt This year it has fallen to a second
place ; yet, notwithstanding tho increasing im-
portance of English, which was in the middle of
May admitted to the international courts as one
of the judicial languages, French still num-
bers a strong following. In all, 447 candi- 
dates presented themselves for examination. 
Of this number 195 were pupils of the
Government schools ;	239 elected for the 1
English examination, which 116 passed suc-
cessfully. The French section, on the other
hand, numbered 208 candidates, of whom only
61 were agrees.
While, therefore, the English section exceed-
ed the French by only thirty one candidates, it
will be seen that the passes were strikingly
more numerous. Probably this result in part
was caused bf the greater severity of the
French test, but a more valid reason is, I
think, that the Government institutions are
giving less instruction in French, whether in
language or law. During the past year or two
the Khedivial schools have been almost entirely
re-manned on the professional staff by the in-
troduction of' a large body of new English
masters. The French, or French speaking,
staff has naturally diminished in proportion. It
goes without saying that the youthful Egyp
tian whose perceptions are sufficiently sharp by
nature, labours the most assiduously at that
language which stands to advance him with the
greatest certainty in his career. English methods
of education, with their inseparable concomitant
of sport, have risen into extraordinary popu-
larity among the well-to-do classes of Egypt, to
whose sons in many cases school life is only the
prelude to an English university career. It
cannot, however, be denied that French social
influences, which are so peculiarly adapted for
the peaceful conquest of other nations, remain
a power in Egypt, and the French language is
likely long to co-exiat with English as one of
the two polished and official languages of
cosmopolitan intercourse.</p>
<div type=“item”>
<head>EGYPTIAN LIGHT</head>
<p>The "Financier" says : —
Interest in the land of the Pharaohs has
shifted from the Government bonds to gold
mines, and Egyptian Unified, formerly freely
dealt in here and special favorites on the
Paris Bourse, are now mentioned only once in
a blue moon. Thanks to the beneficent British
rule, further consolidated by the Anglo-
French agreement, Egyptian bonds have joined
the gilt-edged list, and although the rates of
interest are nominally higher than those on
the beet European Government securities, the
return on tho money is so low as to appeal
only to the non-speculative investor. Accord-
ing to the report just issued by the Public
Debt Commission, an additional earn it
I L.E. 780,000 per annum bas been awarded to
it for amortisation purposes, leaving intact the
' reserve fund of L.B. 1,800,000 available in
case of need. The amount of the Three per
Cent Guaranteed loan outstanding on March
1st was £7,915,200, of the Three and a-Half
per Cent. Preference loan £31,127,780, and of
the Unified Four p4r Cent loan £58,971,960.
Considering that, alter attending to the
service of the debt, there was a surplus
of L.B. 3,640,516, of which half is re-
tained by the "Caisse," the question is whether
Egyptian Unified are not worth even more than
their present price of I80f The scaling down
of the interest at one time feared is no longer
i a practical question in view of the aforesaid
r agreement with France, and the security is
non pins ultra. Egyptian darkness is a thing
of the past.</p>
