                    <head>THE PROSPECTS OF PEACE.</head>
                    <p>We cannot say that the latest news from the United States gives any sore hope
                        of peace. M. de Witte has reiterated, time oat of mind, that Russia will pay
                        no war in- demnity, and even though the tribute levied oo the vanquiahed be
                        styled "a reimbursement for war expenses”—an expression we oan cor- dially
                        recommend to future conqueror*—we doubt whether all the gilding in the world
                        will make Russia swallow the pilL The long delay sinoe the victory of Mokdan
                        has onoe more given the Russians time to reorganise their foroes and fill op
                        their gaps, and though Qeneral Iinievitch does not bear the reputa- tion of
                        a great strategist, and refugees from the scene of action tell stories of
                        demora- lisation and incipient matiny among his soldiers, still, it must be
                        remembered that similar tales have been spread abroad sinoe Liao Yang, and
                        that, in spite of them all, the Russian armies have never been routed, in
                        the tense ol being not only defeated, bat demoralised for a considerable
                        period after their defeat ; that, with the ooe exoeption of Port Arthur,
                        avoidable surrenders on a large soale have been unknown; and that the
                        Russian soldier, in spite of his iacompetent officers and imperfect
                        training, always fights stub- bornly, and retreats with regret The viotory
                        of Tsushima has saved Japan from all risk at defeat and has assured
                        Liautong, Korea Md Bsfbalien to her soldiers, bat the Russian armies may
                        fight a retreating battle, draw away to Lake Baikal or the Upper Amor
                        valley, and, maintaining half a million man there, weary the Japeoese, who
                        will be obliged to tutataio an approximately qual force in</p>
                    <p>Manchuria, into a oompromiao. In the ahock of battle the Japanese are
                        perhaps invincible , but will even the heroes of the Shaho, Mukden, and Port
                        Arthur prove themselves human after another two years of indecisive war t In
                        the itixUsnth c-tntury one of the ablest of Asiatics, Toyotomi Hideyoahi,
                        the Taiko-sama, or Great Lord, as the worshipper* at the shrine of his soul
                        call him, led Japan to a five years' war of oinqueet in Korea against the
                        Chinese and Koreans, whioh ended in the failure of all his plans, not so
                        much through iU-euooess, as through the bitter home-sickness which is one of
                        the prioea a patriotic army has to pay for a long campaign across the seas.
                        Our soldier* un- doubtedly grew homaiiok and ‘stale’ in South Africa, and it
                        will be atrange if even the mo*t ardent Japaneee soldier ha* not aome of the
                        edge taken ofi hi* martial temper *fter more rainy aummen and icy winter.-
                        in the Manchurian plains.</p>
                    <p>AU will depend, in our opinion, on the ability of Russia to play a long,
                        slow, and unattractive game, without hope of any real victory—for the prisee
                        of the.war must be to the Japaneee—but simply and solely with a view to
                        making the peaoe terms leu onerous. And we submit that on this point the
                        Russians themselves are the only possible judges. Were the revolutionary
                        party in Russia led by oapable men, a long war might lead to the tall of the
                        Tsardom, bat the earning cruise of the Potemkin, the failure of the striker*
                        at Odessa to do more than provoke a nmnere, and the fact that a large
                        section of the Russian people •teem* oontented with the promite* of relorm
                        solemnly affirmed by the Tsar, makes us inclined to suspect that the Tsar’e
                        govern- ment will take the risk* of revolution. Bat a long struggle in the
                        Bast must still further weaken Russian infiuenoe and prestige in the West,
                        and from this obvious decline of her infiuenoe and prestige, mast be born
                        the inducements to make peaoe quickly with the Japaneee. The mast
                        pro-Gercn«a Russian cannot but feel dismayed at tho growth of German
                        influence in theNearEi*t,theadvooato of expansion in the Middle Bast must
                        feel alarm at tho rapid extension of British in- fiuenoe in the Persian
                        Gulf; and it must be a galling reflection that Russia oau have now no say in
                        Scandinavian politics, and oannot offer France more than platonio support in
                        Moroooo. Thirty years ago Russia might perhaps have abandoned western
                        politios and striven for years to minimise defeat in theEtst,but events move
                        rapidly now-a-days, and Russia’s effaoe meat as a European power for a few
                        years may prove a terrible handicap to her for another generation.</p>
