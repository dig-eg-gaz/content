                    <head>THE EXTERMINATION OF THE MOSQUITO.</head>
                    <p>Although a quarter of a century has passed since malaria was shown by Laveran
                        to be dee to the presence of oertain parasites in the blood, it is only
                        within the last decade that the natural history of these organisms has been
                        folly worked ont It is no exaggerate now to say that the life story of a
                        malarial parasite is as well-known to the medical scientist as is that of a
                        well-known politioiar to the general pnblio. Jost as we know tha' the eating
                        of 'messley pork' is the means o' transferring the tape worm from the pig b
                        men, we are equally certain that the oon necting link in carrying malaria,
                        blood worm disease, and yellow fever from men to men i> in each case a
                        special variety of moeqoito. This is one of the few absolutely proven iso's
                        of medical science, demonstrated by the evidences in nature and by actual
                        experiment. The examination of the blood of tho viotim o' ’hese diseases is
                        now a routine practice of the modern-physician. It is possible not only b)
                        the m'orescope to diagnose the form of malarir, but also to estimate to some
                        extent the resist ing power of tho individual thereto. It is alar a
                        well-ascertained faot that one human being oannot infect another exoept
                        through the in- tervention of speoial varieties of morqnitoes.</p>
                    <p>The life history of the parasite begins and ends in man, unless it becomes
                        the gnest of an intermediary host, the mosquito, where it i» capable of
                        sexual development and multiplica- tion. As man therefore oan only be
                        infected bi the moiquito and tho mosq lito by man, it fol lows that the
                        removal of either of there from any locality moans the extinction of the
                        na'a rial blood worm, and other similar parasites knownand(as yet)nnknown.lt
                        is obvious th»re- foie that thire are two ways by which these diseases may
                        be stamped out: the destruction of tho mosquito or, failing that, the is
                        ilation of all oaseo of malaria. That the former method is practioab'e is
                        shown by the splendid results obtained at Ismailia. A'tbongh authorities, in
                        writing of the prevent'on of anopheles mularia, qnote the examination of the
                        anopheles a'' Ismailia as resulting in the diminution in malarial case*, it
                        is astonishing that other towns in Egypt have not followed the exam- I pie
                        of the Csnal town in exterminating mos- quitoes. Although one knows that all
                        mos- quitoes do not oonvey malaria yet all mos- quitoes are a source of
                        disoomfort, il not actual danger to community. </p>
                    <p>The mosquito is perhaps one of the easiest of all insects to kill. To
                        successfully attack him in his state of fully-fledged indepen- dence and
                        expect to make much headway against the soourge would be impossible.
                        Fortunately it is extremely easy to kill the mosquito in its early stages of
                        jsxistenoe. In petroleum we have a remedy which never fails when efficiently
                        applied. The larvae of mos- quitoes are air breathers. The inspirator;
                        mechanism is very similar to that of the air- iohaling tube of a submarine.
                        A film of petro- leum in water, their breeding habitat, com- pletely prevent
                        respiration. When sprinkled on water paraffin spreads out into an ex-
                        tremely thin layer, so that for a large area a small quantity is sufficient
                        For large collections of water a gardener's wa- tering can is the best
                        applianoe. Small puddles of stagnant water merely require to have the
                        surfaoe lightly touched with a rag dipped in the oiL The small film of oil
                        neces- sary to destroy the eggs of the mosquito does not affect drinking
                        water for domestio por- pores if the outflow pipe-ia below the surface.
                        There is no possible danger ot fire even though wooden structures are
                        immersed in the water. The film of paraffin required is so thin and
                        evaporates so rapidly that it is impossible to ignite it. </p>
                    <p>Short ot an organised crusade undertaken by the sanitary authorities of a
                        locality much can be dote by individual initiative and example The filling
                        iu of all stagnant pools, drainage, and similar measures greatly mitigate
                        the pest Fortunately in Egypt the malarial bear- ing mxquito has not such a
                        wide geographical distribution as the blood worm disease-bearing morquito.
                        But other species—and their nan: is leg-'on—are soffioiently objeotionab'.e
                        ana suggestive of possible danger, to justify the adoption of any means
                        calculated to get rid « suoh a pest. </p>
                    <p>The rOle of insects as the carriers of disease has come to be more
                        extensively reoognised of late years. One writer on sanitation, at present
                        in the Sudan, mentions in the disoussion on the cantos of eoterio fever in
                        the South African Campaign what he tehely terms, "the filthy feet of faecal
                        feeding flies.” Flies have also been oredited with carrying the germs of
                        oon- tagious ophthalmia.Flies are known sometimes to have transferred the
                        miorobas of plague from rats to man. Evidence is also aooumulat- iog daily
                        to shew that Mediterranean fever, which seems to be beooming almost endemic
                        in some of the Egyptian ports, more especially Port Said, is an insect-borne
                        disease, most pro- bably due to a variety of moiquito which can live in
                        brackish water. </p>
                    <p>The recent epidemio of yellow fever in New Orleans only began to show signs
                        of lessening when the municipality and the inhabitants »operated in
                        instituting a general crusade against the mosquito. The Americans, with
                        characteristic energy, instituted what was known as Mosquito Sunday. Each
                        householder who had oarried out the instructions as to 'umigation in the
                        house and the oovering of ill cisterns and stagnant water with paraffin
                        received a button to shew that he had fulfil- led bis doty in attending to
                        his own premises. It is sometimes argued that it is useless for one
                        householder to destroy tho mosquitoes in the basement or garden of his
                        residence unless bis neighbonra. do likewise. Bat this is a fallacy.
                        Mosquitoes, like sparrows and rooks, have special habitats and hunting
                        gronndf. Thus if one destroys the mosqoitose in any particular house, that
                        plaoe is fur some time qnite free exoept perhaps for the visit of some oo
                        lasional straggler. </p>
                    <p>Incidentally it may be mentioned that petro- enm is very effectual in driving
                        away other insects. The writer has cleared his premises of a horde of small
                        blaok ants by placiog a ittle paraffin in their breeding and rusticg places.
                        For larger insects, such as oockroaohes, it is necessary to lay down borao'o
                        acid, which tots as a poison.on these creatures. When the remedy for the
                        extermination of the mosqnito is so simple and oheap as to be at he command
                        of every householder, it is a great pity that individual initiative and
                        effort is so united, that full advantage has not yet been aken of the means
                        the soooess of whioh was lemonstnted at Ismailia. At the neighbouring and
                        more important centre, Port Su'd, the ‘jamping-off place’ for so many
                        tourists, the nuisance of the mosquito is nearly as great ts that of the
                        ubiquitous Arab street- vendor. In this town all the local conditions are
                        favorable to the saooessfal extermination >f the morquito. Thj oeopsretioa
                        of ths European residents in the carrying oot of an organised crusade would
                        go far to remove the reputation the town has as a hot-bed for the rearing of
                        mo.'qnitoes. The writer has some- times been astonished that the
                        hotel-keepers seem to make no effort,other than tha provission of mosqnito
                        nets, to proteot their patrons. Al- though tha price of petroleum has lately
                        been increase dowing to the trouble in the Caucasus the small outlay
                        required to sprinkle ths cel- lars, basement", oisterns, and bath-rooms
                        would easily be repaid by ths increased cjmfort to the gnests.</p>

                        the bag which had contained the LB 1,000, and still contained L.E 893, under
                        the threshold of the sister of one of the members of the gang. During the

                        the theft and revealed the place where he had bidden L E. 77. The remaining
                        L E. 30 had been spent by the culprits, all of whom have been arrested. They
                        are six in number ; four have confessed and denounced the other two. We

                    <p>A native of Karnak, near Luxor, had reason to believe that his house was
                        built over an ancient tomb or some old building, wherein a great treasure
                        was awaiting discovery. He dug a huge pit and succeeded in coming upon an
                        old door, which after some trouble he managed to get open. He entered, but
                        never came out alive. His wife became alarmed at her husband's long absence
                        and at last took a lamp and made her way down the excavation to the dorr.
                        She likewise did not come back. The son and daughter then went in search of
                        their father and mother* and they also disappeared. A native of the same
                        village, finding the house deserted, determined also to go down, and on
                        getting to the door became asphyxiated. The omdeh got to hear of this fatal
                        pit and informed the markez authorities. The bodies of the man and his wife
                        and two children were discovered just inside the door, they evidently having
                        been suffocated by the foul air. The story is told by our vernacular
                        contemporary “A1 Moayad ”</p>

                        institutions in England and on the Continent, it being claimed, with no
                        small degree of reason, that living and Bleeping in the open air is
                        conducive to regaining and maintaining the best conditions of health.
                        Believing, as we do,the correctness of these principles, we are pleased to
                        bo able to announce that an open-air camp on the most up-to-date lines has
                        been erected in the desert at Helouan. The camp has been pitched to the
                        north of the town, adjoining the golf links and race-course, and forms from
                        its delightfully open position and structure an ideal spot for those who may
                        come to Egypt for health sake daring the present winter.</p>



                    <p>The camp consists of single rooms and a sitting-room combined with sheltered
                        verandahs, eta, comfortably furnished, open at the same time on all Bides to
                        the desert and fitted with every convenience. The whole is lighted by

                    <p>Dear Sir.—Will yon allow me a little space for a word of praise for the
                        prompt and energetic action of Yousbashi Waller and bis staff of firemen, in
                        coping with a fire at Ibrahimieh yesterday ? At about 10.30 a.m. my wife
                        telephoned to me in town that a fire had broken out, as I understood, at
                        home, advising the fire station at the same time. My son and I drove
                        straight out at once and found the house of Mr. Sabatelli, a building partly
                        of lath and plaster and partly of wood, situated about eight yards from
                        ours, in flames, and the Fire Brigade already at work. Not withstanding the
                        light and inflammable nature of the building, after some two hoars of work
                        the fire was extinguished, part of the house and of its contents being
                        saved, and the fire prevented from spreading to the adjoining
                        buildings.—Yours faithfully,</p>

                    <p>AMERICAN FUTURES. - The Market this week has displayed great activity, and
                        prices have experienced a considerable advance, being at one time as much as
                        33 @ 35 points higher than those of last Thursday. This induced free
                        liquidation, and prices had a sharp reaction, but to-day’s dosing values are
                        only 3@ 5 points below the extreme rates touched. Bad Crop reports, with
                        greatly reduced estimates of the yield, coupled with heavy purchases to
                        cover by the “Bears,’’ and well maintained manipulation by the “Bulls” and
                        the withholding of the actual cotton in the South, are amongst the principal
                        causes of this rapid advance, amounting to nearly Id per lb in the last
                        three weeks. The Ginners’ report indicates. a far as one can judge, a yield
                        of about 10 1/2 millions, but the Bureau Report of the Crop, i.e., the
                        condition of the Crop which is to be issued to-morrow, is regarded with
                        greater interest, and will have a very important and immediate effect upon
                        the course of prices. It is impossible to forecast it, but general sentiment
                        is looking for higher prices. We are inclined to think that the serious
                        condition of the Crop is being exaggerated, and that present values discount
                        a great deal.</p>

                    <p>A sufficient number of replies having been received to the provisional
                        committee’s circular , to warrant the formation of the proposed new British
                        Club at Alexandria, a general meeting of those who had signified their
                        intention of joining was held at the Eastern Telegraph Company’s
                        headquarters last night. About sixty gentlemen responded. Admiral Sir Massie
                        Blomfield, R.N..K.C.M.G.,was voted to the chair, and addressed the meeting
                        as fellows:</p>



                    <p>“The printed circulars sent to yon by the provisional committee will have
                        sufficiently explained the object of our meeting this evening, and the
                        response to these circulars assures ns that oar view as to the demand for a
                        local British club at a low rate of annual subscription was not mistaken.
                        Before proceeding to the business on the agenda, I should like to explain
                        that the subscription was fixed at £ .10 0 per annum, because the committee
                        understood that that is the highest rate within the means of all the members
                        for whose benefit it is proposed to establish the club. This rate of
                        subscription having been made the basis of our appeal to you for the
                        formation of the club, cannot be increased except by a practical unanimous
                        vote of those who have responded in the affirmative, until the club is
                        properly constituted with a committee of management and established rules.
                        As the present number of members at £1.10 per annum is not likely to produce
                        a greater annual revenue than £300 per annum, whilst the annual donations
                        cannot be counted on for more than £100 per annum —making £400 in all—the
                        provisional committee can only recommend for your selection premises whose
                        annual rental will not exceed £200. As regards the furnishing expenses
                        guaranteed by us, the funds at present at the disposal of the committee, or
                        promised,amount to £500. It is obvious that, under such conditions, the club
                        most be started on an economical basis with modest pretensions ; but this
                        need not discourage us in our belief and hope that the club will progress
                        and prove a great boon to those for whose nee it is intended, by enabling
                        them to enjoy one another's society, and become better acquainted, in a home
                        of their own conducted by themselves on strict principles.’’</p>



                    <p>"We now come” (added the chairman)"to the first item of the agenda, the
                        election of a committee of management, and we have great pleasure in telling
                        you that the Earl of Cromer has done us the honor to accept the presidency
                        of the olnb.” This announcement was received with applause. The meeting then
                        proceeded to the election of two vice-presidents, and unanimously voted in
                        favor of Sir Massie Blomfield and Mr. E. B. Gould, 1.S.0.</p>



                    <p>A discussion subsequently took place as to the name which the club should
                        bear, and it was found to be the general feeling of the meeting that the
                        club should be known simply as the British Club. This led to some talk
                        regarding the definition of British, much of which was irrelevant, and
                        finally it was agreed to leave the question as to the class of British
                        subjects to be admitted to membership for the committee to decide.</p>



                    <p>Voting then took place for the members of the committee, the following eleven
                        gentlemen being elected : Messrs. J. Hughes, J. McGregor, W. J. B. Webb, G.
                        Morris, T. F. Donovan, W. P. Hughes, J E. Hewett, P. Leveaux, P. Corfield,
                        J. Davies Bryan and Waddington.</p>



                    <p>This committee of eleven will, daring the first three years’ existence of the
                        club, act in conjunction with the provisional committee, which has row
                        formed itself into a finance committee. It was felt that this was necessary,
                        on account of the latter's responsibility for the proper expenditure of the
                        donation fund.</p>



                    <p>Plans and estimates were submitted of various premises in the town suitable
                        for the headquarters of the club. It was stated that the club could not be
                        properly housed at a less rental than £250 per annum, and the committee
                        therefore suggested that the annual subscription should be raised from P T.
                        150 to P.T. 250, as the former subscription was not considered sufficient to
                        cover the estimated expenditure. A good deal of opposition was shown to this
                        proposal, and it was therefore rejected in favor of a proposal of Mr.
                        Chataway that the smaller sub cription should be given a trial for a year or

                    <head>SUEZ CANAL DETENTION. LARGE COMPENSATION CLAIM.</head>



                    <p>The recent block in the Suez Canal caused by the sinking of the steamer
                        ‘Chatham,” resulting in considerable delay to vessels using the waterway, is
                        at present creating much controversy in shipping circles.</p>



                    <p>At the instigation of the Leith Shipowners’ Society, the different steamship
                        associations throughout England have been circularised with a view to joint
                        action against the canal company for detention damage, variously estimated
                        at £80.000 to £100,000 What steps will finally be taken depends, of course,
                        upon the nature of the replies received. The opinion is, however, general
                        that compensation should be paid, although there is a disposition to regard
                        the claims as among those which should first be referred to the protecting
                        and indemnity associations, which, if necessary, could open op negotiations
                        with the company. It is also thought by some that, whilst the agitation may
                        possibly not result in redress for the recent detention, an arrangement
                        might be arrived at in the event of future delay.</p>



                    <p>This is the first time since the canal was opened that it has been found
                        necessary to blow up a wreck in the fairway, and it may easily be that
                        another thirty-six years will elapse before a second disaster of the kind
                        occurs ; but in the opinion of prominent shipowners, the company can hardly
                        wait till then to apply the lesson. Seeing that over 18,000,0 0 tons gross
                        of shipping pass through the canal every year, they think the time has
                        arrived when the construction of an alternative channel should be seriously
                        entertained.</p>



                    <p>Meanwhile it is interesting to note that, owing to the obstruction , the
                        traffic receipts of the company for October show an appreciable diminution
                        on the same month in 1904 and 1903, reducing the surplus acquired at the end
                        of September by over a million and a quarter francs. Three hundred and three
                        vessels passed through the canal in October this year as compared with 880
                        in the corresponding month 1904, and 336 in October 1908, the receipts being
                        8,900,00fr., 10,270,000fr.t and 9,440,000fr. respectively.</p>

                    <head>LORD CROMER AND GENERAL GORDON.</head>
                    <p>Lord Cromer has addressed the following letter to the "Times’’: </p>
                    <p>Sir,—My attention has been drawn to the following passage, which oocnrs in
                        Volume II., page 383. of Lord Edmond Fitzmanrioe's "Life of Lord Granville":
                        — </p>
                    <p>"General Gordon’s commission from the British Government and his
                        instruction,, which he revised himself, direoted him to make the removal of
                        the garrisons Lis immediate and principal care, and to report upon the best
                        means of doing this. On his arrival in Egypt his commission, after a
                        consultation with Nubar Pasha, the Prime Minister, and Sir Evelyn Baring,
                        was modified from one of a merely advisory oharaoter into an executive
                        commission, and be farther accepted a separate commission as
                        Governor-General of the Sudan from the Khedive. Both these steps were taken
                        with the approval of the Government at home; but a calm judgment will not
                        deny that the terms of the original oommission and of the commission as
                        Governor-General were difficult to reconcile altogether with each other;
                        that the latter were of dangerous latitude, and that to these ambiguities
                        most of the subsequent trouble is to be traced." </p>
                    <p>1 do not ooncurwith the view expressed by Lord Elmond Fitzmaurice in the
                        latter part of this paragraph. My opinion is that neither the instructions
                        issned in London, nor those issued in Cairo, affsoted to any considerable
                        extent the ooarse of subsequent events in the Sudan. The faot, however, that
                        so high an authority as Lord Elmond Fitimanrioe should have expressed the
                        opinion I have quoted above, renders it desirable that the facts con- nected
                        with the iisue of General Gordon's n-troc'iona shoal 1 befiFy and
                        accurately, stated. This, so far as I am aware, has never yet been done. </p>
                    <p>The original iastructiors issued in London to General Gordon on January 18,
                        1834, ware that he was "to consider and report npen the best mode of
                        effecting the evacuation of tbe interior of the Sudan.” These instructions,
                        as Sir Charles Dilke explained at tbe time in tbe House of Commons, wore
                        oracticslly drafted by General Gordon himself. It has been very ge- nerally
                        supposed that the initiative in changing those instructions came
                        fromCairo.and that the Government of the day somewhat reluotantly approved
                        of them subsequent to their issue. Some oolour is, indeed, given to this
                        view of the oase from the following passage, which is contained in a
                        despatch addressed to me by Lord Granville on March 28, 1884 : — </p>
                    <p>"Her Msjssty’s Govornmen t, boaring in mind the exigencies of the case,
                        conourred in theso instructions, which virtually altored General Gordon's
                        commission from one of advice to that of executing, or at least directing,
                        tbe evacua- tion not only of Khattoum, but of the whole Sudan, and they ware
                        willing that General Gordon should revive the very extended powers conferred
                        upon him by the Khedive to enable him to effect his difficult task. [Egypt
                        Ho. 13 (1884), page 5.]" </p>
                    <p>The trne facta of the case are, that although 1 fully concurred in the
                        alteration of the in- structions, the proposal to alter them did not emanate
                        from myself, nor, indeed, from any one in Cairo. On page 4 of "Eqrpt No.
                        2(1884)," the followiog brief despatoh.addreesed to me by Lord Granville on
                        January 22—that is to say, whilst General Gordon was travelling from London
                        to Cairo—is given : — </p>
                    <p>"I enclose herewith a paper containing some suggestions made by General
                        Gordon aa to the steps which should be taken with regard to the present
                        state of affairs in the Sudan. </p>
                    <p>“Her Majesty^Government have not suffi- cient local knowledge to enable them
                        to form an opinion aa to the practicability of these suggestions, and I
                        therefore authorise you, aa time is valuable, either immediately to mike the
                        arrangements suggested, or to await Gene- ral Gordon’s arrival and oonsnlt
                        with him as to the aotion to be taken. [Subetanoe telegra- phed.]’’ </p>
                    <p>It will be observed that, although allusion is made to General Gordon’s
                        suggrx’ions, the suggestions themselves were not included in the
                        Parliamentary paper. They were, as a mat- ter of fact, six in nomber. I need
                        here only allnde to two of them. </p>
                    <p>Tbe first was that theKhedive should israe a deoree 'To the Peoples of the
                        Sudan,” in which the followiog paecage occurred :— </p>
                    <p>"I have commissioned General Gordon, late Governor General of the 8udan, to
                        proceed there as my representative and to arrange with yon for the
                        evacuation of the country and the withdrawal of my troops. Her Ma- jesty’s
                        Government, being most des roua of your we'fare, have also appointed General
                        Gordon as their commissioner for the same purpose. General Gordon is hereby
                        appointed Governor-General for the time necestary to aooomplirh evacuation." </p>
                    <p>The second suggestion was that a proclama- tion, si7ned by General Gordon,
                        should )e issned 'To the People) of the Sudan,” in which the following
                        passage occurred :— </p>
                    <p>“I have accepted tbe post of Governor-Gt ne- ral of tbe Sudan." </p>
                    <p>As, when I received Lord Granville’s aotho risation to aot on General
                        Gordon’s sugges- tions, Ge. eral Gordon himself was about to arrive in
                        Cairo, I delayed aotion until I oonld have tbe advantage of discussing the
                        matter with him. The result was the issue of tbe fresh instructions, under,
                        which General Gordon was appointed Governor-General of th* Sudan. It
                        appeared to me at the time that, in view of the telegram dated January 22. I
                        had every right to suppose that her Majesty’> Government agreed to altering
                        General Gor- don’s functions in a sense which woold render them ex ecu tire,
                        and no longer "merely ad- visory." </p>
                    <p>I also take this opportunity of correcting an error in Lord Edmond
                        Pitxmaorioe’s very interesting work. On page 270, Volome II., it is stated
                        that, on the oocasion of M. de Freyoinet'a resignation in July, 1P82, I
                        "said to M. Raverseaux, the French Consol General in Egypt, on hearing the
                        news, 'Ton are a strange people. . . . Yon do not wait for os to ask yon for
                        something ; you bring it to os yourselves.' ’’ </p>
                    <p>This statement, I understand from a foot- note, is made on the authority of
                        M. Alfred Rambaud. I never made any inch statement as that attributed to me.
                        Indeed, I oould not have done so, for at that time Sir Edward Malet was the
                        diplomatio representative oi Great Britain in Bgypt. I was in India, where I
                        oooupied the post of Financial Member of the Govemor-Geoeral's Council. I
                        did not arrive in Cairo to take up the post of Agent and Consol-General
                        until early in September, 1883. I may further observe that at that time M.
                        de Vorges was the French Consul-General in Bgypt The Msrqois de Revereeaox
                        was not appointed until April 20,1891—that is to say, nearly nine years
                        after the remark attributed to me by M. Rimbaud is alleged to have been
                        made. </p>
                    <p>I have reosived permisa:on from the Secre- tary of State for Foreign Affairs
                        to publish this letter. </p>

                    <p>New York, Nov. 8.</p>
                    <p>The Legislative Insurance Investigation Committee to-day resumed its
                        sittings. </p>
                    <p>Mr. McClintock, actuary of the Mutual Life Insnrancs Company rf New York, in
                        response to Mr. Hughes, counsel for the ciroroittee, who questioned him
                        closely as to how tbe divideudi wore apportioned, explained that the
                        dividends for 1904 were determined in November, 1903, before the earnings
                        for 1904 were knowo. There was no assumed amount of increase taken into
                        account, and tbe dividends were arrived at by consideration of tbe gonera1
                        ran of business. Asked why tbe company did not give more dividends, as it
                        oould have afforded to do ao, witness said that the rate was fix’d with due
                        regard to the circnmstanoes ot tho company. </p>
                    <p>Witness said that but $5,168,698 (£1,033,739) were available in 1901 to pay
                        the amount of 89,830,753 (£1,968,150), the coat of the new business, and the
                        old policy holders paid the balance. </p>
                    <p>Mr. McClintock submitted a statement showing that the earnings of the oompany
                        for the five years from 1900 to 1901 amounted to 331,238,440 (£3,257, 6*8),
                        and that meanwhile the dividends amounted only to 312,828,883 (£2,5*5,776)
                        Mr. McClintock said that 20 percent, was the ratio in 1304 of expanse to
                        total income of the Mutual Life Insurance Company, and that this was also
                        true of tbe Equitable and New York Life Insurance Companies, whereas the
                        ratio in the case of smaller companies was ranch lower, being even 13 per
                        cent Forty-nine per oenti was the ratio of expense to the amonot paid to tbe
                        policy holders of tbe Mutual and New York Compa- nies, while the ratio of
                        the Equitable Com- pany was 43, bot that of smaller oompanies was as low aa
                        29. </p>

                    <p>The Bank Rate.</p>
                    <p>The week under review, as regards Stock Exchange doings, can only be
                        described as having been distinctly dull. The transactions in the money
                        market have shown that the Bank rate is still proving effective, and, as was
                        anticipated, no change was made yester- day, the rate remaining at 4%. The
                        Bank ret am for tbe week shows an inr ease in the reserve of £656,000,
                        making a total of £21,497,000, the proportion of reserve to liabilities
                        having ruon in oonseqnenoe 1)% to 40%. It is now believed that the whole of
                        the £1,000,000 in sovereigns, which left Bombay on the 4th inst and is dne
                        at Port Said next Monday, will oome on to London, the Egyptian demand being
                        satisfied. As against this, however, fresh withdrawals for Constantinople
                        are anticipated, and £200,000 is expeoted to leave here to-dey for the
                        Tarlrish Capital. </p>
                    <p>Russian disorders and the Markets.</p>
                    <p>The daily reports of farther Rassian disor- ders have had a depressing effeot
                        hero, and although it is thoughbin well-informed quarters that some daylight
                        is to be seen through the gloom and that there are alight signs of an
                        improved state of sflaira, still some time mast ' elapse before matters can
                        settle down and warrant any serions attempt on the part of Continental
                        bankers to reopen negotiations for a farther Rossian loan. </p>
                    <p>Gilt-Edged Stocks.</p>
                    <p>Consols and other gilt-edged investment stocks seem, to a certain extent, to
                        have cat themselves adrift from the ioflaenoe of Rassian . affairs this past
                        week. From all appearances I it would seem there is not a plentitnde of
                        first-olass securities on offer, and the money released by the repayment by
                        some of tbe Canadian Government stocks has tended to keep tbe gilt-edged
                        market firm in consequeice. Consols leave off to-night at 88 3/4. </p>
                    <p>Foreign Government Securities.</p>
                    <p>There was a report bore yesterday that ; Count Witte had been assassinated,
                        and whilst i not credited the statement did not tend to improve matters in
                        the general market. Ros- sian stocks were lower and close to-night at 89. As
                        regards Japanese, tbe conversion scheme is still nnder discussion, and it is
                        , believed that, when there are the least signs ol improvement in the
                        outlook, this will be effeoted. Japanese bonds have been influenced by the
                        general doll tendency and close to-night at 96 3/4. </p>
                    <p>Rails</p>
                    <p>In the market for home rails a good basin ess has again been done. The favor-
                        able Board of Trade retnms have farther emphasised the oontinned prosperity
                        of the country, which, of oonrse, means increased earnings for the railways.
                        The Amsrioan market has been more or leu interfered with owing to the New
                        York Mayoralty eleotion, and aa a result prioes weakened, and some stocks
                        showed a sharp fall. They, however, olose to-night at their best. </p>
                    <p>Egyptians.</p>
                    <p>There hu been more doing in the Egyptian market daring tbe week. A large
                        advance was recorded in Daira Deferred, which have been booght by good
                        people. The closing price to-night is 111-13 with few sellers about, this
                        being a rise of from four to six points sinoe onr last. The ordinal) shares
                        have also been a good market and have been np to 18 &amp; buyers bat close
                        distinctly easier at 18 1/8. </p>
                    <p>The iune of the Bank of Abyssinia hu been well reoeived, and tbe shares have
                        been dealt in at 2} premium. They have gradually sagged away, however, and
                        olose to-night at )-] nremiom. </p>
                    <p>Union Fonciere have been firm at 1} premium, and should improve on this
                        prion. National Banks 'have fluctuated between 26j and 26) and they olose at
                        the latter price </p>
                    <p>There are strong buyers of the last issne at 6 j premium, bnt there are no
                        sellers at anything like this figure. Agricultural Banks are quoted 9| with
                        hardly any bnsinees passing. Delta Land and Investment keep study at 9 J and
                        Delta Light Railway Pref. at 19 }. Kbedivial Mail Stumship Co. have again
                        bun enquired for at 1, bnt there are no eeflers at this price. Egvptian Salt
                        and 8od* have advanced to 1 ] buyers. There is nothing to report regarding
                        the lower-prioed shares. </p>
                    <p>Anglo-Egyptian Bank's profits.</p>
                    <p>The report of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank for the year ended August 31, is a very
                        satis- factory one and will be welcomed by the shareholders. After providing
                        for all bad debts and contingencies snd deducting ex- pense* there is a net
                        profit of £116,108, to which must be added £15,000 carried forward, making a
                        total profit of £180,V 8. The direc- tors propoee to plaoe £1,608 to tbe
                        staff provi- dent fand, and, after providing for interim dividend at 10 %
                        per annum and a dividend of 16 % per annum, to be paid on Deo. 1, to
                        transfer £80,000 to pension reserve fond, and to oarry £36,000 forward. </p>
                    <p>Mining.</p>
                    <p>The mining market hu also to an extant been affeoted by events in Russia, and
                        in many of the Sooth Afrioan stooks lower priou have been reoorded. There hu
                        boon little doing in the Egyptian section. Bgyptian Minu are slightly weaker
                        at 13s.8d, but United Afrioans have hardened to 1) bid. </p>
