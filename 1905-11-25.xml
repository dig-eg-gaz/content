                    <p>It is understood that the Cabinet has decid- ed not to resign.</p>
                    <p>The meeting of the Cabinet lasted two hours. It is stated that the decision
                        of the Government was largely influenced by the knowledge that the Liberals
                        would not accept office prior to disoIution, and, therefore, until
                        Parliament meets again, it defers resigning or dissolving for a few weeks,
                        thus avoiding at the same time an election at Christmastide and the
                        neceisity of a shortlived interim government.</p>
                    <p><persName>Mr. Balfour</persName> has left town until Monday. He is not going
                        to Sandringham. The Cabinet will meet again on the 1st proximo. (Reuter)</p>

                    <p>Speaking at Stirling, Sir Henry Campbell- Bannerman openly declared himself
                        as being in favor of Home Rule for Ireland, saying that his conviction on
                        this matter was stronger than ever. He advised the Nationalists, how- ever,
                        to accept any instalment of representative control that might be offered,
                        provided that it led up to a larger policy.</p>
                    <p>The newspapers continue to take Mr. Bal- four's resignation for granted. The
                        “Morning Post” says that Mr. Chamberlain and not Mr. Baltour will lead the
                        Unionists at the elections. (Reuter)</p>

                    <p>Lord Lansdowne, speaking here, said that the most-favored nation clause has
                        become obsolete, and Great Britain must rely more upon contracts and
                        bargains in which her interests are specially provided for.</p>
                    <p>He gave as an instance the new treaty with Persia replacing the old
                        favored-nation arrange- ment. lf there should be any tampering with the
                        Persian tariff in future, Great Britain will have to be consulted first.

                        Judge Eeman in the Mixed Civil Court at Alexandria. This was an appeal
                        against the judgment of the Mixed Summary Court, which we published a few
                        weeks ago. The appellant has purchased the building and site known as the
                        Hotel d’Amerique at Alexandria from Mr. Selim Sabounghi, and brought an
                        action against Mrs. Rosina di Bella, the tenant, for resiliation of her
                        lease on the grounds that she had need the hotel for improper purposes
                        although it was specified in the contract that it should simply be need as
                        an hotel-restaurant.</p>
                    <p>Maltre Levi Cuzzer on behalf of Mr. Adda declared that the Hotel d’Amerique
                        was a public scandal, and protested against the judg- ment of the Summary
                        Court.</p>
                    <p>Maltre Guidotti, on behalf of Mrs. Rosina di Bella, declared that Mr. Adda
                        had asked £175 per annum from his client as a permit for her to renew the
                        contract for the hotel. The lady in question had agreed to pay £110 per
                        annum instead of £80, as arranged in the existing contract, which ends on
                        31st Jannary, 1907. But as she would not pay more than £110 the appellant
                        said he would oblige her to quit.</p>
                    <p>Judgment will be given shortly.</p>

                    <p>When the Government decided on the abolition of the salt monopoly it became

                        assure a regular supply of the article. On the one hand, the Government was
                        desirous in the interests of all classes of the population and especially of
                        the poorest, to ma- terially reduce the price of salt to the consumer. On

                        continue to supply the public better than any one else.</p>

                        to a six months' notice, and the monopoly ceases and determines on the 1st
                        January next, when the retail price of salt will be reduced from 5 milliemes
                        to 2 milliemes, while the Government on its part undertakes not to exploit
                        its own salines, or to let them to others, for the space of six years. The
                        poor will be free to piok np salt in the desert; but in order to avoid
                        abuses it may be necessary to guard the more important salines, which will
                        be done at the company’s expense.</p>
                    <p>By this arrangement it is hoped that not only will salt in Egypt be as cheap
                        as any- where else in the world, but that no material injury will be done to
                        the interests of the company whose shares are so largely held in this
                        country.</p>

                    <head>SHIP ON FIRE IN PORT.</head>
                    <head type="sub">BEACHED NEAR BREAKWATER.</head>
                    <p>The S.S. Sardinia, of the Ellerman Line, which had just sent her redder
                        ashore for repairs by Messrs. Watson &amp; Co., was observed to be on fire
                        in her forehold, stowed with cotton and rice, soon after noon yesterday. No
                        flames were visible, but smoke was issuing from the port side through the
                        ventilator cowl.</p>
                    <p>The ship was at once towed to the qua- rantine anchorage in the outer
                        harbour, having the port steam fire-float , alongside. By 6 p.m., the smoke
                        had ceased to issue after two hours incessant pumping, and it was hoped that
                        the fire had been subdued. But, by 8 p.m. the smoke burst forth again and
                        the pomps were set to work.</p>
                    <p>At 10 a.m. to-day it was decided to put the ship ashore on the bank under the
                        breakwater, so that the hold might be filled with water without risk of the
                        ship going down or turn- ing over, as she had a great list to starboard and
                        her boiler fires were on the point of being extinguished. This was being
                        effected at 11a.m.</p>
                    <p>The cause of the fire is unknown.</p>

                    <head>THE SUCRERIES.</head>
                    <p>The report of the experts, and especially their criticism of the proposals of
                        the con- trollers appointed under the concordat pre- ventif, has given rise
                        to considerable discussion. The opinion is held in some circles that from
                        the point of view of the shareholders a de- claration of bankruptcy will be
                        the best solu- tion of the difficulty. Experts take the line that to speak
                        of the financial reconstruction of the Sucreries is all very well in its
                        way, but that all must depend on the question whether the sugar industry can
                        in future be carried on at a profit. To sell the railways would only hasten
                        the catastrophe, for they are essential to the economic working of the
                        industry. The controllers have, no doubt, submitted their answer to the
                        criticism of the experts to the juge-commissaire, which should prove highly
                        interesting. Meantime the shareholders are about to meet this afternoon, and
                        what their attitude will be, after Thursday's meeting of creditors and the
                        reading of the reports of the experts, is a most interesting problem.</p>

                    <p>The homeward bound Messageries Maritimes mail steamer Ofeanien arrived at
                        Suez on Wednesday with a broken shaft. She was moored shortly after in the
                        Port Ibrahim basin, in order to land the mails and passengers. The latter
                        left Suez at 8.30 yesterday evening by special train for Alexandria, where
                        they were transferred to the company's steamer at that port for conveyance
                        to Marseilles.</p>
                    <p>As the Caledonian is too long for the dry- dock at Suez she will be towed
                        to-morrow to Port Said by the Canal Company's tug Titan, and thence to
                        Marseilles by one of the com- pany’s steamers.</p>

                    <head type="sub">AMALGAMATION WITH ANGLO-AMERICAN.</head>
                    <p>The negotiations between the Anglo-Ameri- can Nile Steamer and Hotel Company
                        and the Hamburg-Amerika Steamships Company have ended satisfactorily, and
                        the contract has just been signed. The terms of the amalgamation are in
                        every way satisfactory to both parties concerned and this morning the shares
                        of the Anglo-American Company conse- quently advanced rapidly and closed at
                        5 7/8.</p>
                    <p>It is some time ago since Egypt learnt that the Hamburg-Amerika Steamship
                        Company was desirous of starting a Nile steamer ser- vice and at first it
                        was understood that the venture would be made independently of the companies
                        already established, notably Messrs. Thomas Cook and Son, and the company
                        with which they have just come to terms. Some agitation was evinced and the
                        opinion was expressed in some quarters that German en- terprise should not
                        be allowed the opportu- nity of ousting those companies which had a prior
                        right. The matter was taken np in London, and questions were asked in
                        Parlia- ment, hot, as is so often the case, no definite answer either
                        satisfactory or otherwise was vouchsafed.</p>
                    <p>Shortly afterwards it was rumoured that the conditions under which Nile
                        traffic is car- ried on were to be changed, and that the changes would in
                        all probability deter any would-be interloper from entering into competi-
                        tion with the established companies. Then we learnt that negotiations for
                        the amalgamation of the Hamburg-Amerika line with the Anglo- American were
                        pending,and later that arrange- ments bad been made for meetings between the
                        directors of the two companies at Paris or Berlin. We have more than once
                        prophesied the result of these negotiations, and our anti- cipations now
                        appear to have been well-founded.</p>
                    <p>The Anglo-American line is well-known and is yearly making rapid strides;
                        strengthened by the valuable support of the Hamburg- Amerika Company, with
                        the concomitant addition to its capital and consequent increase of its
                        fleet, it cannot fail to progress still more rapidly. What with the yearly
                        increase of Nile traffic there is plenty of scope for two such lines as
                        Messrs. Thomas Cook &amp; Son and the new amalgamation, and we have every
                        hope of seeing a continued improvement in the already excellent service,
                        without either party suffering from the inevitable but healthy competition
                        of its rival.</p>
