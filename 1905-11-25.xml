                            <p>It is understood that the Cabinet has decided not to resign.</p>
                            <p>The meeting of the Cabinet lasted two hours. It is stated that the
                                decision of the Government was largely influenced by the knowledge
                                that the Liberals would not accept office prior to disoIution, and,
                                therefore, until Parliament meets again, it defers resigning or
                                dissolving for a few weeks, thus avoiding at the same time an
                                election at Christmastide and the neceisity of a shortlived interim
                                government.</p>
                            <p><persName>Mr. Balfour</persName> has left town until Monday. He is
                                not going to Sandringham. The Cabinet will meet again on the 1st
                                proximo. (Reuter)</p>

                            <p>Speaking at Stirling, Sir Henry Campbell- Bannerman openly declared
                                himself as being in favor of Home Rule for Ireland, saying that his
                                conviction on this matter was stronger than ever. He advised the
                                Nationalists, how- ever, to accept any instalment of representative
                                control that might be offered, provided that it led up to a larger
                                policy.</p>
                            <p>The newspapers continue to take Mr. Bal- four's resignation for
                                granted. The "Morning Post" says that Mr. Chamberlain and not Mr.
                                Baltour will lead the Unionists at the elections. (Reuter)</p>

                            <p>Lord Lansdowne, speaking here, said that the most-favored nation
                                clause has become obsolete, and Great Britain must rely more upon
                                contracts and bargains in which her interests are specially provided

                                the Persian tariff in future, Great Britain will have to be

                    <head>HOTEL D'AMERIQUE.</head>
                    <p>This morning the case of Adda v. Rosins di Bella came on for hearing before
                        Judge Eeman in the Mixed Civil Court at Alexandria. This was an appeal
                        against the judgment of the Mixed Summary Court, which we published a few
                        weeks ago. The appellant has purchased the building and site known as the
                        Hotel d'Amerique at Alexandria from Mr. Selim Sabounghi, and brought an
                        action against Mrs. Rosina di Bella, the tenant, for resiliation of her
                        lease on the grounds that she had need the hotel for improper purposes
                        although it was specified in the contract that it should simply be need as
                        an hotel-restaurant.</p>
                    <p>Maltre Levi Cuzzer on behalf of Mr. Adda declared that the Hotel d'Amerique
                        was a public scandal, and protested against the judg- ment of the Summary
                        Court.</p>
                    <p>Maltre Guidotti, on behalf of Mrs. Rosina di Bella, declared that Mr. Adda
                        had asked £175 per annum from his client as a permit for her to renew the
                        contract for the hotel. The lady in question had agreed to pay £110 per
                        annum instead of £80, as arranged in the existing contract, which ends on
                        31st Jannary, 1907. But as she would not pay more than £110 the appellant
                        said he would oblige her to quit.</p>
                    <p>Judgment will be given shortly.</p>

                    <head>THE SALT MONOPOLY</head>
                    <head type="sub">THE NEW AGREEMENT.</head>
                    <p>When the Government decided on the abolition of the salt monopoly it became
                        neces- sary at the same time to settle the line of future policy in order to
                        assure a regular supply of the article. On the one hand, the Government was
                        desirous in the interests of all classes of the population and especially of
                        the poorest, to ma- terially reduce the price of salt to the consumer. On
                        the other hand it was reluctant to cause any unnecessary crisis in the
                        affairs of the Salt &amp; Soda Company, by the too abrupt termination of the
                        monopoly which it has hitherto enjoyed, more especially as it believed that
                        the com- pany, with its expenses and wide organisation, was in a position to
                        continue to supply the public better than any one else.</p>
                    <p>Under the agreement which has been arrived at, the company waives its right
                        to a six months' notice, and the monopoly ceases and determines on the 1st
                        January next, when the retail price of salt will be reduced from 5 milliemes
                        to 2 milliemes, while the Government on its part undertakes not to exploit
                        its own salines, or to let them to others, for the space of six years. The
                        poor will be free to piok up salt in the desert; but in order to avoid
                        abuses it may be necessary to guard the more important salines, which will
                        be done at the company's expense.</p>
                    <p>By this arrangement it is hoped that not only will salt in Egypt be as cheap
                        as any- where else in the world, but that no material injury will be done to
                        the interests of the company whose shares are so largely held in this
                        country.</p>

                        in her forehold, stowed with cotton and rice, soon after noon yesterday. No
                        flames were visible, but smoke was issuing from the port side through the
                        ventilator cowl.</p>
                    <p>The ship was at once towed to the qua- rantine anchorage in the outer
                        harbour, having the port steam fire-float , alongside. By 6 p.m., the smoke
                        had ceased to issue after two hours incessant pumping, and it was hoped that
                        the fire had been subdued. But, by 8 p.m. the smoke burst forth again and
                        the pomps were set to work.</p>
                    <p>At 10 a.m. to-day it was decided to put the ship ashore on the bank under the
                        breakwater, so that the hold might be filled with water without risk of the
                        ship going down or turning over, as she had a great list to starboard and
                        her boiler fires were on the point of being extinguished. This was being
                        effected at 11a.m.</p>

                    <head>THE SUCRERIES.</head>
                    <p>The report of the experts, and especially their criticism of the proposals of
                        the con- trollers appointed under the concordat pre- ventif, has given rise
                        to considerable discussion. The opinion is held in some circles that from
                        the point of view of the shareholders a de- claration of bankruptcy will be
                        the best solu- tion of the difficulty. Experts take the line that to speak
                        of the financial reconstruction of the Sucreries is all very well in its
                        way, but that all must depend on the question whether the sugar industry can
                        in future be carried on at a profit. To sell the railways would only hasten
                        the catastrophe, for they are essential to the economic working of the
                        industry. The controllers have, no doubt, submitted their answer to the
                        criticism of the experts to the juge-commissaire, which should prove highly
                        interesting. Meantime the shareholders are about to meet this afternoon, and
                        what their attitude will be, after Thursday's meeting of creditors and the
                        reading of the reports of the experts, is a most interesting problem.</p>

                    <head type="sub">AMALGAMATION WITH ANGLO-AMERICAN.</head>
                    <p>The negotiations between the Anglo-Ameri- can Nile Steamer and Hotel Company
                        and the Hamburg-Amerika Steamships Company have ended satisfactorily, and
                        the contract has just been signed. The terms of the amalgamation are in
                        every way satisfactory to both parties concerned and this morning the shares
                        of the Anglo-American Company conse- quently advanced rapidly and closed at
                        5 7/8.</p>
                    <p>It is some time ago since Egypt learnt that the Hamburg-Amerika Steamship
                        Company was desirous of starting a Nile steamer ser- vice and at first it
                        was understood that the venture would be made independently of the companies
                        already established, notably Messrs. Thomas Cook and Son, and the company
                        with which they have just come to terms. Some agitation was evinced and the
                        opinion was expressed in some quarters that German en- terprise should not
                        be allowed the opportu- nity of ousting those companies which had a prior
                        right. The matter was taken up in London, and questions were asked in
                        Parlia- ment, hot, as is so often the case, no definite answer either
                        satisfactory or otherwise was vouchsafed.</p>
                    <p>Shortly afterwards it was rumoured that the conditions under which Nile
                        traffic is car- ried on were to be changed, and that the changes would in
                        all probability deter any would-be interloper from entering into competi-
                        tion with the established companies. Then we learnt that negotiations for
                        the amalgamation of the Hamburg-Amerika line with the Anglo- American were
                        pending,and later that arrange- ments bad been made for meetings between the
                        directors of the two companies at Paris or Berlin. We have more than once
                        prophesied the result of these negotiations, and our anti- cipations now
                        appear to have been well-founded.</p>
                    <p>The Anglo-American line is well-known and is yearly making rapid strides;
                        strengthened by the valuable support of the Hamburg- Amerika Company, with
                        the concomitant addition to its capital and consequent increase of its
                        fleet, it cannot fail to progress still more rapidly. What with the yearly
                        increase of Nile traffic there is plenty of scope for two such lines as
                        Messrs. Thomas Cook &amp; Son and the new amalgamation, and we have every
                        hope of seeing a continued improvement in the already excellent service,
                        without either party suffering from the inevitable but healthy competition
                        of its rival.</p>

                    <p>General Lord Grenfell daring his extended military service in Egypt, which
                        commenced in 1882 and ended with his command of the Egyptian forces in 1898,
                        made an interesting collection of antiquities. This collection he has now
                        lent to the Dahlia Museum. It includes a bronze head of the cat-headed
                        goddess Pasht, and a funeral likeness which illustrates the art of
                        portrait-painting twenty centuries ago.</p>

                    <p>The late British representative on the Public Debt Commission at Cairo is

                        Charles Hardinge is absent from his post at St. Petersburg, for the
                        furtherance, it is surmised, of an understanding between England and Russia,
                        Mr. Cecil Edward Spring- Rice, the First Secretary, in charge of affairs in
                        the Russian capital, has bean arranging for the protection of British
                        subjects there in the untoward event of civil commotion. Mr. Spring- Rice
                        may possibly find himself in charge during an exciting time. St. Petersburg
                        is, or shortly will be, closed to ships by ice, and till the other day, the
                        only line of railway that was working was the St. Petersburg-Moscow
                        line.</p>
                    <p>Mr Spring Rice is the grandson of the first Lord Monteagle, and was, last
                        year, married to Miss Lascelles, the daughter of Sir Prank, and the charming
                        maitresse de ceans of her father's Embassy. Her mother was the daughter of
                        Sir James Olliffe, M.D., a practitioner very much in favor, and in fashion,
                        in the Paris of the Second Empire.</p>

                    <p>Coton</p>
                    <p>La fait capital de la semaine, et en même temps le plus intéressant, a été
                        sans contredit le Rapport du Census Bureau, nous donnant Balles 7,494,000
                        comme égrenées au 14 No- vembre, contre Balles 9,906,000 l'année der nière à
                        la même date. Le chiffre pour la récolte, sensiblement inférieur à tous les
                        pronostics qui étaient entre B. 8,200,000 et 7,800,000, a naturellement
                        bouleversé toutes les idées et renversé tous les échafaudages, et il est
                        aisé de s'expliquer l'impression profonde qu'il a produite: De quelque façon
                        qu'on l'étudie, avec les données incomplètes que nous avons jus- qu'ici, et
                        quelle que soit l'année que l'on choisisse pour point de comparaison,les
                        faiseurs de proportions arrivent, comme résultat do leurs calculs, à
                        10,300,000 Balles, ou à peu près, comme récolte aux Etats-Unis pour la
                        campagne 1905-1906.-Dans tous les cas, que ces comptes soient justes on non,
                        le fait maté- riel est que l'opinion générale en Amérique semble être pour
                        10 1/4 millions et la preuve en est que New-York et New-Orleans ont traduit
                        leur croyance en une pareille évaluation par une hausse soudaine de 80 à 90
                        points.</p>
                    <p>Il y a bien aussi en cours quelques estima- tions allant jaeqd'à 9 3/4
                        millions de balles, mais pour le moment elles n'ont pas été prises en
                        considération.</p>
                    <p>Liverpool n'a pas montré de prime abord autant d'entrainement que les marchés
                        améri- cains, mais il doit y avoir certainement eu des réalisations qui ont
                        pesé au début et retardé jusqu'à la fin de la journée la mise à parité de
                        ses cours avec ceux de New-York.</p>
                    <p>Maintenant, pour ce qui est de l'effet de ces nouvelles sur notre marché, il
                        se résume tout simplement en une hausse de 3/4 de tallari pour la journée
                        même, hausse arrivée jaste à temps pour relever le moral des détenteurs de
                        contrats et nous éviter peut-être un mouve- ment exagéré de baisse, qui au
                        fond n'aurait été que le contre-coup des agissements précé- dents de la
                        spéculation dans le sens inverse. En effet, malgré la reprise da Mars en
                        elôture de mardi à 14 7/8-sur les achats du commerce que la chûte à 14
                        19/33, provoquée par les ventes des haussiers et les manoeuvres des
                        baissiers dans les journées de lundi et de mardi, avait attirés,-la tendance
                        chez nous, à la veille du rapport susmentionné, était très mauvaise et
                        restait franchement pour la baisse. A partir du maximum de 15 5/8 pour le
                        Mars, attaint dans la journée de mercredi, les fluctuations chez nous ont
                        été constantes et parfois marquées, mais en somme comme finale, c'est le
                        cours de 15 7/16 qui est affiché au tableau ce soir, soit 3/16 de réaction
                        du plus haut et 15/32 d'avance acquise sur ven- dredi dernier. Cela indique
                        tout au moins de la modération de notre part, car dans le même laps de temps
                        les cotons américains ont gagné de 85 à 90 points.</p>
                    <p>A New-York on a cherché à ergoter sur les chiffres du Census Bureau en disant
                        qu'il y avait 1300 égreneurs qui n'avaient pas réponda; mais, malgré tous
                        leurs dires, les intéressés à la baisse semblent être en train Ide profiter
                        des dispositions des haussiers réalisant leurs bénéfices pour se couvrir.
                        Mais, même en admettant que los quelques asser- tions des intéressés à la
                        baisse soient vraies, les opinions isolées ne peuvent avoir beau- coup de
                        poids, surtout qu'aujourd'hui la très grande majorité du monde cotonnier en
                        Amé- rique, et ailleurs peut-être, est convainone de la hausse ou du
                        maintien des prix. Certes le niveau de 6 pence escompte beau- coup de
                        choses, mais avec un appui com- me celui que les haussiers viennent d'a-
                        voir, le champ ne reste-t-il pas ouvert anx manipulations de la spéculation?
                        Et si au bout du compte la récolte devait res- sortir supérieure à ce que
                        l'on peut actuelle- ment prévoir, le jour où l'on pourra le consta- ter est
                        encore loin et d'ici là que de manoen- vres peuvent être faites! N'oublions
                        pas aussi le point principal, a.a.d. que l'industrie coton- nière marche
                        cette année vent arrière et que les 6 pence n'ont pas l'air de
                        l'effrayer.</p>
                    <p>Nous ne faisons pas ces réflexions pour pré- coniser la hausse, mais à notre
                        avis et quoique notre opinion ne vaille pas plus que celle d'un satre, lés
                        idées de baisse dépassant les limite de simples réactions ordinaires
                        devraient être mises de côté jusqu'à nouvel ordre.</p>
                    <p>Et pour revenir à notre marché, nous diron que l'activité y est assez
                        satisfaisante, quoique intermittente; des baissiers se sont retiré pour
                        faire place à d'autres vendeurs, mais an fond l'acheteur se trouve en
                        général en face d la marchandise réelle et cela l'empêche de fair ce qu'il
                        voudrait, d'autant plus qu'il n'est pas le plus fort. Cela n'est pas un mal,
                        car cette modération, forcée ou non, est de nature à faciliter l'écoulement
                        de notre récolte.</p>
                    <p>Le marché da disponible a laissé à désirer: Faible au débat et se prêtant
                        beaucoup à la pression des acheteurs qui cherchaient à pro fiter des
                        circonstances, il a naturellement fi par se raffermir; mais, fait curieux à
                        relever, la cote n'a pas varié de beaucoup, le Mit Affi le plus directement
                        sujet aux changement dans les contrata, n'ayant haussé que de tallari,
                        tandis que les autres genres sont au même niveau qu'il y a huit jours.</p>
                    <p>d</p>
                    <p>Les Domaines n'ont pas eu d'enchères catte semaine, faute de marchandise
                        disponibler quantité suffisante à offrir à la vente. Probs blement jeudi
                        prochain aura lieu l'avant dernière enchère de la saison.</p>
                    <p>Les exportations ont dépassé un peu les pré visions et le chiffre de l'année
                        dernière, mais il est probable qu'à cause des fêtes du Bairam, les
                        changements de la semaine prochaine feron disparaitre le surplus de cantars
                        24,000 que l'on constate à ce jour. Quant au reste du mon vement, il est
                        satisfaisant et commence à être</p>
                    <p>en rapport avec la récolte.. Les arrivages jas- qu'ici sont de Cantars 65,000
                        au-dessus de ceux de l'année dernière et le stock ne présente plus qu'an
                        déficit de Canters 22,000.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>Etant sur ce chapitre, nous croyons devoir faire remarquer que le mouvement
                        de la récolte américaine est en opposition flagrante avec les petites
                        estimations; si les choses ne changent pas sous peu, c'est-à-dire s'il n'y a
                        pas réduction sensible dans les recettes à partir de Décembre, comme cela a
                        été le cas il y a deux ans, le fait pourrait avoir son influence sur le
                        marché.</p>
                    <p>Liverpool a de nouveau été peu propice à nos cotons: les ventes n'ont pas eu
                        d'impor- tance et, malgré tout, le disponible, après une amélioration
                        passagère, y revient à son point de départ, soit 8 pour le fully good fair.
                        Et pour ce qui est du livrable, il n'y a que 6/64 de hausse, contre le
                        demi-tallari gagné chez nous par les contrats.</p>
                    <p>On n'y a pas été bien chaud non plus pour les américains, mais en somme
                        ceux-ci ont suivi de plus près les évènements, les change- ments constatés
                        étant une hausse de 18 points sur le spot et de 21 points sur les
                        futurs.</p>
                    <p>Graines de Coton</p>
                    <p>La situation continue à être dépourvue d'intérêt, et comme si nous n'en
                        avions pas assez avec l'abstention de la spéculation, il nous a eucore fallu
                        les mouvements da marché cotonnier pour détourner l'attention générale de la
                        graine. L'année a bien l'air de rester insignifiante jusqu'au bout comme
                        affaires de Bourse.</p>
                    <p>Nous avons bien eu un peu de raffermisse- ment, mais cela a été motivé tout
                        simplement par l'état général du marché; da reste les rares affaires qui se
                        traitent sont la meil- leure preuve de l'absence de tout changement pouvant
                        secouer un peu notre marché de sa torpeur. Bref, après avoir été à près de
                        P.T. 58 pour les 3 mois, la cote revient à 57 .</p>
                    <p>Pour ce qui est da disponible, l'abondance de la marchandise contrebalance
                        l'effet de la demande et de l'importance des exportations; aussi, après qu'à
                        la suite des contrats nous étions montés à 56, la clôture a-t-elle en lien à
                        55</p>
                    <p>Il y a des achats pour couvertures à Hall, mais tout courant d'affaires
                        régulier pour compte consommation fait défaut. Avec les dernières nouvelles
                        de l'Argentine et des Indes au sujet de la récolte de la graine de lin et
                        avec la récolte cotonnière américaine si ré- duite, la chose semble
