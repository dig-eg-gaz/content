                        a labourer, and Mankarins, a barber. These men divided the money among
                        themselves, bought a house at Haret el Nasarn, 1,500 metres of land at
                        Shoubra, and were negotiating for the purchase of a honse at Eagallab for
                        £3,000, but they did conclude the bargain for fear of attracting attention.
                        Amdrons also bought jewels for his wife. The box which contained the stolen
                        money remained buried for several weeks in an unknown place and it was then
                        brought to Said Hannalla's house and burnt there. The houses of the accused
                        have been searched by the police. £2,723 was found in tin box built in the
                        wall in Amdrous's house and£400 and a quantity of jewels and valuable papers
                        were found in Said Hannals's house. The accused deny the charge of theft,

                        last Thursday night She was reported here yesterday by the Dutch mail boat,
                        which brought her chief officer to Suez. According to the latter's

                        several lighters and labourers are about to sail from Suez this afternoon.

                        observe the eclipse of the sun, which will occur on August 30. The
                        expedition will be organised and despatched under the auspices of the Lick
                        Observatory. Mr. W.W. Campbell, director of the Lick Observatory, recently
                        sent a communication to Secretary Shaw asking that permission bo given to
                        the collector of the port of Now York to examine a number of scientific
                        apparatus to be used in observing the eclipse. Included in the apparatus to
                        be brought out are lenses, prisms, mirrors, telescopes, clocks, photograph
                        apparatus and materials, tents, mechanics' tools and other minor
                        necessaries. Some of this apparatus is to bo taken from the United States
                        Naval Observatory at Washington, from Harvard University, and from
                        Princeton. The director stated that be would ship some of this late in May.
                        The expeditions will start July 6 from New York. He asked also that on the
                        return of the expeditions the instruments might be shipped in bond direct
                        various destinations, because an examination in Now York involved danger to
                        them on account of the unpacking and repacking. The Secretary of the
                        American Treasury has instructed the collector to make the requested
                        examination so that the instruments may be taken back without payment of

                        Voronoff, consulting physician to H.H. the Khedive, has proved a great
                        success, judging by the large number of patients that have been admitted. Id
                        fact for several weeks during the winter many pressing cases had to be
                        refused admittance for want of accommodation. Miss Glewitt, the matron,
                        formerly lady doctor at the Suez Quarantine Office, and Miss Mac-phereon,
                        her assistant, have been kept busy since the opening. The latter has now
                        left for England owing to ill-health, but her place will be filled later by
                        another English nurse. The buildiug grounds surrounding were leased for four
                        years, with option of purchase, from Mohamed Boy Abdel Wahid, a wealthy
                        landlord of the Capital, and the gardenis 4,000 square metres in extent The
                        mansion contains over 20 rooms, but it is intended during the summer to make
                        several improvements and alterations which will increase the accommodation
                        for patients. Since the opening ho less than 106 cases have been treated in
                        the hospital, all ot which, with the exception of twelve, were surgical.
                        Besides paying patients there are also free beds for persons of
                        respectability who are unable from want of means to pay the fees. Dr. S.
                        Voronoff has left for Europe on a short and much-needed holiday and until
                        his return his duties will bo performed by Dr. G. Voronoff.</p>

                    <p>Plans and contracts have been completed for four electric automobiles, each
                        to carry forty passengers at a trip, and an American youth as conductor, who

                        the sights between Cairo and the Sphinx. The cars cost £1,000 each and will
                        start running on the first of January next, from Shepheard's, stopping at
                        the Continental, Angleterre, National, and Savoy Hotels to pick up
                        passengers. The head porters in all those hotels are financially interested
                        in the scheme. Two trips per day, 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., are scheduled. About an
                        hour will be spent on the road and two hours at the Pyramids. About March,
                        the machines will bo shipped to Paris, where they will be used during the

                    <p>A shocking crime is reported from the village of Miniat El Kobra, in the
                        Menoofieh maiksz, Menoofieh province. A fellah, who had a grudge against his
                        brother, attacked him from behind while he was engaged in threshing his
                        wheat crop, and foiled the unfortunate man with several heavy blows of a
                        about. Unfastening his turban, the murderer coolly strangled his victim, and
                        having satisfied himself of his death, dragged the body to a neighbouring
                        canal and threw it into the water. The body was found floating in a partly
                        decomposed state, but the marks of the injuries sustained by the murdered
                        man persisted and the inquiry which was held established the brother's
                        guilt. The murderer, who was arrested, has confessed to having committed the
                        crime.</p>
