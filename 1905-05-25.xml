                            a population of about 45,000 souls, it possesses no telegraphic
                            communication with the outside world. The business men of the town, he
                            adds, feel the greater need of telegraphic connection with other cities
                            and hope that in the near future the authorities will open an office
                            there. </p>

                    <head>NEW EGYPTIAN COMPANY. IMPORTANT FLOTATION. "EGYPT, LIMITED.”</head>
                    <p>Among the forthcoming Egyptian flotations there is one very important
                        company, the prospectus of which will soon be set before the public. The
                        company will be known by the comprehensive and attractive title of "Egypt,
                        Limited." One of the advantages of this name is that the company will not be
                        confused in the minds of the investors with the mass of other new companies
                        whose founders have not shown any originality in their nomenclature. Egypt,
                        Limited, is to have a capital of £250,000 with power to increase to a
                        million. The London board of directors is composed of a number of business
                        men, well-known in the world of commerce and finance. These include Mr.
                        Callender, of telegraph and construction fame, whose products are well known
                        hero, Mr. J. A. H. Drought, chairman of the United Lankat Plantations
                        Company, which is one of the favorite industrial securities is the London
                        market, Mr. John Waddington, the founder of Egyptian Options, and Mr.
                        Doolette, chairman of the Oroya Brownhill Co., Limited, one of the premier
                        Australian mining securities on the London market. One or two other
                        well-known names will, it is understood, also appear on the prospectus. The
                        entire capital has been guaranteed both in London and Egypt unlike the
                        majority of companies having advisory boards here, the Egyptian
                        directors,whose names we will announce shortly, will be represented by a
                        delegation on the London board, and in this way will be able to exercise a
                        salutary check on the London board in their Egyptian investments. The chief
                        object of the company will be mortgage business, the purchase and resale of
                        land, the development of building estates, and the promotion and
                        guaranteeing of new Egyptian enterprises. With regard to the last object
                        Egypt, Limited, intends to promote another Egyptian mortgage company, which
                        has already been guaranteed to the extent of over a million pounds sterling.
                        It is needless to point out that the promotion profits of the parent company
                        will b considerable. </p>

                    <head>ALEXANDRIA. ARCHAEOLOGICAL SOCIETY. REPORT FOR 1904-1905.</head>
                    <p>Dr. Breccis, in his very interesting report, announces some very satisfactory
                        results of the progress of the above society. The appereance of the
                        Bulletins Nos. 6 and 7 have gained the esteem of other learned societies to
                        such an extent that seventeen scientific associations have offered to make
                        exchanges with that of the A. A. S., In this way its library will grow
                        rapidly ; it already contains many important works. Several learned men
                        connected with European Universities and Museums have promised to write
                        articles for the Bulletin of the A. A. S. which will greatly help Dr.
                        Breccia in bringing out a regular quarterly review. In answer to a request
                        made by the last general meeting Dr. Breccia inaugurated a series of
                        lectures at the Popular University on archeological subjects, two of which
                        have been given already, one on “The Recent Discoveries in Crete and
                        Mycaenian Civilisation," and the other on “Greek and Arab Civilization in
                        Sicily,” both illustrated with limelight views. They were so well attended
                        that Dr. Breccia feels encouraged to continue the series in the Museum
                        itself, where his audience can see the objects of interest to which he will
                        refer. The excavations carried out at the expense of the A. S. S. Fund westt
                        of the Victoria College were of great interest, but were unavoidably
                        interrupted. The things, however, discovered there will be treated of in the
                        next Bulletin in an article by Simond Bey and Dr. Breccia. The excavations
                        at Hadra, in the Eastern Necropolis, also proved to be important as a rich
                        series of loculi of the Ptolemaic period were discovered, the doors of which
                        were painted in the style of that period in different colours and in some
                        instances with the addition of inscriptions. Notwithstanding the friability
                        of the stone several of those doors have been safely removed to the Museum.
                        The attention of savants has been attracted lately to the connection between
                        the Alexandria tomb paintings and those known as Pompeian and this
                        similarity is strikingly noticeable in these tomb-doors lately found at
                        Gabbari. Funeral urns and fragments of statuettes known, as Tanagrae were
                        also found in the same place. Excavations under the auspices of the Museum
                        Committee have been also undertaken at Chatby in what has proved to be a
                        Necropolis of tho 1st Ptoleinaic period, the results of which will be found
                        in a separate notice in the next Bulletin, Members of the society meanwhile
                        are invited to visit the Museum and see these latest discoveries.
                        Excursions-having been proposed by the committee and approved of by the
                        general meeting, the first come off on 17th April last, when the members
                        went in great numbers to Aboukir to visit the mosaics discovered by H. H.
                        Prince Omar Toussoun on his property and who has kindly offered them to the
                        society. This excoursion was most successful and much appreciated by all who
                        took part in it, and it is proposed to continue them from time to time. Dr.
                        Schiess Bey, president of the Museum Committee, has invited members to
                        promenade lectures in the Museum— where the conservator will hold
                        peripatetic discourses. An excursion to Chalby will be organized later on
                        with the approval of the general assembly, also to Taposiris Magna, Mariout,
                        etc. H. H. Prince Omar Toussoun, having always taken a keen interest in the
                        work of the A.A.S., was invited by the committee to become their honorary
                        president, which he has graciously agreed to do, and presided at the last
                        committee meeting. The dedicatory tablet to the memory of the late
                        conservator, Dr. Botti, is not yet ready, but it is hoped that it will
                        shortly be finished, so that the ceremony which has been for some time
                        planned can then take place, i.e., of removing the remains of the learned
                        professor and placing them in an ancient sarcophagus as a suitable monument.
                        It was proposed by Simond Bey and Dr. Schiess Bey that Professor Maspero
                        should be begged by the A. A. S. to allow them to have two of the obelisks
                        lying about amongst the rains of San presented to the city of Alexandria,
                        and the Municipality promises to pay the cost of transport. Many now members
                        have joined lately, especially since the excursion to Aboukir, and donations
                        have been received from Artin Pasha, Judge Batcheller, and others. </p>

                    <p>A clever seizure of smuggled hashish was effected by a Coastguard patrol on
                        Monday at a point on the coast about 10 kilometers west of Rosetta
                        lighthouse.</p>
                    <p>The hashish, which weighed no less than 1070 kilos and was packed in 16
                        sacks, had been landed on the previous evening by a blockade runner, and
                        removed to its place of hiding, it evidently being the intention of the
                        smuggler to take tho drug away into the interior the following night. </p>
                    <p>Their intentions, however, were frustrated by the Coastguard patrol,
                        consisting of one onbashi (corporal) and a tracker. Early on Monday morning
                        the patrol found traces of the landing which had been made near a road much
                        used by fishermen leading from the sea to Bossili. The patrol followed tire
                        tracks and eventually,after some hours’ search, came to some sand dunes,
                        wherein the hashish had been buried. </p>
                    <p>Judging by the tracks on the sand, four camels were used to transport the
                        hashish from the seashore, and the escort consisted of twenty men, one of
                        whom was on horseback. </p>

                    <p>As we briefly stated in our issue of yesterday, Tuesday’s concert of the
                        Alexandria Literary, Musical &amp; Dramatic Society was a great success. The
                        programme was a long and interesting one, and there was not a dull moment
                        from beginning to end. It opened with an “andante maestoso" on the piano for
                        four hands, excellentiy played by Misses Giorgina and Gemma Fiteni, two
                        little mites, who, with their equally small sister, Alice, delighted the
                        audience with two more selections and an encore. We found them best in
                        Suppe’s “onverture moderato" (paragraph 3), where they showed clever
                        mechanism and a perfect understanding of the use of the pedal. Considering
                        that the piano was anything but easy to play on, their performance was
                        highly commendable. Miss Euna Lang Anderson,whose talent is not unknown to
                        A.L.M &amp; D.S. audiences, contributed two violin solos, and for her
                        exquisite execution of Mariani’s “L’Abandono" secured a well deserved encore
                        when she gave a spirited rendering of “Perpetuo Mobile." Miss MunGavin was
                        in splendid voice and sang M. E. Dandridge’s “One Flower” with great feeling
                        and effect, her rendering of "My Heart is Weary" from Nadeschda, in the
                        second part, being likewise given in her usual finished style. Mrs. F. Cree,
                        who contributed two items, Godard’s "Jo ne veux pas d’autres choses” and
                        Brahm's “Chansons Tziganes" (No 1), was also in good voice and fully
                        maintained the reputation she has already gained as one of our host singers.
                        Miss Helene Lulos, a young and promising pianist, showed to great advantage
                        in Beethoven's “Adagio grazioso” and Liazt's well-known“Rhapsodie
                        Hengroise.” Albeit having to deal with a most unsympathetic keyboard she
                        played the latter number with all due softness and fully interpreted the
                        spirit of the great composer. Mr. L.A. Johnson gave two selections from the
                        Indian Lore Lyrics, (a) “The Temple Bells” and (b) "When I wake," as well
                        as“The Lute Player”(Allitsen), all of which he rendered with great taste and
                        feeling. Mr. P. Byrne was also very successful in his two numbers, ‘The
                        Slave Song” (Teresa del Riego) and “Queen of the Roses," from “Haddon Hall,”
                        in the latter of which he appeared to greatest advantage. The accompanists
                        to the singers were Mrs. MunGavin, Mme Foscolo, Miss Gibson, and M. Felix.

                    <head>CAIRO'S WATER SUPPLY.</head>
                    <p>In regard to the complaints of a correspondent concerning the water supply of
                        Cairo, which appeared in our issue of Tuesday, we find on making enquiries
                        that the Water Company have for the last 15 days, pumped each day 2.000m.c.
                        more water than daring tire corresponding days of last year. They have
                        pumped with all their engines during 24 hours of each day. The enormous
                        increase in consumption and the abnormal wave of heat can alone account for
                        it but that the town has had the water the company say there is no doubt. On
                        Sunday, part of the filtered supply was out off, as they were connecting to
                        their new works, but this was only for a few hours, after which the service
                        was resumed. </p>
                    <p>The company havo spent nearly £100,000 on their new installation during the
                        last 18 months. This will come into work early next month, to assist the old
                        installation, which will gradually be done away with. </p>
                    <p>As regards ice, the company state that the price is never more than P.T. 3.5
                        the block, whatever the demand. Probably people who buy from Arabs in the
                        street have to pay what the latter choose to ask. </p>

                    <p>(From Our Financial Correspondent).</p>
                    <p>London, May 19. </p>
                    <p>Things financial, like the Russian fleets,are “fighting shy”. Rumours, like
                        phantom torpedo boats, give pause every few hours and the very mention of
                        political complications of any kind is enough to make the few buyers turn
                        tall. Until doubt is dispelled all will be nervous tension and paralysis. Of
                        this state of things all are tired, and ask “how long can we bear this
                        strain? </p>
                    <p>Markets are still idle and awaiting events. The break at the end of last
                        account cleared out, to a very large extent, any weak bull element which
                        existed, and consequently the present position should be more healthy. The
                        tendency is already firmer, and any good news would cause a sharp recovery
                        in prices. </p>
                    <p>As to the Egyptian market, prices there keep quietly steady, but without
                        feature. Salt and 8oda are eerier at 33s. and Delta Preterenoe have gone
                        back a shade to 13. Bank shares are firm. The latest new issue, the North
                        Egypt Land Company,is quoted at 1/8 premium, and should the proposed
                        irrigation scheme be sanctioned and the company’s application for the
                        extension of the Nubarieh Canal be acceded to by the Egyptian Government,
                        there ought to be a good future for the shares, of which 100,000 £1 shares
                        out of 230,000 are now offered at par. </p>
                    <p>The mining section is still weak from sheer want of interest. Prices continue
                        to sag away, and ought certainly to be worth attention for looking up.
                        Egyptians are inclined to be firmer, Nile Valley Block “E" attracting
                        attention on the developments reported from the Dongola Concession, a reef
                        having been struck assaying, in the east shaft, 12 dwts. over 2ft. 3ins, and
                        in the west shaft 1oz. over 1ft. Egyptian mines are also being bought at
                        their present low level. Um Rus at just over £1 and Nile Valleys at
                        1/1/6/1/8 look really cheap. </p>

                        Franco pour les protéger contre l'anglicisation de l'Égypte, elles faisaient
                        volontiers l'éloge de l'odonpatioD. Mais à peine la France eût-t-ell •

                        tulations et des tribunaux mixtes.</p>
                    <p>On comprendra facilement dit la "Revue 'de* Débats," oette impatience des
                        colonies eu- ropéennes d’Egypte, nous voulons ici parler do colonies
                        .allemande, austro-hongroise, helléni que et italienne, et il n’e»t pas
                        besoin de dire pour quelles raisoua nous devons faire abstrac- tion de la
                        colonie française et de la colonie anglaise, — si l'on veut bien se rendre
                        compte que, pour cos colonies l'kooord franco-anglais iln » avril 1904 a été
                        une déception et, jusqu » un certain point, un sujet d'alarme Ces «lo- nies,
                        en effet, s'aocomodaient assez bien de l'état de choses antérieur à
                        l'aocord. Non seule ment ellos ne protestaient pas oontre l'occupa tion
                        anglaise , niais encore elles l'acceptaient presque avec reconnaissance,
                        comme une ga- rantie de bqo ordre et, par conséquent, de sécurité, pour
                        leurs intérêts matériels. Mais, Vif ne'leur déplaisait point que
                        l’Angleterre ", fût-en Egypte le gendarme de l'Europe, elles désiraient
                        ardemment que là se bornât sou rôle; à l'égal d'une Egypte trop égyptienne
                        elles redoutaient une Egypte trop britannique ; elles craignaient surtout
                        que des institutions pure ment anglaises ne. vinssent prendre la placé des
                        ipstitâtions internationales, et, parmi ces institutions internationales
                        deux principalement leur tenaient à oœur': les capitulations, et les
                        tribunaux mixtes : les capitulations, parce quelles leur assuraient des
                        privilèges ; les tri- bunaux mixtes, parce qu'ils leur distribuaient une
                        justice éclairée et toqjours impartiale. La politique que suivait la France,
                        en retardant l'absorption britannique, assurait le maintien des '
                        capitulations ainsi que des tribunaux, mixtes ; o'«t pourquoi Alluma mis et
                        Auatro Hongrois, Grecs, Italiens et même Levantins approuvaient, au moins
                        secrètement, cette poli-, tique dont ils • recueillaient tous les bénéfices
                        sans avoir à en sabir les inconvénients. Us l'approuvaient et s'en
                        réjouissaient, et, comme on prend facilement ses désira pour dos réalités,
                        ils éroyaient très sincèrement que la Francs ne se lasserait jamais de
                        plaider, seule ou presque seule, la cvpse de l'Europe en Egypte.</p>
                    <p>La i,o i ville de l'aocord produisit parmi les européens résidant ou Egypte
                        an, moment d'an- xiété ; ils crurent à la proclamatioi d'un pro- tectorat et
                        à la suppression de leurs privilèges. Ils respirèrent seulement lorsqu'ils
                        apprirent quela Commission ds la Dette était la grande sacrifiée.</p>
                    <p>Cetts belle oonfiance, toutelois, ne devait pas durer. Quelques mois après la
                        presse anglo- égyptienné, plus ou moins inspirée par l'agence diplomatique
                        d'Angleterre, entreprenait une campagne oontre les capitulations, ce qui
                        fai- sait prévoir aox gens d'ordinaire bien informés que lé rapport de Lord
                        Cromer annoncerait leur imminente disparition.</p>
                    <p>Dans ce rapport si impatiemment attendu, Lord Cromer no voit pas très
                        clairement quel système pourrait être substitué au système capitulaire, mais
                        il eroit devoir saisir fopiniou publique de la question de la suppression
                        des capitulations ; le syst^be oompliqué connu sons «nom demeure, il est
                        vrai, intact pour le moment, mais la possibilité de le modifier se dessine
                        déjà. En-d'autres termes, il pose nette- ment le problème, sans d'ailleurs
                        préciser quand nioomment il serafésolu.</p>
                    <p>Quel est donc ce régime capitulaire, ajoute la Revue, que Lord Cromer soumit
                        jujourd’- hui au jugement de ' l'opinion publique égyp- tienne et européenne
                        f Tout le monde sait que le régime capiWlaire est on régime de faveur pour
                        les étrangers auxquels « régime oonfère un certain nombre de privilèges
                        trèsexorbi tants et très suranné», dont le» principaux sont: l’exemption
                        d'impôts, l'inviolabilité de la demeure, l'immunité do juridiction civile et
                        pénale et l'immunité législative. Tout le monde sait «la, mais « qu'on
                        ignore assez générale ment,' c'est que «la n'est que la théorie, et qu'entré
                        le régime théorique des capitulations et lé" régime des capitulations, tel
                        qu'il fonc- tionné actuellement et depuis longtemps en Egypte, il y a un
                        abîme. Eu théorio, les étran- gers sont exemptés de tout impôt : en réalité,
                        les étranger» sont soumis eu Egypte à l'impôt foncier, à l’impôt sur la
                        propriété bâtie, aux taxes du commeroe extérieur et du commerce intérieur,
                        enfin à certaine-» (axes municipale-. En théorie, la demeure'de l’étranger
                        est invio- lable et les «genta de l’autorité localo n'y peu- vent jamais
                        pénétrer ; en réalité, tons la seule condition do donner avis préalable à
                        l’autorité oonsulaire, les agents de l'autorité égyptienno peuvent pénétrer
                        dans la demeure do l'étran- ger pour exécuter les dérisions de la justice,
                        pour rechercher la contrebande, pour opérer des perquisitions domiciliaires
                        et même, dans certaine ose, pour oonstater les contraventions eux t
                        règlements de police. En théorie, 1m é- trapger* sont soustraits à la
                        juridiction civile et pénale de* tribanaox territoriaux ; eu réa- lité,
                        l'immenité de jmjdlctioo pénale n'exbte pas, en Egypte, pour les
                        contraventions,'et l’immunité de juri action ri vile n’existe pas dans les
                        rapports entre étrangers ajipartenant k la même nationalité ; encore oon
                        vient-il de prêcher que toutes lo» actions immobilière», même entre
                        étrangers appartenant à la mémo nationalité, rentrent dans l'exolusirs oom-
                        péten« des tribunanx' égyptiens. En théo- rie, fm étrange» échappent à
                        l'action légis- lative de l'Etat territorial; en réalité, les lois
                        égyptiennes sont obligatoires jpoux^ Jjnoggrs, »o tu, la,-seul*, condition

                    <p>Il y a donc, à vrai dire, un régime égyptien des capitulations, très
                        différant du régime théorique de» capitulations, très différent aussi du
                        ségime des capitulations tri qu’il fonotioono en Turquie d'Europe ou en
                        Turquie d’Asio. Or, il est bien évident que, en toute loyauté, o'est le
                        régime égyptien des capitulations qui [ seul peut et doit être en
                        discussion. Quels grief- 11 lord Cromer élève-t-il contre ce régime 1 Dans 0

                    <p>KEARSLEY AND CUNNINGHAM’S WEEKLY REPORT</p>
                    <p>Liverpool, May 18.</p>
                    <p>A moderate business has been done in Egyptian Cotton this week, and prices
                        generally are firm, the quotations of Brown being raised 1/8 per lb., except
                        fine which is only 1/10 higher. In Futures a fair business has been done,
                        and the following are the latest values:- May 6.60 July 6.51 Sep. 6.46 June
                        6.54 Aug. 6.48 Oct. 6.43 Nov. 6.40</p>
                    <p>American Futures.—The Market this week has again been fairly active, with
                        constant fluctuations ; the tendency has been to higher prices, and to-day's
                        closing values are 9 @ 5 points higher than those of last Thursday. The
                        principal influences have been the con- tinued report of unfavorable
                        weather, chiefly in the South and Western Cotton areas, and the weekly
                        Government Report generally con- firms them ; the market is, however,
                        extremely sensitive and quickly responds to more favor- able news.
                        Apparently the last day or two the conditions are somewhat improved, and
                        although the market is firm in tone there is not much disposition shown to
                        fresh specula- tion.</p>

                    <head>ARAB HOSPITALITY.</head>
                    <p>Fifty-three pairs of dark eyes were fixed upon us in unwavering scrutiny ; it
                        was dark, and there was silence. The eyes as they gleamed out of the
                        darkness might have belonged to a herd of wild beasts watching their prey;
                        but we were privileged guests of the Arab sheik in whose tent we were
                        sitting, and the gaze was but that of friendly curiosity. We had been placed
                        on the seat of honor- a rush mat at one side of the tent opposite to as
                        squatted our host, a venerable old man with a white beard which flowed over
                        his bare, wrinkled chest, with one arm he supported a small boy who played
                        with the beads round the old chiefs neck.</p>
                    <p>Between us, in the centre of the hut, glowed a dying fire, and beside it,
                        silently watching the pot on the ashes, sat the coffee-maker. Now and then
                        he scraped the ashes together round the pot. A thin veil of smoke rose up
                        slowly and dispersed itself under the low roof of the tent. The.silence was
                        almost religious; the darkness suggested witchcraft rather than night; a
                        hobgoblin might have sprung out of the coffee-maker's pot and not been out
                        of keeping with the natural sequence of events. </p>
                    <p>All at-once, at the back of the tent, a hand was raised and a bundle of fine
                        brushwood came down on to the fire ; in sudden blare it momentarily lit up
                        the fifty-three dark faces, flared an instant, flickered, then as rapidly
                        died away, and we only felt the gaze we had seen before. We silently watched
                        the coffee- maker and our host, who being nearest to the tire were dimly
                        visible in a remaining light. The attention of the one was concentrated on
                        his pot; that of the other, in common with his companions was fixed on us.
                        There was no call for speech, for we spoke in tongues unintelligible to one
                        another, and the only sound which fitfully broke the ghostly silence was
                        that language understood by all nations alike—the wail of an infant in its
                        mother’s arms.</p>
                    <p>Salaam Aleikum’, we had been received with as the sheik stood up to welcome
                        us on our arrival, unexpected and uninvited, in the midst of his tribe. We
                        had been guided to his tent by the long spear which stood upright at the
                        door and when he had offered us the token of Arab good-will—the cup of
                        coffee—we knew that we were among friends. He waved us to our seats, and
                        then, seating himself, had pulled the child towards him ; he patted his own
                        chest, and then pointed to the lad with pride.</p>
                    <p>His youngest child, interpreted the Turkish soldier who accompanied us, and
                        who understood a few words of Arabic.</p>
                    <p>We nodded back our looks of appreciation, and these preliminary acts of
                        courtesy having established the requisite good feeling, all need for farther
                        converse seemed at an end, and a comfortable silence fell upon us all.</p>
                    <p>The whole village had followed us into their chief's tent as a matter of
                        course, and those for whom there was no room inside herded together at the
                        door. The Eastern standard of ideas, which allows respectful equality with
                        one’s superiors; was responsible for the total absence of ill-mannered
                        jostling which would have characterised a civilised crowd in similar
                        circumstances on the reception of strange foreigners.</p>
                    <p>The coffee-maker reached out his hand without turning, and one among the
                        crowd at his back handed him a massive iron spoon on to which was chained a
                        copper, ladle. The sheik’s little son, obeying a nod from his father, pulled
                        a bag out of a dark recess behind him ; another bundle of brushwood was
                        thrown upon the fire, and by the light of its sudden, almost startling blare
                        the lad untied the bag and carefully counted out the allotted number of
                        coffee-berries. The coffee-maker dropped them into the spoon, for which he
                        had raked out a hole in the ashes. The slight stir caused by these
                        proceedings subsided, the blare died away, and the attention of all was
                        again riveted on us, save that only of the coffee-maker, who sitting close
                        up to the embers, now scraped the white ashes round the pot, now turned the
                        roasting berries over with the ladle chained to the spoon. The sheik’s hand
                        stole on to the little boy’s head, and the boy, looking up stroked the old
                        man’s beard. On we sat in the dark silence, learning from there true master
                        of time how neither to waste it nor let it drag but going step by step with
                        it, laying ourselves open to receive all that it had to give.</p>
                    <p>The silence was so prolonged and so intense that, silently as time flies, we
                        could almost hear its moments ticking away. It has been said that we take no
                        note of time except when we count its loss; it might be said of all Easterns
                        that they are unconscious of the time they lore, because they take no note
                        of it ; they live unconsciously up to the fact that the past being beyond
                        recall and the future unfathomable, the present only is in our power. And
                        the Eastern is master of time because he spends it in absorbing the
                        present</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the berries had blackened, and the man emptied them into a copper
                        mortar as he pounded them he caused the pestle to ring in tune against the
                        sides of the bowl. The child laughed gleefully and pointed at him the stern
                        old man smiled and shot a proud glance over us.</p>
                    <p>Fiddle away, old Time,’ rang out the TONES of the metal pestle : it seemed to
                        give voiCe to our joyful derision of time ;here was Time trying to weary us
                        with himself, and we only laughed at him.</p>
                    <p>Fiddle away, old Time— Fiddle away, old fellow! Airs for infancy, youth, and
                        prime, Tunes both shrill and mellow. Fiddle away, Or grave or grey, For
                        faces pink or jell aw , Scrape roar song a lifetime long, Piddle away, old
                        fellow!</p>
                    <p>Not a soul moved; outside in the dusk a stunted black cow thoughtfully chewed
                        the maize-stalks of which the enclosure round the tent was built, and a kid
                        rubbed his head up and down against a child’s bare leg. Beyond this the
                        darkness had nothing to conceal; we were in the middle of a bare, largely
                        uninhabited, desert land known only to a few wandering Arab tribes; outside,
                        the mysterious open vault of the dark sky with its many hundred points of
                        light; inside, the mysterious recess of the dark tent with the fifty-three
                        pairs of gleaming eyes—every one fixed upon ourselves. Now and then, as a
                        flash of lightning in the sky at night will expose the immediate
                        surroundings to view, so a sudden spark from the fire revealed the setting
                        of the eyes—the solemn, dusky Arab faces.</p>
                    <p>A splutter on the fire as the pot boiled over put an end alike to the tune
                        and to the meditations called up by it. The man transferred the ground
                        berries to a copper jug, and, pouring the boiling water on to them, placed
                        this second pot on the hot ashes. We had been sitting there for an hour,
                        watching these preparations, and it seemed as if we might now reasonably
                        entertain hopes of tasting the results. Our expectations in this direction
                        were also enhanced by the appearance of three tiny cups which had been
                        unearthed from a dark corner and handed to one of the men nearest the fire.
                        He proceeded to rinse them out one by one with hot water, displaying a care
                        and absorption in the process which contrasted strangely - with the
                        simplicity of his task.</p>
                    <p>The coffee on the fire came to the boil; the coffee maker poured it back into
                        the original pot, which he again set on the ashes. He then handed the empty
                        jug to the cup- washer, who rinsed each cap out carefully with a few drops
                        of the coffee left for this purpose ; very quietly, very precisely he placed
                        each cup on the ground within reach of the coffee-maker and retreated into
                        the background.</p>
                    <p>The coffee on the fire boiled up; the coffee- maker reached out his hand ;
                        but he emptied the boiling liquid back again into the original pot, and
                        replaced it on the ashes.</p>
                    <p>The fire now burned very dimly. Even the man’s form bending over the glowing
                        ashes was discernible only as a black shadow. The still- ness for a few
                        moments was so great, and the concentration of all to centred on the
                        bubbling coffee-pot, that one felt as if all the meaning of life, the past,
                        the present, and the future, was being distilled in the black liquid, and
                        that only an incantation was necessary for the future to take shape, and,
                        rising out of the pot, become visible to us all in this mysterious
                        darkness.</p>
                    <p>Again the coffee boiled up. Again the man emptied the boiling liquid back
                        into the other pot, and replaced it on the fire.</p>
                    <p>The stillness and the concentration became more intense. Outside a lamb's
                        sudden cry and the mother’s answering bleat rang out sharply in the black
                        night, a distant reminder of a far- off world; it died away, and the broken
                        silence was all the more intense.</p>
                    <p>The coffee boiled up.</p>
                    <p>By this time, one had ceased to associate the drinking of coffee with the end
                        of these mysterious rites. The coffee of Cook's hotels, the coffee of
                        crowded railway stations, whole coffee, ground coffee, French coffee, coffee
                        at 1s. 8d. a pound ; the clatter of black saucepans, the hot and anxious
                        cook, the bustling waiter, the impatient people of the world with only a
                        minute to wait, calling for instantaneous coffee —what had coffee and all
                        these associations to do with this? And so it was with a certain shock that
                        we looked at this magician pouring the result of his black art into the
                        cups, a few carefully measured drops only. Two were handed to us and one to
                        the sheik. We sipped the oily black drink slowly and thoughtfully. A liquid
                        which had been prepared with so much deliberation could not be quaffed down
                        with the reckless indifference ordinarily displayed in the process. It was
                        thick and bitter; we drained the last drop and returned the cups. Another
                        spoonful was poured in, and they were passed back to us. Etiquette required
                        that we should not refuse till the third time of offering; then the
                        remainder of the coffee was handed round to the rest of the company in order
                        of rank.</p>
                    <p>There was a stir among the crowd round the door, and a woman forced her way
                        through with a baby in her arms. She squatted in front of us, and held the
                        child down for our closer inspection by the firelight</p>
                    <p>'Khasta' (ill), said the Turkish soldier; ‘she wants medicine.’</p>
                    <p>The mother pointed to the sores on the child's face and body, the pleading
                        eloquence in her dark eyes rendering unnecessary any explanations on the
                        part of our interpreter.</p>
                    <p>It was a pathetic instance of the suffering induced by man, even when living
                        so akin to nature, when he tries to superimpose his own crude ideas of
                        beauty and expediency on to the human frame. The baby, though only a few
                        months old, had been pierced in the nose and ears for the reception of the
                        ornaments which were to enhance its charms in after-life, and of the blue
                        bead which would ensure its safety from the one recognised enemy—the Evil
                        Eye. The wounds were healing badly, and the irritation set up had caused
                        fever.</p>
                    <p>‘Tell her we can give her medicine,' was said to the Turk, 'but it is not
                        medicine to drink ; it is to wash the wounds with. If the baby drinks it, it
                        will die.’</p>
                    <p>The message was interpreted. ‘Aha, aha, Mashallah,' was murmured all through
                        the crowd. The baby became an object of intense interest; the soldier threw
                        back hhis head and pretended to swallow, then he pointed significantly to
                        heaven and to the unconscious victim at his feet</p>
                    <p>‘Ha ! ha !' murmured the crowd.</p>
                    <p>Hassan meanwhile had begun to fidget uneasily.</p>
                    <p>‘There are fleas here,’ he said ; ‘you must not stop any longer.'</p>
                    <p>We rose, and silently salaaming our host pissed out of the tent. It was
                        lighter outside ; the moon had risen, casting mysterious black shadows round
                        the huts, where weird black and white forms flitted stealthily in and
                        out.</p>
                    <p>The Arab encampment into which we had intruded ourselves was one of many to
                        be found at intervals down the banks of the Tigris below Mosul. We were on
                        our way to Bagdad, floating down stream on one of the native rafts, and at
                        night when we moored to the shore it was considered safer to establish
                        ourselves within reach of some such habitation. On this occasion, owing to
                        the shallowness of the water on the low shaving mudbanks, we had been unable
                        to bring the raft right up to the shore, and it had been moored at a little
                        distance out in the water. The boatmen had carried us across on their backs,
                        and had returned to cook their evening meal on board. We now shouted across
                        the water to them to come and carry us back. As we stood waiting a woman
                        came up to us, dragging a child by the arm, who hid his head in his mother's
                        dress and refused to allow himself to be examined.</p>
                    <p>'He is ill too,' said, the Turk, like the other child.' </p>
                    <p>'We will give them some medicine when we get on the raft,’ we said ; Tell
                        them each to send a cure'</p>
                    <p>‘And this one says he is ill,' the man went on, as a tall, sheepish-looking
                        youth touched me on the arm ; 'They will all say they are ill now that they
                        know you have medicine.'</p>
                    <p>'We can only give to those who are really ill,' we answered. ‘What is the
                        matter with, this one?'</p>
                    <p>'He has fever : he cannot eat, and his head hurts.’ I had some quinine pills
                        in my pocket, and I gave three to the boy.</p>
                    <p>'Tell him to take two now, and not to keep them in his mouth,’ I explained,
                        ‘but drink some water and swallow them down ; then, when the sun has risen
                        one hour to-morrow, let him take the other one.'</p>
                    <p>A dozen interested spectators at once went through the whole proceed in
                        pantomime. A pill was swallowed, and its downward coarse , indicated by
                        stroking the chest 'Ha!' was ejaculated all round. Then the second pill was
                        swallowed with equally suggestive signs. The rising-point of the sun was
                        indicated, and one finger held up—and the third pill swallowed.</p>
                    <p>'Mashallah!’ went up through the crowd, staring with bated breath.</p>
                    <p>We boarded the raft, and had scarcely established ourselves in our
                        sleeping-hut when Hassan staggered to the door with a huge clay pitcher,
                        capable of holding several gallons; he deposited it at our feet.</p>
                    <p>‘For the medicine,’ he said gravely. ‘We said that the woman was to send a
                        cup,’ we said ; The few drops of lotion will be lost in that’</p>
                    <p>‘For the medicine,' be answered imperturbably.</p>
                    <p>‘We had better send it in one of our cups,' I said, and I measured out some
                        lotion. Hassan took it; a few minutes later he returned laden with cups,
                        jars, pitchers, and bowls of every size and description.</p>
                    <p>'For the medicine,' he said, as he deposited them beside us.</p>
                    <p>We looked at one another aghast.</p>
                    <p>'Say that we have no more,’ we said.</p>
                    <p>'I have told them,’ he said; 'but they will not go away.’</p>
                    <p>We went outside, where a tremendous hubbub had arisen. Our men were standing
                        round the edge of the raft, resolutely pushing would- be intruders book
                        into-the river. Up to their waists in water, hanging on to the raft at every
                        point, shouting out their ailments, pointing to their throats, their eyes,
                        their heads, were the whole male population of the place. In vain our men
                        strove to keep them off; the raft was besieged at every point. In
                        desperation we unmoored and floated out into the middle of the river; the
                        most determined swam out after us, and holding on to the raft with one hand
                        stroked their chests and pointed to sun with the other. Finally, as we
                        drifted down stream, they gave up, and the last sight we had was that of a
                        row of disconsolate invalids, suddenly endowed with great evidences of
                        health and strength, careering wildly on the mud flats in the starlight
                        round a discarded heap of empty bowls and pitchers (Louisa Jebb in Longman's
                        Magazine).</p>

                    <p>Made in 70 Colors</p>
                    <p>An artistic wall covering.</p>
                    <p>This celebrated water paint is made in two qualities for Inside and Outside
                        work</p>
                    <p>HALL’S SANITARY WASHABLE DISTEMPER is rapidly superseding wall papers in all
                        tastefully furnished homes. It is made in 70 artistic tints, and only
                        requires the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is quickly and
                        easily applied with a whitewash brush, with half the labour and at one third
                        the cost of paint. HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures cleanliness, and is pleasing to
                        the eye. It appeals alike to artistic and practical house decoration. HALL’S
                        DISTEMPER is of special value in hot climates. Owing to its cool, pleasing
                        colours, great weather-resisting and germ-destroying properties, it lends
                        itself to every kind of wall, wood, brick or stone coating, possessing all
                        the advantages of paint, colour- wash, and disinfectant at one third the
                        cost of oil paint. It never blisters in the hottest sun, and the fact that
                        it can be washed adds greatly to its sanitary advantages.</p>
