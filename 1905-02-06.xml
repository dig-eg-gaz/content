                            <p>HAs not the time arrived for a stereotyped spelling of the names of
                                towns and villages in Egypt! The present variety is more con- fusing
                                than pleasing. The Journel Officiel often contains several spellings
                                fo the same place according as the name is being used by the Public
                                Works, Railway, Finance or other administraion. Nor is an
                                administration always uniform in its method, for the Railway
                                Administration sometimes exhibits in time- table, telegrphic guide,
                                tickets, station home- boards, and lamps all the various forms of
                                spelling. Here are some illustrations of variety taken from official
                                sources:Kalioubieh, Galiou- bieh, Qualiubia; Guzieh, Guiza, Giza;
                                Kena, Keneg, Qena; Assiout, Assyut, Assiut; Ebchan, Ebshan, Ibshan;
                                Barqnaqs, Barknaks. When names can be found indifferently under the
                                inital K Kh H C G or Q it is quite a labor to consuly an index.</p>

                            <p>Some years ago the Indian Government adopted a uniform system of
                                spelling on the Hunterian method, to prevent confusion, and it is
                                quite time the Egyptian Government did the same. The stereotyped
                                form could be left to the Survey Department, who have already nearly
                                completed a survey of Egypt embracing every single hamlet, or ezbeh,
                                ezbet, isba, izba, izbit. This department could issue a general
                                index, and also a geographical list with mudiriehs, districts,
                                villages, esbehs. It would be of much use in fixing exact name and
                                locality. Press notices of village occurrences are at times very
                                vague as to locality. Teh el Baroud, often erroneously called Tel,
                                is now spelt Stai el Baroud on Survey maps. The names of natives is
                                a great source of error, and a properly-spelt list would be of much
                                ser- vice. A native's identity is at times lost in the vagaries of
                                spelling.</p>

                            statemeut, which showed that the church started the new year with the
                            substantial balance of £199. 16a to its credit. The Rev. H. P. Reid
                            congrat ulated the treasurer upon his satisfactory report, and while
                            thanking the congregation and friends for their generous help, expressed
                            the hope that they would all unite in the effort during the year to
                            increase their resources their Christan usefulness, and their depth of
                            spirituality, which after all was the work of i Christian Church. He
                            also took oocasion to refer to the appointment of his predecessor the
                            Rev.W. Cowan, to St. Ninian’s, Edinburgh and also to say that he was
                            sure the congre gation would unite with him in congratulating Mr. Cowan
                            upon his appointment, and in sending best wishes for his success in his
                            new sphere of labor. The eveniug was spent amid songs, games, etc., and
                            a very pleasant and enjoyable evening it was. it muse have quite

                            be one of the largest ever open, and it is supposed to be the resultant
                            of the group of small spots which were visible in the early part of last
                            month. The appearance of this great spot seems to give a good opportu-

                            what-not, beflowered and begarlauded, deserved something better than the
                            weather that chilled Cairo yesterday. the morning was overcast till
                            about 10 a.m., then it cleared only for a cold and dust-laden wind to
                            bring the clouds up again, and-shortly before 3 p.m. rain began to H.
                            Thencefor- ward showers came down intermittently till close on 6
                            o'clock, and theugh it cleared later the air was always raw and chilly.
                            The crowd of spectators was, none the less, large and good-tempered.
                            There was nothing approaching an accident to chronicle, for the police
                            worked indefinitely with the committee to keep the carriages in line and
                            the public from under the wheels. And here we may state that Major
                            Vernon Jarvis and Capt Tecci deserve great praise for the excellent
                            handling of the proceesion. The Ghezireh Casino, the hotel avenue, and
                            the paths road the lake were gaily deoorated, at least three bands were
                            playing, two as a rule together, the Inniskil- lings in the band-stand
                            and the Blue Hunga- rians in the casino, in front of which was the
                            semi-circular space reserved for the members of the committee of fetes,
                            flanked by stands which were full of spectators by 3 p.m. Other stands
                            from which and on which a heavy fusillade of flowers and confetti was
                            kept up, had been erected opposite the casino, and tea, which was
                            apparently much appreciated, was served in the control hall of the
                            casino itself. It would be impossible to give a full and ac- curate
                            description of the deoorations of the motors, dog carts, carriages, and
                            all kinds of vehicle that circled round the casino between 8.20 and 6
                            p.m. Most of them were abund- antly, some brilliantly,and a good few
                            tastefully deoorated.</p>

                            beautifully loco rated with white roses and lilac. then there was a
                            hansom, belonging to Mr. Dallioo, wreathed in green and violet, a
                            victoria deco- rated with orange and purple, and another with powdered
                            coachmen and heaped with white flowers, crowned by an urn full of white
                            roses, and decorated with pale lemon yellow ribbons, belonging to M.

                            parasol-shaped cover hung with Chinese lanterns, a victoria begarlanded
                            with pink and white roses; in which a very majestic Indy held up a white

                            orange hood fastened above it, M. Micbo let’s camels in gorgeous

                            bieb, and M. Cattani’s brake, a mass of cream and rose. Such were some
                            of the prize winning.carriagee in the procession Naturally enough, Cairo
                            society, Euro pean and native, was largely represent ed,and had the
                            weather been better the gardens of the Ghezireh Palace would have been
                            even more crowded, aud also the terrace, where multitudes of visitors
                            had tea. The committee deserve every congratulation ot the success of

                        <head>THE FITZNER QUARTETTE.</head>
                        <p>The Fitzner Quartette gave their first concert at Cairo on the 3rd inst
                            at the Continental HoteL Tbe programme was excellent and the performance
                            very good. Chamber music is so infrequent in Cairo that adequate
                            performances thereof are a real godsend. the programme consisted of
                            Mozart's quartette (B flat major), a largo by Smetana, a sherzo(Brandts
                            Buys), and Beetheven’s quartette (Eminorop. 99 no. 2),"—a most
                            interesting selection.The Mozart is peculiar- ly, delightful for its
                            minuet and adagio, which last was admirably rendered. There were moments
                            when the performers were perhaps the least bit too energetic, too apt to
                            “handle" the music ; but they certainly gave all the finish which this
                            quartette requires. The Brandts Buys sohorzo was delightfuL both for
                            itself end for the rendering, and a most charm- ing (one would almost
                            say amusing) melody, daintily given. The Smetans, on the other hand, was
                            a carious, interesting piece, unusoal for the individual treatment of
                            the instra- ments and for the development of the phrases : it formed a
                            strange contrast to the 1 preceding and succeeding pieces. The Beethoven
                            was one of these quartettes to be grateful for a great quarrett. The
                            molto agadio is a splendid movement, and the allegretto also. Here
                            perhaps we might bint that there was a suspioion of “roughness” in the
                            treat- ment; the leader seemed shrill at times, almost too sudden in
                            attack. Let us say at once that Herr Walther is a most pleasing cellist
                            he plays really artistically, and gives a great perfection of tone. As a
                            last “encore" and favor, Boccherini's minuet in 'Sordini' was given; and
                            here perhaps the four executants showed at their very best, presenting
                            with the atmost grace and delicasy its delightful," haunting rhythm. We
                            cannot refrain from expressing a wish that programmes should be of some
                            “non-crumpling" material; for instance, cardboard! In a quartette the
                            least sound or rustle is more than noticoable: and, appre- ciative as
                            the audience was, there were moments, especially at the very beginning
                            of movements, when there was a perceptible look of that absolute silence
                            so necessary to bring out and enhance the attraction of chamber music.
                            We certainly recommend all lovers of music to attend the other
                            performances of this quartette: we feel confident that they will be
                            amply rewarded in the enjoyment provided thereby.</p>
