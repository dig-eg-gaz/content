                        <p>HAs not the time arrived for a stereotyped spelling of the names of towns
                            and villages in Egypt! The present variety is more con- fusing than
                            pleasing. The Journel Officiel often contains several spellings fo the
                            same place according as the name is being used by the Public Works,
                            Railway, Finance or other administraion. Nor is an administration always
                            uniform in its method, for the Railway Administration sometimes exhibits
                            in time- table, telegrphic guide, tickets, station home- boards, and
                            lamps all the various forms of spelling. Here are some illustrations of
                            variety taken from official sources:Kalioubieh, Galiou- bieh, Qualiubia;
                            Guzieh, Guiza, Giza; Kena, Keneg, Qena; Assiout, Assyut, Assiut; Ebchan,
                            Ebshan, Ibshan; Barqnaqs, Barknaks. When names can be found
                            indifferently under the inital K Kh H C G or Q it is quite a labor to
                            consuly an index.</p>

                        <p>Some years ago the Indian Government adopted a uniform system of spelling
                            on the Hunterian method, to prevent confusion, and it is quite time the
                            Egyptian Government did the same. The stereotyped form could be left to
                            the Survey Department, who have already nearly completed a survey of
                            Egypt embracing every single hamlet, or ezbeh, ezbet, isba, izba, izbit.
                            This department could issue a general index, and also a geographical
                            list with mudiriehs, districts, villages, esbehs. It would be of much
                            use in fixing exact name and locality. Press notices of village
                            occurrences are at times very vague as to locality. Teh el Baroud, often
                            erroneously called Tel, is now spelt Stai el Baroud on Survey maps. The
                            names of natives is a great source of error, and a properly-spelt list
                            would be of much ser- vice. A native's identity is at times lost in the
                            vagaries of spelling.</p>

                            inst., as arranged. The 22nd inst is the date now definitely decided
                            upon. Mr. Felix Powell has once more kindly undertaken the management of
                            the box-office, which will be opened on Tuesday next, 9th inst, at the

                            sending best wishes for his success in his new sphere of labor. The

                        at Khartoum on the 3rd inst, the inspection being very therough aud lasting
                        long hours</p>
                    <p>At 8.30 p.m. the Duke and Duchess, with the Princesses and suite, attended
                        the Agri- cultaral and Industrial Show at the Zoologi- cal Gardens, where
                        all sorts of Sudanese products and examples of native work. were exhibited.
                        The Royal visitors were greatly interested in the examples of native handi-
                        craft, and purchared several trophies, silver ornaments, etc.</p>
                    <p>A garden party on the same day was attend- ed by all the British officers and
                        officials and was followed by a dinner at the Rifle Brigade mess.</p>
                    <p>On the morning of Saturday a most suc- cessful parade was hold of the British
                        aud Egyptian troops in garrison at Khartoum, under the command of Lewa Henry
                        Pasha, C.B. The troops who paraded consisted of the 2nd Battalion Rifle
                        Brigade under Lieut-CoL Wilson, the Egyptian Cavalry and Artillery, and two
                        Intantry Brigades composed as follows</p>
                    <p>1st Brigade: 2nd, 3rd, and 7th Battalions. 2nd „ 4th, 5th, and 16th Sudanese.
                        H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught telegraphed to H.H. the Khedive his
                        satisfaction at the performance of the troops, and expressed to the
                        Governor-General his high approval of the bearing, steadiness, and
                        efficiency which they had displayed.</p>
                    <p>According to the Meteorological Observatory at Helonan, a sun-spot was
                        visible in Cairo on Friday last with the naked eye. This spot is said to be
                        one of the largest ever open, and it is supposed to be the resultant of the
                        group of small spots which were visible in the early part of last month. The
                        appearance of this great spot seems to give a good opportu- nity for
                        investigating the very interesting pro- blem of the connection between
                        sun-spots and magnetic storms on the earth, and it would be interesting and
                        helpful if practical telegraphists would put upon record any interruption
                        caused in their work on Friday, when the spot reach- ed the centre of the
                        disc.</p>

                        begins at 9 p.m. All complaints as to delay in receiv- ing the "Gazette''
                        should be addressed to the Local Director of the Cairo Post Office. A number
                        of complaints would be obviated if letter-boxes were put up at the main
                        entrances of subscribers' houses.</p>
                    <p>Excellent arrangements, brilliant decoration, carriages, dogcarts, and
                        what-not, beflowered and begarlauded, deserved something better than the
                        weather that chilled Cairo yesterday. the morning was overcast till about 10
                        a.m., then it cleared only for a cold and dust-laden wind to bring the
                        clouds up again, and-shortly before 3 p.m. rain began to H. Thencefor- ward
                        showers came down intermittently till close on 6 o'clock, and theugh it
                        cleared later the air was always raw and chilly. The crowd of spectators
                        was, none the less, large and good-tempered. There was nothing approaching
                        an accident to chronicle, for the police worked indefinitely with the
                        committee to keep the carriages in line and the public from under the
                        wheels. And here we may state that Major Vernon Jarvis and Capt Tecci
                        deserve great praise for the excellent handling of the proceesion. The
                        Ghezireh Casino, the hotel avenue, and the paths road the lake were gaily
                        deoorated, at least three bands were playing, two as a rule together, the
                        Inniskil- lings in the band-stand and the Blue Hunga- rians in the casino,
                        in front of which was the semi-circular space reserved for the members of
                        the committee of fetes, flanked by stands which were full of spectators by 3
                        p.m. Other stands from which and on which a heavy fusillade of flowers and
                        confetti was kept up, had been erected opposite the casino, and tea, which
                        was apparently much appreciated, was served in the control hall of the
                        casino itself. It would be impossible to give a full and ac- curate
                        description of the deoorations of the motors, dog carts, carriages, and all
                        kinds of vehicle that circled round the casino between 8.20 and 6 p.m. Most
                        of them were abund- antly, some brilliantly,and a good few tastefully
                        deoorated.</p>
                    <p>“Hors Coneours” was Omar Bey Sultan's tonneau, shaped like a swan,
                        beautifully loco rated with white roses and lilac. then there was a hansom,
                        belonging to Mr. Dallioo, wreathed in green and violet, a victoria deco-
                        rated with orange and purple, and another with powdered coachmen and heaped
                        with white flowers, crowned by an urn full of white roses, and decorated
                        with pale lemon yellow ribbons, belonging to M. Sursock, Khayat Bay's motor
                        with fan-shaped golden-green screen and parasol-shaped cover hung with
                        Chinese lanterns, a victoria begarlanded with pink and white roses; in which
                        a very majestic Indy held up a white dove perched on or at tached to her
                        wrist, a dogcart with a purple and orange hood fastened above it, M. Micbo
                        let’s camels in gorgeous trappings, palanquin and a fair freight, one of
                        which bore a mushara bieb, and M. Cattani’s brake, a mass of cream and rose.
                        Such were some of the prize winning.carriagee in the procession Naturally
                        enough, Cairo society, Euro pean and native, was largely represent ed,and
                        had the weather been better the gardens of the Ghezireh Palace would have
                        been even more crowded, aud also the terrace, where multitudes of visitors
                        had tea. The committee deserve every congratulation ot the success of the
                        fate despite inclement weather and for their excellent and well-concieved
                        arrangements.</p>

                    <p>It is hereby notified that owing to the ap- pearance of Cattle Plague in the
                        Sudan, the exportation of cattle from the Sudan into Egypt, via Halfa, is
                        prohibited until further notice.</p>
                    <p>The exportation of cattle from the Sudan from Suakin into Egypt, via Suez, is
                        permitted for the present under the same conditions as these regulating the
                        importation of cattle from Syria.</p>

                    <head>THE FITZNER QUARTETTE.</head>
                    <p>The Fitzner Quartette gave their first concert at Cairo on the 3rd inst at
                        the Continental HoteL Tbe programme was excellent and the performance very
                        good. Chamber music is so infrequent in Cairo that adequate performances
                        thereof are a real godsend. the programme consisted of Mozart's quartette (B
                        flat major), a largo by Smetana, a sherzo(Brandts Buys), and Beetheven’s
                        quartette (Eminorop. 99 no. 2),"—a most interesting selection.The Mozart is
                        peculiar- ly, delightful for its minuet and adagio, which last was admirably
                        rendered. There were moments when the performers were perhaps the least bit
                        too energetic, too apt to “handle" the music ; but they certainly gave all
                        the finish which this quartette requires. The Brandts Buys sohorzo was
                        delightfuL both for itself end for the rendering, and a most charm- ing (one
                        would almost say amusing) melody, daintily given. The Smetans, on the other
                        hand, was a carious, interesting piece, unusoal for the individual treatment
                        of the instra- ments and for the development of the phrases : it formed a
                        strange contrast to the 1 preceding and succeeding pieces. The Beethoven was
                        one of these quartettes to be grateful for a great quarrett. The molto
                        agadio is a splendid movement, and the allegretto also. Here perhaps we
                        might bint that there was a suspioion of “roughness” in the treat- ment; the
                        leader seemed shrill at times, almost too sudden in attack. Let us say at
                        once that Herr Walther is a most pleasing cellist he plays really
                        artistically, and gives a great perfection of tone. As a last “encore" and
                        favor, Boccherini's minuet in 'Sordini' was given; and here perhaps the four
                        executants showed at their very best, presenting with the atmost grace and
                        delicasy its delightful," haunting rhythm. We cannot refrain from expressing
                        a wish that programmes should be of some “non-crumpling" material; for
                        instance, cardboard! In a quartette the least sound or rustle is more than
                        noticoable: and, appre- ciative as the audience was, there were moments,
                        especially at the very beginning of movements, when there was a perceptible
                        look of that absolute silence so necessary to bring out and enhance the
                        attraction of chamber music. We certainly recommend all lovers of music to
                        attend the other performances of this quartette: we feel confident that they
                        will be amply rewarded in the enjoyment provided thereby.</p>
