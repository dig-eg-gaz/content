                <p>THE FINCAIAL SITUATION.</p>
                <p>The deep-tooted distrust with which thinking men of all classes have been brought
                    to regard the finance of the London County Council will not be lessened by the
                    recent debate in the House of Lords. It has been the usual custom to treat the
                    Bill, by which that body receives annually its borrowing powers, as a private
                    measure, and to allow it to pass undebated through all its stages. This year it
                    occurred to Lord Camperdown that a Bill which placed £19,000,000 at the disposal
                    of the councillors in Spring gardens deserved at least some words of explanation
                    from Lord Welby, the chairman of the Finance Committee. The London County
                    Council is very remarkably situated in all matters regarding expenditure : it is
                    under the supervision if no department of Government, and though its annual
                    estimates are required to be “considered and approved” by its Finance Committee,
                    this requirement is habitually disregarded. Warnings and remonstrances by the
                    eminent specialists who serve on the committee are laughed at and set aside
                    whenever they point to economy, land the presence of men like the late Lord
                    Lin-geo, like Lord Welby, like Sir Francis Mowatt, at the Council board has
                    ceased to be any guarantee of the reasonableness or security of the Connoil’s
                    undertakings. Last year an ex-chairman of the Council declared, with doe sense
                    of his responsibility, that its commitments were appalling, and that he looked
                    upon the future with the gravest apprehensions. Even since then matters have
                    gone from bad to worse. The costly failure of the river steamboat service is no
                    longer a matter of dispute; the enormous expenditure on tramways is booming
                    rapidly jeopardize! by the development of the motor omnibus; the Electric Supply
                    Bill threatens an immeasurable vista of extravagance in the near future; the
                    Council is about to embark upon the erection of a costly Hotel de Ville, which
                    is ostentation dy intended as a rival for the Houses of Parliament; its finance
                    is still juggled in a way which renders it almost hopeless to distinguish
                    between loss and gain; and the cost of its building operations is still
                    systematically and grossly under-estimated. </p>
                <p>The spokesmen of the Council in the Upper House scarcely attempted to deny these
                    allegations ; nor could they refuse to admit that be credit of the richest city
                    in the world has sunk in the money market below that of Birmingham and
                    Manchester. All that Lord Monkswell could do was to point to the fact that the
                    ratepayers had steadily maintained the dominant faction in power. Unfortunately,
                    it is too true. The criminal apathy of the Unionist voter has saddled the London
                    ratepayer with the Old Man of the Sea, from which it seems that he can never
                    shake himself loose. And neither age nor responsibility have taught moderation
                    or wisdom to the Radicals and Socialists at Spring-gardens: the leading members
                    have strengthened their position by obtaining seats in Parliament, and the
                    purses of the Londoner who has got anything to be robbed of are literally at the
                    mercy of a band of brigands. But, apart from the sufferings of individuals, this
                    matter of municipal extravagance, of which London offers the most flagrant
                    example, is fast becoming an Imperial question of the first magnitude. The
                    piling op of local loans, the reckless handling of local finance, is rapidly
                    affecting the national credit. The diminishing power of expenditure among the
                    rank and file of the population is combining with a well-grounded fear as. to
                    the security of many of the undertakings upon which their capital has been
                    adventured. However much the export and import returns may be cited, there has
                    never been in our modern history such an otter stagnation and depression in all
                    public securities. The “City, * to use a conventional term, has never gone
                    through such times since the Baring crisis in 1891, and men of the largest
                    experience and the highest reputation in we financial world are weighed down
                    with the gloomiest anticipations. On the one hand, they see the municipal bodies
                    throughout the kingdom refusing absolutely to cat their coat according to their
                    cloth, or to take any notice of the diminished financial capacity of the
                    country. On the other hand, they have a Government in power-which seems utterly
                    callous at . to the delicate condition of affairs both in oar own colonies and
                    among the great Powers of the world. With the exception of Sir Edward Grey,
                    there is not a Minister who can open his mouth without increasing the general
                    unrest. ( Globe’.)</p>

                    applied the brakes and succeeded in stopping the train in time to prevent a
                    disaster. The shock caused by the sadden stopping of the train caused a panic
                    among the passengers, and a number of them attempted to proceed on foot to
                    Meshta, which was not far distant. The train staff, however, succeeded in

                <p>LONDON, Monday, July 16.</p>
                <p>Five battalions of Turkish reservists have mutinied at Hodeida. Over 300 were
                    killed or wounded in attempting to suppress the mutiny. A Turkish general has
                    been condemned by a court-martial and shot for provoking the revolt.</p>
                <p>The “Times” has received the following from the Imperial Ottoman Embassy :— </p>
                <p>"A telegram from Aden, published by some London papers on the 2nd inst., stated
                    that 16 battalions of Turkish reserves mutinied in Yemen and set out for Sana,
                    demanding to be sent home; that the commander-in-chief ordered the forts to open
                    fire on the mutineers, who surrendered after hundreds of them had been killed;
                    that a certain rebellious Imam’s forces were advancing, and that a battle was
                    reported with heavy losses on both Bides.</p>

                <p><hi rend="bold">NATIVE PRESS OPINION.</hi></p>
                <p>After giving several reasons for believing that there is no religious fanaticism
                    in Egypt, “Al-Ziher” writes : What fate is in store for us ? That is the
                    question over which the public are now brooding. Some people seem to be of the
                    opinion that the Anglo French Agreement bas given “new” colour to the Egyptian
                    question, and made many 0atomans and Egyptians imagine that England is getting a
                    firmer hold in Egypt, and that this fact will lead to the conclusion of an
                    agreement between Turkey and Great Britain, whereby the former Power might
                    assent to the administration of Egypt by the latter ; preserving for herself the
                    sacred right of suzerainty over this country, which should continue to pay her
                    the usual tribute, as is the case in Cyprus under the control of England; and
                    that Egypt will, at last, be in a position to obtain an administrative
                    independence. But we are of another opinion. Egypt, which lies — as an
                    isthmus—between Constantinople and Mecca, enables the power that gets a firm
                    hold of it to spread its influence not only over Africa but also over Asia. The
                    Ottoman Government is aware that the Mohamedan world sympathises with it not
                    only because it is a Moslem Government, but because of the religious prestige of
                    the Caliph and guardian of the Imamate, the defender of the two holy shrines of
                    Mecca, the two Kiblahs. Turkey is aware that the European governments have
                    surrendered themselves to a policy of unlimited ambition : so that if one
                    foreign power possesses Egypt, the neighboring countries— Syria, El Irak, Yemen
                    and the Hedjtz will be exposed to great danger. Therefore, it will be impossible
                    for Turkey to agree to surrender the administration of Egypt to England. Good
                    judges are of opinion that England will not create a serious change in the
                    general policy of the world on account of Egypt. It will be not benefit her to
                    declare a protectorate over Egypt. Such a declaration will, on the one hand,
                    show that the British Government haB broken its promises, and perhaps set forces
                    in motion that may lead to unpleasant results, and, on the other hand, will
                    produce no new benefit to England. The imaginary protectorate can never add
                    influence and strength to the absolute authority which the English practice
                    nowadays in Egypt, but will cost them dearly in trouble and expense.
                    Consequently, neither England nor Turkey nor Egypt can benefit by the alteration
                    of the present state of the latter country ; and it we consider that a state
                    will never lead an absolutely monotonous and unchanging existence ad infinitum,
                    that the temporary occupation of Egypt will lead to no danger to Turkey, and
                    that no agreement concluded between governments can be regarded as permanent,
                    and that, after all, the general ignorance now prevailing in the Orient will
                    Borne day vanish and be replaced by enlightenment—if we consider all these
                    Lets', we mast perforce conclude that the day will come when Egypt will be
                    released from its political restraints and restored to Turkey, its first
                    controller ; and when England will oblige the Egyptians by withdrawing the
                    occupation from this country.</p>

                <p><hi rend="bold">SYMPATHY WITH ENGLAND.</hi></p>
                <p>The statement made in the House of Commons by Sir Edward Grey on native unrest in
                    Egypt has aroused great interest in France, and sympathy with England is
                    generally felt in the most influential circles, as difficulties with which
                    Britain has to contend in this country are fully understood and appreciated. As
                    the “Standard’s” Paris correspondent aptly remarks, time was when Frenchmen
                    might have been inclined to rejoice in England's difficulties, to be sarcastic
                    over the result of twenty odd years of British administration ; bat those days
                    have gone by, and, besides, it ie well, though not generally, known that France
                    in the north-western portion of the African continent ia face to face with the
                    same mysteriously moving danger. The movement which is taming the peaceful,
                    laborious fellaheen into fanaticaripe for mischief is not confined to Egypt; it
                    is not merely racial in origin.it is a religious upheaval felt all across
                    Northern Africa, and likely to be more violent among the warlike tribes of the
                    French Sudan than among the unmartial peasants of the Nile.</p>
                <p>“I have (the correspondent adds) heard many strange tales about its inception and
                    its development, and particularly about the secret support given to it by a
                    Christian Power. I do not wish to pass .for a mischief maker between England and
                    Germany, bat at the risk of so doing I must say that it is the latter power
                    against whom the accusation is brought of fostering a Pan-Islamic movement As
                    indisputable evidence, the action of her diplomacy at Constantinople, her
                    intrigues in Syria and Asia Minor, and especially the interference of the
                    Emperor in person in favour of the Sultan of Morocco are mentioned. But it is
                    further stated that her agents in Morocco, in Algeria, in Tripoli and in Egypt
                    are so directly implicated that they are actually engaged in helping the spread
                    of an anti-Christian agitation. An official in the German Legation at Cairo is
                    especially mentioned as beiDg a particularly active occult director of the
                    movement.</p>
                <p>“Whether these latter statements be true or not I cannot say, but I have heard
                    them from men whose word is not to be taken lightly. It is certain, however,
                    that Germany has encouraged Turkey against the Powers, and has emboldened
                    Morocco to flaunt France; by so doing, she has encouraged, if not kindled, a
                    spirit of resistance in the Mohamedan mind to all Christian authority.</p>
                <p>The French press, too, supports the firm attitude adopted by England in the
                    matter of the Pan-Islamic movement. </p>
                <p>The “Figaro” says :—The cause which the British are defending in Egypt, whether
                    in the interior or on the Turkish frontier, is the cause of civilization. This
                    cause is the more particularly ours, inasmuch as we have so many Mussulman
                    subjects. The telegrams say Sir E. Grey’s tone was grave. Events have proved,
                    and will prove, that he does not exaggerate the seriousness of the situation. It
                    is not by chance that Turkey has violated the Persian and Egyptian frontiers,
                    and it is certainly not by chance that other incidents are occurring elsewhere.
                    The visit of the Emperor William and the protection accorded by Germany to the
                    Sultan of Morocco have everywhere awakened Mussulman fanaticism, encouraged Pan
                    Islamism and inspired barbarians with fresh hopes against civilization. Every
                    country most take measures, as Great Britain has done in Egypt, to prevent the
                    spread of the movement, and each must be on its guard.</p>
                <p>M. Dombasle declares in the “Siecle” that to show pity for the Egyptian assassins
                    would lead adversaries of the British domination to believe they had the
                    sympathies of politicians in London—an illusion that would be dangerous.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">"A FELLOWS-FEELING."</hi></p>
                <p>The Paris correspondent of the “Pall Mall Gazette” writes:—An eloquent silence
                    has fallen upon the Press in respect of Egypt, with one or two exceptions. No
                    one speaks of it. It is not difficult to imagine what the comments would have
                    been like a few years ago. Now there are two influences to restrain—one the
                    Entente, the other a fellow-feeling engendered by the problem in Morocco. The
                    Arab, especially of the nomadic tribes, is a very different man from the
                    fellaheen who under normal conditions has very little fighting staff in him.</p>
                <p>Moreover, students of British Colonial methods know that revolt has very little
                    chance of success whilst a man of the calibre of Lord Cromer is at the head of
                    affairs in Egypt, and the general direction of foreign policy in the hands of
                    Sir Edward Grey. The Press is generally responsive to the higher political
                    necessities of the Quai d’Orsay. Now, it is against the interests of the moment
                    to stir no international strife; the Legislature, concerned with placating
                    advanced and Socialist opinion, is directly opposed.</p>
                <p>Egypt is a hornet’s nest for this reason : that, in examining the situation there
                    you are almost bound to come to certain definite conclusions of a disquieting
                    nature. The revolt of the fellaheen is but a symptom of a general sickness that
                    has spread across the whole of Northern Africa. The first outward manifestation
                    was Algeciras. Briefly, the “agent provocateur” is abroad, and revolt, whether
                    amongst the Arabs or the Egyptians, is to be traced to a certain Power, whose
                    conversations at Constantinople have borne their expected fruit That, at least,
                    is the view taken by serious observers here.</p>

                <head>FRENCH NATIONAL FETE.</head>
                <p><hi rend="bold">CELEBRATION AT ALEXANDRIA.</hi></p>
                <p>H.E. Mustapha Pasha Ibadi, Governor of Alexandria, exchanged official visits on
                    Saturday with M. Pierre Girard, who held a reception at the French Consulate.
                    Patriotic speeches and toasts were received with remarkable enthusiasm, and the
                    health of M. Failures was drunk amid acclamations.</p>
                <p>At 8 p.m. the official banquet took place at the New Khedivial Hotel, M. Girard
                    presiding. The leading members of the French colony were present at a very
                    animated and successful function.</p>
                <p>Numerous French commercial establishments were brilliantly illuminated on
                    Saturday evening, among them the Credit Lyonnais, the French Club, the Comptoir
                    National d'Escompte, etc.</p>
                <p>The Casino at San Stefano was crowded on Saturday night, and the whole of the
                    interior of the Casino building brilliantly decorated with the flags of all
                    nations and brightly illuminated. The Greek Philharmonic Society’s band played
                    with remarkable vigour during dinner, and on its temporary departure the Bracale
                    orchestra appeared, and a vocal and instrumental concert followed. In spite of
                    the inevitable noises that proceeded from the crowded Casino, the songs were
                    audible and much appreciated.</p>
                <p>The concert over, the public streamed out on to the terrace and the cinematograph
                    began to flicker. Oar French friends will excuse us if we say that the series of
                    views to which we were treated suggested a Bonapartist demonstration. To begin
                    with, we saw the "Little Corporal,” or someone sufficiently like him, reviewing
                    his grenadiers near the Pyramids. Then came a ball under the Directory, in the
                    midst of which the Greek musicians, who had reoccupied the baed-stand, attacked
                    the “Marseillaise” with stunning vehemence. Scenes from Austerlitz send the
                    Russian campaign, with the famous episode of the sleeping sentry, followed, and
                    the death of the Emperor and emblematical tableaux representing the pest—all
                    fire and sword—and the future depicted under the guise of a floral iete.</p>
                <p>Then game the fireworks, and when at 11.30 p.m. blue, green, and red Catherine
                    wheels revolved vigorously to the strains of the “Mattchiche,” the fete had
                    reached its height. </p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">AT CAIRO</hi></p>
                <p>At Cairo all the Diplomatic Agencies and Consulates flew their flags in honour of
                    the anniversary and the tricolour was everywhere in evidence in the streets. At
                    10 a.m. M. Nettement held a reception at the French Consulate, which was
                    followed by a similar function at the French Diplomatic Agency, where M. de
                    Valdrome did the honours.</p>
                <p>In the evening a gala performance at the Zaitoun and Rod-el-Cafe CM chantants and
                    ietes at the Kasr-el-Nil terrace and at the Ambassadors were largely attended

                <p>Yesterday morning, at 10 o’clock, a reception was held at the French Consulate,
                    which was attended by the members of the French colony.</p>
                <p>In the afternoon, at Terre Plein, opposite the club, in a well decorated
                    enclosure, a gymkhana took place. The programme principally consisted of
                    childrens,’ ladies,’ and gents’ potato-races, and also of several other sports,
                    for which prizes were distributed to the winners.</p>
                <p>In the evening dancing commenced at 9.30 in the club room, which was largely
                    attended. The ball was kept up to a late hour, when the Suez guests returned by

                <p>JULY SKYE MEETING</p>
                <p>Saturday’s Skye Meeting was a very agreeable function. The weather was of the
                    pleasantest, and there was a fairly large gathering of the public in the
                    enclosure. There were seven races on the card, and the greatest interest was
                    taken in all. Most of the look was with Khalil Pasha Khsyat, who won four of the
                    seven events, Ibrahim Bey Cherif winning two others. Betting was fairly animated
                    and the prices realised in several cases were quite tempting, especially in the
                    July Plate, in which Kordofan rewarded his backers by a 31 to 1 chance. The band
                    of the R. Dublin Fusiliers played a choice selection of music during the
                    afternoon, which was greatly appreciated. The following are the details of the
                    various events:</p>
                <p>NOVICES RACE of P.T. 1,560, viz: P.T. 1,250 to winner and P.T. 250 to 2nd horse.

                <p>Tezkar jumped off at the start, but had almost immediately to give place to
                    Zeibeck, who made all the running. Coming out of the catting he was leading the
                    field by 8 lengths and, never being challenged, won in the easiest fashion by a
                    couple of lengths, half-a-length separating second and third. Time: 1.25.</p>

                    way home, winning as he liked by a couple of lengths. Marco coming out of the
                    cuttting tried to get on terms with him, but could not make any impression and
                    was placed third, half a length behind Dallez. Time 1.10.</p>
