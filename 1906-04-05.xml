                <div type="item"> <head>The Housing of Officials</head>
                    <p>The Government has decided to make an experiment of a decidedly bold character in housing its higher officials. An official commu- nication to the Press, after mentioning the inadequacy of the house accommodation now existing at Cairo, and the consequent embar¬rassments of officials with fixed incomes whose rents have been raised often to prohibitive figures, states that the Ministry of Finance has decided to proceed forthwith to the construc- tion of a few experimental houses at Ghezireh to be let to Government servants at rents representing an adequate return on the capital expended. The rents, from £150 to £200 per annum in the case of the houses and from £100 to £120 in the case of two sets of flits, will of course be beyond the means of any bat the better-paid officials. The. Government is aware that the experiment will not benefit the smaller ' officials, and expresses the hope that private enterprise will supply their needs, and makes special reference in this connection to the Abbassieh Oasis Co., which has bean granted a concession on very favourable terms for the creation of a suburb beyond Ahbassieh. Should all else fail the Government will be compelled to consider what steps can be taken to ensure a (equate housing accommodation for this class of its servants. The proposal has been criticised with great severity by the greater part of the - European and native Press, and we believe it s to be regarded with disfavour by a large num¬ber of educated Europeans and natives, among them many officials, who consider that the smaller officials and those occupying an in¬termediate position, whose embarrassments from the deficiency of suitable houses and from high rents are proportionately greater, should have been the first to benefit from any such scheme on the part of the State.
                    </p><p>We are quite ready to admit that the higher an official’s pay the greater the jealousy with which he is regarded, and that this sentiment may have inspired some of the criticism which has been bestowed on the scheme. But we consider that the authorities have not examined the scheme from the point of view of the man who will not benefit by it. If an official, he will argue that the embarrass¬ments of men earning from £800 to £2000 a year are as nothing to those of the function¬aries earning half or less than half of those amounts. If his temper is at all unangelic he will probably go farther and speak of favour-itism, with gestures and epithets, inspired by his irritation. Now we do not share the opinion of our hypothetical official, but we do consider that before taking this step the Government might have taken the public into its confidence. It would then have realised that the scheme was not likely to prove popular with any but a very limited class of public servants. As it is the authorities seem tons to have spoiled a good scheme by beginning at the wrong end. We quite understand that the general rise of prices and the lack of ac¬commodation affect functionaries in all bran¬ches of the public service, and that the diffi-culty of aiding the large number of petty employes has not been overstated in the recent official community. But we feel that a section, at all events, of the small or inter-mediate employes—married men with large families and good records for choice—deserved first aid. An officer with a simple bullet wound can give op his place in the ambulance to a private who has had the misfortune to stop some fragments of a shell, without loss of dignity, and we cannot help feeling that some of the victims of iniquitous rents might similarly have waited their turn with¬out very grave inconvenience. Moreover, a scheme that only aids officials who can afford to pay rents of from £150 to £200 a year is bound to Be misinterpreted. The Govern-ment has already been accused of raising up caste distinctions between the various classes of offi¬cials, of unduly favouring the British employes, who are certainly expected to benefit the most from the scheme, and of neglecting the com- | plaints of the poorer functionaries. All these criticisms may be refuted. “Suave mari magno, etc.,” has never been the motto of the 1 present Administration. But it is-a fair ques¬tion whether it was worth incurring them.

                    <p>There was told in Paris last week a moving story of how the Louvre is kept supplied with the mummies of ancient Pharaohs. The embalm¬ed remains of primitive kings have done very well in their own tombs, but the process was never intended to stand the ordeal of light in a glass case in a modern museum. Hence the mummies gradually fall to pieces, and as the supply of genuine Pharaohs fails, it has to be supplemented Cargoes of nameless mummies are shipped to France and are kept in the vaults of the Louvre to be brought out surrep-titiously as wanted to replace that of some historical personage whose bones have frittered away under the action of a northern atmosphere. This kind of substitution is carried out in the early hours of the morning and a correspondent of a Paris journal was on Wednesday week pri- vileged to assist at it.

                <p>Championship Won By Greek Athlete.</p>
                 <p>It may safely be said that the most absorbing topic discussed at the annual meeting of the Alexandria Amateur Athletic Club yesterday on the A.S.C. grounds was- the weather. And many were the aspersions cast on the Clerk of the Weather, who had so ill-favoured the great sporting event of the year in our town. Certainly the climatic conditions were of the most unseasonable charc-ter- cold, raw, and windy, with ominous clouds which obscured the warming sun's rays at intervals and made everyone shiver. After the boisterous weather of the past two days it was feared that we might have rain, but though the rain kept off, providentially, the wind did not abate and it was a moot point whether half a gale or a khamseem was preferable. However, the choice was not given to the committee, who had to do the best they could with half a gale. The wind was conducive to fast times and the times of the different races compared very favourably with those of some years past, albeit the spectators would have preferred it other-wise. There was a large attendance of the public, though not quite as large as we have seen on previous occasions. Many, no doubt, especially the ladies, were deterred from coming by the unfavourable state of the weather, which was not conducive to a due display of now spring frocks,and though, as one spectator remarked, the grandstand was a 'galaxy of color', we have seen it look much brighter than it was yesterday. The ground bore a gray appearance, with flags and banner flying in every direction. Among those present we noticed some officers belonging to the American cruiser Brooklyn and the Austro-Hungarian Squadron.</p>
                    <p>Athletically, the meeting was a great success, the one blot being the poorness of the entry in the quarter-mile race. This must be a count-ed for by the fact that the race is of such a punishing character that men running subse-quently in the half-mile prefer to give it a wide berth. It was with regret that we noted the very poor reponse to the one event open to all comers- the obstacle race. The Clerk of the Course had put his whole back into the arrang-ing of obstacles. The result was most pleasing to the eye and should have afforded unlimited amusement to the spectators. Only four, however, turned out for the race instead of the fifteen or twenty we have generally seen. The tug-of-war, too, was confided entirely to the "Dublins". "A" team winning the final after a pull of about four minutes. The Alexandria police failed to put in an appearance for their match with the fire brigade, who were given a walk-over. In the open 100 and 220 the handicappers gave Aly Fahmy Ahmed a task just a little beyond his ability, fine runner though he is.</p>
                    <p>Reverting to the club events, we have with much regret to report an accident to J.R. Lees, last year's champion. He has been doing exceedingly well in practice this year and gave indications of possibly repeating his performance of last year. After getting a second from scratch in the 150 yards, he won the 100 from a 1-yard penalty, but in the winning of it, in fact, just after passing the post, he fell heavily and so injured his collar-bone that he was unable to take further part in the sports. But for this accident we might have seen a keen competition for the championship. E. A. Willmott, from short marks, was successful in the two sprint handicaps and came in a very good second in the 100 yards. He would have made a bid for Lord Cromer's Cup had he entered for more events. The champion of the day was E. Tsaloumas, an exceedingly good all-around athlete. He won all the jumps and the hurdle race and was second in putting the shot. His points numbered 28 and his nearest opponent was Willmott with 19. Tseloumas is a Greek who has youth on his side. He is going to Athens for the Olympic games and we wish him success, although he will come in contact with a different class of opponents in the jumps. He is a useful runner also, but for some reason or other did not enter for the sprints. The result of the sports might be called a Greek invasion, as besides the all-round success of Tseloumas we have to chronicle a magnificent "put" of 37 feet 7 1/2 inches in the shot by Veranakis. This is better than has been done for about twenty years, the nearest to it in that time being 36 feet 6 inches-also by a Greek, Valissarides. We must not omit the mention of Tseloumas' jump of 20 feet 4 inches, which beats by two inches the record for the course. In the half-mile there were ten runners. Peel, last year's winner seemed to crack up early against the wind and J.D. Carver off the 40 yard mark came in a few yards ahead of Blythman (scratch), who was confidently expected to win. Blythman in his turn was a good way in front of Wallace. The journey down to the hurdle almost in the teeth of the wind militated against fast time being done but 2 minutes 12 1/5 seconds was very fair. The Veterans' Race was the best seen for many years, and the large entry is encouraging to the continuance of the event on the programme. Gooding, from a long start, was too speedy for the rather heavily penalized Freeman, a dual winner of this race, and he romped in a fairly easy winner. Burrill, also penalised, was a good third. The Children's Race, a most popular event filled very well and afforded plenty of amusement. Lillian Cheva-ier, a 6 year old, got in a yard in front of Marion Percival, with Lionel Burrill, a chip of the veteran, a few inches behind. The handi-cappers, who have very thankless tasks to undertake, did their work uncommonly well, as the judges and referees can testify, the finishes in the sprint handicaps giving them something to think about.</p>

                    <p>Madame Girard presented the prizes with a few graceful words of congratulation to the winners. Mr. Haselden called for three cheers for the champion, which were very heartily given, his success being especially gratifying to a large number of his compatriots. Mr. Gould proposed three cheers for Mme Girard for her kindness in giving away the prizes, and on the call of M P. W. Carver, the clerk of the course and the hoc. secretary were similarly honoured. By the kindness of Col. Bird, D.S.O., and. the officers of the Dubline, the regimental and the fife and drum bands played selections during the afternoon. The prizes were, as usual, very handsome and well-chosen, reflecting credit on the prize committee. The following are the results of the different competitions

                <div type="item"> <head>A CONSTITUTION FOR EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>SHEM EL-BAKRI AND LORD</p>
                    <p>DUFFERIN.</p>
                   <p> The “open letter,’’ which Sheikh el Bakri has addressed to the Prince of Wales on the subject of a constitution for Egypt, is based in great part on the celebrated Report of Lord Dufferin. Bat the establishment in Egypt of a system of representative government as Lord Dufferin summed up in his 'Synopsis of Proposed Egyptian Institutions” will never be possible in Egypt as it is contrary to the fundamental ideas of the Oriental, for even the most modified form of Parliamentary system baa not, and is never likely to have, the slightest chance of taking root in a country like Egypt. None of the other reforms suggested by Lord Dufferin were so Utopian as this. In nearly all other matters be not only laid his finger at once on the ailing spot, but the remedies he suggested, if frequently incapable of immediate application, were al-ways sound in themselves and have in many instances been subsequently applied.
                    </p><p>Lord Milner’s criticism of the proposals of Lord Dufferin, whereon Sheikh el Bakri bases in great measure his arguments, are much to the point The passage run as follows :— “He was right in not despairing of the ultimate independence of Egypt; he was right in effort. But on the other hand, he certainly glossed over the deep-rooted obstacles which his scheme of reform was bound to encounter, and above all the length of time which would be required to accomplish it. His rose-coloured picture of an Egypt ‘un¬-trammelled’ by external importunity, though aided by sympathetic advice and assistance,’ of the Egyptians governing themselves on civilized principles without an irritating.and exasperating display of authority on our part, though ‘under the uncompromising series of our friendship,’ was exactlv united" to hit the pre¬vailing taste, both in Egypt and Great Britain.
                    </p><p>It flattered the self-importance and the shallow Liberalism of the Pachas, always ready to sym¬pathise with reforms, until they began to come home to them in the shape of harder work, diminished license, and fewer opportunities of self-enrichment. I was no less grateful to the British people in their honest desire to play the part of guide, philosopher, and friend to the people of Egypt, but to play it cheap. And it the same time it concealed from both parties he disagreeable side of the business : from the Egyptians, the long period of irksome control and training through which they would have to pass on their [gap] to a civilised independ-¬ence ; from the English, the corresponding period of close attention to the affairs of Egypt and the effort, anxiety, and risk which such attention involved.”

                    <p>A Renter’s telegram despatched from Con-stantinople last week gives some remarkable samples of Turkish diplomatic manoeuvres. The telegram states : —
                    </p><p>Although the Turkish Ambassador in Lon-don has been instructed to infirm Sir Edward Grey that the Tabah question is now under consideration, and will be settled at Constan¬tinople at the two last Ministerial Councils, and at the meeting of the Committee of Minis¬ters to-day, the question was not even dis- cussed. Thus it is dear that Turkey is skeptical on the subject of Great Britain’s resolution to proceed to coercive measures, no doubt owing to the long patience of the British Government.
                    </p><p>Tue Porte at the present moment appears to be manouvring to maintain the semblance of negotiations at Constantinople in order to avoid  a settlement of the question on the spot. In Turkish circles it is declared that a temporary telegraphic interruption prevents communic-ation with Akabs, and has delayed the receipt of the report of the Turkish Commissioners who were sent to the spot.

                    <p>Port Said, Tuesday.</p>
                    <p>H.E.  the Governor.</p>
                    <p>Ample evidence of the popularity of H.B Mustapha Pacha Ibadi has been given by the vents of the last few days. Reference has I ready been made to the great regret with which the news of his Excellency’s transfer to Alexandria was received. It is true that his new appointment is a promotion, and as such it as been duly celebrated ; but the approaching departure of "our Pacha” is very keenly felt, and expressions of regret are as numerous as ley are sincere. Ibadi Pacha was doubly popu-lar. He was popular on account of his genial personality, and popular again for the good work he has done.
                    </p><p>On Wednesday a banquet was given in his honour at the Savoy Hotel, among the guests being : Khalil Bey Riad, Fawzi Bey Montii, Dimitri Bey Macar, Selib Claudius, Bimbashi Bonelli, Snow Bay, Messrs. Delany, Dupont, Philippides, Aly Bey Leheta, and Ahmed ley el Sanabari. Speeches were made by Khalil ley Riad, Judge Macar, Sanabari Bey, Leheta Bey, and others, all uniting in congratulating be Pacha on his promotion and referring to is many successes. His Excellency replied in few well-chosen words thanking all for the kindness they had shown him. Schalch Bey and Dixon Bey were unavoidably absent.
                    </p><p>On Saturday evening a banquet, offered by the Consular Corps and European notables, took place at the Eastern Exchange Hotel, over sixty persons being present, including the Consuls, officials, all the managers of banks and firms, and many notables of the foreign colonies. Consul General Cameron, in a sin- gularly happy speech, referred in glowing terms to his Excellency’s successful term of office here and expressed the feelings of all Port Said very correctly by saying that “Alex- andria’s gain is our loss." He then called upon the Greek Consul to propose the toast of his Excellency, which was drunk with much enthusiasm. Other speeches by Khalil Bey Riad, Fawzi Bey Moutii, etc, followed. His Excellency made an appropriate reply, and it was evident that he was much touched.
                    </p><p>In recording these agreeable functions it is only fair to say that some of the success which attended them was due to the excellent arrangements made by the managements of Savoy and Eastern Exchange Hotels.

                    <p>How that the Chatham incident may be con- sidered as closed, I am in a position to affirm that the wild rumours regarding fabulous urns having been voted to Mr. Harris, the eminent metallurgical chemist to Messrs. No¬els, who conducted the explosion of this vessel, are unfounded. It is not true as stated in some papers, that Mr. Harris received cheques of £3000, etc. What he did receive from the Suez Canal Co. was one sixth of that sum. Together with a handsome present in the shape of a very fine example of the silver-worker’s art, a silver tea service, with suitable inscription thereon.

                <div type="item"><head>THE EGYPTIANT DEPARTMENT OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM.</head>
                    <p>An important and long required work of re arrangement is now in progress at the British Museum. The great central ball of the Egyp-tian Department has remained in the same condition for nearly a century, and the way in which the various monuments were dumped for no other expression so well describes this confusion—rendered a systematic study of this archaeology impossible. Dr. E. A. W. Budge having completed the systematic arrangement of the galleries upstairs, has now begun the work of putting this saloon of the larger monu-ments in order.
                   </p><p> Many of the objects, such as huge gra-rnite arms and torsos, seem to have been chiefly exhibited to impress the visitors with the massive character of Egyptian monuments These will give place to works of real archaeo- logical importance. Having opened two year ago the vestibule, devoted to monuments of the period of the early dynasties, the large gallery will continue the sequence from north to south. There, will be many new exhibits including several important monuments from the excavations at Dier-el-Bahri. Chief among these will be the large Osiris statue of Amenemhat of the Twelfth Egy- tian Dynasty, B C. 2500, and the three statues of Userteren III., representing him in youth, middle, and old age. Monuments hitherto hidden in dark corners will be brought into prominence. Among these the statue of Kha-muas, the wonder-working son of Rameses II., the inscription upon which is of great interest. In the later portions of Ptolemaic and Ethiopian remains we may expect to see some of the results of Dr. Budge’s numerous visits to the Sudan. The rearrangement will in due course be completed by the publication of an illustrated guide.

                    <p>A GERMAN ENTENTE WHICH PROVEDABORTIVE.</p>
                   <p> The "Eclair” publishes the second part of M. Et-ienne Lamy’s article on Fashoda, the burden of which is that Marchand, triumphed over all obstacles of climate and otherwise, and being in a position to accomplish his mission of cutting the “English Cross,” had to desist and retire because the Delcasse policy had succeeded that of M. Hanotaux.
                    </p><p>Amongst the revelations of M. Limy is that in JUNE, 1898, M. de Munster, German Am-bassador, proposed to M. Hanotauxan entente, having for its object the protection of Portu- gal’s independence against England. This is described as a "small pretext, bat the beginning of a great accord.” However, M. Honotauxan and his colleagues went out of power, and with them went the policy which would have made an alliance with Germany possible. M. Deloasse gave effect to the radical "attach¬ment” to Great Britain, and Marchand was ordered back.
                    </p><p>France’s lost opportunities are thus present¬ed: If she had co-operated with Germany at the moment when England was menaced by Menelik in Abyssinia and Kroger in the Trans-vaal, she would have "gained the share she has irrevocably lost.” English "good sense” would have compromised rather than risk a conflict which might have imperilled her supremacy, M. Dalcesse and his colleagues are held to have been either guilty of a grievous mistake or a crime.

                    <p>ANOTHER QUESTION FOR THE POWERS TO DECIDE.</p>
                    <p>A Parisian newspaper states that as soon as the Moroccan Question is settled, Italy intends to raise the question of Tripoli in order to obtain Europe's recognition to her eventual rights over this territory.
                    </p><p>The agreements which Italy has concluded with France and England as to the Mediter¬ranean make it certain that her demands will not meet with difficulties in these quarters The opposition of Germany and Austria re mains to be overcome. They have been several times approached on the subject, especially under the Tittoni Ministry, but have so far always turned a deaf ear.
                    </p><p>The Cabinet at Rome now considers this moment favourable to push its aspirations and to this fact is largely due the replacement of Signor Pansa by Signor Tittoni as Ambassa-dor in London. 
                    </p><p>KASSALA SHOW.</p>
                    <p>The Kassala Correspondent of the "Sudan Times” describes the Agricultural Show held in that town early in this month. The vege-tables impressed visitors very favourably and it was declared by well informed persons that the Kassala vegetables were superior to those exhibited at the Khartoum Show The choicest came from the Governor’s garden and the gardens of the Mirghanis, who are taking at intelligent interest in the progress of agriculture in their province.
                    </p><p>The able Governor of the Kassala Province has made a local institution of the Show which was first established last year among many doubts as to its success. One hears so much of the fertility of the Kassala soil that by the time the railway line and the Gael irrigation works are completed it is hoped Kassala will receive its due share of the public attention.

                    </p><p>M. Gaston des Him, writing in the “Peti Marseillais,” asserts that at the forthcoming Universal Postal Congress, which is to take place in Rome, the Sultan, acting upon the suggestion of the Kaiser, will, through his representatives, request the abolition of foreign post-offices in Turkey. This would amount to the abrogation of one of the most important clauses in the conventions concluded by Tur-key with Great Britain, France, and other nations.	.	,
                    </p><p>In Constantinople there are British, French, Russian, and Austrian postal services. But there is no German postal service, the German Empire not having entered into any treaty with Turkey. 
                    </p><p>WHY MEN AVOID CHURCH.</p>
                    <p>Lord Nelson, presiding at the meeting of the Free and Open Church Association, said there was great controversy about why men did not come to church, but it was proved that they would come to special men’s services, and also to early Communion. His opinion was that if the sexes were divided, men on one side and women on the other, men would come to church. Men did not like intruding into a seat where there were three or four gaily dressed females. He had an experience of the kind at Eastbourne not long ago, and, although they did not take any notice of an old fellow like him, he thought a serious young man would have felt uncomfortable.

                <div type="item"><head>THE GATE OF ISLAM.</head>
                    <p>Whatever her sins in life may have been, in death Eve surely atoned for them. She died at Jeddah, so tradition says, and the spot is mark-ed by scattered buildings covering perhaps a hundred yards a bitter place for the end, where Eden had been the beginning. Most of the ports of the Red Sea, with the exception of Massowab, share the same characteristics. Whether they are as arid as Port Sudan or as squalid as Yambo, little is left to choose be¬tween them in their lack of attraction. But Jeddah is different, because there, as one watches the pilgrims disembark, and listens to the clamour that goes up through the sun¬light, the individual spirit of the city makes itself felt, and with it comes the certain know- ledge that this place is, as it always has been, the gate of Islam and of Mecca. The Frank feels that he is upon soil utterly strange to him and resentful of his presence, as he watches the precession go by, victim and conquerors, the mountaineer from Dibra, in Albania, rivalling the fzhan in his swagger, the truculent Mogrebbi who pushes the soft, richly dressed Javanese from the middle of the open road, the Chinamen who have shaved their cherished pigtails for the Hajj or the Bokharis who seem, with their pale faces to have strayed from some dream of Rip Van Winkle’s into the glare.
                   </p><p> During the season of the pilgrimage through¬out the city there is only one indifferent man, the ragged, lounging Turkish soldier who is not in a fury to reach Salvation and thirsty for the remission of sins which the holy places give to the true believer. On the whole, the order that he contrives to keep among the j amble of tongues and passions is good. Whether trouble occurs on the quay among the boatmen, or in the much-breathed air of the bazaars, where Hammals stagger under loads of red locusts, and the sunlight comes in shafts through the broken roof like red-hot lance heads, the stolid Turkish soldier is more or less on the spot, as much a foreigner as an English policeman, and, though not as monu¬mental, fairly effective. He shuffles along fingering a rosary that represents the 99 names of God, keeping order as he is told to do be- cause Jeddah is a Consular town. The Anato¬lian pushes and pulls, and in response to protests in many tongues answers pacifically, Come, my lamb,” and ultimately gets his way, so that little bloodshed occurs in the streets.
                    </p><p>The Consulates at Jeddah may be said to be purely philanthropic, except of course, where the Consuls themselves are concerned. Holland has her subjects from Java, Sumatra, and the West Indies to look to, Austria the Bosniaks  and the Moslems of Herzegovina, and Russia watches the interests of her subjects from the Caucassus and Bokhara, who, however, some- times prefer to be registered as Turkish sub- jects. Italy’s Consular agents ARE responsible for her profits from the neighbourhood of Messowah. France protects the pilgrims from Algeria, and England is occupied by her sub¬sets from several different quarters of the world. It is only Germany’s policy that remains is purely platonic-as the day when it was born, the Emperor’s famous declaration of affect-tion for and desire to help the thirty millions who profess the Moslem faith.
                    </p><p>Besides these purposes the Consulates serve to prevent the indecency of an open slave market. Although it is denied that there is inch a market today the trade exists and flourishes. Cargoes from Africa are run precarious-l y and as a speculation. The slave trade from the interior of Arabia, on the other hand, is is prosecuted unostentatiously either in markets outside the town or in the houses of brokers within the walls. Since the late revolt in the Yeman this trade has increased greatly, and :he price of slaves has gone down. Families that were once well-to-do have had their lands ravaged, and as a consequence have sold their children. The man or woman for tale is usually a black, or what may practically be described as such, but at the present mo¬ment many in the market are of the very fair type. All honour is due to the Consuls who prevent an open slave market in Jeddah, but the limited authority which is theirs does not empower them to forbid similar practical outside the walls.

                <div type="item"><head> USE OF IRON IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>There is no subject in the history of metals of more interest than that which relates to the early use of iron. Recent investigations prove that its application to the arts of war and peace extends farther book than was formerly thought to be the case; and it is easy to understand the failure to recognise its antiquity when we remember how great is its liability to change by oxidation as compared with its rival, bronze. Mr, Bennett H. Brough, in a very interesting lecture delivered at Glasgow last week, has brought together, within reasonable compass, most of the material facts bearing on the question and has added some interesting matter as the result of his own researches!
                 </p><p>   Iron was undoubtedly used in the building of the Pyramids, 3000 BC., the working of granite and porphyry being scarcely conceived without steel tools. There is in the British Museum an iron sickle which was found under one of the sphinxes at, Karnak, Mr. Brough mentions another historic piece of iron, also preserved in the British Museum. It is part of a tool and was found in the Great Pyamid, and so must be nearly 5000 years old. This is more interesting in the light of recent metal-lurgical practice, as it contains not only nickel, but also combined carbon, thus showing it is not of meteoric origin.

                <div type="item"><head>MONEY AND SHARE MARKET.</head>
                    <p>(FROM OUR FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT).</p>
                   <p> London, March 30.</p>
                    <p>The Money Market.</p>
                    <p>The markets are on the tip-toe of expectation. Some dealers, in fact, were so carried away on Wednesday -as to talk of the possibility of a reduction in the Bank rate. The state of tension which has so long existed owing to the Morooco difficulty having at last practically relaxed, and the immediate prospect of the disburse¬ment of a large portion of the Government hoardings, of course lent odour to the prospect of ease, and no doubt in normal times these would have been potent influences to that end. The governing factor, however, at the present moment is the Frennch exchange, which at 2.5 12 1/2 is a serious menace to our gold reserve With such a prospect to face, and bearing in mind the many new “issues” which are looming on all sides, the Bank directors are not likely to be unduly hasty in lowering the Bank rate, much as they may desire to meet the wishes of the commercial community.
                   </p><p> Money has been in great demand throughout the past week, and frequent resort has had to be made to the Bank of England. The market is still much in debit to that institution. Weekly loans command 3f%, and the India Council has renewed loans for a month at 8%.
                   </p><p> The coming week should see some measure of ease, and there is just a possibility of the Bank rate coming down, the discount houses apparently favouring this view. Three months' bills are being taken at 3 1/4% whilst the forward quotation is down at 3 1/8% for the same period, and the spot rate for six months at 2 1/8%. The Bank return, however, does mot lend itself to this easier outlook, for in spite of the fact that half-a-million has been received from abroad during the week, the reserve shows a decrease slightly in excess of that sum. The demand from the provinces for currency has been heavy, and the note circulation has expanded. The “Other Deposits” have increased by nearly a million, but this is offset by an increase in “Other Securities” of one-and-a-half millions. The Government deposits are still at the high figure of 18 ¼  millions.
                   </p><p> The Stock Markote-Consola.</p>
                 <p>   Idleness is still the ruling feature in the gilt-edged market, and the movement of Consuls has again been somewhat erratic. On Wednesday the price jumped 5/15 to 90 11/18 for cash 3/4 for the account, but the closing quotations to-night, 9 and 7/16 and 9 9/16 show little change on the week.
                    </p><p>Foreign Bonds.</p>
                   <p> In the international market the strength of Japanese bonds has been the ruling feature, and there has been large buying of these for the Continent. With perhaps one exception, the 1902 five per-cents, the price of all the issues is higher, the fours (being £ up at 91. Russians are steady, and close at 85 after being 85 1/2.	
                  </p><p>  Home Railways,</p>
                    <p> Lack of business” continues to be the com- plaint in this market, but, as “Truth” points out, the prospect of easier money should before long bring the recovery in the stocks that has been so long anticipated. The out¬look for home railway shares was never better than at the present; trade is splendid, and all the chief lines continue to report expand¬ing traffics “The Railways News" publishes a list of statistics which show that the aggre¬gate receipts of thirty-seven of the companies for the past eleven weeks of the current half- year amount to over 20 millions, an increase of nearly half-a-million, the North Eastern alone having an increase of 87,000. What better testimony could even the most timid investor require to the soundness of the 6 stocks and the prosperous future that awaits them ?
                    </p><p>Americans.</p>
                    <p>The remarks with reference to home railways may also be fitly applied to Americans. There, too, conditions are highly favourable to a boom, and the only deterrent is the pending strike of the anthracite coal miners. The fears of this have kept business to a somewhat moderate level, though yesterday the market -h -wed an appreciable increase of activity. Much of the shares are higher on last week’s quotations. Chicago’s showing an advance of nearly two points. The closing prose in the chief stocks are as follows: Aitchison , 96 1/8 ; Baltimore, 114 3/4 ; Canadian Pacific. 176 3/4; Chicago and Milwaukee. 181 1/4 ; Erie 45 x I. ; Illinois Cen-¬tral, 177; Louisville, 55 1/4; New York Central, 149; Penssylvania shares 71; Philadelphia and Reading. 69; Southern Pacific, 69 1/2.;Union Pacific, 158 1/2 ; Steel Common, 41 7/16;  Steel Preferred, 109.
                   </p><p> Egyptians.</p>
                   <p> The Egyptian market his been very quiet since our last, with the exception of Delta Land and Investment in which a large business has been done. The price of these has not moved, however, and closes at 3 3/8•5/8. Trust and Investment are firm at 5/8 buyers. Khedi-vial Mail Ordinary have been flat, and at times it has been impossible to get a bid, but yester¬day buyers came forward, and several thousand shares changed hands at 38s. National Bank of Egypt closed steady at 28 1/4, and Agri¬culturals at 10, the Debentures of the latter being slightly easier at 95. Daira Ordinary at 18 5/15, the Deferred at 107 and practic- ally unchanged. Delta  Preface are about 12 ½, Egyptian Markets 1 5/16, Salt and Soda 23. 6d, and Corporation of Western Egypt 7/8 premium. Daira Sugar are nominally 4 1/2. Egvptian Estates have fallen to 1 7/8-2 on the dividend of 2s, but the report is considered good, and should, if properly read, have raised rather than lowered the price. After all, the investors have got nearly 0 % per annum. Estates Deferred are 13^-13$. Bank of Rouma-
                </p><cb n="3"/><p>nia, after being flat at 9 sellers, close with a firmer tone at 9 3/4 buyers. Union Fonciere at 6 1/2 and Abyssinian Banks at 5/9 premium are quite unmentioned.</p>
                <p>Mining</p>
                    <p>The trouble in Natal, coming on the top of the other clouds hanging over South Africa, has farther increased the spirit of pessimism in the mining market, and dealers seem to be resigning themselves to the inevitable. There seems to be little prospect of a recovery for some time to come, unless the Government, as is unlikely, drop the bombastic and irrespon¬sible attitude they have so far taken up with regard to South Africa, and act with a little more reasonableness and common-sense. Rind Mines at 6$ and East Rands at 5 1/16 show no change on the week.
                   </p><p> In the Egyptian section Nile Valley have been distinctly better at 7s. 6d., presumably on the registration of the new Company, but close 6s. 6d.. Egyptian Mines are rather higher at 7[gap]. 61., but United African Exploration are unchanged at 1 1/4.
