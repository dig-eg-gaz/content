                            under that banner." This speech has caused
                            a sensation in political circles.</p>
                        <p>Lord Rosebery's remarks have caused the
                            utmost surprise in Liberal circles, recent
                            speeches of his having led to the supposition
                            that he fully intended to co-operate with Sir
                            Henry Campbell-Bannerman.</p>

                            <p>Reports from the provinces show that serious
                                risings of peasants in many country districts,
                                and of strikers in the towns, continue. The
                                employes here are enforcing a combined lock-
                                out because the workmen were practically
                                taking 8 hours per diem work.</p>
                            <p>The results of the congress of Zemstvos
                                appears to be that there is little chance of the

                                M. Witte.</p>
                            <p>The lock-out is rapidly assuming a general

                            <p>The sailors and a regiment of troops have
                                mutinied. Rear Admiral Pessrevaki was shot
                                and seriously wounded while haranguing the
                                men, whom he threatened to have shot down
                                by the troops. The mutineers have ordered the
                                Admiral in Chief to leave in three days. The
                                dockers have joined the mutineers and serious
                                rioting has taking place.</p>

                            <p>An official communique ascribes the mutiny
                                at Sevastopol to the Socialist propoganda. The
                                gravity of the situation is admitted, though it
                                is not expected that looting and plundering
                                will take place. It is rumoured that the disaffec-
                                tion is spreading among the naval battalions
                                here.</p>
                            <p>The most serious feature of the mutiny at
                                Sevastopol is the wholesale detection of the
                                troops, who apparently made common cause
                                with the mutineers. Only one regiment
                                remains loyal. Up to the present there have
                                been no excesses. The silence of the offi-
                                cial communique as to measure for the
                                repression of the mutiny is regarded as
                                confirming the rumour that the warships
                                are in the hands of the mutineers. The
                                revolt has been carefully prepared, and
                                deliberately carried out.</p>
                            <p>The Council of Ministers have approved the
                                proposal to grant 15,000,000 roubles to im-

                            Dufferin arrived at Suez in the afternoon
                            flying the Viceroy's flag. As soon as she drop-
                            ped anchor, she was dressed with flags. The
                            director of the Quarantine Office, accompanied
                            by two medical officers, boarded the Dufferin
                            on arrival and practique was given at 3 c'clock
                            when Mr. D.A. Cameron, British Consul,
                            welcomed Lord and Lady Curzon. Shortly
                            afterwards the Governor of Suez, accompanied
                            by the chief of police and others, paid his
                            lordship an official call.</p>
                        <p>At about 5.30 p.m. Lord and Lady Curzon,
                            accompanied by Lord Curzon's secretary (Mr.
                            Nathan), the Governor of Suez, Mr. Cameron,
                            and others, landed at the passport pier, and
                            proceeded to the railway station, where a
                            special carriage had been placed at their
                            disposal.</p>
                        <p>The train arrived at Suez station at 5.50;
                            a guard of honor was drawn up and saluted
                            the distinguished visitors. H.E. the Governor
                            of Suez presented Lady Curzon with a beautiful
                            bouquet of flowers, and at 6 p.m. the
                            train left the station amidst the cheers of the
                            spectators.</p>
                        <p>Lord and Lady Curzon proceeded to Cairo,
                            and, I understand, will join the P. &amp; O. Mon-

                    <p>Last Saturday witnessed the last public
                        act in the winding-up of the Daira Sanieh
                        Company, Limited- the final general meeting
                        of shareholders, called for the purpose of
                        having an account laid before them showing
                        the manner in which the winding-up has been
                        conducted and the property of the company
                        disposed of, and of hearing th explaination
                        of the liquidators, and to determine the
                        manner in which the books, accounts and
                        documents of the company and of the liquida-
                        tors should be disposed of.</p>
                    <p>The meeting was held at noon at the
                        National Bank of Egypt, Mr. F.T.
                        Rowlatt in the chair. There were fourteen
                        shareholders present in person, representing a
                        total of 645 ordinary shares, while a furhter
                        618 ordinary shares were represented by proxy.
                        The comparatively small amount of captial
                        represented was of course owing to the fact
                        that the great bulk of the shares of La
                        Societe Egyptienne de la Daira Sanieh, its 
                        successor.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rowlatt made a short explanatory
                        speech in the following terms:</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen,- This meeting has been called
                        to comply with the requirements of the Com-
                        panies Acts. It is the last step inthe liquida-
                        tion of the Daira Sanieh Company,- its ob-
                        sequies, in fact. As you are all aware, the Daira
                        Sanieh Company, Limited (which I will call the
                        Enlish company), by an agreement made in
                        March last, transferred to "La Societe Egyp-
                        tienne de la Daira Sanieh" the whole of its
                        assets of whatsoever description, subject of
                        course to its liabilities. In consideration of
                        this transfer, the English company received
                        fully-paid ordinary and deferred shares of
                        the Egyptian company, identical in every
                        respect with those of the English company,
                        and to a like nominal amount. The principal
                        duty of the liquidators consisted in giving
                        these new shares in exchange for the
                        share certificates and bearer warrants of the
                        English company- share for share. This ex-
                        change has been effected, and the shares of the
                        English company duly cancelled, with the
                        exception of a small number which have not
                        yet been presented for exchange. The holders
                        of these shares are, however, expected to come
                        in very shortly, and, until they do so, they will
                        of course receive no dividend. As you will all
                        understand, this transfer from the English
                        company to the Egyptian company did not in
                        itself necessitate the preparation of any
                        accounts, the operation consisting, if I may so
                        describe it, in taking the whole concern
                        out of one box and placing it in another-
                        the whole of the assets of whatsoever nature
                        after deduction of the whole of the liabilities.
                        It was, however, necessary to prepare accounts
                        in order to open the books of the Egyptian
                        company. These accounts, conssiting of a
                        balance-sheet and a profit and loss account
                        as at 8th July last, have been audited
                        by Messrs. Russell and Kerr, and are now
                        placed on the table. I will not read to you
                        the resolutions on which you are asked to
                        vote:</p>
                    <p>1. That the explanation of the liquidators
                        as to the method in which the liquidation has
                        been conducted and the property of the com-
                        pany disposed of having been received and the
                        accounts having been submitted, the same
                        are hereby approved and adopted.</p>
                    <p>2. That the books, accounts and documents
                        of the company and of the liquidators thereof
                        be forthwith handed over to La Societe
                        Egyptienne de la Daira Sanieh.</p>
                    <p>On being put to the vote, both resolutions
                        were carried unanimously on a show of hands.</p>

                        in our issue of last Saturday regarding the
                        contract signed at Cairo by Mr. Stangen, local

                        the necessary capital to meet the greatly in-
                        creased traffic that is expected from this
                        fusion the latter company has decided to
                        issue 5,000 new shares, which the Hamburg-
                        Amerika Line will take up at the price of
                        £5 each, or £1 premium. Of this sum £5,000

                        an important point in favor of the Anglo-

                        du Conseil, autre que feu le President,
                        ignoraient tout. Nous decouvrions une contre-
                        partie de ces effects consistant en traites
                        acceptees en blanc par la liquidation H. Say &amp;

                    <p>The reading of the report was followed by
                        a series of discussions. M. Fatica pointed out
                        that an important item in the company's
                        expenses, viz., the 2% guaranteed to the
                        shareholders of the Ibrahimieh Ploughing Co.,
                        did not appear in the balance-sheets drawn up
                        either by the experts of the controllers. Me.
                        Fatica's statement gave rise to some discussion
                        and was mentioned at his request in the
                        proces-verbal. Further points were argued for
                        a considerable time till M. Barois read the
                        first of them motions submitted to the meeting,
                        viz., "L'assemblee approuve les mesures prises
                        par le conseil d'administration en vue d'obtenir
                        le concordat preventif."</p>
                    <p>Me. Padoa Bey and several of the share-
                        holders criticised the motion with considerable
                        animation, while Me. Carton de Wiart insisted
                        on the necessity of arriving rapidly at a
                        decision in view of the coming sugar season.
                        A suggestion that two representatives should
                        be chosen to act on behald of the shareholders
                        at Paris and at Cairo was warmly taken up and
                        MM. Letort and Cozzika were selected.</p>
                    <p>The second motion read by M. Barois:
                        "Elle (l'assemblee) donne pouvoirau Conseil de
                        discuter les conditions du concordat eventuel
                        au mieux des interets sociaux, de conclure
                        definitivement les propositions concordataires
                        a soumettre aux creanciers et d'en obtenir
                        l'approbation en justice," provoked an animat-
                        ed and vigorous argument which was chiefly
                        marked by the anxiety of almost everyone
                        present to speak. There were many objectors to
                        the phrase "de conclure definitivement" and the
                        alteration "d'arreter definitivement" had to be
                        substituted. After a considerable amount of
                        discussion the following resolutions were
                        actually passed and the meeting adjourned at
                        about 6 p.m.:-</p>

                        du texte propose par le Conseil.</p>
                    <p>La deuxieme portait, dans le projet, les
                        mots: de conclure definitivement..." Le mot
                        conclure a souleve de tres vives pretestations.

                        qu'il esperait que la justice ferait une etiquete

                    <p>The reading of the report was followed by
                        a series of discussions. M. Fatica pointed out
                        that an important item in the company's
                        expenses, viz., the 2% guaranteed to the
                        shareholders of the Ibrahimieh Ploughing Co.,
                        did not appear in the balance-sheets drawn up
                        either by the experts of the controllers. Me.
                        Fatica's statement gave rise to some discussion
                        and was mentioned at his request in the
                        proces-verbal. Further points were argued for
                        a considerable time till M. Barois read the
                        first of them motions submitted to the meeting,
                        viz., "L'assemblee approuve les mesures prises
                        par le conseil d'administration en vue d'obtenir
                        le concordat preventif."</p>
                    <p>Me. Padoa Bey and several of the share-
                        holders criticised the motion with considerable
                        animation, while Me. Carton de Wiart insisted
                        on the necessity of arriving rapidly at a
                        decision in view of the coming sugar season.
                        A suggestion that two representatives should
                        be chosen to act on behald of the shareholders
                        at Paris and at Cairo was warmly taken up and
                        MM. Letort and Cozzika were selected.</p>
                    <p>The second motion read by M. Barois:
                        "Elle (l'assemblee) donne pouvoirau Conseil de
                        discuter les conditions du concordat eventuel
                        au mieux des interets sociaux, de conclure
                        definitivement les propositions concordataires
                        a soumettre aux creanciers et d'en obtenir
                        l'approbation en justice," provoked an animat-
                        ed and vigorous argument which was chiefly
                        marked by the anxiety of almost everyone
                        present to speak. There were many objectors to
                        the phrase "de conclure definitivement" and the
                        alteration "d'arreter definitivement" had to be
                        substituted. After a considerable amount of
                        discussion the following resolutions were
                        actually passed and the meeting adjourned at
                        about 6 p.m.:-</p>
                    <p>1.- L'Assemblee approuve la procedure en

                    <p>2. Elle donne pouvoir au Conseil de discu-

                    <p>Elle donne mandat special a M. l'Ingenieur
                        Letort de s'adjoindre aux Membres du Conseil
                        presents a Paris pour arreter avec eux les pro-

                        acceptation par M. Letort, elle donne le meme

                    <p>La premiere resolution est votee, on le re-
                        marquera, avec une modification significative
                        du texte propose par le Conseil.</p>
                    <p>La deuxieme portait, dans le projet, les
                        mots: de conclure definitivement..." Le mot
                        conclure a souleve de tres vives pretestations.
                        Un actionnaire a vote contre, en sioutant
                        qu'il esperait que la justice ferait une etiquete
                        sur tous les scandales.</p>

                        ete admis a suivre les operations.</p>
                    <p>La discussion avait ete si confuse que la
