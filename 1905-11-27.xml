                        ROSEBERY.</head>
                    <dateline>London, November 26.</dateline>
                    <p>Speaking at Bodmin yesterday evening, Lord Rosebery said that, n once more
                        hoisting the banner of Home Rule, and that in the most pronounced form, Sir
                        Henry Campbell- Bannerman is impairing the unity of the Free Trade party,
                        upon which victory at the elections depends. He would say emphatically,
                        explicitly, and once for all, "I cannot serve under that banner." This
                        speech has caused a sensation in political circles.</p>
                    <p>Lord Rosebery's remarks have caused the utmost surprise in Liberal circles,
                        recent speeches of his having led to the supposition that he fully intended
                        to co-operate with Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman.</p>

                            <p>Reports from the provinces show that serious risings of peasants in
                                many country districts, and of strikers in the towns, continue. The
                                employes here are enforcing a combined lock- out because the workmen
                                were practically taking 8 hours per diem work.</p>

                            <p>The sailors and a regiment of troops have mutinied. Rear Admiral
                                Pessrevaki was shot and seriously wounded while haranguing the men,
                                whom he threatened to have shot down by the troops. The mutineers
                                have ordered the Admiral in Chief to leave in three days. The
                                dockers have joined the mutineers and serious rioting has taking
                                place.</p>

                            <p>An official communique ascribes the mutiny at Sevastopol to the
                                Socialist propoganda. The gravity of the situation is admitted,
                                though it is not expected that looting and plundering will take
                                place. It is rumoured that the disaffec- tion is spreading among the
                                naval battalions here.</p>
                            <p>The most serious feature of the mutiny at Sevastopol is the wholesale
                                detection of the troops, who apparently made common cause with the
                                mutineers. Only one regiment remains loyal. Up to the present there
                                have been no excesses. The silence of the offi- cial communique as
                                to measure for the repression of the mutiny is regarded as
                                confirming the rumour that the warships are in the hands of the
                                mutineers. The revolt has been carefully prepared, and deliberately
                                carried out.</p>
                            <p>The Council of Ministers have approved the proposal to grant
                                15,000,000 roubles to im- prove the condition of the railway
                                men.</p>

                        <p>As I wired you yesterday, the R.I.M.S. Dufferin arrived at Suez in the
                            afternoon flying the Viceroy's flag. As soon as she drop- ped anchor,
                            she was dressed with flags. The director of the Quarantine Office,
                            accompanied by two medical officers, boarded the Dufferin on arrival and
                            practique was given at 3 c'clock when Mr. D.A. Cameron, British Consul,
                            welcomed Lord and Lady Curzon. Shortly afterwards the Governor of Suez,
                            accompanied by the chief of police and others, paid his lordship an
                            official call.</p>
                        <p>At about 5.30 p.m. Lord and Lady Curzon, accompanied by Lord Curzon's
                            secretary (Mr. Nathan), the Governor of Suez, Mr. Cameron, and others,
                            landed at the passport pier, and proceeded to the railway station, where
                            a special carriage had been placed at their disposal.</p>
                        <p>The train arrived at Suez station at 5.50; a guard of honor was drawn up
                            and saluted the distinguished visitors. H.E. the Governor of Suez
                            presented Lady Curzon with a beautiful bouquet of flowers, and at 6 p.m.
                            the train left the station amidst the cheers of the spectators.</p>
                        <p>Lord and Lady Curzon proceeded to Cairo, and, I understand, will join the
                            P. &amp; O. Mon- golia at port Said to-morrow for Marseilles.</p>
                        <p>The rest of the party remained on board the Dufferin, and will be
                            transferred to the Mongolia at Suez to-day.</p>
                        <p>Mr. D.A. Cameron accompanied Lord and Lady Curzon as far as Ismailia.</p>

                        <p>Lord and Lady Curzon arrived at Cairo late on Saturday from Suez and

                            guests of Lord and Lady Cromer.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday afternoon Lord Curzon went for a drive in Cairo, while those
                            who happened to visit the Zoological Gardens in the afternoon had the
                            pleasure of seeing Lady Cromer and Lady Curzon, looking very well. Lady
                            Curzon looked charming in a cream gown and black picture hat.</p>
                        <p>This morning Lord and Lady Curzon visited the Pyramids, and were expected
                            to pay a visit to the bazaars later. They will leave for Port Said by
                            special train at about 4 p.m. to-day.</p>
                        <p>We understand that Lord Curzon, although still feeling the effects of
                            overwork and anxiety, is in much improved health.</p>

                    <p>Last Saturday witnessed the last public act in the winding-up of the Daira
                        Sanieh Company, Limited- the final general meeting of shareholders, called
                        for the purpose of having an account laid before them showing the manner in
                        which the winding-up has been conducted and the property of the company
                        disposed of, and of hearing th explaination of the liquidators, and to
                        determine the manner in which the books, accounts and documents of the
                        company and of the liquida- tors should be disposed of.</p>
                    <p>The meeting was held at noon at the National Bank of Egypt, Mr. F.T. Rowlatt
                        in the chair. There were fourteen shareholders present in person,
                        representing a total of 645 ordinary shares, while a furhter 618 ordinary
                        shares were represented by proxy. The comparatively small amount of captial
                        represented was of course owing to the fact that the great bulk of the
                        shares of La Societe Egyptienne de la Daira Sanieh, its successor.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rowlatt made a short explanatory speech in the following terms:</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen,- This meeting has been called to comply with the requirements of
                        the Com- panies Acts. It is the last step inthe liquida- tion of the Daira
                        Sanieh Company,- its ob- sequies, in fact. As you are all aware, the Daira
                        Sanieh Company, Limited (which I will call the Enlish company), by an
                        agreement made in March last, transferred to "La Societe Egyp- tienne de la
                        Daira Sanieh" the whole of its assets of whatsoever description, subject of
                        course to its liabilities. In consideration of this transfer, the English
                        company received fully-paid ordinary and deferred shares of the Egyptian
                        company, identical in every respect with those of the English company, and
                        to a like nominal amount. The principal duty of the liquidators consisted in
                        giving these new shares in exchange for the share certificates and bearer
                        warrants of the English company- share for share. This ex- change has been
                        effected, and the shares of the English company duly cancelled, with the
                        exception of a small number which have not yet been presented for exchange.
                        The holders of these shares are, however, expected to come in very shortly,
                        and, until they do so, they will of course receive no dividend. As you will
                        all understand, this transfer from the English company to the Egyptian
                        company did not in itself necessitate the preparation of any accounts, the
                        operation consisting, if I may so describe it, in taking the whole concern
                        out of one box and placing it in another- the whole of the assets of
                        whatsoever nature after deduction of the whole of the liabilities. It was,
                        however, necessary to prepare accounts in order to open the books of the
                        Egyptian company. These accounts, conssiting of a balance-sheet and a profit
                        and loss account as at 8th July last, have been audited by Messrs. Russell
                        and Kerr, and are now placed on the table. I will not read to you the
                        resolutions on which you are asked to vote:</p>
                    <p>1. That the explanation of the liquidators as to the method in which the
                        liquidation has been conducted and the property of the com- pany disposed of
                        having been received and the accounts having been submitted, the same are
                        hereby approved and adopted.</p>
                    <p>2. That the books, accounts and documents of the company and of the
                        liquidators thereof be forthwith handed over to La Societe Egyptienne de la
                        Daira Sanieh.</p>
                    <p>On being put to the vote, both resolutions were carried unanimously on a show
                        of hands.</p>

                    <p>With refernce to the article that appeared in our issue of last Saturday
                        regarding the contract signed at Cairo by Mr. Stangen, local representative
                        of the Hamburg-Amerika Line, and the directors of the Anglo-American Co.,
                        for the amalgamation of their Nile tourist services, we are now informed
                        that to provide the necessary capital to meet the greatly in- creased
                        traffic that is expected from this fusion the latter company has decided to
                        issue 5,000 new shares, which the Hamburg- Amerika Line will take up at the
                        price of £5 each, or £1 premium. Of this sum £5,000 will be added to the
                        reserve and with the balance will be purchased two more steamers to be
                        delivered in time for next year's season.</p>
                    <p>We are also informed that no time limit has been inserted in the contract as
                        regards the deration of the amalgamation, which is an important point in
                        favor of the Anglo- American Co. After the close of the current financial
                        year, that is, on the 1st May next the name of the Hambourg-Amerika Lina
                        will be added to that of the Anglo-American Nile Steamer and Hotel

                    <head>THE SUCRERIES COMPANY. MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS.</head>
                    <p>The extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders of the Sucreries
                        Company was held in Cairo on Saturday at 4.15 p.m. and was largely attended.
                        M. Barois was in the chair, supported by the Hon. A.J. Davey M.M. Arbib,
                        Naus and Naville, Me. Carton de Wiart, shareholders and avecats acting as
                        proxies, or otherwise interested representing 52,000 add shares. Proceedings
                        opened with the reading of the report, the text of which we give in
                        full:-</p>
                    <p>Messieurs, nous vous avons conveques en Assemblee Generale pour vous exposer
                        en toute sincerite la situation de la Societe et vous demander de prendre
                        les mesures ur- gentes necessaires pour empecher la faillite qui
                        equivaudrait pour vous, Actionnares, a une ruine complete et pour les
                        Obligataires a une perte importante.</p>
                    <p>Nous n'avons pas a vous rappeler la mort tragiquede votre ancient President,
                        survenue le 27 Aout et les revelations qui s'en suivi- rent? Nous apprimes
                        l'echesnce prochaine de traites pour un montant de 24 Millions environ
                        acceptees par deux des Administrateurs dele- gues. Il fallait eviter a tout
                        prix les protets et la faillite, sauf a etudier ensuite de pres, les
                        consequences de cette charge imprevue.</p>
                    <p>Sur l'avis de nos Avocats a Paris et en Egypt nous demandions a etre admis an
                        benefice du Concordat preventif et le 19 Septembre nous obtenions un
                        judgement auto- risant les operations preperatoires a la decla- ration du
                        Concordat. La Juge-Commissaire nomma trois Controleurs: Sir Elwin Palmer,
                        Gouverneur de la Banque Nationale d'Egypte et Ancient Conseiller financier
                        du Gouverne- ment Egyptien; S.E. Harari Pacha, Directeur General de la Daira
                        Sanieh et ancien Directeur General de la compatabilite de l'Etat; M. Eugene
                        Debourg, Industriel Administrateur Delegue de la Salt and Soda. Il designa
                        aussi des Experts charges d'exeminer la situation.</p>
                    <p>Eu meme temps que les Experts s'occu- perent de l'elaboration de leuf
                        rapport, nous procedions, avec l'aide de specialistes designes par les
                        principaux groupes de creanciers et d'interesses a l'examen des charges et
                        des resources. Les traites dont le decouvert avait necessite le depot du
                        bilan etaient signees a concurrance de 18 millions par un des admi-
                        nistrateur-delegues; a concurrence de 6 mil- lions par l'autre, chacun
                        ignorant ce que l'autre avait signe. Le troisieme Admi- ni trateur-Delegue
                        et tous les membres du Conseil, autre que feu le President, ignoraient tout.
                        Nous decouvrions une contre- partie de ces effects consistant en traites
                        acceptees en blanc par la liquidation H. Say &amp; Co Mais vis-a-vis de tous
                        porteurs, nous etions responsables. Nos avocats ne nous laissent ancun donte
                        a cet egard.</p>
                    <p>Ce n'etait le qu-une des phases de ce que revela la mort de M. Cronier. On
                        reconnut alors que le groupement des resultats divers de l'industrie sociale
                        avec des operations de commerce et d'arbitrages executees sur une grande
                        echelle par M. Cronier, en dehors de tout controle, et reglees ensemble en
                        fin d'exer- cice, ainsi que le fait que l'ensemble avait tou- jours donne un
                        benefice apparent, avaient dissimule au Conseil d'Administration, comme a
                        vous-memes, le veritable situation indus- trielle.</p>
                    <p>Nous nous sommes preoccupes de determi- ner avec precision la situation
                        actuelle et ne croyons pourvoir mieux faire, que d'adopter le bilan dresse
                        par Messieurs les Controleurs. Il a ete serieusement etabli en dehors des
                        questions de personnalites et de polemiques irritantes qui interviennent
                        trop souvent dans l'appre- ciation d'une situation comme celle ui nous a ete
                        faite. Nous erons a meme de defendre completement ce bilan et ses bases des
                        discus- sions de detail.</p>
                    <p>Vous avez a decider aujourd'hui s'il y a lieu de laisser declarer la faillite
                        et liquider l'Actif dans des circonstances qui ne laissent absolu- ment rien
                        au capital actions, ou au contraire, de tenter par une reconstitution
                        financiere, et sous une direction sage et ecouome, de rememttre l'affaire
                        sur pied et tout en diminuant la perts actuelle de vous donner les moyens de
                        recupe- rer peut-etre une partie de ce qui a ete englouti.</p>
                    <p>Messieurs les Controleurs ont bien voulu se charger, en attendant que vous
                        ayiez donne pouvoir a vos mandataires, de le faire, de trausmettre certaines
                        propositions au Juge- Commissaire. La base essentielle est que- apres avoir
                        traite avec les creaneiers des diverses categories, vous receviez en echange
                        de trois actions actuelles, une action nouvelle con- courant aux resultats
                        de l'entreprise.</p>
                    <p>D'apres l'etat desnegeciations actueilement en cours a Paris nous pouvons
                        presumer que ce te combinaison sera maintenue de que'que feconque les
                        porleurs des traites Cronier, les Obligataires et la Daira Sugar Corporation
                        fixent, vis a vis les uns des autres, la maniere dont seront reglees leurs
                        creances respectives.</p>
                    <p>Vous recevrez ulterienrement que'que de- tails sur la situation toute
                        speciale de la Daira Sugar Corporation, resultant des contrats passes avec
                        elle.</p>
                    <p>D'autre part les Obligataires concentiraient dans le projet objet des
                        pourparlers actnels, une reduction de ringt pour cent sur le chiffre nominal
                        de leurs titres ce qui constitue une perte inferieure a 20% sur les pius
                        demission. Une reduction analoque est demandes aux porteurs des traites
                        Cronier.</p>
                    <p>D'ailleurs c'est a titre de simple renesigne- ment que nous vous indiquons
                        residonnees. Il ne s'agit pour le mement que de donner mandat d'obtenir si
                        possible un concordat aux meil- eures conditions pour ves creanciere et
                        vouer.</p>

                    <p>Vous serez eusuite convoques pour examiner le bilan definitif au 31 Octobre
                        1905 fin de l'Exercice social, elire au nouveau Conseil et prendre acte de

                    <p>The reading of the report was followed by a series of discussions. M. Fatica
                        pointed out that an important item in the company's expenses, viz., the 2%
                        guaranteed to the shareholders of the Ibrahimieh Ploughing Co., did not
                        appear in the balance-sheets drawn up either by the experts of the
                        controllers. Me. Fatica's statement gave rise to some discussion and was
                        mentioned at his request in the proces-verbal. Further points were argued
                        for a considerable time till M. Barois read the first of them motions
                        submitted to the meeting, viz., "L'assemblee approuve les mesures prises par
                        le conseil d'administration en vue d'obtenir le concordat preventif."</p>
                    <p>Me. Padoa Bey and several of the share- holders criticised the motion with
                        considerable animation, while Me. Carton de Wiart insisted on the necessity
                        of arriving rapidly at a decision in view of the coming sugar season. A
                        suggestion that two representatives should be chosen to act on behald of the
                        shareholders at Paris and at Cairo was warmly taken up and MM. Letort and
                        Cozzika were selected.</p>
                    <p>The second motion read by M. Barois: "Elle (l'assemblee) donne pouvoirau
                        Conseil de discuter les conditions du concordat eventuel au mieux des
                        interets sociaux, de conclure definitivement les propositions concordataires
                        a soumettre aux creanciers et d'en obtenir l'approbation en justice,"
                        provoked an animat- ed and vigorous argument which was chiefly marked by the
                        anxiety of almost everyone present to speak. There were many objectors to
                        the phrase "de conclure definitivement" and the alteration "d'arreter
                        definitivement" had to be substituted. After a considerable amount of
                        discussion the following resolutions were actually passed and the meeting
                        adjourned at about 6 p.m.:-</p>
                    <p>1.- L'Assemblee approuve la procedure en obtention du Concordat preventif
                        engagee par le Conseil d'Administration;</p>
                    <p>2. Elle donne pouvoir au Conseil de discu- ter les conditions du Concordat
                        eventuel au mieux des interets sociaux, d'arreter definiti- vement les
                        propositions concordataires a sou- mettre aux creanciers et d'en obtenir
                        l'appro- bation en justice;</p>
                    <p>Elle donne mandat special a M. l'Ingenieur Letort de s'adjoindre aux Membres
                        du Conseil presents a Paris pour arreter avec eux les pro- positions
                        concordataires et au cas de non acceptation par M. Letort, elle donne le
                        meme mandat a M.F.C. Dusseigneur.</p>
                    <p>Elle designe M.P. Cozzika pour suivre spe- cialment au Caire supres du
                        Conseil les nego- ciations relatives au dit COncordat Preventif.</p>
                    <p>La premiere resolution est votee, on le re- marquera, avec une modification
                        significative du texte propose par le Conseil.</p>
                    <p>La deuxieme portait, dans le projet, les mots: de conclure definitivement..."
                        Le mot conclure a souleve de tres vives pretestations. Un actionnaire a vote
                        contre, en sioutant qu'il esperait que la justice ferait une etiquete sur
                        tous les scandales.</p>
                    <p>Eufin apres une tres longue discussion on a nomme M. Letort mandataire at M.
                        Cozzika a ete admis a suivre les operations.</p>
                    <p>La discussion avait ete si confuse que la reunion avait ete declaree close
                        trois fois deja avant le dernier vote. On a leve enfiu la seance a 6

                    <head>THE NATIVE PRESS. LORD CECIL'S APPOINTMENT.</head>
                    <p>"All Express" says:- Lord Cecil Pasha, the new Under Secretary to the
                        Ministry of Finance, is well-known to be a brave soldier, but nobody know
                        that he is an economist or a financier. Such a new post as this under
                        secretaryship must be occupied by some one who has studied and practised
                        finance. The English are well aware that such should be the case, yet they
                        easily allow appointments of this character to be made in Egypt. We are much
                        surprised at such actions on their part, but our surprise will cease if we
                        remember that the English, who know how to educate capable men in every line
                        of business, yet consider Egypt to be, like India and other colonies, a
                        preliminary school for their intelligent young men. The English require more
                        financial officials of their own race in Egypt, and after some practice
                        those financial tyros will make a success of their business, thus preparing
                        themselves for the higher positions which are in store for them.</p>

                        heavy structural work appears to be finished, and carpenters are busy
                        finishing off the deck work. The stern carving is almost completed and the
                        moudling of the port side is being carved. The rail has still to go round
                        the flying bridge, but the bosses for the propeller shafts are well in hand
                        and the plating of the stern where it was altered is being replaced.</p>

                    <p>The great scheme for the Nile dam involved a survey to set up marks whereby
                        the rise of the Blue Nile could be annually ganged, and the surveying party
                        was accompanied by Dr. Hayes. The "The Source of the Blue Nile," Dr. Hayes
                        related his travels, and incidentally produced as account of Abyssinia as it
                        is to-day, its geography, ethnography, social customs, and religions,
                        collating his own experiences with those of previous travellers. The work is
                        illustrated by two maps and thirty-two pages of illustrations, and includes

                        University, has returned from Egypt, whether he came to photograph the
                        recent total eclipse of the sun. When the eclipse occurred nineteen pictures
                        were secured, made on plates giving the sun's diameter - a scale of 3.10
                        inches. The valuable negatives made by Professor Hussey in Egypt have been
                        sent to Lick Observatory, where they will be studied before the results
                        obatined by the expedition are made public.</p>

                    <p>We have received a copy of "Sunny Egypt," by George Vincent, M.D., (6s.
                        nett), which the author styles a "prescription taken in 17 doses." The book,
                        which is written in a bright and easy manner, without any attempt at
                        elaboration and profusely illustrated, opens with a short account of the
                        author's journey out, and is followed by an interesting and concise history
                        of the Ancient Egyptians. Through the succeeding "prescription" the author
                        treats his readers to graphic descriptions of the places visited during his
                        stay in the country and the manners and customes of the people. From the
                        first page to the last the book is full of interest, both to those who have
                        and those who have not visited the country, and we can heartily recommend it
                        to our readers.</p>

                        <p>Sir,- The state of the foot pavement in some of the main streets of
                            Alexandria is disgraceful. I was walking to-day in Old Bourse-street by
                            the corner where the new pavement joins the old pavement of St. Mark's
                            Building, when I feel down owing to the unevenness of the pavement,
                            which is quite three inches higher then that adjoining. A great many
                            people stumble at the same place owing to this disgraceful state of
                            things. It is entirely the fault of the Tanzim Department of the
                            Alexandria Municipality, which becomes more inefficient every day.- I

                    <head>EGYPTIAN COTTON.</head>
                    <p>Some interesting observations on Egyptian cotton have been communicated to an
                        American newspaper by Mr. L. Stinson, a native of Mississippi and a lifelong
                        cotton grower, who has completed two years' experimental cotton growing in
                        Africa for the British Government. He believes the drawbacks to successful
                        crops there are temporary.</p>
                    <p>In Souh Africa the Egyptian variety was killed by frosts. As a general rule,
                        only the tops of the same stalks would grow a better grade of cotton the
                        second year. In some places the stalks yielded cotton as late as the seventh
                        year, but the staple was poor.</p>
                    <p>In Egypt Mr. Stinson found the finest cotton in the world except the Sea
                        Island cotton, but the restricted area and poor machinery will always tend
                        to prevent Egypt from becoming a serious competitor of America. The
                        machinery there, especially the gins, are primitive, and really hard the
                        staple agyer it is gathered. According to Mr. Stinson, the staple in the
                        bolls is superior to the American.</p>
                    <p>The best grade of cotton raised by him in Rhodesia was classed as being worth
                        half a cent a pound higher than American middling, and the Egyptian variety
                        raised in the same territory equalled the best that is grown along the Nile,
                        according to a Portuguese buyer.</p>
                    <p>The Egyptian lands are owned by British interests, (sic) and land rents make
                        the cost of production excessive. Mr. Stinson believes that with the land
                        rents eliminated cotton can be produced more cheaply than in the South. It
                        is not an uncommon thing to find lands renting for $50 an acre through

                    <head>EGYPT'S EARLY MONARCHY.</head>
                    <p>At the last meeting of the Society of Biblical Archeology, held on the 8th
                        inst.- Mr. F. Legge in the chair- Prof. Flinders Petrie read a paper on the
                        'The Early Monarchy of Egypt.' He considered fully all the arguments of Dr.
                        Sethe's paper on the subject; he claimed, too, that Sethe had already
                        accepted the kings of the first and second dynasties as identified by the
                        author. But in the following points it was contended that Sethe's reasons
                        were not conslusive, and that other considerations lead back to the
                        arrangement previously arrived at. That the king Narmer is a predecessor of
                        Mena is shown by the style of the rapidly changing art of the time. Merneit
                        is not necessarily a queen, and if rejected as the fourth king of the first
                        dynasty, then a gap must be left there in the series. As to the pre-Menite
                        kings, it is highly probable that the kings who reigned before Mena were
                        buried at the capital- Abydos- and in the royal cemetery. In that cemetery,
                        at the earliest part of it, are tombs under and smaller than those of the
                        first-dynasty kings; in one tomb is the name of he Horus Ka, in another is
                        only the name of the Horus Ra, and scattered about are object with the names
                        of Zeser, Narmer, and Sma. Not one of these can be shown to have lived after
                        Mena and all of them agree with the character of kings before Mena. The
                        whole of the evidence of style and locality shows that these are part of
                        dynasty O. These later names of Kha-sekhem and Ka-ra were also shown to
                        belong probably to the place which the author had before assigned them.- The
                        Chairman said that the acceptance of Prof. Petrie's theories must depend on
                        evidence rather than on authority.</p>

                    <head>ON PAYING CALLS.</head>
                    <p>The most maddening of all the conventions which grip a man when he gets
                        married is that known as "paying calls." During the years of my bachelorhood
                        I do not remember even once "paying a call" on anybody, or any-body "paying
                        a call" on me. That is to say, I never was so foolish as to go to the house
                        of any person whom I did not really want to see, and no one was cruel enough
                        to inflict his society on me unless he has some definite reason for so
                        doing- business or social. True Jones and Smith often dropped in on me of an
                        eveing, and I on my part often dropped in on them. But that was because we
                        had things to say to each other, or wanted to be cheered up, or wished to
                        discuss plans of some sort. There was a genuine reason for our visits. We
                        were friend, and enjoyed each other's company. But when I got married I
                        found I had to receive visits from dozens of people whom I had no desire to
                        see whatever. Moreover, it was painfully evident in most cases that they had
                        no desire to see me. But it was their bounden duty to "Call on us," and our
                        equally bounden duty to "return the call." Why? I don't know. My wife
                        doesn't know either, though she pretends she does. She cannot give me any
                        explanation of this conduct of our neighbors; and, what is more, she object
                        if I hint that I have no desire to encourage them by following their bad
                        example. "Oh! but we must return their call," she says; "they'd think it so
                        odd if we didn't They'd never come to see us again." Which is precisely what
                        I am aiming at. I have no interested in common with them; I have no desire
                        to waste a quarter of half an hour once or twice a month holding forth to
                        them about the weather; and, besides, I know they are as bored as I am.
                        Would not they thank my, then, is I refrained from returning their call?
                        Ought not they to be rather grateful than otherwise at my
                        considerateness?</p>
                    <p>It is not as though one had any difficult in making friends. one finds
                        friends quickly enough- but not by paying calls. Indeed, I connot imagine
                        anybody ever being on friendly terms with people who pay calls. I could
                        never overcome my first feeling of repulsion for a person who had
                        deliberately forced his way into my house and stolen part of my afternoon
                        with chatter about nothing in general. I know quite well I shall never be
                        able to care for any of the individuals who have called on my wife and
                        myself, or any of those upon whom we have called. The mere fact that they
                        did call, and that we were forced to return their call, has made me dislike
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Now I ask a plain question: Is there, in the length and breadth of Egypt a
                        solitary man- one solitary man- who can honestly say that he enjoys paying
                        calls? Is there one out of all the thousands of masculine members of this
                        community? I reply without hesitation: Not a single one. Man's sense of
                        fitness has condemned the absurdity of called for centuries past. men have
                        paid calls with their wives or sweethearts under protest ever since calling
                        was invented. Inquire into the cause of any given call, and you will fine
                        that it is due to feminine influence. A yound man pays calls because his
                        mother forces him to do so, an old man because his wife insists. neither
                        young men nor old men would stir a yard across the street to pay a call if
                        womankind hadn't created the fashion.</p>

                    <head>A REVOLTING TRADE. REVELATIONS REGARDING GERMAN SAUSAGE.</head>
                    <p>German sausage is no longer a mystery. Evidence given at the trial of a
                        number of Berlin provision merchants for adulteration shows, says the "Daily

                        scraps fo refuse of all kinds of flesh, rancid butter, margarine, and
                        various other obnoxious ingredient were promiscuously cast into seething
                        cauldrons for the manufacture of the "finest Berlin sausages." When the
                        cauldrons were emptied six inches of sediment remained, "mostly sand and
                        filth."</p>
                    <p>Chemicals were used extensively to arrest putrefaction after it had set in,
                        and when tainted sausages were returned by customers an application of
                        chemicals made them all right again. The principal consumers were the
                        military authorities at the garrisons in Thom. Grandenz, Togar, Spandau,
                        etc. Tons of horseflesh sausage were purchased every three months, mized
                        with rotten pork, and sold as a speical delicacy.</p>

                            which the French army is armed. It is made of solid bronze, has a hollow
                            base, and tapers from 7.8 millimetres (equal to 315 inch) to a point,
                            being in appearance likened to "a well-sharpened pencil." It is claimed

                            Lebel rifle by 300 yards, with a corresponding flatness of trajectory.
                            It does not "set up" on impact with hard substances, and it is supposed
                            that it will leave a clean, easily cured wound. At a trial of its powers
                            the bullet pierced six two-inch planks, set fifteen inches apart, and
                            after that penetrated fully three feet into the hard clay butt. The
                            range was 40 yards, and the point of the bullet showed no signs of
                            impact. That would hardly be an advantage in savage warfare.</p>

                    <p>"I was unable to walk more than a few steps wihtout fainting, now could I get
                        upstairs without assistance. My lips and gums were white as paper. I grew
                        weaker and weaker, and painfully thin; my appetite vanished; my night were
                        sleepless, and all day I felt exhausted. Life became a wearisome burden. For
                        a long time I had the careful attention of skilful doctors, but no medicine
                        seemed to help me. Indeed, as years passed I grew worse, and fell into a
                        steady decline that nothing seemed to arrest. I only looked forward to
                        release in a consumptive's death. Then I refused to take more medicine, but
                        soon after was advised to try Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People, and
                        now I can truthfully say that it is solely through these pills I am to-day
                        well and hearty, and able to follow my employment in a cotton mill. As I
                        took the pills my appetite returned and sleep refreshed me. With the second
                        I had strength to leave bed and go downstairs, while a third bow completely
                        cured me."</p>
