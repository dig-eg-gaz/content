                    <head>TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1905. JAPAN'S FUTURE. </head>
                    <p>The “Times” draws attention to the fact that Count Katsura, the Japanese
                        Premier, has been addressing to the provincial governors he Empire some
                        words which point the way the employment of Japan’s activities in the
                        immediate future. The national energy, he told his hearers, must be so
                        directed as to effect an economic expansion and develop- ment commensurate
                        with the nation's victories. All the efforts which for twenty months have
                        been devoted to the successful prosecution of the war must now be
                        concentrated on carrying out the post bellum programme. It is same policy
                        that Count Okuma was enforcing the other day in the pages of an English
                        contemporary, and it is the only policy that can commend itself to a
                        sagacious Jap- anese statesman. There are signs already that it is beginning
                        to sink into the minds of the pie. The first outburst of excited indigna-
                        tion that greeted the peace terms is giving place to a business-like
                        consideration of the future. The amount of strong feeling which still exists
                        shows the strain that the Japanese have just gone through, and does all the
                        more honor to the self-control and far-sightednees which have enabled the
                        majority to triumph over the first pangs of disappointment.</p>
                    <p>The first section of the Japanese nation to grasp the rest opportunities
                        which peace has <cb/>brought within range is, naturally enough, the business
                        community. A piece of intelligence is reported which is in the highest
                        degree signi- cant of the future. A great trade combination, representing
                        eighty-one firms, and headed by the Japanese capitalist Mr. Iwade, has been
                        formed for the promotion of Japan’s industries and the expansion of her
                        foreign trade. We are told that it is based on the support of wealthy and
                        conservative elements; but, though it seems to have plenty of Japanese
                        capital behind it, its organisers have taken Okuma's wise advice, and
                        declare their readiness to co- operate with the capitalists of foreign
                        countries, Korea and China an the chief fields of enter- prise to which the
                        combination is going to de- vote itself. Here, then, we have the first big
                        move- ment to take advantage of the opportunities afforded by the peace. It
                        is directed towards the countries which Japan has thrown open to her own
                        industry, but which she has opened equally to the industry of all the world.
                        In Korea, of course, she has very large commercial interests already. Above
                        and beyond the volume of trade which she offers, Korea is of the utmost
                        importance to Japan as an outlet for her surplus population. The Japanese
                        people now number 60 millions, as against 40 millions in 1890. Expansion and
                        emigration are necessities. To Korea, where many Japanese havee settled, a
                        constant and still larger stream will continue to go, with all the more
                        confidence now that Japan’s predo- minance in the Hermit Kingdom is assured,
                        The development and civilisation of Korea, which Japan has taken in hand
                        already, coupled with the growing settlement of her people in the peninsula,
                        hold oat great prospects of commercial expansion. Bat it is safe to say that
                        all the chances of this kind which Korea offers are inconsiderable beside
                        the measure- less opportunities in China, where Japan, already a powerful
                        factor, will enter with in finitely greater prestige and resources after the
                        war. No one can yet attempt to estimate what will be the effect on China, in
                        many other ways than the merely commercial of the rise of this untiring
                        people at her gates if any Power can prevail on her to shake off her
                        lethargy and enter on the path of reform, it will be the Oriental Power
                        which knows the Chinese mind as no Europeans can hope to know it, and yet is
                        more sin- cere in its dealings with China than are most of them. The terms
                        of the peace and the scope of the new Anglo-Japanese treaty have shown the
                        Chinese that they have nothing in the way of territorial dismemberment to
                        dread from Japan. Nor will they have trade mono- polies, or more “spheres of
                        influence” wrung, out of them ; for Japan fought for the Open Deor, and by
                        the principle of the Open Door she is prepared to stand.</p>
                    <p>Equal opportunity in the Par Bast has been guaranteed to all nations, but
                        what kind of a people is it which has secured that guarantee Count Katsura
                        made no idle boast when he spoke to the provincial Governors of its "enter-
                        prising energy,” an energy possesed by the Japanese "in so remarkable a
                        degree.” The Japanese have asked nothing better than to be put on a fair
                        level with competing races. They know that, once there, the qualities of
                        intelligence, thoroughness, and vigour will place them ahead of many of
                        their rivals in peace. We have all wondered at the success of martial Japan,
                        bat we mast expect in the ensuing period to see industrial successes of her
                        part which will be no less surprising. She has to retrieve the temporary
                        economic losses of the war, and that conscioousness will lend fresh spar to
                        her at the beginning of her enter prise.</p>

                    <p>Esbekieh Gardens Theatre. -Judging by the large audience that nightly attend

                        become great favorites with the Cairene playgoing public. On Saturday the
                        three act comedy Monsieur le Directeur was played before a crowded and
                        enthusiastic house. Between the second and third acts Mlle Symiane-Val
                        entertained the audience with some songs from her extensive repertoire which
                        elicited hearty applause. Last night the Gardet company gave a special
                        benefit performance for the thousands I who have been rendered destitute by
                        the terrible earthquake in Calabria and the house was crowded in every part.
                        The artistes appear- ed to excel themselves for the occasion and their
                        efforts met with most hearly and well deserved applause. The piece staged
                        was La Marraine de Charley, which evoked much laughter. Daring the third act
                        Madame Bra- cale sang Giordano's "Andre Chenier" and Bizet's "Pecheur dee
                        Perles” in excellent strain, and the ever popular Mile Symiane-Val sang
                        "Sous les Bamboos," "Daos l’Oasis," and "Messanda” with her accustomed
                        vivacity.</p>

                    <head>STATE RAILWAYS REPORT. REPLY TO THE COMMISSION.</head>
                    <p>The report of the Board of Administration of the State Railways and
                        Telegraphs and the Port of Alexandria is of special interest, appear- ing as
                        it does a few months after the report of the railway commission presided
                        over by Lord Farrar. The chairman and the directors of the board were
                        evidently by no means insensible to the criticisms of Lord Farrar, Mr. Bury
                        and Major Le Breton, and at the conclusion of the report under the heading
                        "General” the reader will find their answer to the commis- sion. So
                        interesting is this reply that we felt that no apology is needed for the
                        reproduction of the more interesting passages of the direc- tors reply in
                        full.</p>
                    <p>“During the last four months of the year, a rapid and exceptional increase of
                        imports pro- duced an acute crisis in traffic at Alexandria and gave rise to
                        well-founded complaints. We had forseen the possibility of such a crisis,
                        though we had not anticipated so sudden an increase in trade, but we had
                        been unable to obtain funds in sufficient time to prepare for it. Since it
                        occurred, funds have keen placed at our disposal, which are, we believe,
                        sufficient to provide against so serious a crisis in future.</p>
                    <p>The commission presided over by Lord Far- rer, to which we have alluded, was
                        in Egypt when these difficulties were at their worst, and it was far from
                        easy for our officials to deal with the exceptional stress of traffic and at
                        the same time furnish the commission with the information they desired in a
                        complete and convenient form.</p>
                    <p>The commission criticised severely our sys- tem of signals. When the present
                        Board took office, they were at once struck by the defects of this system,
                        but owing to the many other works which urgently required attention, and the
                        enquiries and experiments which we con- sidered necessary before embarking
                        on a large expenditure, we did not seriously commence signalling work until
                        1903, in which year we gave large orders for appliances of the latest types.
                        The erection of these appliances only commenced in 1904, and the commission
                        seems to have based its opinion on installations which were unfinished, or
                        even—as at Kantara, which is cited by them as an example — which had not
                        been commenced.</p>
                    <p>The reasons which led us to adopt the electro pneumatic system for Cairo
                        station do not appear to have been fully explained to the commission.</p>
                    <p>The technical member of the commission expressed to us verbally a high
                        opinion of our signal engineer, Naghib Bey Shakour, which we share. We note
                        with pleasure the remarks of the commission on the ability and skill of Mr.
                        Husson, deputy chief engineer, who is entrusted with the difficult task of
                        strengthen- ing the railway bridges.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we cannot refrain from commenting on the remarks made both in the
                        report of the commission and in the press on the subject of the Permanent
                        Way Department. It is extremely easy to criticise this Department, it is
                        most difficult for any person not intimately concerned in the work to
                        realise the difficulties which have baset Mr. Cotterill's efforts to make
                        good the defects both of organisation and of maintenance which had resulted
                        partly from a long period of insufficient expenditure, partly from other
                        causes which we need not here discuss. Mr. Cotterill has ungrudgingly
                        devoted all his time and energy to the work ; he has done his utmost to
                        ensure economy, to defend the interests of the administration, and to
                        improve the position of his staff, espe- cially of the labouring class. No
                        one acquaint- ed with the alterations made daring his term of office, can
                        fail to recognize the improve- ments effected under his direction.</p>
                    <p>Much remains to be done, and we have been obliged to consider the
                        desirability of appoint- ing a succesor to him, whose powers have not been
                        affected by so long a period of work under trying conditions; but we feel
                        certain that if he leaves our service, his own staff and many in this
                        country who have been brought into contact with him, will join in our
                        sincere regret at his departure."</p>
                    <p>Whatever view be taken of the defence as a whole, (and it is certain to give
                        rise to some discussion) we feel sure that the references to Mr. Cotterill
                        contained in the last two para- graphs will be thoroughly appreciated by all
                        who have had an opportunity of watching Mr. Cotterill's work or of studing
                        his schemes for the benefit of the lower ranks of his staff and their
                        children.</p>

                    <head>THE CHATHAM EXPLOSION. TRANSPORT OF BLASTING MATERIAL.</head>
                    <p>A special train arrived at Alexandria from Aboukir shortly after 1 am.
                        yesterday. The train which had been specially chartered by Messrs. Thos Cook
                        and Sons was in charge of Hr. Harold Harris, P.C.S., the well-known expert
                        employed by Messrs. Nobel, and con- tained twenty-two cases of blasting
                        gelatine with other accessories which are to be employ- ed in the blowing np
                        of the SS. Chatham which will take place on Thursday. These cases, which had
                        been stored at Aboukir, were naturally handled with great care by all who
                        were responsible for their conveyance to the train and officials of the
                        Railway Admi- nistration were also on board the "special" to supervise the
                        operation and the transport of the cases to Alexandria. In the evening the
                        train left Alexandria station with Mr. Harris on board for Ras-el-Esh,a
                        station fourteen kilo metres south of Port Said, near which the electric
                        batteries which will ignite the charges that are to explode the Chatham are
                        to be put into place. Special precautions have been taken against any
                        accident happening to the train which conveys the explosive charges.</p>
                    <p>We hear that no great danger is apprehended by the most competent judges from
                        the wave that will follow the explosion. They hold that, the banks of the
                        canal near the scene of the explosion being low, a great quantity of the
                        water displaced will sweep, over them and dissipate its force instead of
                        rushing violently up and down the canal as it would do were the banks high
                        and solid.</p>
                    <p>A certain amount of inconvenience will be caused to the public by the rupture
                        of tele- graphic communication between Port Said and the rest of Egypt, and
                        we wonder whether it would be possible for the Government and the Eastern
                        Telegraph Company to come to an ar- rangement by which the submarine cable
                        from Port Said to Alexandria could be used for messages to other parts of
                        Egypt during the interval between the explosion and the restor- ation of
                        telegraphic communication.</p>

                    <head>MOTORS FOR THE SUDAN.</head>
                    <p>The Sirdar has been for some time trying to solve the problem of desert
                        locomotion by the introduction of a quicker mode of transport than the camel
                        in those, districts which are not served by the railway. The motor-car which
                        has been constructed specially for Sir Reginald Wingate for the purposes of
                        desert travel was finally tested before the departure of the Sirdar for
                        Egypt last week on the sands at Dunbar. While the car came well out of the
                        trials it is doubtful whether a motor can be constructed that would be
                        powerful enough to drag the 1 1/2 ton dead weight of the trailer, as the
                        sandbanks of the Sudan would place a heavy strain on the machinery. The car
                        when last tried ploughed through the soft sand at the rate of three miles an
                        hour; on the harder aand seven miles was the average, and when relieved of
                        the trailer excellent progress was made.</p>
                    <p>It will be interesting to know at what rate of progression the same car can
                        be propelled over the loose sandy soil of the greater part of the desert,
                        and whether this specially built motor will turn out a success, for, if so,
                        the problem will have been solved.</p>

                    <p>A certain Abdallah Sadik recently informed the Slave Trade Department that
                        Lamloum Bey El Saadi, a notable of Maghagha, who rendered considerable
                        services of a quasi-di- plomatic nature to the Government this year, had
                        brought four black slaves with him from the frontier of Tripoli, which he
                        visited in March.</p>
                    <p>On receiving this denunciation the Depart- ment sent an inspector to visit
                        the Bey's ezbeh at Maghagha. The black slaves proved to be free laborers
                        working for a daily wage, abso- lutely without complaint and, in fine,
                        enjoying what Mr. Edward Lear describes as "truly abject and rustic
                        happiness.” The Bey, who was justly indignant at the accusation stated that
                        he bad been sent on a mission to the frontier of Tripoli and had there
                        settled a number of questions that had arisen from Bedouin quarrels, and
                        finding Sudanese slaves there had persuaded them to accompany him to Egypt,
                        after obtaining manumission documents from the Ottoman Government which were
                        countersigned by the British Con- sul. The Bey having thus emerged from the
                        enquiry without a stain on his character Abd- allah Sadik remains to be
                        dealt with. We hope to hear of his appearance in the dock one of these
                        days.</p>

                        end of next month,and it is proposed that Sir John Rogers, the chairman of
                        the company, who returns to Cairo in about a month’s time, will inaugurate
                        the new passengers and goods service between Port Said and Matarieh in the
                        first week of November. The Matarieh and Damietta section will then be taken
                        in hand and it is hoped that the dredging operations of the whole distance
                        of about 30 kilometres will be finished in six months. When this has been
                        accomplish- ed the company will then undertake the widening of the Ananieh
                        canal near Damietta, which is 6 1/4 kilometres long, and by means of a lock
                        gate, make it navigable for small steamers, which will then be able to go
                        through from Port Said to Mansourah by the Nile. This work will also greatly
                        facilitate the transport of coal from the former port to all the places on

                        APPEAL TO THE SOCIETE ARTISTIQUE.</head>
                    <p>To the Editor or the Egyptian Gazette. Sir,—As the open season draws near I
                        allow myself to ask the Societe Artistique if this year we will again be
                        bereft of one of the finest modern operas, and only for a political
                        difference. Yes political!! strange as it seems. But what have politics to
                        do with art,. and pa- triotism with music?</p>
                    <p>It is Germania that I mean, that splendid opera that we had the happy chance
                        of seeing staged two years ago, interpreted by cele- brated artists such as
                        Anoona, Garbin, and Santerelli, not forgetting Walter Carlo and Emma
                        Trentini.</p>
                    <p>The piece was new, the music rather diffi- cult, worthy of Wagner himself,
                        but little by little the artistic ear of the Egyptian public relished the
                        masterful and harmonious "airs” of Germania and the eye became more and more
                        interested in its everchanging scenes.</p>
                    <p>Alexandria especially was enthusiastic. In every corner one spoke but of
                        Germania and the "Gaudeamus igitur" was whistled by young and old. But then
                        came the reaction.</p>
                    <p>Some found themselves piqued in their patriotism, especially by the last
                        scene in which Napoleon’s army is seen retreating before the Germans, and
                        loud was their outcry, that such a piece could be played in a land like
                        ours. I say "some" and happily there were not many.</p>
                    <p>This year La Belliucioni will once more favor us with her presence! What a
                        splendid "Ricke” she would be, and we all hope to see her in this part.</p>
                    <p>Let politics be politics and art remain art. One has nothing to do with the
                        other.—I am, Sir, etc.</p>

                        pas déclaré un cas de peste qu’il avait au à soigner.</p>
                    <p>L’audience était présidée par le Com. G. Paulucci; Zaki bey Ghali remplissait

                        dootear oontre venant, prit la parole pour exposer la défense de son olient.
                        L'iospactaqr sanitaire, U. le Dr. Gottschlich, interrogé par le prérident,
                        fit la déposition suivante :—</p>
                    <p>“Je ne connais pas le Dr. Varveropoulo. Le 5 août, j'ai été appelé par le
                        Dr. Mohamed Aly Zarka, médecin du kism Karmous, pour inspecter un cadavre
                        qui avait eu un ou de peste. Le décédé s’appelait Mohamed Issa. La
                        constatation a été faite entre 10 et 11 heures du matin.</p>
                    <p>“Quelques jours avant ce fait, il y avait en un eu de peste au quartier
                        Kom-el-Nadoura, et à la suite de ce cas nous nous sommes mis en garde de ne
                        pas délivrer de certificat d'inhu- mation sansavoir d'abord procédé à une
                        consta- tation médicale. Moi et le docteur Zarka syant dono procédé à cette
                        constatation, nous avons trouvé sur la personne du cadavre de Mohamed Issa
                        ungros bubon de peste. Pour moi, iln’yapas le moindre doute que o'était un
                        cas de peste ce n’était pas une gastro-entérite, comme il a été qualifié par
                        le docteur Varveropoulo. D'après nos constatations il ne pouvait y avoir
                        d'erreur sur le diagnostic."</p>
                    <p>Sur la demande dU président, il répond : "Depais plusieurs années, la
                        Municipalité m’a fait l'honneur de me nommer son inspec- teur sanitaire et
                        pendant tout ce temps, j’ai en l'occasion de constater plusieurs centaines
                        de cas de peste, sur lesquels il m'était presque impossible de me
                        tromper.</p>
                    <p>“La gastro-entérite ne produit jamais de bubons ; c'est la scrofuleuse qui
                        peut en pro- duire. Je crois que le Dr. Varveropoulo ne pouvait pu se
                        tromper. Il a mis une très grande négligencs dans la constatation. Le fait
                        des bubons a été oonstaté, comas je l’ai déja dit, en présence du Dr.
                        Zarka."</p>
                    <p>Sur demande de M. le président au témoin, si on avait procédé a l'autopsie du
                        cadavre, il répond : “j’ai cru inutile de faire une au topsie, ni un examen
                        bactériologique parce que lo -as de peste était tout b fait oûdr comme
                        aspect du cadavre et d'ailleurs confirmé par h fait que cet homme provanait
                        d'un four sis l Karmous, oü la veille il y avait eu un autre cas de pesto.
                        Il y a eu aussi d'autres eu de peste au quartier Labbaue.</p>
                    <p>Comme les assertions du Dr. Gottachlich étaient contestées par Me Narissi, le
                        tribunal décida de nommer comme expert M. le Dr Torella.</p>
                    <p>L’affaire a été plaidée hier. Le rapport da Dr. Torella conclut a ce qu’il
                        n'y a pu le moindre doute qu'on se trouve en face d'un cas de peste. Le Dr.
                        Gottschlich a confirmé pure ment et simplemeut set assertions précédentes.
                        Le Dr. Zarka, médecin du kism Karmous, qui avait constaté en compagnie da
                        Dr. Gottschlich que le éfunt Mohamed Issa avait un bubon inguinal et des
                        taches de peste sur le corps, a également affirmé qu’il a’agissait
                        indubitable ment d’un ou de peste.</p>
                    <p>Sur ces dires le ministère public a conclu a la condamnation du Dr.
                        Varveropoulo au ma ximum de la peine, soit a 100 PT. d’amende et 7 jours de
                        prison.</p>
                    <p>Me. Narissi a prononcé eu faveur de soi client one longue et brillante
                        plaidoierie dont voici un conrt aperça :</p>
                    <p>En Jait : M. le Dr. Varveropoulo, appelé a soigner le défont, Mohamed Issa,
                        constata qu’il était atteint de gastro-antérite aigue qui pro voquait des
                        vomissements et da la diarrhée Il ordonna une potion qui ne fut pas prise
                        par le malade et quelque tempe après une seconde visite que le Dr lui fit la
                        mort survint Or dans les deux visites faites par le Dr Varveropoulo
                        celui-ci-ne trouva sur lui aucun signe de peste Ce n'est pas, cependant, la
                        compétence qui lui manque, puisqu'il a eu l’occasion de soigner plusieurs
                        cas de peste a Damanhour. Il y a dono deux opinions en présence, celle da Di
                        Gotablich et celle da Dr Varveropoulo. Ceci étant admis, il est juste de
                        prendre note dam là déclaration da Dr Gotschlich que celui-ci n'a procédé a
                        aucun examen bactériologique, seule preuve qui eût été légale et
                        irréfutable. Le Dr Torella,nommé comme expert pour tran- cher la question,
                        s’est prononcé, il est vrai, et faveur de l’inspecteur sanitaire, mais sans
                        ap- porter aucun fait nonveau, ni aucune preuve Son témoignage est d'autant
                        plus sujet b oau tion qu’il semblo professer pour le Dr Gotsohlicl nne
                        espèce de culte, analogue au fétichisme. Laissant de côté l'opinion da Dr
                        Torella, il y a cependant un moyeu de tout concilier: o’est que les taches
                        et les bubons n’apparaissant souvent qu’après la décès, lorsque le cours de
                        la maladie a été très rapide, il est bien difficile dans ce cas pont le Dr
                        d’établir le diagnostic de la peste.</p>
                    <p>En droit : On se trouva en face d’un procès- verbal dont la véracité est
                        contestés; et comme ici, il ne s’agit pu de faits dont l’existence on la
                        non-existence peuvent être prouvées par appréciation mais qui doivent être
                        dûment et légalisent établies par des procédés indiscuta- bles, le prévenu
                        ne pent pu être obligé d’ap- porter la preuve du contraire. Si, en outre, le
                        procès-verbal de l’officier de santé peut être considéré comme infaillible,
                        lorsqu'il s’agit d’ur diagnostic facile et fréquent, il n’en est pas de même
                        en ce qui concerne la peste, maladie rare et au diagnuestic excessivement
                        difficile, qui ne se trouve vérifie que dans la pro- portion de 5 our cent
                        et encore grace a <cb/>l'examen bactériologique. On voit pu là que pour
                        valoir légalement un procès-verbal ne doit pu se baser en pareil cas sur un
                        examen superficiel mais sur un examen bactériologique sérieux. La preuve
                        légale'doit'ôtte fondée sur des procédés infaillibles et non sur des appré-
                        ciations.</p>
                    <p>Au pis aller, 1a bonne foi da prévenu dans cette affaire est on ne peat plus
                        évidente.</p>
                    <p>Or, le principe dit : pas d'intention, pu de punition.</p>
                    <p>Le jugement sera rendu a huita no.</p>

                    <head>SURVEY OF THE SUDAN. INTERVIEW WITH SLATIN PASHA.</head>
                    <p>A correspondent of the "Standard" lately obtained an interview with Sir
                        Rudolph R. von Slatin Pasha, from whom he was able to gather a great deal of
                        information of a sort which is scarcely available to the ordinary unofficial
                        traveller o: student of world politics, the Inspector-General is, of course,
                        an unim- peachable authority, and the very compre- hensive statement made by
                        him should, therefore, prove of real and permanent value, In response to an
                        opening question as to the general situation and outlook. Sir Rudolph said:—
                        "I may say the situation in the Sudan is satisfactory, but the best way to
                        demonstrate it is to give you some figures. Shortly after Lord Kitchener’s
                        victory in 1898. the revenue of the Sudan was estimated at L.E 8,000, and L
                        E. 35,000 were realised. The Budget of 1904 showed 'estimated revenue' L.E
                        469,000, while the ‘realised revenue' was L.E. 576,000. We are obeying the
                        advice of Lord Cromer—the great statesman who has made the prosperity of
                        Egypt and is now making that of the Sudan—that ‘low taxation should be tho
                        key- stone of the political arch.</p>
                    <p>"As Inspector-General, it is my duty to travel over the whole Sudan, and to
                        report on the situation. I have, too, to investigate com- plaints, and I can
                        assure you that there have been very few cases in which people have
                        complained that they were overtaxed, though he Sudanese certainly don't like
                        paying taxes, Tout commencez nous!</p>
                    <p>"When we reoccupied the Sudan there were Fewer than -1,000 ‘sakias’ (water
                        wheels) ; to- day there are over 10,000 ! Cultivation on rain land has
                        increased enormously. Cotton, which was scarcely planted at all formerly, co
                        vers to day an area of more than 95,000 acres in the different provinces.
                        Herds and flocks are now very numerous. These results have been obtained
                        through wise administra- tion.</p>
                    <p>"The Sirdar, General Sir Reginald Wingate is the right man for
                        Governor-General of the Sudan. Not only is he the brave soldier who defeated
                        and killed the Khalifa at Om Debere kat, and brought Mahdism to its end, but
                        he is also an extremely good administrator. He talks Arabic fluently, which
                        enables him, during his tours of inspection, to communicate directly with
                        natives, instead of depending on an inter- preter. This is a very great
                        advantage. He is the most kind-hearted man, but, at the -same time,
                        strong-minded enough to force everybody to obey his orders ; and he has the
                        gift of selecting his assistants, and putting them in their right places. As
                        to his able and hard- working beads of departments and governors of
                        provinces, it is unnecessary for me to praise them. The continuous progress
                        of the Sudan speaks for them better than I could do. "Mr. Joseph Walton and
                        Mr. Gibson Bowles came to Khartoum last winter and had a look round. Both
                        expressed their thorough satis- faction with the state of affaire, and Mr.
                        Bowles said to me, 'I confess I admire the work done by your subalterns.’ He
                        used the word subaltern, as all governors and a great number of heads of
                        department and inspectors are military officers, and comparatively
                        young.</p>
                    <p>"But with regard, now, to the future, I am sure the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan is
                        the land of the future. What we have to do is to improve communications and
                        create a system of irrigation. Concerning communications, we are building a
                        railway from the Red Sea to the Nile, joining the Haifa-Khartoum railway
                        about 80 miles south of Berber. This line is built by Royal Engineer
                        officers, under the Director of Railways, Lieut.-Colonel J. B. Macauley.
                        Lord Cromer refused to import Indian labourers, as was first proposed, and
                        insisted on our using natives of the country for the work. And we succeeded
                        ! The lazy blacks, formerly loafers and runaway slaves, have now learnt to
                        work steadily, and nomad Arabs, who had never worked since time im-
                        memorial, gave a certain amount of help.</p>
                    <p>"The line, of over 320 miles length, will be finished, after two and a-half
                        years’ work, and opened next spring. We shall have two ports —Old Suakin and
                        the new Port Sudan, formerly called Sheikh el Bargh’ub which will be a
                        splendid harbour. The straight and short débouché to the sea will enable us
                        to export our products, such as gum, corn, cotton, etc. The cost of
                        transport through Egypt is now too high, especially for heavy products, like
                        gum and corn ; and traders, although they pay a very low price to the
                        cultivators, state that it is hardly a profitable business to export Sudan
                        products.</p>
                    <p>"We intend, after finishing the Red Sea- Nile railway, to build lines to
                        Kassala, Gezira, and Kordofan. Meanwhile, we are trying to connect trade
                        centres by trunk roads, on which we shall use motor-cars, and we are improv-
                        ing other roads for animal transport The only difficulty is the want of
                        money, and the Financial Secretary, Colonel Bernard, has to be always on the
                        look out to meet the different demands with the money he has at his dis-
                        posal.</p>
                    <p>”More difficult than communication is the question of irrigation. Although
                        considerable progress was made during the past year in the direction of
                        prospecting for minerals, believe the future of the Sudan lies in agricul-
                        ture. Vast areas are still uncultivated, and ap- plications by important
                        companies for permis- sion to buy land for agricultural purposes have to be
                        refused, as we cannot grant them right of perennial irrigation. Egypt in all
                        circum- stances must be sure of getting the necessary amount of water, and
                        we are only allowed to take the surplus.</p>
                    <p>"We may take as much water as we like from July 15 until January 81 (as for 6
                        1/3) <cb/>months the Nile water runs to waste into the sea), but after
                        January 31 we have to get per- mission for every single pump of any size
                        lift- ing water from the river. Mr. Dupuis, the Inspector-General of
                        Irrigation in the Sudan, and his staff, under the supervision of Sir Wil-
                        liam Garstin, the head of the Egyptian Public Works Department, are studying
                        this most important question. Sir William Garstin, the highest authority on
                        all irrigation matters, travelled during the last three years over the whole
                        Sudan, examining all the waterways He even went to Uganda with the object of
                        discovering means to increase the water supply. "Through Mr. Dupuis’s
                        calculations, we know that if we make a simple canal from the Blue Nile to
                        the White Nile, with a length of about 100 miles through fiat land, we shall
                        be able to bring under cultivation an area of over three millions of acres
                        of the best soil, which now lies fallow.</p>
                    <p>"Nevertheless, as I told you before, we are even now going ahead rapidly.
                        Daring the rainy season the natives sow seed wherever water accumulates
                        sufficiently to render the ground capable of bearing a crop.</p>
                    <p>"You ask me as to public security in the Sudan. You may believe me whom I
                        tell you that you are just as safe in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan as you are in
                        Europe, and perhaps more so ; and I may quote what I stated in one of my
                        official reports :—'It is no exaggeration to say that, if it were not for
                        the possible danger of attack by wild animals any individuals could pass
                        unarmed through the whole country under the Sudan Government. Highway rob-
                        bery is extremely rare, and there is com- paratively little thieving. If
                        from time to time one or the other occurs, it is nearly always amongst
                        natives, and not against the white man. Our police system is good, and the
                        sheikh, and omdehs of villages and tribes, who are the pick of the
                        population, are responsible for pubic security. Therefore I may say per-
                        fect tranquillity and safety prevails in the Sudan.</p>
                    <p>"So much for the safety of individuals. Then, with regard to tribal affairs
                        and the ad- ministration of Government orders, there were last year only two
                        occasions on which public tranquillity was threatened.One man proclaim- ed
                        himself as the 'Prophet Jesus.’ He had only eleven followers—a very small
                        number for such a position and his appearance was by no means the execution
                        of a well-prepared plan, but the unexpected action of a lunatic. The other
                        case was that a continually drunken sheikh and some natives of a Nuba
                        mountain refused to obey Government orders, and fired on a patrol.</p>
                    <p>“In both cases detachments were sent, and, after a short engagement and a few
                        casualties, order was restored. However much we tray regret such forcible
                        measures, it is sometimes important to show that we are able to enforce our
                        authority, and that our orders have to be obeyed. Two cases are not many in
                        a newly- conquered country consisting of eleven pro- vinces, of which some
                        are greater than entire countries in Europe. You will have idea as of the
                        Sudan if I tell you that one province out of eleven—Kordofan—is governed by
                        some thirty British and Egyptian officials, and covers an area greater than
                        the whole of France</p>
                    <p>"When I had to report officially on this sub ject, I wrote : 'Public security
                        prevails, and, barring these two cases, Government orders have been and are
                        carried out without any resistance. The inhabitants of the Sudan are
                        convinced that the Government is able to maintain peace and to enforce
                        prompt obe- dience to its orders.’ I don’t think I am committing an
                        indiscretion if I tell you Lord Cromer’s criticism on my statement Lord
                        Cromer said :—</p>
                    <p>“ I concur with the general principle that we should be able to maintain
                        pesos, but this does not, to my mind, quite state the whole case. Justice,
                        sound political and fiscal policy, backed by an adequate force, is the only
                        way to govern the Sudan, or, indeed, any other country. I have but alight
                        belief in the one without the other, whether the scene of action be St.
                        Petersburg or Khartoum.' " The great statesman was very right Yes, I am
                        proud to say our Government is just and its justice is recognised by every
                        living soul in the Sudan—by redentary natives ant nomad Arabs. I never beard
                        that even the losing party suspected one of our judges of having been
                        influenced by private reasons in giving a decision or sentence. Never ! They
                        appeal often, saying that the judge has misun- derstood the case—that
                        individuals of bad character gave false evidence, or that they are able to
                        produce new witnesses ; but there was never a remark about ‘injustice.’ In
                        the eyes of the natives our judges are all Knights without fear and
                        reproach’—as, indeed. they are.”</p>
                    <p>In reply to a question as to the popularity or otherwise of our
                        administration, and the content of the people, the Inspector-General said :
                        “ The people are every day gaining more confidence in the good intentions of
                        the Government.</p>
                    <p>”They are convinced that we do our best to establish security in the country.
                        Public wealth is increasing. In former days, under an earlier régime in the
                        Sudan, every one wished to be considered poor. He was afraid that if he
                        showed his wealth be would draw on himself the attention of the authorities,
                        and be exposed to their despotic measures. Nowadays it is just the contrary.
                        The native knows that with his wealth his influence as an individual
                        increases, and that only a man of a certain amount of wealth is consulted by
                        Government officials on public questions.</p>
                    <p>‘There is, of course, sometimes a little dis- satisfaction if an order is
                        given which does not fit the immediate views and inclinations of the people,
                        but they soon realise-that such ordi- nances are only given in the interest
                        of public welfare- There may be some discontented in- <cb/>dividuals who
                        held prominent positions under the Dervish rule, and who are now powerless
                        and ignored, but this does not apply to the public feeling. Especially is
                        the sedentary popu- lation pleated with our system of administra- tion, and
                        the prevailing security. Nomad Arabs are naturally last favorable to it I
                        won’t say that they are discontented, or are onging for Dervish rule, or any
                        other change. But nomad Arabs love a free and uncontrolled life, and we tie
                        them down a good bit. "I had lately a meeting with the heads and sheikhs of
                        nomad Arab tribes, and while talk- ing about the situation, and various
                        other things, an old friend of mine, the head sheikh of an important tribe,
                        asked me, quite confi- dentially :—Tell me—why have we to pay tribute to
                        you? 'Because,' I answered, we are the masters of the country, which we con-
                        quered—we established peace—and we protect you against all sorts of danger.
                        Therefore, we have to keep a force, which has to be paid. Four tribute is,
                        perhaps, a little assistance, but more a sign of loyalty.’</p>
                    <p>“ 'Oh, he said, T pay my tribute willingly, and I am loyal because you are
                        the stronger. I don't mind if the lion takes toll out of my herd —that is
                        his right, he is the king of the forests —but I won't pay tribute to be
                        protected. I am man enough to protect myself ! Look, my dear friend and
                        master,' he continued, with a sad smile, ‘you have taken all the spice out
                        of our life. We Arabs are a fighting race—one day we were on a war footing,
                        the next day living in peace with our neighbouring tribes. Coming back from
                        a successful raid, I was received as a conqueror, and I was praised in song
                        by the most beautiful women of my tribe. If I came back defeated, or if my
                        enemy succeeded in taking away my herds, I bore my misfortune with dignity,
                        thinking of the day of revenge... This was our traditional custom, and it
                        has gone on for centuries. All my ancestors did so —why do you come and do
                        away with our old and beloved habits? If I dare to fight now —even for the
                        sake of my honor—1 risk being tried and put in gaol amongst common thieves
                        and murderers.'</p>
                    <p>‘ I tried to argue with my old friend, and explained to him the advantages of
                        peace and security, but I did not succeed in convincing him or his
                        followers. When he asked me if we sometimes had war in Europe, I could not
                        deny it, but explained to him that this was not the decision of a single
                        individual, but a general necessity for reasons of state. He said : It's all
                        the same ; yon have the sport— you have the fun of fighting.’ "And as we
                        parted he shook hands with me, and his last words were : ‘Saladin ! You know
                        I am loyal—but I am very sorry that you made me like a woman.'</p>
                    <p>I was long enough living amongst Arabs to understand their feeling in this
                        matter, and most confess I have some sort of sympathy with them. . . .
                        Please do not think that I am a warrior, and like ‘the fun of fighting.’ No
                        ; I like peace—nearly as much as my cele- brated countrywoman Baroness
                        Suttner, whose motto is, ’Die Waffen nieder.’ And as the Government made me
                        responsible for the be- haviour of the nomad tribes, I hope to be able to
                        prevent their falling back into their old barbaric habits.</p>
                    <p>"The greatest proof of confidenoe in the Government that the people give is
                        the send- ing of their sons to Government schools. There are so many
                        applications that we are forced to refuse a certain number, and so we are
                        able to select our pupils. Of course the number of schools will be increased
                        before long, so that every boy may get an elementary education. At the
                        Gordon College at Khartoum members of families of religions influence are
                        trained for schoolmasters and judges in the Maho- metan courts. Sons of
                        sheikhs and important people of different tribes receive a general edu-
                        cation, which will enable them to give sound advice to their relatives on
                        public questions. Sons of officers and officials are taught to be Government
                        clerks, surveyors, land measurers, etc., and other boys are sent to
                        industrial workshops. Of coarse this is not a strict rule, but only the
                        general line which is taken by Mr. Currie, who is the Director of Public
                        Instruction.”</p>
