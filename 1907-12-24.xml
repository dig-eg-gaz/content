                        a large Greek element, and while the Anglican Pro testant Church and the

                        the Greek and Eastern Cburcbea defer their celebration till the 7th of

                    <p>It is interesting to study the early records of the obeervanoe of Christmas
                        Day. In a previous Christmas article we showed that its origin was
                        distinctly pagan and quite unoon uected with the birth of Jesus Christ
                        Indeed many early writers hold that it was s special providenoe that
                        appointed the birth of Christ to take place in the midst of pagan festivals.
                        Menander gives a long account of them, and considers that a festival held on
                        the shortest day-the winter solstice—presented the op¬portunity of a
                        transition to the Christian point of view , Christ, the sun of the spiritual
                        world, beiug compared with the sun ot the amtenal world. The comparison was
                        carried still further, for as in the material world it is after dark ness
                        has reached its highest point that the end of its domiuion is already near,
                        and the light begins to acquire freeh powet, eo, too, in the spiritual world
                        Christ, tbt spinteal eon, must appear to make an end of the kingdom of
                        darkness But the date to be observed presented a difficulty, and while the
                        Western Churches decided on the 25th December, the Eastern Cburcoes deferred
                        it till the Epiphany. Heoce the difference of dates at the preeeot time.

                        Coupled with these, no doubt, in the minds of many Englishmen resident in

                        the plethora of dolls, mechanical toys, and noveltiea of all descriptions

                    <p>According to the director*, the Grant, Bondi and Chinn branch would, on an
                        adequate capital, have shewn excellent result», but the oompany not having

                        engagements with the manager, they have arranged with the firm of Grant,

                        Bondi to remain as manag mg director, while his company forego their share
                        in the profits mal* tor the Construction* hy this branch during the past

                        arbitration for £4,000 on shares.</p>
                    <p>With reference to the G Boyes branch, the company retain laud at Rod el Farag
                        included in the original purchase price, receiving from Mr Roves the sura of
                        £4,000, value of stock, furniture fixings etc, the company is keeping the
                        existing assets and liabilities of the branch and loses £880or the sale.</p>
                    <p>The land at Rod el Farag was purchased with a view of erecting larger maun
                        tact unng work* as well as general depot for stock etc in order to
                        centralize the business and reduce the working expenses, but in view of the
                        present state of finances they propose selling this land at the first
                        favourable opportunity, at an estimated depreciation of £9,000 The loss on
                        the building oontract at San Stefano amount* to £1895, due to tbe injudi
                        cious technical supervision , the company adds that this loss brought about
                        tbe retirement of the technical superviser» at the tenmnation of the
                        work</p>
                    <p>An estimate of 10 has been allowed for on outstanding debts, as an allowance
                        for tbe possible failures of various debtors to meet liabilities in view of
                        tbe financial crisis. The sum of £11.897 under the bead of preliminary
                        expenses has been written ofl, as it was felt that the gradual extention of
                        this sum would reuder the payments of dividends impossible for years</p>
                    <p>The value of the company s stock as distinct from the branches is £1,695,
                        this after allowing for dead loss on cement which suffered from climatic
                        conditions. </p>

                    <p>We published a special telegram from London on Wednesday last announcing that
                        Lord Vivian had obtained a divorce from his wife owing to her having
                        committed adultery with Mr Alfred Curphey, th* well known Anglo Egyptian
                        financier The case came be fore Mr Justice Bergrade last Tuesday. The
                        detail* are as follows :—</p>
                    <p>His lordship gTSLted a decree nisi to the Right Hoo George C'reapigny
                        Brabaion, Baron Vivian, on the ground of the misoooduot of his wife, Barbara
                        (Neely, Ltd y Vivian, with the oo reepoodent, Mr Alfred Curphey There was no
                        defense.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rayford said Lord and Lady Vivian were married at St Michael’*, Pimlioo,
                        in August* 1603, and lived at North Audley street. The married life for a
                        time was a happy one There were two children In 1906 the petitioner went to
                        Canada, and on his return, in October, oc d (ÿlrred the first real trouble,
                        because be found a (hat hi* wife had arranged to take part in some
                        theatricals at the Royalty Theatre He object ed, and finally per*uaded her
                        to give up the idea</p>
                    <p>The following winter they arranged to go to Cairo, and then on a shooting
                        expedition Be fore going, however, the petitioner spoke to his wife about
                        tbe co respondent, whose acqu aintonce *he had made in Cairo Lord Vivian had
                        got to know something about the oo respondent, and felt he was not a
                        desirable person for hi* wife to know. The petitioner mentioned the matter
                        to Lady Vivian before departing for the shoot in the neighbourhood of
                        Khartoum On his ret urn to Cairo Lord Vivian found that his wife had made
                        the aeqas in tance of tbe co respondent and some of the latter’s friend*, to
                        whom the petitioner strongly objected </p>
                    <p>Subsequently I^idy Vivian told her husband that she had arranged to go on a
                        motor tour through France, but when he found that the co-respondent was to
                        be one of the party he objected, and told the co respondent that Lady Vivian
                        would not be one ot the party In the end there was no motor party, and the
                        peti tioner and hi* wife retained home</p>
                    <p>The co-respondent and some of his friends shortly afterwards returned to
                        England, and Lady Vivian was constantly going about to different places, and
                        would have nothing to‘ do with her husband In tact (said counsel', from the
                        time Lord Vivian returned from the shooting axpedition Iiady Vivian refused
                        to live with him as hi* wife In Apnl last she left her husband s house,
                        intimating that she would not return Lord Vivian had made every endeavour to
                        get his wife to return *nd give up the co-respondent</p>
                    <p>On one occcasion Lord Vivian went and saw hi» wire at the Coburg Hotel, where
                        she was staying, and promised to forgive her if she would return But she
                        absolutely declined his offer, and left the hotel in a motor-car Sub-
                        sequently, it was ascertained that she was constantly in the society of the
                        oarespondent in the Isle of Man, and with whom she stayed at the Boston
                        Hotel on the night of October 25 last.</p>
                    <p>Lord Vivian, in his evidence, corroborating counsel’s statement, said that
                        after the shoot ing expedition near Khsrtcnm his wife refused to live with
                        him an his wife</p>
                    <p>His Lordship: What was the reason? — She refused, saying she did not wish
                        it.</p>
                    <p>His lordship inquired who the co respondent wn*, and counsel said he believed
                        him to lie a man of considerable wealth, who lived in the Isle of Man, and
                        spent a great deal of his time at Cairo</p>
                    <p>Other evidence was called, and a decree nisi, with cost», and the custody ot
                        the children was granted </p>
