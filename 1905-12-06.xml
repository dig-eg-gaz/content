                    <head>The New Government</head>
                    <p>A telegram from London,which we publish today, announces that the composition
                        of the new Administration will not be announced till next Monday.
                        Speculation, therefore, will be rife at home during the next week as to the
                        selection which the new Premier will make. Regret will be general that Earl
                        Spencer was not sent for the King instead of Sir Henry Cambell Bannerman.
                        But he refused the task when he was a younger man and his agehe is 70 years
                        oldand his bad health left the King no alternative, as Lord Rosenbery will
                        not accept office. Sir Henry would never agree to take office under Lord
                        Rosebery, especially in view of the latter's recent pronouncement on Home
                        Rule, and many Liberal Imperialists hoped that he would have retired with
                        peerage to the House of Lords in favor of Lord Rosenbery, who would have
                        combined the Permiership and Foreign Secretaryship in his person. It will be
                        very difficult to imagine anyone but Lord Rosenbery, at the head of Foreign
                        Office with the single exception of Sir Edward Grey. After so long an
                        exclusion from office, it would be by no means undesirable that the Prime
                        Minister should for a breif period combine that office with the Foreign
                        Secretaryship. In no other way could he make sure of picking up the threads,
                        and of obtaining that first hand knowledge of international forces and
                        persons which a Prime Minister ought to possess. Putting aside this
                        suggestion and leaving out Lord Rosenbery, we can all think of a young
                        Liberal statesman who would inspire general confidence either at the Foreign
                        Office or at the Colonial Secretary, it is not easy to think of any
                        nomination to the Foreign Office, except one, which would meet with the
                        general approval of the country at large. Lord Rosenbery will doubtless have
                        therefusal, but it is doubtless have the refusal, but it is doubtful if he
                        will take it. Leaving, then the Foreign Secretaryship aside, we may, venture
                        on the following adumbation of the new Ministry:-<table rows="3" cols="2">

                        inclusion of Mr. Winston Churchill is doubtful. If Sir Edward Grey obtains
                        the Foreign Secretaryship, the post of Colonial Secretary may be given to
                        Mr. Bryce. Mr. Haldane and Mr. Lloyd-George will most probably be among the
                        Under Secretaries, while the posts of Attorney General and Solicitor General
                        may be given to Mr. Lawson Walton and Mr. W. S. Robson. The Liberals will be
                        so sure that the "flowing tide" of public favor is with them that they will
                        in all likelihood refuse any coalition with the Free Trade Unionists, who on
                        the Fiscal Question would join the Liberals in any case, but would otherwise
                        hamper the Government. </p>

                                continue the strike for 20 days. All the troops in the vicinity have
                                been called in to the city. The run on the sayings' banks continues.

                    <p>I had the privilege of being present at the wedding to-day, in the Chapel
                        Royal, St. James's, of Mr. Percy Machell to Countess Valda Gleichen. The
                        weather, unfortunately, was dall, but the brilliancy of the function was not
                        in any way marred. H.M. the King, who was present, looked the picture of
                        health. The Archbishop of Canterbury, who officiated, de'ivered a most
                        impressive address.</p>
                    <p>The "best man" was the Hon. Harold Willoughby, and the bride was attended by
                        Miss Lavinia Spencer and Miss Lolia Ponsonby, as bridesmaids, and Master
                        Derrick Amory and Master Patrick Holme (nephew of Mr. Machell). as pages.
                        The bride, who was given away by her brother, Count Gleichen, wore a white
                        moire silk dress, with gold tinsel woven in the material, and embroidered
                        with silver bugles. The bodice was made high in the neck, and the top filled
                        with lace and net. The skirt had a long train,out square (but not a Court
                        train), and had two long sprays of the silver bugle trimming up the back,
                        and also two on the front of the skirt. There was a real lace veil draped on
                        the back of the dress, and hanging down. She wore a tulle veil over her
                        face, and a wreath of myrtle on her head. The going-away dress was of pale
                        blue cloth, with embroidery onlays, while the going-away hat was a shot silk
                        blue, trimmed with a mink edge and a shaded blue feather.</p>
                    <p>LONDON, December 5, Mr. P. W. Machell was married to Countess Victoria
                        Gleichen in the Chapel Royal to-day. The King was present. The Archbishop of
                        Canterbary officiated. (Router)</p>
                    <p>The Countess Valda is the second of the three daughters of Princess Victor of
                        Hohenlohe Langenburg, her father having been a first cousin to King Edward.
                        Princess Victor is an aunt of the present Marquess of Hertford and was
                        married in 1861, her husband forfeiting his title for her sake, and being
                        known for some years as Count Gleichen, until the late Queen restored his
                        princedom to him. He was an exceedingly clever sculptor, which talent bas
                        descended to his eldest daughter, Countess Feodors, who has made quite a
                        name for herself in that line. Countess Valda has a delightful voice, and
                        sings well, being particularly fond of music. She has a residence in Engine
                        Court, St. James's Palace, where she used to spend the greater part of her

                    <p>PRISONER FOUND GUILTY.</p>
                    <p>SENTENCE OF TWO YEARS.</p>
                    <p>The care of Rex v. Pisani came before the British Supreme Consular Court,
                        sitting at Cairo, on Monday morning, when the charge was read to the
                        prisoner, who pleaded "Not Guilty." The jury was composed of Messrs. J. Home
                        (foreman) Russell, Chamberlaine, Kossessios, and Radford. Mr. Briscoe
                        prosecuted for the Crown, and Mr. Sciortino appeared for the prisoner.</p>
                    <p>After the reading of the charge, proceedings opened with the calling of the
                        witnesses for the prosecution. Those heard on Monday were Mr. Mansto, who
                        was in his shop in old Zaptieh-street between two and three p.m. on October
                        13, beard the shot, and saw Victoria Déan after the wound had been inflicted
                        on her by Pisani; Rosina Kraus, the landlady of the pension where the
                        incident occurred, whose refusal to take an oath for some minates and whose
                        eloquence in giving evidence caused much amusement; Vincenza Xueref, the
                        mother of the injured woman, who was present when her daughter was shot, and
                        who appears to have been so terrified that she returned to Port Said at
                        once; and Victoria Déan.</p>
                    <p>The latter's evidence was decidedly interesting. The injured woman, whose
                        evidence at the preliminary enquiry had pointed to the fact that the shot
                        was fired with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm, now asserted
                        that the prisoner fired by accident, and stated that he implored her pardon
                        and declared that he had not meant to fire as she lay on the ground-an item
                        which, as the Court noted, did not appear in the previous statement made by
                        her in the course of the preliminary enquiry. The rest of her evidence dealt
                        with her somewhat intricate love affairs, if one may dignify by that term
                        some rather qualid episodes in an irregular existence. Her evidence gave the
                        impression that she had changed her mind as to the prisoner's motives in
                        committing the act.</p>
                    <p>In the afternoon Drs. Nolan and Corling Hayward gave evidence as to the
                        finding of a revolver bullet in the curtains of the room and as to the
                        nature of the wound, which both described as serious. Victoria Dean was then
                        recalled and, cross-examined by Mr. Sciortino, described Pisani's conduct in
                        Cairo and asserted that though he accompanied her to the house of Mascarelli
                        and knew she was living with him he had shown no jealousy, though she
                        admitted that the day before she left Port Said and Pisani tó live with
                        Mascarelli prisoner had shown considerable jealousy. Dr. Becker Bey, in
                        giving evidence, pointed out that the woman had had a very narrow escape,
                        the upward movement of her arm when the revolver was aimed at her
                        deflecting, the bullet upwards. Mascarelli, the doctors who rendered first
                        aid to the injured woman, and the doctor of the Menshieh prison were also
                        heard.</p>
                    <p>At 10 a.m. on Tuesday the hearing was resumed, Constable No. 934, Emin
                        Effendi Wasfi, mamour of the kism in which the affair occurred, and Gaetano
                        Taro, who had been in the street when the shot was fired, and saw Pisani
                        holding a revolver half hidden by the door of the house and also witnessed
                        his arrest, gave further evidence for the prosecution. Me. Sciortino then
                        outlined his defence, which might be summed up as follows. The prisoner had
                        intended to go to Jaffa and Beyrout for a trip, but finding he had not
                        enough timecharged his mind and decided to visit Cairo and Alexandria. A
                        request made by his brother to bring him some oysters and fish from
                        Alexandria induced him to go to Cairo. first taking Alexandria on his
                        return. Shortly before starting he met Victoria Dean's mother. who asked him
                        to persuade her daughter to return to Port Said. He attempted to do this but
                        the woman refused unless her mother came up to Cairo and took her back.
                        Pisani thereupon wired to the mother and in the interview that immediately
                        preceded the hot, supported the mother's pleading. When Victoria proved
                        obdurate Pisani, to frighten ber into compliance, as 6 had done before, drew
                        his revolver. The bone handle slipped, he caught at the fallen revolver with
                        both hands, and it went off. After begging his victim's pardon he seemed to
                        have become distraught and to have attempted suicide.</p>
                    <p>Witnesses for the defence were then called They were Raffaele Pisani, brother
                        of the accused; Aloisio Said, who took £1 from prisoner to give to
                        Victoria's mother for her expenses to Cairo; Constantine Rubas, who had been
                        accused's foreman for many years and gave him a good character, and finally
                        Carmelo Pisani, a short, rather dark and thick-set man with bright and
                        piercing eyes, a long and piratical moustache, and abundance of bandages on
                        his head and neck. His evidence followed the lines of Me. Sciortino's
                        defence, till ba was asked to reconstruct the scene with the identical
                        revolver. It was noticed that he fired he revolver only after repeated
                        attempts Owing to the heavy pull (about nine or ten pounds) and to his
                        curious handling of the uncorked weapon the trigger of which he tried to
                        pull with his third finger. Both these circomstances appeared to tell
                        somewhat against the theory that the revolver had gone off accidentally.</p>
                    <p>At 2 p.m. Me. Sciortino summed up his de fer cs and Me. Briscoe hen spoke for
                        the prosecution, noting the carious difference in the evidence given by
                        Viote Déan at the previons enquiry and on the first day of the trial, which
                        he ascribed to the feminine readiness to forgive, and o mmenting on the
                        reservation of the defence by prisoner, who had had nothing to say during
                        the preliminary erquiry. His Honor, Judge Cator, then summed up for the
                        benefit of the jury. He complimented counsel for the defence on the skill he
                        had employed, gave his own views as to the arguments used, and informed the
                        jury that they would be asked three questions:</p>
                    <p>1. Did sooused as a fact shoot Victoria Déan 1 2. If so did he shoot her
                        accidentally? 3. If not accidentally did he shoot her with intent: (a) to
                        kill; (b) to inflict grievous bodily barm; (c) to wound her unlawfully ?
                        After a short absence the jury returned and answered the first question in
                        the affirmative, adding that they found that Pisani had shot</p>

                    <p>JUDGMENT OF COURT.</p>
                    <p>The following are some extracts from the judgment given yesterday by the 2nd
                        Civil Chamber of the Cairo Mixed Court under the presidency of Judge
                        Herzbruch :-</p>
                    <p>Sur la recevabilité de l'action:</p>
                    <p>Attenda que le Conseil d'administration de Paris, en se rapportant d'abord à
                        la décision de Davey par un des moyens indiqués dans sa lettre du 21
                        septembre, soit en acceptant le cas échéant la démission de Poutrel soit en
                        le licenciant, et en approuvant ensuite le départ de Poútrel, &amp; assumé
                        de ce chef comme mandant la responsabilité de Davey son mandataire, mais
                        n'ayant pu contrôler l'exactitude des motifs de licenciement, semble-t-il, à
                        la condition tacité que ces faits se trouveraient confirmés par une
                        vérification ultérieure ; car il va sans dire que le mandat ne peut s'éten-
                        dre jusqu'à l'injure;</p>
                    <p>Attenda qu'il s'ensuit que la responsabilité de l'action se confond avec le
                        fond et dépend de la question s'il y a injure et en cas affirmatif si les
                        motifs de licenciement sont justes et bien fondés.</p>
                    <p>Au fond:</p>
                    <p>Attenda qu'il est avéré par les experts nommés par le juge commissaire, que
                        24 millions de traites au profit de Say 6'aient en ciroulation au moment où
                        la Société Générale des Sucreries et de la Raffinerie d'Egypte a déposé Ron
                        bilan soit 4 millions environ signées par de la Bouglise et 20 millions par
                        Leroux.</p>
                    <p>Attendu qu'il semble établi à suffisance de droit sur la base des livres
                        examinés par les experts que les traites tirées par la raison sociale Henry
                        Say et Cia depuis tout au moins 1899 et acceptées par la Société Générale
                        des Sucreries et Raffinerie d'Egypte étaient en circulation au Livre des
                        Inventaires; qu'en retenant oes faits il est difficile à admettre que Davey,
                        un des administrateurs-délégués, qui est entré sa service de la Société
                        avant Poutrel, ait pa, sans négligence coupable, en ignorer l'existence et
                        qu'en tous cas qu'il puisse se prévaloir de, cette ignorance pour se
                        disculper en mettant la fante de ce chef à la charge de Poutrel, lequel dans
                        ces conditions ne pouvait raisonnablement concevoir que Davey soit resté
                        dans l'ignorance des opérations qui se pratiquaient depuis nom- bre
                        d'années; car pour être de bonne foi, il ne suffit pas d'avoir ignoré tel ou
                        tel fait, mais il il faut encore et surtout qu'on ait épuisé les moyens
                        nécessaires dont on dispose pour éclairer sa religion, moyens qui en
                        l'espèce étaient multiples et certainement à la portée de Davey.</p>
                    <p>Mais attenda qu'en ajoutant foi pour un instant aux dires de Davey qu'il n'a
                        pu rien savoir de traites créées depuis mai 1905 et que lorsqu'il a appris
                        plus tard l'existence des traites représentant 24 millions de francs envi-
                        ron, effrayé par l'énormité du chiffre et se trouvant devant un gouffre
                        impossible à combler, il est cependant certain que cette situstion n'était
                        que la conséquence des situations antérieures révélant qu'on couvrait le
                        déficit résultant de l'exploitation des usines et allant a'augmenter d'année
                        en année, par les soi-disant arbitrages qui s'opéraient à Paris par le fait
                        de Cronier lequel faute d'argent pour se procurer les sommes nécessitées
                        pour ses opé rations d'arbitrage tirait pour la Société Gé nérale des
                        Sucreries et de la Roffi erie d'Egypte, escomptant les traites et
                        fournissait avant l'échéance à l'établissement chez lequel lesdites traites
                        avaient été domiciliées les fonds nécessaires pour le paiement; qu'il va
                        sans dire que ces mance avres étaient des plus périlleuses, les traites
                        tirées de Cronier pour lesquelles il n'y avait comme couvertures que des
                        acceptations Say en blanc, devant, le cas échéant, entrer en ligne de
                        comptes des arbitrages qui du reste n'étaient même pas spécifiés et ne
                        devaient jamais être admis par le Conseil d'admininistration; que néanmoins
                        on continnait l'exploitation dans les mêmes conditions monobstant la
                        déconfiture qui a déjà commencé en 1900 et lorsqu'on a voulu tenter le grand
                        conp en 1905 en créant pour le besoin de la cause pour 20 à 24 millions de
                        traites, la spéoulation a marqué et entrainé la catastrophe. Attendu qu'il
                        semble que dans ces conditions Davey touchait ses appointements élevés comme
                        administrateur-délégué et les dividendes comme actionnaire pendant les
                        quatre ans où la Société était déjà en déconfiture et ne vivait
                        qa'artificiellement par les soi-disant arbitrages, n'a pas de base morale
                        pour se disculper en se prévalant de son ignorance quant à la création des
                        traites signées par Leroux depuis mai 1905 et pour se créer par les motifs
                        du licenciement de Poutrel, s'il l'a voulu, un état d'irresponsa bilité
                        qu'il ne peut pas avoir.</p>
                    <p>(Suivent quatre autres attendus)</p>
                    <p>Par ces motifs, sans s'arrêter aux fins plus amples ou contraires de part et
                        d'autre, rejette la demande comme non justifiée, déboute également le
                        défendeur et le demandeur, reconventionnellement comme sans base sérieuse,
                        compense les frais judiciaires et extrajudiciai</p>

                    <p>Victoria Déan with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. The Judge then
                        addressed the prisoner and told him that he had been lucky, first, in being
                        so well defended, and secondly, in not killing the woman. On the other hand,
                        his conduct went to show that the action was unpremidated and repented of as
                        soon as done, ard had been committed in a moment of overexcitement. Taking
                        this and the prisoner's attempt at suicide into account, he would inflict A
                        sentence of only two years' imprisonment with hard labour. The Court rose at
                        about 3.50 p.m.</p>

                    <head>ALL SAINTS' CHURCH.</head>
                    <p>The annual meeting of the Committee of All Saints' Church took place at the
                        British Agency on Friday, November 10th, at 3 p.m. Present, Lord Cromer in
                        the Chair, Brig. Gen. Bullock, Lord Edward Cecil, Mr. A, D. Alban, Dean
                        Butcher, Judge Tuck, Capt. Lyons, Mr. Russel, Mr. Geo. Walker and Mr. Du
                        Boulay.</p>
                    <p>The minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed.</p>
                    <p>The accounts were presented and passed subject to audit.</p>
                    <p>A letter was read by Mr. Hooker resigning the office of Treasurer. Lord
                        Cromer proposed and Dean Butcher seconded a vote of thanks to Mr. Hooker for
                        his past valuable services and expressed regret that he felt obliged to
                        resign the office he had filled for so many years. Lord Cromer then
                        announced that Mr. Russell had kindly consented to take the post rendered
                        vacant by Mr. Hooker's resignation.</p>
                    <p>Lord Edward Cecil, who had hitherto represented Sir Reginald Wingate on the
                        Committee, was requested to join as a permanent member and it was resolved
                        that the Senior Officer in the Egyptian Army should represent the Sirdar
                        when he was absent.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Wiltrid Carey proposed that the interior of the Church should be painted
                        during the summer. Judge Tuck, Mr. Russell and Mr. Richmond were appointed
                        to act as a sub committee to consider the matter. The report of the Antoin
                        Yusef Charity Fund was read and discussed. During the year ending September
                        30th, the £1137s had been expended and 28 persons relieved. The fund proper
                        amounts to about £33.0.0 a year; but Mrs. Butcher had paid into that account
                        the proceeds of a concert given under the kind patronage of Lady Cromer in
                        aid of two special cases which had called for unusual expenditure during the
                        year. Crookshank Pasha had also collected and brought in the sum of £30 for
                        these extra cases; for which the ordinary income of the fund would have been
                        inadequate. ("All Saints' Church Magazine.")</p>

                        <p>Divine service has been resumed at St. Paul's Church by the Rev. Tyrwhitt
                            Drake, who is the chaplain this season.</p>
                        <p>A slight improvement has taken place in the railway journey to Helouan.
                            The distance is now covered in 35 minutes. Nevertheless there is still
                            much room for further amelioration.</p>
                        <p>A combined 1st class return ticket, with luncheon, either at the Grand or
                            at the Tewfik Palace Hotel, is now obtainable at the Bab-el-Louk station
                            for P.T. 20. No one can complain at the price except those who provide
                            the first class luncheon at either hotel.</p>
                        <p>As the question of rent is of such importance in Cairo, and the much
                            looked for villas in Abbassieh have not been even begun, it surprises
                            one why the Delta Railway Co., having all the conveniences at hand, does
                            not take the initiative in building villas in Helouan. Such villas will
                            readily let for £30 and £40 a year, giving a return of 9 or 10% per
                            annum. The company have the railways, the stone, the water supply, and,
                            in fact, everything requisite to commence building at once. There is one
                            thing, however, which is essential to success, and that is quick trains
                            at hours suitable to men of business. This has been hitherto the
                            stumbling block of Helouan as a place for residence; if it can be
                            overcome a big dividend should result.</p>
                        <p>If you were buying a house, you would not buy it because it had fancy
                            paper on the wall. You would go to the cellar, look at the foundations,
                            and look the house over thoroughly to see how it was built, before
                            buying. This is precisely what you want to do when buying a typewriter.

                    <p>While the goods tariff of the Nile-Red Sea Railway has not yet been decided
                        on, the Ottoman authorities are discussing the advisability of reducing the
                        Hedjaz Railway goods tariff, which at present amounts to 40 paras-or one.
                        Turkish piaster-per kilometric ton, to the low figure of 5 paras per
                        kilometric ton, with a view to opening up the trade between Syria and the
                        Hedjaz. It is not likely that this tariff will be adopted till the lines
                        reaches the holy land of Islam, but its adoption, if-and it is a big
                        'if'-the line is capably and honestly administered, should enable the Mecca
                        railway to compete with the Nile-Red Sea line as far as the export of grain
                        is concerned. There are to be no octroy duties on corn at the frontier
                        between the vilayets of Syria and Kedjaz, and Sudan corn will, of course,
                        have to contend with the 8 per cent. ad valoreon import duty imposed at
                        Jeddah. On the other hand, even granting that the Hedjaz line is well
                        managed, the Sudan line will be first in, for three years are likely to
                        elapse before the whistle of the engine is heard at Mecca. Moreover, as far
                        as the port S. of Jeddah are concerned, the Nile-Red Sea line can meet the
                        Turkish railway on favorable terms, inasmuch as the Hedjaz line is not
                        likely to be prolonged for many years to come.</p>

                    <p>Sicily's latest brigand is the heir of all he ages, and he appreciates the
                        possibilities of journalism. Instead of sticking to the old laborious ruts
                        of going to individuals to frighten them out of their money, he just sends
                        to the editor of the local paper, a formal notice to the effect that if the
                        peasantry of the district do not wish to see their cattle perish, a certain
                        sum, raised among them, had better be in his hand by a fixed fate. Of

                        otherwise, from the point of view of the journal concerned. Failla, as the
                        brigand is named, surmounts these by enclosing with his advertisement an

                    <head>A NOVEL WEDDING TRIP</head>
                    <p>The following amusing incident is cabled by a "Telegraph" New York
                        correspondent:</p>
                    <p>An instance of a man taking his wedding trip in a trunk was revealed near
                        Omaha yesterday. Lacking the money for his railway fare and wishing to take
                        his bride to see his father in Chicago, George Frances travelled inside his
                        wife's big dressing-case. Mrs. Frances apparently better endowed with wealth
                        traveled in a comfortable sleeper, and kept the key of the trunk in her
                        pocket-book. Near Omaha, the porter checking the trunks in his care heard a
                        noise within the dressing-case, and, suspecting the explanation, called out,
                        "Do you want a drink?" More noises came from the case, which was finally
                        unstrapped Frances was so stiff that he could hardly walk. He expressed
                        gratitude to the porter, and said he was sure it would have been physically
                        impossible for him to have reached his journey's end.</p>

                    <head>RECONSTRUCTION OF BELIEF</head>
                    <p>BY T.A.</p>
                    <p>II.</p>
                    <p>In my former article (published Nov. 8th) I briefly sketched the method
                        adopted by Mr. Mallock in his treatment of his subject. But such matters as
                        Deterministic science, Molecular conditions and pre-arrangements, etc., are
                        so highly technical and purely scientific that I do not propose to go into
                        any of the arguments so ably advanced by the author, contenting myself with
                        to some extent summarizing the conclusions at which he has arrived as the
                        outcome of his analysis. Even to do this with thoroughness would probably
                        result in too lengthy a paper to be of interest to the general reader, while
                        at the same time it would be of little use to the student who would be
                        wishful to study the arguments carefully.</p>
                    <p>The arguments on pre-arrangement and chance, and pre-arrangement and purpose
                        are of great interest, and the author sees himself the task of confuting the
                        conclusions of Professor Haeckel with much ability. He denies the existence
                        of such a thing chance, and states that "the objective certainties are
                        forewritten and potentially visible before any special chance is thought
                        of." As an illustration of this he takes the case of two pedestrians who
                        come on an unknown railway, and stop to bet on whether the next train that
                        passes will be a passenger train or a goods train. While for the pedestrians
                        this will be a matter of pure chance, for the railway officials it is a
                        matter of certainty. So the conclusion is drawn that chance as applied to
                        human nature is a doctrine of human nature, not of any facts external to it.
                        But this and many other instances of what are called change, such as tossing
                        of a coin, the movements of a roulette ball, etc., may be explainable by
                        known physical laws. If Mr. Mallock had, instead of the railway trains,
                        instanced the case of two sportsmen betting upon whether a sparrow or a
                        starling would be the next bird to fall to the gun of one, and had explained
                        how foreknowledge of the result came about, he would have dealt with a more
                        difficult phase of the question. Sir Oliver Lodge, in a recent lecture on
                        "Science and Religion" delivered at the Lecture Hall of the City Temple,
                        London (the Rev. R J. Campbell, M A. presiding), in speaking of another very
                        difficult problem – free will and foreknowledge – gave his hearers the
                        following advice: "If you cannot reconcile free will with foreknowledge,
                        think carefully whether you have reason to believe in both, and if you have,
                        if your experience lead you to believe that both are true, then hold both,
                        and wait for the reconciliation." In the "Fortnightly Review" for last month
                        Mr. Mallock say that Sir Oliver Lodge has not arrived at his conclusions
                        scientifically. Site Oliver replied that he must have arrived at them
                        scientifically if at all; for he has had no other training worth speaking
                        of. Perhaps some day Mr. Mallock will have taken a further step in advance,
                        that will bring him into line with the more progressive scientific thought
                        of the day. At present his spiritual perceptions seem somewhat undeveloped
                        and the concluding chapter of the book, on Religion and Religions, is one of
                        the least value to the student, and not, to be compared in clearness of
                        argument with what has gone before. I have somewhat digressed for the
                        purpose of making a comparison which appears to me a very apposite one.
                        Returning to the question with which I was dealing, Mr. Mallock sums up the
                        arguments on Chance and Purpose thus:–</p>
                    <p>For it the universe is, as according to Spence and Haeckel it must be, the
                        soil and sufficient cause of every human intelligence and if each
                        intelligence only is what it is, and only does what it does likewise, and
                        always was what it was, and always did what is did, the universe itself, as
                        a whole, actually is the intelligence which the human being manifests, and
                        the human being as distinct from it, is nothing more than its instrument.
                        Thus the very science, which as expounded by Spencer and Professor Haeckel
                        has oppressed religious thought from the days of Darwin onwards, which is
                        denounced by its enemies as the grossest form of materialism, which is in
                        reality the strictest form of determinism, and for all practical purposes is
                        the completest form of atheism, is found to hatch itself, under the
                        incubation of its own principles, into the re-affirmation of a Power to
                        which, since it feels and purposes, no other name is applicable than that of
                        a living Deity.</p>
                    <p>A short chapter following is devoted to a statement of the difficulties
                        connected with the moral character of the Cosmic Intelligence and the
                        relation of it to the human mind. The following extract gives the pith of
                        this matter: –</p>
                    <p>This Intelligence must, from all time, so have arranged the universe that not
                        only saints and martyrs, philosophers, heroes, poets shall think its
                        thoughts, feel with it, and will its will, but that every savage and
                        lecherous monster shall feel, think, will with it also. The universe, in
                        short, appears to us as a sort of cosmic Briareus, with a hundred heads,
                        instead of a hundred hands, each head talking a different language, and its
                        eyes regarding us with a look of different meaning. Here the eyes of love;
                        here are the eyes of hatred; one mouth whispers a prayer, its neighbor mouth
                        is blaspheming; yet the blood in the brains of all of them comes from the
                        same heart. What can the heart be that ministers to so mad a discord? </p>
                    <p>And, if we succeed in harmonizing this multitude of moral contradictions in
                        the Deity there still remains the question of the moral nature of man.</p>
                    <p>The author's endeavours to solve these questions form the concluding part of
                        his book.</p>
                    <p>The first chapter in Book IV. is entitled "Current Evasion of Difficulties,"
                        and Mr. Mallock greatly mare the effect of his argument by the language he
                        permits himself to use respecting clerical methods. Although he guards
                        himself in the first instance by saying, "If it were not for the fact that
                        this method is practised in perfect good faith and that those who practise
                        it are the first people to be taken in by it, we might call it the method of
                        theological conjuring or – to speak even more plainly – theological card
                        sharping," yet this suggestions of conjuring appears again and again
                        throughout the chapter, while the good faith received no further mention.
                        The author's logic is merciless, but his way of enforcing his arguments is
                        calculated to cause needless irritation. The following chapter elaborates
                        "the great truth upon which Spencer himself insists viz. that human religion
                        is the product of far-reaching and deep-seated causes, and that there must
                        be something which corresponds to it in the general constitution of the
                        universe." Much in this chapter is well worth quoting, but I will confine
                        myself to stating the conclusion arrived at: "Is," says Mr. Mallock, "all
                        deep-seated and widely-spread beliefs have, as according to strict science
                        they must have, some equally general fact in the constitution of things as
                        their origin; if moreover the religious assertion that the supreme principle
                        is good, represents as it does, once of the most powerful instincts of human
                        nature; and further, if this assertions, when assumed in practical life,
                        results in what by all is recognized as human development, whilst the denial
                        of it results in what is similarly recognised as decay; then in spite of the
                        difficulties which the facts of evil present to us, the balance of
                        probabilities in favor of the religious assertion is, from some points of
                        view, overwhelming."</p>
                    <p>The great question of reconciling the undoubted existence of evil with the
                        Divine Goodness is next considered or rather shirked, for the chapter in
                        which it is professedly dealt with is devotes to showing how impossible it
                        is to form a conception of the Infinite, and that even "Christ himself,
                        though proclaimed as the word by which the worlds were made, is not
                        represented even in John's Gospel as manifesting to men any knowledge of
                        what the cosmic process was," and the only answer given to the difficulty is
                        this: – "The intellect is incompetent to solve the contradiction, but is
                        nevertheless competent, with its eyes open, to disregard it. All solutions
                        of it are hopeless. They are shame subterfuges, the nostrums of theological
                        quacks." As Sir Oliver Lodge contends, we must wait for the reconciliation,
                        but with Sir Oliver, as I have already said, Mr. Mallock is not in
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>In the chapter on Personality and the Universe, the author shows how little
                        his spiritual perceptions are developed, by attacking Sir Oliver, who, he
                        says, is one of those who believe in the reality of telepathy and other
                        so-called spiritualistic phenomena." The chapter is an interesting one, but
                        opens up so many questions and deals with so many theories, that I must
                        leave it for readers of the book to consider, and not attempt to indicate
                        their complex nature.</p>
                    <p>"Science," says Mr. Mallock, "will play a direct part in the stimulation of
                        active religion by forcing the waters of belief to flow in a given channel,
                        and thus become capable like a mill-stream of doing active and definite
                        work, instead of wasting themselves on impotent rivulets, or stagnating in a
                        shallow flood." No doubt it will, but, after all, what has the author done
                        to justify the title of his book? He has elaborately criticized Haeckel,
                        Spencer, Lodge and others, has quoted Dean Mansell and other theologians,
                        but the promise of attempted construction appears to be confined to
                        predictions similar to the one I have just quoted, and little beyond. Nor
                        could it well have been otherwise. Where Spencer failed, others are hardly
                        likely to succeed, and until scientists follow the example of Sit Oliver
                        Lodge and Professor James, and recognize the spiritual forces that come to
                        man's aid when science fails to satisfy the soul's hunger, so long will they
                        fail to formulate any belief that can be acceptable to the seeker after
                        truth. None the less is Mr. Mallock's book one of great value to the student
                        and far in advance of Haeckel and his theories. (Concluded.)</p>

                    <p>The Fayoum is a large circular depression in the Libyan Desert, situated
                        immediately to the west of the Nile Valley and occupying the site of the
                        ancient Lake Moeris, which has now shrunk to the much smaller sheet of water
                        known as the Birket-el-Qurun.</p>
                    <p>After describing the physical characters of the province, which is watered by
                        a branch of the Nile, the author discusses the proposal to utilize the Wadi
                        Rayan, a deep depression to the westward, as a Nile reservoir in the same
                        manner as Lake Moeris was employed in former times.</p>
                    <p>The geology is then dealt with in considerable detail. Overlying nummulitio
                        limestone of middle Eocene age is a fluviomarine series which referred to
                        the upper Eocene and Oligocene. The Miocene is absent, but is represented by
                        similar deposits in the depression of Mogara some 100 kilometres to the
                        north-west. The Oligocene is covered by marine Pliocene and by beds of
                        gypsum probably deposited from sea water, but in Pleistocene times the
                        depression appears to have been occupied by the fresh water lake which
                        persisted into the historical period. At the base of the fluviomarine beds
                        Dr. C. W. Andrews, of the British Museum (Natural History), found extensive
                        remains of mammals and reptiles which he has since described. </p>
                    <p>The book is illustrated by a number of plans and sections as well as by
                        sixteen full-page reproductions of photographs.</p>

                    <p>The reports of the Egyptian cotton crop for 1905 show that it has not reached
                        the maximum attained before the construction of the Assouan Reservoirs. The
                        Department of State has instructed the diplomatic agent and consul-general
                        at Cairo, Mr. Iddings, to ascertain the exact area, if any, added to the
                        cultivated land as the result of the Assouan Reservoir; the increased area,
                        if any. Of land converted from inundated to perennially irrigated land on
                        which cotton can grown; and how much of the cotton raised since 1903 was
                        grown on land previously used for sugar cane. </p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer states that the excess of imported sugar, in 1904-05, over that
                        of the preceding year was 20,000 tons, largely due to the substitution of
                        cotton, requiring less water per acre, for sugar cane. Instructions have
                        also been sent, at the request of Mr. Cope Whitehouse to ascertain the exact
                        situation of his Raiyan project, with a view to its creation by American
                        constructors and engineers, in case the work has not been commenced by the
                        Egyptian Public Works Ministry.</p>
                    <p>It if be true that the Assouan Reservoir is a total failure, it is a triumph
                        for the French representative on the technical commission of 1984; but it
                        will cause keen distress to the artistic world; which will have now more
                        reason than ever to denounce the submergence of Phileas useless

                        instability by its opposites. It has been, no doubt, labour of love to them
                        throughout, but none the less does the obligation rest on the nation which
                        sent them forth to testify its warm appreciation of the splendid work they
                        have accomplished. Withan estimated revenue of fourteen and half millions
                        for next year. The Cairo Treasury comes into sight of a half million
                        surplus, although taxation is remitted to an appreciable extent. And so it
                        goes on, year after year; there is no longer any swing of the pendulum in
                        either Egyptian finance or in the economic improvement which has gradually
                        occurred. There are some authorities who argue that such a prosperous
                        condition of affairs should be taken advantage of to hasten the liquidation
                        of the State's indebtedness to it bondholders. But although much might be
                        said for that policy in the case of other countries suffering from inflated
                        national debts, Egypt occupies a wholly different position. By spending
                        surpluses on irrigation works, railway construction, and the economic
                        development of the Sudan, the Cairo Treasury puts them to a more profitable
                        use, even from a purely monetary standpoint, than if it were to devote them
                        to the liquidation of the external debt.</p>

                    <head>PULSE AND VERBAL RHYTHM.</head>
                    <p>Mrs. Mary Hallock Greenewalt has written a most attractive little essay on a
                        subject that has, as yet, received little attention, even from poets and
                        musicians-the basis of rhythm in poetry and music. This she finds in the
                        human heart beat, with its reiteration on the brain, which unconsiously
                        communicate themselves to any rhythmical expression whether sung, chanted,
                        recited, or played upon an instrument. </p>
                    <p>Here is an explanation: "Clearly time is neccesary to verse. Too much of it
                        is disatrous. Uttered at the rate of fifty quantities a minute an impossible
                        drone meets the ear. One hunddred and twenty quantities a minute is
                        unnaturally fast, so that, roughly speaking, the limit of speed at which
                        verbal quantities are possible stands at a time rate of between sixty and
                        one hundred beats to the minute. Just this is true of musical rythms. Just
                        this scope of beat confronts the physician when he feels a normal
                        pulse."</p>
                    <p>"It is strange," asks the writer later on, "if with such rigorous instruction
                        on the heart should have taught the head regular recorrence." Differences in
                        rhythm when due to the subject correspond to the differences in the cardiac
                        pulse which is raised by exhilaration and lowered by greif or weariness.</p>
                    <p>The theory is extremely attractive- unfortunately it explains too little. If
                        all rithmal utterance be the product, in a sense, of the unconsious muscular
                        action of the heart, why does human utterant tend to become less and less
                        rythmic? Assuming the earliest man to have communicated by cries of varying
                        intensity and timbre to his fellows and noting that animal sounds are
                        usually rythmical, how is it that unrythmical speech exists? By the authors
                        theory it should have been abandoned at an early stage - if ever attempted-
                        in favor of a rythmical expression. Or can it be proved that the rhythm
                        still underlies spoken word? Amultitude of phonograghic records can alone
                        elucidate this point.</p>
                    <p>Another point-"In the travail of poetis workmanship, the rhythmis light has
                        pales and faded and all but died." Surley, the high the workmanship the more
                        perfect and subtle the rhythm, for Browning and Carlyle have not- thank
                        Heavan! said the last word in poetry ad prose. Taking out modern English
                        poets and versifiers let us select aline from Mr. Yeats, who assuradly
                        belong to the first class: "And the names of the demons, whose hammers made
                        armour for Conor of old." The caesura would here fall naturally after
                        "hammers", but the sense of the line carries one on through the caesure with
                        an accelerated tampo imitating, as it were, the rapid strokes on the glowing
                        bronze. Then to Mr.Kipling-usually a versifier and at times a poet- does not
                        the couplet.</p>
                    <p>"Where the sea egg flames in the coral and the long backed breakers
                        croon,</p>
                    <p>Their endless Ocean welcomes to the lazy locked lagoon"</p>
                    <p>Even if its artifice is a little too obviousus, it rhythm to sense most
                        admirably? And, remember, we can have too much of a rhythm- rythmically no
                        more perfect poem of its kind than "A'alant in Calydon' exists in the
                        language, but it was not Lowell, greatest of American critics, who remarked
                        that a poem might be too poetical?</p>

                    <p>St.Andrew FC</p>
                    <p>These teams met on the college ground on Saturday afternoon, the meeting
                        resulting n a very enjoyable game all around, and ending in a goal less
                        draw. Play for the greater part was confined to midfield; so strong was the
                        play of both defenses that the opposing forwards were sledom able to get
                        through. Occasional visits were made to both custodians, however, but the
                        custodians were never found wanting, and play was quickly transferred. The
                        college team played a very effective long passing game, and the forwards
                        were always quick to take up the ball. The Saints, on the other hand adopted
                        the short passing game, but the college halves were always on alert to
                        intercept. The play was even throughout, and the result is fully
                        representative of the play of both sides. The game was entirely free from
                        the rough element, and the school team are to be complimented on the
                        excelent stand they made against the heavier St. Andrew men.The following

                            Cairo and Alexandria. I beg to point out that commercial houses as well
                            as newspaper advertisers could help the public and incidentally help
                            themselves by inserting their house number and name of street on their
                            envelopes and letter papers as well as in the body of any and all
                            advertisements. I customer or client, even if not a new one, cannot be
                            expected to know the address always.</p>

                        <p>Boiled Water</p>
                        <p>Sir,-I see in your paper that eminent civil doctor Leigh Canney is still
                            to the fore on the above subject. I never before heard that "The
                            principle was amatter of not acepted etc." I fancied, on the contrary,
                            that it was very muc the other way around, and that very serious
                            difficulties were found in it, by those best qualified to judge. I
                            certainly remember areading, I think in your columns, a long statement
                            which seemed to me to prove, not only that the system had been carefully
                            studied, but that it had been found wanting. </p>
                        <p>Dr. Canney certainly failed to convince the Army Medical Board, but the
                            rejection of his scheme does not seem to me to be any proof that no
                            steps are to be taken to attain the result he aims at- in a more
                            practical manner. </p>
                        <p>I do not pretend to speak with any authority on the matter, but I have on
                            several occasions reached a spring or well after a long day's march,
                            hours after water bottles had benn exhausted, and no mortal power, short
                            of absolute coercion, would have induced me to wait until the water had
                            been boiled and cooled again, before taking a drink.</p>
                        <p>In modern times, it has become, more than formerly, a recognized fact
                            that private soldiers are human beings just as much as their superior
                            officers, and a wise discipline takes this into consideration; but if on
                            the other habd our scouts are to be fastened to the tail of boiled water
                            cart, why then we had better at once give up the idea of defending
                            ourselves against any very active enemy.</p>
                        <p>Japan is a long way off, and it is pretty well known that our allies did
                            not allow outsiders to know much better evidence than we have yet heard,
                            to cconvince me that we know what sort of water Japanese soldiers did or
                            did not drink in the late campaign.</p>
                        <p>I did know a little about the Aessoun Camp, but I never heard on good
                            authority that Dr. Canney was inmeddical charge of it, or that his sytem
                            is sufficently practical to hold water, the sooner the bottom is knocked
                            out of it , the better.-I remain. etc</p>
