                            <p>The New Government</p>
                            <p>A telegram from London,which we publish today, announces that the
                                composition of the new Administration will not be announced till
                                next Monday. Speculation, therefore, will be rife at home during the
                                next week as to the selection which the new Premier will make.
                                Regret will be general that Earl Spencer was not sent for the King
                                instead of Sir Henry Cambell Bannerman. But he refused the task when
                                he was a younger man and his age- he is 70 years old- and his bad
                                health left the King no alternative, as Lord Rosenbery will not
                                accept office. Sir Henry would never agree to take office under Lord
                                Rosebery, especially in view of the latter's recent pronouncement on
                                Home Rule, and many Liberal Imperialists hoped that he would have
                                retired with peerage to the House of Lords in favor of Lord
                                Rosenbery, who would have combined the Permiership and Foreign
                                Secretaryship in his person. It will be very difficult to imagine
                                anyone but Lord Rosenbery, at the head of Foreign Office with the
                                single exception of Sir Edward Grey. After so long an exclusion from
                                office, it would be by no means undesirable that the Prime Minister
                                should for a breif period combine that office with the Foreign
                                Secretaryship. In no other way could he make sure of picking up the
                                threads, and of obtaining that first hand knowledge of international
                                forces and persons which a Prime Minister ought to possess. Putting
                                aside this suggestion and leaving out Lord Rosenbery, we can all
                                think of a young Liberal statesman who would inspire general
                                confidence either at the Foreign Office or at the Colonial
                                Secretary, it is not easy to think of any nomination to the Foreign
                                Office, except one, which would meet with the general approval of
                                the country at large. Lord Rosenbery will doubtless have therefusal,
                                but it is doubtless have the refusal, but it is doubtful if he will
                                take it. Leaving, then the Foreign Secretaryship aside, we may,
                                venture on the following adumbation of the new Ministry:-<table

                            <p>Another alternative is that Mr. Asquith will be Leader o the House,
                                while the inclusion of Mr. Winston Churchill is doubtful. If Sir
                                Edward Grey obtains the Foreign Secretaryship, the post of Colonial
                                Secretary may be given to Mr. Bryce. Mr. Haldane and Mr.
                                Lloyd-George will most probably be among the Under Secretaries,
                                while the posts of Attorney General and Solicitor General may be
                                given to Mr. Lawson Walton and Mr. W. S. Robson. The Liberals will
                                be so sure that the "flowing tide" of public favor is with them that
                                they will in all likelihood refuse any coalition with the Free Trade
                                Unionists, who on the Fiscal Question would join the Liberals in any
                                case, but would otherwise hamper the Government. </p>

                        <p>The annual meeting of the Committee of All Saints’ Church took place at
                            the British Agency on Friday, November 10th, at 3 p.m. Present, Lord
                            Cromer in the Chair, Brig. Gen. Bullock, Lord Edward Cecil, Mr. A, D.

                        <p>The minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed.</p>
                        <p>The accounts were presented and passed subject to audit.</p>
                        <p>A letter was read by Mr. Hooker resigning the office of Treasurer. Lord
                            Cromer proposed and Dean Butcher seconded a vote of thanks to Mr. Hooker
                            for his past valuable services and expressed regret that he felt obliged
                            to resign the office he had filled for so many years. Lord Cromer then
                            announced that Mr. Russell had kindly consented to take the post
                            rendered vacant by Mr. Hooker’s resignation.</p>
                        <p>Lord Edward Cecil, who had hitherto represented Sir Reginald Wingate on
                            the Committee, was requested to join as a permanent member and it was
                            resolved that the Senior Officer in the Egyptian Army should represent
                            the Sirdar when he was absent.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wiltrid Carey proposed that the interior of the Church should be
                            painted during the summer. Judge Tuck, Mr. Russell and Mr. Richmond were
                            appointed to act as a sub committee to consider the matter. The report
                            of the Antoin Yusef Charity Fund was read and discussed. During the year
                            ending September 30th, the £1137s had been expended and 28 persons
                            relieved. The fund proper amounts to about £33.0.0 a year; but Mrs.
                            Butcher had paid into that account the proceeds of a concert given under
                            the kind patronage of Lady Cromer in aid of two special cases which had
                            called for unusual expenditure during the year. Crookshank Pasha had
                            also collected and brought in the sum of £30 for these extra cases; for
                            which the ordinary income of the fund would have been inadequate. (“All

                        <p>HELOUAN NOTES.</p>
                        <p>(From Our Correspondent.)</p>
                        <p>Helouan, December 4.</p>
                        <p>Divine service has been resumed at St. Paul’s Church by the Rev. Tyrwhitt
                            Drake, who is the chaplain this season.</p>
                        <p>A slight improvement has taken place in the railway journey to Helouan.
                            The distance is now covered in 35 minutes. Nevertheless there is still
                            much room for further amelioration.</p>
                        <p>A combined 1st class return ticket, with luncheon, either at the Grand or
                            at the Tewfik Palace Hotel, is now obtainable at the Bab-el-Louk station
                            for P.T. 20. No one can complain at the price except those who provide
                            the first class luncheon at either hotel.</p>
                        <p>As the question of rent is of such importance in Cairo, and the much
                            looked for villas in Abbassieh have not been even begun, it surprises
                            one why the Delta Railway Co., having all the conveniences at hand, does
                            not take the initiative in building villas in Helouan. Such villas will
                            readily let for £30 and £40 a year, giving a return of 9 or 10% per
                            annum. The company have the railways, the stone, the water supply, and,
                            in fact, everything requisite to commence building at once. There is one
                            thing, however, which is essential to success, and that is quick trains
                            at hours suitable to men of business. This has been hitherto the
                            stumbling block of Helouan as a place for residence; if it can be
                            overcome a big dividend should result.</p>
                        <p>If you were buying a house, you would not buy it because it had fancy
                            paper on the wall. You would go to the cellar, look at the foundations,
                            and look the house over thoroughly to see how it was built, before
                            buying. This is precisely what you want to do when buying a typewriter.
                            We are sure that is that case you shall buy a Smith Premier.</p>
                        <p>NILE-RED SEA RAILWAY</p>
                        <p>While the goods tariff of the Nile-Red Sea Railway has not yet been
                            decided on, the Ottoman authorities are discussing the advisability of
                            reducing the Hedjaz Railway goods tariff, which at present amounts to 40
                            paras-or one. Turkish piaster-per kilometric ton, to the low figure of 5
                            paras per kilometric ton, with a view to opening up the trade between
                            Syria and the Hedjaz. It is not likely that this tariff will be adopted
                            till the lines reaches the holy land of Islam, but its adoption, if-and
                            it is a big ‘if’-the line is capably and honestly administered, should
                            enable the Mecca railway to compete with the Nile-Red Sea line as far as
                            the export of grain is concerned. There are to be no octroy duties on
                            corn at the frontier between the vilayets of Syria and Kedjaz, and Sudan
                            corn will, of course, have to contend with the 8 per cent. ad valoreon
                            import duty imposed at Jeddah. On the other hand, even granting that the
                            Hedjaz line is well managed, the Sudan line will be first in, for three
                            years are likely to elapse before the whistle of the engine is heard at
                            Mecca. Moreover, as far as the port S. of Jeddah are concerned, the
                            Nile-Red Sea line can meet the Turkish railway on favorable terms,
                            inasmuch as the Hedjaz line is not likely to be prolonged for many years
                            to come.</p>
                        <p>BRIGANDAGE BY ADVERTISEMENT</p>
                        <p>Sicily’s latest brigand is the heir of all he ages, and he appreciates
                            the possibilities of journalism. Instead of sticking to the old
                            laborious ruts of going to individuals to frighten them out of their
                            money, he just sends to the editor of the local paper, a formal notice
                            to the effect that if the peasantry of the district do not wish to see
                            their cattle perish, a certain sum, raised among them, had better be in
                            his hand by a fixed fate. Of course, in such a made of procedure there
                            are difficulties, financial and otherwise, from the point of view of the
                            journal concerned. Failla, as the brigand is named, surmounts these by
                            enclosing with his advertisement an intimation that unless it is
                            inserted gratis next morning, the editor need not trouble to order
                            dinner for evening. One of the leading daily papers in Sicily has just
                            inserted one of the brigand’s notices on these terms.</p>
                        <p>A NOVEL WEDDING TRIP</p>
                        <p>The following amusing incident is cabled by a “Telegraph” New York
                            correspondent:</p>
                        <p>An instance of a man taking his wedding trip in a trunk was revealed near
                            Omaha yesterday. Lacking the money for his railway fare and wishing to
                            take his bride to see his father in Chicago, George Frances travelled
                            inside his wife’s big dressing-case. Mrs. Frances apparently better
                            endowed with wealth traveled in a comfortable sleeper, and kept the key
                            of the trunk in her pocket-book. Near Omaha, the porter checking the
                            trunks in his care heard a noise within the dressing-case, and,
                            suspecting the explanation, called out, “Do you want a drink?” More
                            noises came from the case, which was finally unstrapped Frances was so
                            stiff that he could hardly walk. He expressed gratitude to the porter,
                            and said he was sure it would have been physically impossible for him to
                            have reached his journey’s end.</p>

                    <p>RECONSTRUCTION OF BELIEF</p>
                    <p>BY T.A.</p>
                    <p>II.</p>
                    <p>In my former article (published Nov. 8th) I briefly sketched the method
                        adopted by Mr. Mallock in his treatment of his subject. But such matters as
                        Deterministic science, Molecular conditions and pre-arrangements, etc., are
                        so highly technical and purely scientific that I do not propose to go into
                        any of the arguments so ably advanced by the author, contenting myself with
                        to some extent summarizing the conclusions at which he has arrived as the
                        outcome of his analysis. Even to do this with thoroughness would probably
                        result in too lengthy a paper to be of interest to the general reader, while
                        at the same time it would be of little use to the student who would be
                        wishful to study the arguments carefully.</p>
                    <p>The arguments on pre-arrangement and chance, and pre-arrangement and purpose
                        are of great interest, and the author sees himself the task of confuting the
                        conclusions of Professor Haeckel with much ability. He denies the existence
                        of such a thing chance, and states that “the objective certainties are
                        forewritten and potentially visible before any special chance is thought
                        of.” As an illustration of this he takes the case of two pedestrians who
                        come on an unknown railway, and stop to bet on whether the next train that
                        passes will be a passenger train or a goods train. While for the pedestrians
                        this will be a matter of pure chance, for the railway officials it is a
                        matter of certainty. So the conclusion is drawn that chance as applied to
                        human nature is a doctrine of human nature, not of any facts external to it.
                        But this and many other instances of what are called change, such as tossing
                        of a coin, the movements of a roulette ball, etc., may be explainable by
                        known physical laws. If Mr. Mallock had, instead of the railway trains,
                        instanced the case of two sportsmen betting upon whether a sparrow or a
                        starling would be the next bird to fall to the gun of one, and had explained
                        how foreknowledge of the result came about, he would have dealt with a more
                        difficult phase of the question. Sir Oliver Lodge, in a recent lecture on
                        “Science and Religion” delivered at the Lecture Hall of the City Temple,
                        London (the Rev. R J. Campbell, M A. presiding), in speaking of another very
                        difficult problem – free will and foreknowledge – gave his hearers the
                        following advice: “If you cannot reconcile free will with foreknowledge,
                        think carefully whether you have reason to believe in both, and if you have,
                        if your experience lead you to believe that both are true, then hold both,
                        and wait for the reconciliation.” In the “Fortnightly Review” for last month
                        Mr. Mallock say that Sir Oliver Lodge has not arrived at his conclusions
                        scientifically. Site Oliver replied that he must have arrived at them
                        scientifically if at all; for he has had no other training worth speaking
                        of. Perhaps some day Mr. Mallock will have taken a further step in advance,
                        that will bring him into line with the more progressive scientific thought
                        of the day. At present his spiritual perceptions seem somewhat undeveloped
                        and the concluding chapter of the book, on Religion and Religions, is one of
                        the least value to the student, and not, to be compared in clearness of
                        argument with what has gone before. I have somewhat digressed for the
                        purpose of making a comparison which appears to me a very apposite one.
                        Returning to the question with which I was dealing, Mr. Mallock sums up the
                        arguments on Chance and Purpose thus:–</p>
                    <p>For it the universe is, as according to Spence and Haeckel it must be, the
                        soil and sufficient cause of every human intelligence and if each
                        intelligence only is what it is, and only does what it does likewise, and
                        always was what it was, and always did what is did, the universe itself, as
                        a whole, actually is the intelligence which the human being manifests, and
                        the human being as distinct from it, is nothing more than its instrument.
                        Thus the very science, which as expounded by Spencer and Professor Haeckel
                        has oppressed religious thought from the days of Darwin onwards, which is
                        denounced by its enemies as the grossest form of materialism, which is in
                        reality the strictest form of determinism, and for all practical purposes is
                        the completest form of atheism, is found to hatch itself, under the
                        incubation of its own principles, into the re-affirmation of a Power to
                        which, since it feels and purposes, no other name is applicable than that of
                        a living Deity.</p>
                    <p>A short chapter following is devoted to a statement of the difficulties
                        connected with the moral character of the Cosmic Intelligence and the
                        relation of it to the human mind. The following extract gives the pith of
                        this matter: –</p>
                    <p>This Intelligence must, from all time, so have arranged the universe that not
                        only saints and martyrs, philosophers, heroes, poets shall think its
                        thoughts, feel with it, and will its will, but that every savage and
                        lecherous monster shall feel, think, will with it also. The universe, in
                        short, appears to us as a sort of cosmic Briareus, with a hundred heads,
                        instead of a hundred hands, each head talking a different language, and its
                        eyes regarding us with a look of different meaning. Here the eyes of love;
                        here are the eyes of hatred; one mouth whispers a prayer, its neighbor mouth
                        is blaspheming; yet the blood in the brains of all of them comes from the
                        same heart. What can the heart be that ministers to so mad a discord? </p>
                    <p>And, if we succeed in harmonizing this multitude of moral contradictions in
                        the Deity there still remains the question of the moral nature of man.</p>
                    <p>The author’s endeavours to solve these questions form the concluding part of
                        his book.</p>
                    <p>The first chapter in Book IV. is entitled “Current Evasion of Difficulties,”
                        and Mr. Mallock greatly mare the effect of his argument by the language he
                        permits himself to use respecting clerical methods. Although he guards
                        himself in the first instance by saying, “If it were not for the fact that
                        this method is practised in perfect good faith and that those who practise
                        it are the first people to be taken in by it, we might call it the method of
                        theological conjuring or – to speak even more plainly – theological card
                        sharping,” yet this suggestions of conjuring appears again and again
                        throughout the chapter, while the good faith received no further mention.
                        The author’s logic is merciless, but his way of enforcing his arguments is
                        calculated to cause needless irritation. The following chapter elaborates
                        “the great truth upon which Spencer himself insists viz. that human religion
                        is the product of far-reaching and deep-seated causes, and that there must
                        be something which corresponds to it in the general constitution of the
                        universe.” Much in this chapter is well worth quoting, but I will confine
                        myself to stating the conclusion arrived at: “Is,” says Mr. Mallock, “all
                        deep-seated and widely-spread beliefs have, as according to strict science
                        they must have, some equally general fact in the constitution of things as
                        their origin; if moreover the religious assertion that the supreme principle
                        is good, represents as it does, once of the most powerful instincts of human
                        nature; and further, if this assertions, when assumed in practical life,
                        results in what by all is recognized as human development, whilst the denial
                        of it results in what is similarly recognised as decay; then in spite of the
                        difficulties which the facts of evil present to us, the balance of
                        probabilities in favor of the religious assertion is, from some points of
                        view, overwhelming.”</p>
                    <p>The great question of reconciling the undoubted existence of evil with the
                        Divine Goodness is next considered or rather shirked, for the chapter in
                        which it is professedly dealt with is devotes to showing how impossible it
                        is to form a conception of the Infinite, and that even “Christ himself,
                        though proclaimed as the word by which the worlds were made, is not
                        represented even in John’s Gospel as manifesting to men any knowledge of
                        what the cosmic process was,” and the only answer given to the difficulty is
                        this: – “The intellect is incompetent to solve the contradiction, but is
                        nevertheless competent, with its eyes open, to disregard it. All solutions
                        of it are hopeless. They are shame subterfuges, the nostrums of theological
                        quacks.” As Sir Oliver Lodge contends, we must wait for the reconciliation,
                        but with Sir Oliver, as I have already said, Mr. Mallock is not in
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>In the chapter on Personality and the Universe, the author shows how little
                        his spiritual perceptions are developed, by attacking Sir Oliver, who, he
                        says, is one of those who believe in the reality of telepathy and other
                        so-called spiritualistic phenomena.” The chapter is an interesting one, but
                        opens up so many questions and deals with so many theories, that I must
                        leave it for readers of the book to consider, and not attempt to indicate
                        their complex nature.</p>
                    <p>“Science,” says Mr. Mallock, “will play a direct part in the stimulation of
                        active religion by forcing the waters of belief to flow in a given channel,
                        and thus become capable like a mill-stream of doing active and definite
                        work, instead of wasting themselves on impotent rivulets, or stagnating in a
                        shallow flood.” No doubt it will, but, after all, what has the author done
                        to justify the title of his book? He has elaborately criticized Haeckel,
                        Spencer, Lodge and others, has quoted Dean Mansell and other theologians,
                        but the promise of attempted construction appears to be confined to
                        predictions similar to the one I have just quoted, and little beyond. Nor
                        could it well have been otherwise. Where Spencer failed, others are hardly
                        likely to succeed, and until scientists follow the example of Sit Oliver
                        Lodge and Professor James, and recognize the spiritual forces that come to
                        man’s aid when science fails to satisfy the soul’s hunger, so long will they
                        fail to formulate any belief that can be acceptable to the seeker after
                        truth. None the less is Mr. Mallock’s book one of great value to the student
                        and far in advance of Haeckel and his theories. (Concluded.)</p>

                    <p>FAYOUM GEOLOGY.</p>
                    <p>The Fayoum is a large circular depression in the Libyan Desert, situated
                        immediately to the west of the Nile Valley and occupying the site of the
                        ancient Lake Moeris, which has now shrunk to the much smaller sheet of water
                        known as the Birket-el-Qurun.</p>
                    <p>After describing the physical characters of the province, which is watered by
                        a branch of the Nile, the author discusses the proposal to utilize the Wadi
                        Rayan, a deep depression to the westward, as a Nile reservoir in the same
                        manner as Lake Moeris was employed in former times.</p>
                    <p>The geology is then dealt with in considerable detail. Overlying nummulitio
                        limestone of middle Eocene age is a fluviomarine series which referred to
                        the upper Eocene and Oligocene. The Miocene is absent, but is represented by
                        similar deposits in the depression of Mogara some 100 kilometres to the
                        north-west. The Oligocene is covered by marine Pliocene and by beds of
                        gypsum probably deposited from sea water, but in Pleistocene times the
                        depression appears to have been occupied by the fresh water lake which
                        persisted into the historical period. At the base of the fluviomarine beds
                        Dr. C. W. Andrews, of the British Museum (Natural History), found extensive
                        remains of mammals and reptiles which he has since described. </p>
                    <p>The book is illustrated by a number of plans and sections as well as by
                        sixteen full-page reproductions of photographs.</p>

                    <p>AMERICAN OPINION.</p>
                    <p>Washington Nov. 15.</p>
                    <p>The reports of the Egyptian cotton crop for 1905 show that it has not reached
                        the maximum attained before the construction of the Assouan Reservoirs. The
                        Department of State has instructed the diplomatic agent and consul-general
                        at Cairo, Mr. Iddings, to ascertain the exact area, if any, added to the
                        cultivated land as the result of the Assouan Reservoir; the increased area,
                        if any. Of land converted from inundated to perennially irrigated land on
                        which cotton can grown; and how much of the cotton raised since 1903 was
                        grown on land previously used for sugar cane. </p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer states that the excess of imported sugar, in 1904-05, over that
                        of the preceding year was 20,000 tons, largely due to the substitution of
                        cotton, requiring less water per acre, for sugar cane. Instructions have
                        also been sent, at the request of Mr. Cope Whitehouse to ascertain the exact
                        situation of his Raiyan project, with a view to its creation by American
                        constructors and engineers, in case the work has not been commenced by the
                        Egyptian Public Works Ministry.</p>
                    <p>It if be true that the Assouan Reservoir is a total failure, it is a triumph
                        for the French representative on the technical commission of 1984; but it
                        will cause keen distress to the artistic world; which will have now more
                        reason than ever to denounce the submergence of Phileas useless
                        vandalism.</p>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p>EGYPT’S PROSPERITY.</p>
                    <p>Once more (says the “Globe”) the Egyptian Budget is a triumph for the skill
                        and patience of Lord Cromer and his able subordinated in replacing financial
                        instability by its opposites. It has been, no doubt, labour of love to them
                        throughout, but none the less does the obligation rest on the nation which
                        sent them forth to testify its warm appreciation of the splendid work they
                        have accomplished. Withan estimated revenue of fourteen and half millions
                        for next year. The Cairo Treasury comes into sight of a half million
                        surplus, although taxation is remitted to an appreciable extent. And so it
                        goes on, year after year; there is no longer any swing of the pendulum in
                        either Egyptian finance or in the economic improvement which has gradually
                        occurred. There are some authorities who argue that such a prosperous
                        condition of affairs should be taken advantage of to hasten the liquidation
                        of the State’s indebtedness to it bondholders. But although much might be
                        said for that policy in the case of other countries suffering from inflated
                        national debts, Egypt occupies a wholly different position. By spending
                        surpluses on irrigation works, railway construction, and the economic
                        development of the Sudan, the Cairo Treasury puts them to a more profitable
                        use, even from a purely monetary standpoint, than if it were to devote them
                        to the liquidation of the external debt.</p>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p>PULSE AND VERBAL RHYTHM.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Mary Hallock Greenewalt has written a most attractive little essay on a
                        subject that has, as yet, received little attention, even from poets and
                        musicians-the basis of rhythm in poetry and music. This she finds in the
                        human heart beat, with its reiteration on the brain, which unconsiously
                        communicate themselves to any rhythmical expression whether sung, chanted,
                        recited, or played upon an instrument. </p>
                    <p>Here is an explanation: "Clearly time is neccesary to verse. Too much of it
                        is disatrous. Uttered at the rate of fifty quantities a minute an impossible
                        drone meets the ear. One hunddred and twenty quantities a minute is
                        unnaturally fast, so that, roughly speaking, the limit of speed at which
                        verbal quantities are possible stands at a time rate of between sixty and
                        one hundred beats to the minute. Just this is true of musical rythms. Just
                        this scope of beat confronts the physician when he feels a normal
                        pulse."</p>
                    <p>"It is strange," asks the writer later on, "if with such rigorous instruction
                        on the heart should have taught the head regular recorrence." Differences in
                        rhythm when due to the subject correspond to the differences in the cardiac
                        pulse which is raised by exhilaration and lowered by greif or weariness.</p>
                    <p> The theory is extremely attractive- unfortunately it explains too little. If
                        all rithmal utterance be the product, in a sense, of the unconsious muscular
                        action of the heart, why does human utterant tend to become less and less
                        rythmic? Assuming the earliest man to have communicated by cries of varying
                        intensity and timbre to his fellows and noting that animal sounds are
                        usually rythmical, how is it that unrythmical speech exists? By the authors
                        theory it should have been abandoned at an early stage - if ever attempted-
                        in favor of a rythmical expression. Or can it be proved that the rhythm
                        still underlies spoken word? Amultitude of phonograghic records can alone
                        elucidate this point.</p>
                    <p>Another point-"In the travail of poetis workmanship, the rhythmis light has
                        pales and faded and all but died." Surley, the high the workmanship the more
                        perfect and subtle the rhythm, for Browning and Carlyle have not- thank
                        Heavan! said the last word in poetry ad prose. Taking out modern English
                        poets and versifiers let us select aline from Mr. Yeats, who assuradly
                        belong to the first class: "And the names of the demons, whose hammers made
                        armour for Conor of old." The caesura would here fall naturally after
                        "hammers", but the sense of the line carries one on through the caesure with
                        an accelerated tampo imitating, as it were, the rapid strokes on the glowing
                        bronze. Then to Mr.Kipling-usually a versifier and at times a poet- does not
                        the couplet.</p>
                    <p>"Where the sea egg flames in the coral and the long backed breakers
                        croon,</p>
                    <p>Their endless Ocean welcomes to the lazy locked lagoon"</p>
                    <p>Even if its artifice is a little too obviousus, it rhythm to sense most
                        admirably? And, remember, we can have too much of a rhythm- rythmically no
                        more perfect poem of its kind than "A'alant in Calydon' exists in the
                        language, but it was not Lowell, greatest of American critics, who remarked
                        that a poem might be too poetical?</p>

                    <p>Victoria College F.C</p>
                    <p>St.Andrew FC</p>
                    <p>These teams met on the college ground on Saturday afternoon, the meeting
                        resulting n a very enjoyable game all around, and ending in a goal less
                        draw. Play for the greater part was confined to midfield; so strong was the
                        play of both defenses that the opposing forwards were sledom able to get
                        through. Occasional visits were made to both custodians, however, but the
                        custodians were never found wanting, and play was quickly transferred. The
                        college team played a very effective long passing game, and the forwards
                        were always quick to take up the ball. The Saints, on the other hand adopted
                        the short passing game, but the college halves were always on alert to
                        intercept. The play was even throughout, and the result is fully
                        representative of the play of both sides. The game was entirely free from
                        the rough element, and the school team are to be complimented on the
                        excelent stand they made against the heavier St. Andrew men.The following

                    <p>House to House Delivary of Letters</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir,Re the oft repeated notice about house to house delivary in Cairo
                        and Alexandria. I beg to point out that commercial houses as well as
                        newspaper advertisers could help the public and incidentally help themselves
                        by inserting their house number and name of street on their envelopes and
                        letter papers as well as in the body of any and all advertisements. I
                        customer or client, even if not a new one, cannot be expected to know the
                        address always.</p>
                    <p>Tantah, Dec 2, 1905</p>
                    <p>Boiled Water</p>
                    <p>Sir,-I see in your paper that eminent civil doctor Leigh Canney is still to
                        the fore on the above subject. I never before heard that "The principle was
                        amatter of not acepted etc." I fancied, on the contrary, that it was very
                        muc the other way around, and that very serious difficulties were found in
                        it, by those best qualified to judge. I certainly remember areading, I think
                        in your columns, a long statement which seemed to me to prove, not only that
                        the system had been carefully studied, but that it had been found wanting. </p>
                    <p>Dr. Canney certainly failed to convince the Army Medical Board, but the
                        rejection of his scheme does not seem to me to be any proof that no steps
                        are to be taken to attain the result he aims at- in a more practical manner. </p>
                    <p>I do not pretend to speak with any authority on the matter, but I have on
                        several occasions reached a spring or well after a long day's march, hours
                        after water bottles had benn exhausted, and no mortal power, short of
                        absolute coercion, would have induced me to wait until the water had been
                        boiled and cooled again, before taking a drink.</p>
                    <p>In modern times, it has become, more than formerly, a recognized fact that
                        private soldiers are human beings just as much as their superior officers,
                        and a wise discipline takes this into consideration; but if on the other
                        habd our scouts are to be fastened to the tail of boiled water cart, why
                        then we had better at once give up the idea of defending ourselves against
                        any very active enemy.</p>
                    <p>Japan is a long way off, and it is pretty well known that our allies did not
                        allow outsiders to know much better evidence than we have yet heard, to
                        cconvince me that we know what sort of water Japanese soldiers did or did
                        not drink in the late campaign.</p>
                    <p>I did know a little about the Aessoun Camp, but I never heard on good
                        authority that Dr. Canney was inmeddical charge of it, or that his sytem is
                        sufficently practical to hold water, the sooner the bottom is knocked out of
                        it , the better.-I remain. etc</p>
