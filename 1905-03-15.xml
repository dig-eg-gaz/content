                    <p>The whole fortnight of carnage, probably un- equalled in the history of
                        modern warfare, and certainly greater than that of Yen-tai and of Liao-yang
                        has resulted in an unquestionable disaster to the Russian arms. We say, ad-
                        visedly, a disaster, becuase whatever propor- tions it may finally take -
                        the battle of Mukden is essentially different from its predecessor.
                        Consternation reigns at St. Petersburg, de- spite the efforts of a terrified
                        Government to prevent full knowledge of the truth, and in friendly Paris,

                        <p>loyal to the Grand Ally, profound sorrow pre- vails. But, alike in the
                            Russian and in the French capitals, public opinion must be even more
                            moved by a very human horror at the terrible slaughter which has been
                            inflicted than at the political consequences of the Russian disaster,
                            grave though these must necessarily be. Our own people, and the whole
                            civilised world, will share the natural abhorrence of humanity at the
                            spectacle of such frightful loss in a struggle which would never have
                            been entered upon but for the overweening arrogance and fatuous blind-
                            ness of the men who have brought it to pass. May we not venture to hope
                            that in this universal horror there may be found a potent influence
                            capable of making for peace. It is, we believe, an undeniable fact that
                            there is a great, though hitherto noiseless, wave of reaction aganist
                            militarism sweeping over the Continent of Europe. After more than thirty
                            years of a truce which has been kept by two nations armed to the teeth,
                            the French and German peoples are heartily sick of the burden of
                            everlasting preparation for war. It is impos- sible to watch the trend
                            of events in France and Germany without perceiving that fact. In France
                            military service is daily grow- ing more and more unpopular, and mili-
                            tary discipline more and more difficult to maintain. In Germany the
                            extraordinary growth of Social Democracy is making for the same results.
                            Italy has reduced her military strength to a point which proves clearly
                            that she has no intention od being drawn into war if she can possibly
                            avoid it. Again, in Austria- Hungary, the language dispute has gone to
                            prove the one-half of the Dual Monarchy does not set military matters,
                            above all other considerations In 'England, too, the suggestion of uni-
                            versal service has - rightly or wrongly - evoked unmistakable signs of
                            popular opposition. As to Russia, we know that the unfortunate
                            reservists can only be compelled by force to join their regiments, and
                            leave for the seat of war. Is it, then, too much to hope that the
                            terrible fate of all the vic- tims of Yentai, of Liao-Yangm of port Ar-
                            thur, of Mukgen, and the other battle- fields, to say nothing of whole
                            ships com- panies sent to the bottom by single mines or torpedoes, may
                            produce a movement in favor of the restoration of peace, backed by a
                            moral momentum which not even Russian autocracy could withstand? The
                            blood of martys is the see of the State as well as of the Church, and
                            the victims of Mukden and the rest, will not have died wholly in vain of
                            their blood cries out for peace with a voice that will take no denial.

                    <p>A terrible tragedy was enacted here yester­day. A certain sarraf
                        (money-changer) visited a deutist iu order to have his set of ialse teeth
                        repaired. He bad with him his purse contain­ing £162, which he intended to
                        deposit in the ALjudirieh Treasury. The dentist's servant took notice, ou
                        being given a piastre by the sarral to purchase tobacco, of the money in the
                        purse aud he made up Ins mind to. obtain pos­session of it at any cost.
                        Accordingly, when his master went to a pharmacy '■qear by to procure some
                        drugs, he closed the door and strangled tbo poor sarraf to death, threw his
                        hoffy in a well iu the house, took the' money to his mother's' house, aud
                        returned to the clinic to resume work, as if nothing had happened.</p>
                    <p>On his return, the dentist noticed that his nervaiit was in a state of
                        confusion, and found traces ot biooCson bis hands and clothes. Ou asking him
                        afotuthe sarraf he could pbtain uo satisfactory aubwer? Two hours later the
                        deutist found the sarrat's shoes on a Window­sill in the room, and this made
                        him suspicious of foul play. The police were informed, an enquiry was set ou
                        foot, aud traces of blood were luund leading from the room of the clinic to
                        the well. A diver was soon brought, aud ou descending the. well he found the
                        poor sarraf's body iu a tetrible condition. The servant was interrogated and
                        his house sekrejb- ed. There, iu his mother's box, were found the shawl of
                        his victim, his registers, notes, books, and set of teeth, together with a
                        portion ot theTnouey. Tne man was arrested aud will shortly be cotnmitted
                        for trial.</p>
                    <p>It is to" be noted that 'this is the fourth "crime" (felony) which has taken
                        place in the town ot Assiout th.s year. > I really think that the police
                        authorities should make a better distribution of ghaffirs and ^policemen in
                        the streets. The crime I have related was com­mitted ,at midday, and iu a

                    <p>For,some time Mtt it has been noticed (hat the fig trees "at Miistdpha Pasha
                        and on (he eatatea-near the Mahuioudieh Canal have been very 'seriously
                        attacked by more than one disease. Mustapha Pasha is within a quarter of
                        &amp; mile^of the important fig groves of Sidi Gaber, and it is^be
                        fearecT*that Unless precau­tionary measures are taken, the disease will
                        quickly spread, and the crop at S^idi Gaber be considerably reduced
                        iniYMue.</p>
                    <p>A well-grown tree at Mustapha, which in the old days bore, fruit to the value
                        .of £3, now only gives a return of P.T. 20. If this can be taken as an
                        example of what may happen at Sidi Gaber the loss will be enormous.</p>
                    <p>Specimens from the infected trees wore sent to the Khedivial Agricultural
                        Society,.and- their entomologist, Mr. Frank C. Willoocljs, has kindly sent '
                        the interesting report which we publish Wow. Unfortunately the remedies
                        which' he suggests are beyond; the intelligence $f the simple Arab

                        which in the end bannut fail to reduce the value of his property.</p>
                    <p>The following is Mr. Willcocks' report :—</p>
                    <p>T^e specimens sent fer examination are very badly infested with a scale
                        insect (a sterols- canium pustttlqns) unfortunately only too oommon in this'
                        country. It feeds on a great variety of plants, but is especially
                        destructive to figAnd oleander. This insect, which is of a greenish yellow
                        colour, fringed and' sparsely covered with piiikish hairs, plunges its long,
                        slender, .suckingmouth iuto the hark and sucks out the sap which would
                        otherwise go to nourish the tree. At the same time it causes a small
                        swelling or pustule to fonn on the bark with a depression in the centre in
                        which it lies. These pustules, when presetit in num­bers,' give the twigs
                        and small branches a very rugose and uuhe&amp;lthy appearance. The female
                        scale, when mature, produces a number of eggs which are protected by her1
                        body*. In due course these eggs give rise to young larval scale insects
                        which make their escape from under the now dead parent scale, and after
                        wanderiug about for a short time^finally settle down to a sedentary life of
                        pumpingup sap and producing another brood of young 'scales. In ;this way the
                        attack spreads to different parts of the tree until it becomes infeeted 'all
                        over. An attacked tree is also capable Of infecting those surrounding it,
                        the larval scales being carried from tree to tree by various natural
                        agencies—birds, insects, etc., so that a whole</p>
                    <p>Plantation gradually becomes infested. Judging rom the number of scales on
                        the specimens sent, the trees mast be badly attacked gad require prompt
                        treatment I have left tbo .question of treatment to the end. The ends of
                        several of the twigs were dead, being honey­combed with small tunnels and
                        perforated iu places with holes no larger than a pin's head. This is ./the
                        work of "bark boring beetles." The female beetle chooses the end of a twig
                        or-small branch of a sickly tree, bores through i be bark, and forms a small
                        tonnel between the inner batk.and the sap Woods. The eggs are placed along
                        the sides of this—the "mother gallery"—and the larva: on hatching out at
                        once commence ta firpi tunnels more or leefe at right angles to jt, feeding
                        on the inner bark and sap woods. The white footless maggots when mature form
                        a small chamhgr at the end of their galleries and pupole, the adults later
                        boring uieir w£y out through the remaining thickness of bark,leaving behind
                        them the small shut holes, to show their point of exit These little insects
                        always prefer a tree that has been rendered unhealthy from some cause or
                        other — in this case the attacks of astervleconium pustulans—and will spread
                        from one tree to all the surrounding sickly ones. The signs of their attack
                        are dead and dying twigsanosmall branches,and the presenceofthesmall
                        shotholee. 1 have yet. to record the finding of the larva of ik boring
                        beetle- tunneling up the centre oi one twig, but in This state it is
                        impossible to say to what beetle it belongs. From the number of injects
                        found, I should say that the trees are in a very bad' state, and reqnire
                        prompt treatment to'get them into a health­ier condition. The primary etiuse
                        is the scale inseot (asteroleeohium jntstulans), but of oourae there may be
                        other causes at worik— bad cnltaral methods, unsuitable, soil, etc., which
                        give the scale a greater hold, on the trees.</p>
                    <p>Treatment for a Pustulans</p>
                    <p>The trees should be sprayed or painted! with kerosene emulsion. For large
                        trees and {Tress a nroper spraying outfit would be ne­cessary, but for small
                        trees and plantations a knapsack spraying machine might be Sised. Similarly,
                        painting can only be carried out on small drees and the trunks and larger
                        branches. If, in a plantation, only a few trees are badly infested the best
                        plan wonld to be ent them dosa^and burn them. Branches and twigs that are
                        badly attacked should be cut out and destroyed, also dead and dying
                        wood.</p>
                    <p>In planting young stock it is most impor­tant that it snoald be free of scale
                        from the start, any that is infested should be remorse lessly rejected. Toe
                        following is the formula and method of preparation for kerosene emul-
                        sioti.</p>
                    <p>Kerosene 2 gallons.</p>
                    <p>Soft or hard soap J 1).</p>
                    <p>Boiling water 1 gallon.</p>
                    <p>Dissolve the soap in the boiling water and</p>
                    <p>whilst still boiling hot, stir in the kerosene, (reduce the fire or take
                        vessel off when doing this), then emulsify by means of a force pump or good
                        powerful hand syringe, until you have a creamy yellow liquid which thickens
                        on oooling. This is the stock solution and if well made will keep for some
                        time. When required forluse, dilute with from four to thirty times its hulk
                        of water, according to what strength the foliage will stand, and that which
                        is found most suitable for destroying the scale. If used as a paint dilate
                        with four times its bulk of water.</p>
                    <p>Bark beetles.—The trees should be carefully examined for signs of these
                        beetles,and infested twigs and branches should be cat off and destroyed.
                        Trees that are found to be badly infested all over had best be destroyed,as
                        thsy wre^pnly a menace to others that are in an unhealthy condition. This
                        should be done in May, n at that time the msjority of the intents will bq

                    <p>The Savoy Hotel fancy-dress hall, which took place last night, was a very
                        distinct suoccss. Close on 600 people were -preant The restaurant and
                        dining-room jrflfa crowded both at dinner and sapper, and dwmrfag lasted
                        till close on 3 o'clock. The mittf m the ooetumee was very great, and though
                        sofcne of those who $Oolr part in the ball qrola the same costumes that had
                        done doty at' Qhentah Palaoe Hotel, stiff-there is a good dial of trath in

                        Mr. Beott-Mon- 1 crieff, who appeared as "Padgett, M.P." His face was
                        artistacoliy reddened; be wore a son . helmet, with veil behind, anii white

                        time, tan over his 1 dothee caused genual horror, till it whs seen to be
                        attached to a piece of string. Another ; very good make-up was Mr. Tmunin's.
                        Attired as a blind beggar, he shambled about the place , in a most piteous
                        way demanding alms, but we tear, with less suooess -than he deserved.</p>
                    <p>1 Mias Walford, who was dressed as a flower- seller, would have sold
                        quantities of r flowers had she pursued .her vocation with . more
                        consistency. The Misses Harley, in \ 'Dutch peasant dress, were greatly
                        admir- . ed, as was Miss Wolff, in a Ahmnmg ' Kate Greenaway costume. A
                        good-deal of ' amusement was created by CoL' Jago, who in | the early part
                        of theejenmg appeared Mweng , the dancers robed rough towel and'oariy- r ing
                        a large bath sponge, and at about 1 o'clock l reappeared, and, rushing from
                        room to room,</p>

                        i Mrs. Lehmann Shreuder appeared as a pair of ) harem ladies and puzzled
