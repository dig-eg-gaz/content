<dateline>London, May 5.</dateline>
    <p>The “Times" learns from St. Petersburg that
the report that Russia has acquired the Chilian
and Argentine navies, continues to be denied,
but it is intimated from a good diplomatic
source that the warships will be brought to the
Baltic and will serve as a nucleus for a new
navy in case Admiral Rodjestvensky should
come to grief.	        (Reuter.)</p></div>

POSTPONED INDEFINITELY.</head>
<dateline>London, May 5</dateline>
    <p>(Official).  The grand naval manoeuvres
arranged for next mouth have been postponed,
as, if carried out then as planned they may
cause inconvenience, but if not carried out at
all the lessons it is desired to inculcate would
not be given.</p>	
	<p>This apparently refers to the world wide
manoeuvres mentioned in the despatches of
10th December and is possibly due to the
desire to have a large fleet in home waters on
the occasion of the visit of the French squadron.

	<p>The Police Case. — There is to be an in-
vestigation at the Alexandria Gouvernorat
into the alleged brutal conduct of a policeman
in Cherif Pasha-street on Thursday last.</p>
	<p>Khedivial Appointment — We are pleased
to learn that the well-known engraver and
printer, Mr. J. Margosches, has lately been
honored with the appointment of engraver to
H. H. the Khedive.</p>
	<p>Mohamed Aly Centenary —The Fête Com-
mittee at Alexandria officially requests us to
inform the public that it is hoped that private
homes will be illuminated on the evening of
the Mohamed Aly Centenary.</p>
    <p>Trams to Abou Roash. — It is stated that

consideration of the scheme submitted by
Boghos Pasha Nubar for the construction of a
tramway between Abou Roash and Mena House.</p>
	<p>The Splendid Hotels of Egypt Co. — A
meeting of the shareholders of the Splendid

etc., of the New Khedivial Hotel at Alex-
andria.</p>

retta company is meeting with great success at

100,000 francs of the Crédit Foncier Egyptien

Joseph, in the service of the well-known Con-
tsantinople banker, M. L Zarifi. The latter
had himself purchased the lottery bond for his
servant.</p>
	<p>Ottoman Official Salaries. — It it stated
that for the first time in living memory every
Turkish official was punctually paid his full
salary on April 1. There is something very
subtle about the selection of this precise date
by a paternal Government. It suggests so
clearly that the recipients are very much
mistaken if they think that it is going to
happen again.</p>
	<p>“La Revue Internationale d'Egypte." — M.
Canivet is to be heartily congratulated on the
first number of his new review, the contents of
which are very good, and include articles by

European races during the pre-historic period.
Another interesting paper to be read at the
meeting will be Yacoub Pasha Artin’s, on
Egyptian Press statistics up to 1904.</p>
	<p>The Coptic Monasteries. — Owing to the
bad state of repair into which the old Coptic
monasteries, known as “El-Abyad” (the White)
and "El-Ahmar" (the Red), at Sohag, have
fallen, steps are to be taken to preserve them.
An examination of these monuments has been
made, and it has been decided to restore them.
The Coptic Patriarch has consented to provide
LE. 1,000 of the total sum required for this
purpose, on condition that the Government
finds the rest.</p>
	<p>Suspension of a Moudir. — Hassan Bey
Wassif, Moudir of Ghirgeh, has been suspend-
ed temporarily from his official functions,
because it is alleged that he was an accomplice
in a serious case of fraud committed by Mo-
hamed Effendi Badaoui, son of Badaoui Bey, a
notable of Sohag. The Moudir has been sum-
moned to Cairo and an enquiry is to be opened
on the subject by the Ministry of the Interior.
Another official is also accused of being an
accomplice in the fraud, namely the judge of
the Mehkemeh Sharieh of Tahta Markaz, and
the judge is to be brought before a council of
discipline of the Ministry of Jostice.</p>
	<p>Cairo Cigarette-maker’s End. — Mr. Joseph
Helpern, who had been brought up in Cairo
and was of Roumanian nationality, and by trade
a cigarette-maker, 30 years of age, entered a
restaurant in Whitechapel-road, Loudon, a few
days ago and called for a cup of tea, which was
supplied. He was seen to drop the contents of
a white paper into the cup, and, after drink-
ing, exclaimed to the waiter, "Don’t use it;
there is poison in it. Take me to the hospital.”
A constable who was called gave Helpern an
emetic, and took him to the London Hospital.
He died on the way there. At the inquest, a
letter, written in German, and addressed to a
Jewish journal, was read. It concluded:— This
voice calls to you, a young venturer, Joseph
Helpern, born in Roumania, brought up in
Cairo, and a cigarette-maker by trade. My
friends and acquaintances; I am warning you
all. Keep away from the cards, and your head
will be clear for work and business, and you
also retain with your money and your health,
and not have the same end as I have.</p>
	<p>Shoubra School.—It has been decided to
hold the examination for the scholarships
offered in connection with this school about
the last week in May, and the successful can-
didates will receive a year’s education free of
charge at the above school. The competition
will be open to all English children, whether
now attending at Shoubra school or not, between
the ages of 9 and 13. The subjects for examina-
tion will be: Scripture (questions on the four
Gospels to be answered in writing); Dictation;
Geography (of Africa); and simple Arithmetic.
In addition the girls will be required to make
a button-hole and sew on a button. With
reference to the above scholarships the term
“English” will be held to include a citizen of
the United Kingdom, Canada, or Australia.
Children whose mothers only are English in this 
sense, will not be eligible unless the father is a
British subject. The full names, and age last
birthday of candidates, should be sent in to
Miss Taylor or Miss Cullen on or before May
15. No scholarship will be awarded unless
there are at least three competitors. In each
case the boy or girl who has the second highest
number of marks will receive a prize.</p></div>

successful as he undoubtedly has been in all
other posts he has filled.”</p>

<div type="item"><head>CAIRO WATERWORKS.
REMOVAL OF SITE.</head>
	<p>The Cairo Water Company has just pur-
chased from the Government a large area of
about 10,000 square metres near the rue Abou
el Ela, in the Boulac quarter, for the installa-
tion of new refrigerating apparatus.</p>
	<p>Several refrigerating chambers are to be let
to the Nile Cold Storage Company.</p>
	<p>The Water Company intend to transfer all
their plant and offices to this spot. The whole
installation and transference of the said plant
and offices from the present site will be com-
pleted by the end of 1907, when the company
will have sufficient engine power and accom-
modation to produce 200 tons of ice per day.
The maximum output in any one day last
year did dot exceed 94 tons.</p></div>

<div type="item"><head>THE PHARMACY REGULATIONS</head>
	<p>The International Association of Pharmacists
held a meeting on Wednesday evening at
Alexandria to read Lord Cromer’s letter on the
subject of the new pharmaceutical regulations.</p>
	<p>The society thoroughly appreciated the
value of these regulations, and were unanimous
in recognising that their enforcement would be
of benefit to all orthodox pharmacists. It was
acknowledged that the Egyptian Government,
represented by the Sanitary Administration,
had, after thoroughly studying the matter,
taken this course in order to protect legitimate
pharmacists, as owing to the difficulties inhe-
rent in the system of the Capitulations, it had
been hitherto impossible to suppress or inspect
so-called pharmacies, where the proprietors or
employés had no knowledge of or qualification
for the compounding and dispensing of drugs.</p>
	<p>In relation to the regulations, the only
regret of the society was that the Sanitary
Administration should not have stringently
put in force the application of the regu-
lations, as in Egypt’s commercial capital
there are a number of so called pharmacists
who have never conformed to the regulations
and thus openly set the Government at de-
fiance. The society demand nothing better
than a stringent and permanent application of
the regulations which are now accepted as law.</p></div>

<div type="item"><head>THE KHEDIVE.</head>
    <p>The Khedive held a largely attended recep-
tion at Ras-el-Tin Palace this morning, on
the occasion of his return to Alexandria.</p>
	<p>His Highness is leaving Alexandria this
afternoon in order to inspect his estates in
the Mariout district.</p>
	<p>Great preparations are being made, says our
Constantinople Correspondent, for the recep-
tion of the Khedive on his approaching visit.
His Highness's Konak on the Bosphorus is to
be renovated throughout.</p></div>

<div type="item"><head>THE MOHAMED ALY CENTENARY</head>

<div type="item"><head>PORTS AND LIGHTHOUSES.</head>
	<p>The following is the text of the decree
appointing. Rear Admiral Sir Massie Blomfield,
K.C.M.G., Director-General of the Ports and
Lighthouses Administration. The appointment,
we believe, is a personal one in recognition
of the Admiral’s services:—</p>
	<p>Le Contre-Admiral Sir Massie Blomfield,
contrôleur général des Ports et Phares, est
nommé Directeur général de la dite Admi-
nistration, à partir du 1er mai 1905.</p></div>

<div type="item"><head>A HORRID SPECTACLE.</head>
	<p>Yesterday’s express to Upper Egypt ran
over three camels, just past the Embabeh
bridge. At this point there is a crossway, but
instead of there being a proper gate, to close
this up when the trains are passing, there is only
a chain, that is pulled across, not a foot from the
ground. The poor beasts, who had got over this,
were run down, and jammed between the line
and the railings of a garden, belonging to some
railway employés. The animals were not quite
dead, hut they could not be moved, as between
the railing and the train there is just enough
space for a man to pass. The train moved
slowly on, with the natural consequence that
the animals were drawn under the wheels, and
the train had to stop, then moved again and
stopped, till at last, they did what they ought
to have done at first, that is, cut down the
wooden railing and draw the animals away. It
would have also been more humane if they
had killed them at once.</p></div>

<div type="item"><head>NOTES FROM PORT SAID.
VISIT OF JAPANESE PRINCE.</head>
<p>(From our Correspondent.)</p>
<dateline>Port Said, Friday.</dateline></div>
	<div type="item"><p>The S.S. “Prinz Heinrich, which arrived
here yesterday, had on board as passenger to
Germany, H.I.H. Prince Arisugawa, the
Mikado’s representative at the forthcoming
wedding of the German Crown Prince. His
Imperial Highness landed here, and Mr.
Tanaka, the Japanese Agent, who has been in
Port Said since December last, had a long
interview with him. Both lunched in one of
the special dining saloons of the Eastern
Exchange, which had been reserved for the
purpose.</p></div>

<div type="item"><head>SHIP ASHORE:</head>
    <p>The S.S. “Kamil Pacha”, which was to have
left last evening for sea, after having weighed
anchor, drifted ashore through some cause or
other, and remained there all night. She was
got off this morning with the aid of tugs, and
proceeded.</p></div>

<div type="item"><head>THE S.S. “CANDLESHOE.”</head>
	<p>The surveys on the hull of the “Candleshoe"
are to be made next week; the entire portion
of the damaged cargo being expected to be
out by that time.</p></div>

<div type="item"><head>THE S.S. “CONGAL”</head>
	<p>The hole in this side of the “Congal” is,
I believe, now blocked up; the building of the
caisson still goes on, and it is rumoured all
will be ready for the pumping out by the last
week of the month.</p></div>

<div type="item"><head>BANDMANN COMPANY.</head>
	<p>Among the visitors now staying in the
Eastern Exchange Hotel are three Members
of the above company, who are leaving for
England by the P. &amp; 0. mail on Monday.
They are Miss Treseden, who will be remem-
bered as one of the dancers, and Messrs.
Tillett and Williams, the latter the musical
conductor.</p></div>

<div type="item"><head>GARDEN PARTY AT NOUZHA.</head>
	<p>A delightful garden party was given by
Mrs. Chataway yesterday afternoon in Nouzha
Gardens. From five to six hundred persons
were present, including all the rank and
fashion of Alexandria and Ramleh. The
gardens form a unique site for a garden
party in the neighbourhood of Alexandria,
and yesterday afternoon they looked their
best. After tea dancing was indulged in on
an excellent floor, which had been laid down
for the occasion. An Egyptian Army band
played a charming selection of music. During
an interval in the dancing Baron René de
Menasce and Mr. Ramsay gave an exhibition
of the Cake Walk. The guests did not disperse
till 7 o’clock, after enjoying a most pleasant
afternoon.</p>
	<p>The host and hostess were indefatigable in
entertaining their numerous guests; Mrs.
Chataway after having greeted, with her usual
courtesy and charming manner, all arrivals,
went round to each table and had a chat
with her friends, looking after them herself.</p>
	<p>The display of handsome gowns was quite a
feature; it is impossible to give a detailed
description. Whilst the grown-ups were enjoy-
ing themselves, over a hundred children were
being entertained. A conjurer and a gramo-
phone gave the little folks intense delight
for a time, after which they were all grouped
round a huge "horse-shoe” table, where tea,
cake, and all sorts of good things were provid-
ed for them.</p>
	<p>We will close our notice by saying that the
Municipality deserves great credit for having
taken over Nouzha. Considering that it is
scarcely two months since the work was taken
in hand, the results already obtained are
simply marvellous. Avenues have been opened
up, fine specimens of trees hidden away have
been brought to light, valueless shrubs have
been removed, etc, thus obtaining vistas
pleasing to the eye.</p>
	<p>We have no doubt that if the tram lines
reach Nouzha, these gardens will resume their
pristine glory, and become a fashionable resort
for Alexandria.</p></div>

<div type="item"><head>THE PIGMIES AT CAIRO.</head>
	<p>The "Globe" remarks:- There are many in-
teresting facts in the papers about the pigmies
who are coming over to this country. “Life in
the forest,” says the "Express,” “is dreary in
the extreme. It is always twilight, the sun
never penetrates through the dense foliage,
and for nine months of the year it pours
with rain.” An English summer will make
the poor fellows feel quite homesick.</p>
	<p>They are not dandies. Their whole personal
belongings, we read, consist of a poisoned
spear or two, an old day cooking-pot, and a
scrap of skin round the waist. They should
create a sensation on church parade.</p></div>

	<div type="item"><p>It has been ruled that in future the em-
ployment of officers as attachés of foreign
armies in the field will not reckon as active
service in the field for the purposes of the
grant of a foreign decoration. The grants of
medals and clasps by the Egyptian and other
Governments and the reckoning of war service
of officers in the employment of those Govern-
ments will be dependent on the express sanc-
tion of the Army Council.</p>
	<p>Captain C. G. Grazebrook, 2nd Battalion
Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, Cairo, has been
ordered home for two years’ duty at the Depot,
Omagh.</p>
	<p>Major J. A. Hope, Depot, King's Royal Rifle
Corps, on promotion, has been posted to the
3rd Battalion in Bermuda, and Captain H.C.
Warre, D.S.O., on return to regimental duty
from staff employment, has been posted to
the same battalion.</p>
	<p>The 2nd Battalion K.R.R.C., at Bareilly,
defeated the 1st Battalion Seaforth High-
landers in the final of the Infantry Polo
Tournament in India lately. The Seaforths,
it may be remembered, had a splendid reputa-
tion when at Cairo last year, and the defeat
of their team came as a bit of a surprise.</p>
	<p>The cruise of the combined Atlantic and
Mediterranean Fleets in the Levant will last
for a month. Much useful practical manoeuvring
based on the "blue-water school” doctrine of
crushing an enemy to our naval supremacy
will be carried out, and ports will be visited
by detached cruisers for the purpose of showing
the flag.</p></div>

	<p>As was anticipated in these notes some time
ago, Brigadier-General G.M. Bullock, C.B., who
has been in temporary command of the British
troops in Egypt since the retirement of Major-
General Slade, has been confirmed in that
appointment, to the great gratification of the
many friends of the hero of Colenso and
Honingspruit.</p>
	<p>In the new infantry drill sanctioned by the
Army Council the ancient custom of rifle regi-
ments presenting arms with unfixed bayonets,
and marching past at the trail, has been resum-
ed. These differences from the Line regiments
were highly prized by the gallant "Green
Jackets” and their revival will be learned with
pleasure by the foreign service battalions of
the Cameronians, Royal Irish Rifles, King's
Royal Rifle Corps, and the Rifle Brigade.</p>
	<p>It is very gratifying to learn that the Cape-
to-Cairo Railway, the life dream of Cecil Rho-
des, is making good progress, having been .
completed almost to Ralomo, which is about
100 miles north of the Victoria Falls. From
the latter point the line will be continued via
Broken Hill to tap that mining country, rich
in copper and zinc. The Falls Bridge will be
open early in June for traffic. In addition to
the important bearing which the line will have
on British commerce, it will be possessed of
immense strategical importance, not the least
of which will be the easy transfer of troops
from Egypt to the Cape and vice-versa. A
French settlement at Fashoda would have been
fatal to that.</p>
	<p>A London contemporary has just caused a
great sensation by announcing that fifteen of
our battleships are unfit to go into action
owing to faulty guns. A lengthy article on
the subject alleges that the 12-inch mark
VIII. guns, which constitute the principal
armament of fifteen out of thirty-seven of our
battleships of the latest type, are incapable of
firing more than fifty full charges under active
service conditions. The most recent type of
the 6-inch gun, which is largely mounted in
the secondary batteries of our battleships and
cruisers, is also condemned. It is farther stated
that the 12-inch guns of the “Majestic"
class of battleship have also foiled to stand
the test of hard service, and still worse, that a
shell burst in seven out of sixteen big guns on
board British-built Japanese battleships. The
article points out that the facts are indisput-
able, and that now is the time to act and have
our fleet equipped with the best type of guns
obtainable.</p></div>
