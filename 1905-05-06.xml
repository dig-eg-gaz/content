                        intimated from a good diplomatic source that the warships will be brought to

                        large fleet in home waters on the occasion of the visit of the French

                        by a paternal Government. It suggests so clearly that the recipients are
                        very much mistaken if they think that it is going to happen again.</p>

                        restore them. The Coptic Patriarch has consented to provide LE. 1,000 of the

                    <p>Suspension of a Moudir. — Hassan Bey Wassif, Moudir of Ghirgeh, has been
                        suspend- ed temporarily from his official functions, because it is alleged
                        that he was an accomplice in a serious case of fraud committed by Mo- hamed
                        Effendi Badaoui, son of Badaoui Bey, a notable of Sohag. The Moudir has been
                        sum- moned to Cairo and an enquiry is to be opened on the subject by the
                        Ministry of the Interior. Another official is also accused of being an
                        accomplice in the fraud, namely the judge of the Mehkemeh Sharieh of Tahta
                        Markaz, and the judge is to be brought before a council of discipline of the
                        Ministry of Jostice.</p>
                    <p>Cairo Cigarette-maker’s End. — Mr. Joseph Helpern, who had been brought up in
                        Cairo and was of Roumanian nationality, and by trade a cigarette-maker, 30
                        years of age, entered a restaurant in Whitechapel-road, Loudon, a few days
                        ago and called for a cup of tea, which was supplied. He was seen to drop the
                        contents of a white paper into the cup, and, after drink- ing, exclaimed to
                        the waiter, "Don’t use it; there is poison in it. Take me to the hospital.”
                        A constable who was called gave Helpern an emetic, and took him to the
                        London Hospital. He died on the way there. At the inquest, a letter, written
                        in German, and addressed to a Jewish journal, was read. It concluded:— This
                        voice calls to you, a young venturer, Joseph Helpern, born in Roumania,
                        brought up in Cairo, and a cigarette-maker by trade. My friends and
                        acquaintances; I am warning you all. Keep away from the cards, and your head
                        will be clear for work and business, and you also retain with your money and
                        your health, and not have the same end as I have.</p>
                    <p>Shoubra School.—It has been decided to hold the examination for the
                        scholarships offered in connection with this school about the last week in
                        May, and the successful can- didates will receive a year’s education free of
                        charge at the above school. The competition will be open to all English
                        children, whether now attending at Shoubra school or not, between the ages
                        of 9 and 13. The subjects for examina- tion will be: Scripture (questions on
                        the four Gospels to be answered in writing); Dictation; Geography (of
                        Africa); and simple Arithmetic. In addition the girls will be required to
                        make a button-hole and sew on a button. With reference to the above
                        scholarships the term “English” will be held to include a citizen of the
                        United Kingdom, Canada, or Australia. Children whose mothers only are
                        English in this sense, will not be eligible unless the father is a British
                        subject. The full names, and age last birthday of candidates, should be sent
                        in to Miss Taylor or Miss Cullen on or before May 15. No scholarship will be
                        awarded unless there are at least three competitors. In each case the boy or
                        girl who has the second highest number of marks will receive a prize.</p>

                        of about 10,000 square metres near the rue Abou el Ela, in the Boulac

                    <head>THE PHARMACY REGULATIONS</head>
                    <p>The International Association of Pharmacists held a meeting on Wednesday
                        evening at Alexandria to read Lord Cromer’s letter on the subject of the new
                        pharmaceutical regulations.</p>
                    <p>The society thoroughly appreciated the value of these regulations, and were
                        unanimous in recognising that their enforcement would be of benefit to all
                        orthodox pharmacists. It was acknowledged that the Egyptian Government,
                        represented by the Sanitary Administration, had, after thoroughly studying
                        the matter, taken this course in order to protect legitimate pharmacists, as
                        owing to the difficulties inhe- rent in the system of the Capitulations, it
                        had been hitherto impossible to suppress or inspect so-called pharmacies,
                        where the proprietors or employés had no knowledge of or qualification for
                        the compounding and dispensing of drugs.</p>
                    <p>In relation to the regulations, the only regret of the society was that the
                        Sanitary Administration should not have stringently put in force the
                        application of the regu- lations, as in Egypt’s commercial capital there are
                        a number of so called pharmacists who have never conformed to the
                        regulations and thus openly set the Government at de- fiance. The society
                        demand nothing better than a stringent and permanent application of the
                        regulations which are now accepted as law.</p>

                    <p>Yesterday’s express to Upper Egypt ran over three camels, just past the
                        Embabeh bridge. At this point there is a crossway, but instead of there
                        being a proper gate, to close this up when the trains are passing, there is
                        only a chain, that is pulled across, not a foot from the ground. The poor
                        beasts, who had got over this, were run down, and jammed between the line
                        and the railings of a garden, belonging to some railway employés. The
                        animals were not quite dead, hut they could not be moved, as between the
                        railing and the train there is just enough space for a man to pass. The
                        train moved slowly on, with the natural consequence that the animals were
                        drawn under the wheels, and the train had to stop, then moved again and
                        stopped, till at last, they did what they ought to have done at first, that
                        is, cut down the wooden railing and draw the animals away. It would have
                        also been more humane if they had killed them at once.</p>

                        Baron René de Menasce and Mr. Ramsay gave an exhibition of the Cake Walk.
                        The guests did not disperse till 7 o’clock, after enjoying a most pleasant
                        afternoon.</p>
                    <p>The host and hostess were indefatigable in entertaining their numerous
                        guests; Mrs. Chataway after having greeted, with her usual courtesy and
                        charming manner, all arrivals, went round to each table and had a chat with
                        her friends, looking after them herself.</p>
                    <p>The display of handsome gowns was quite a feature; it is impossible to give a
                        detailed description. Whilst the grown-ups were enjoy- ing themselves, over
                        a hundred children were being entertained. A conjurer and a gramo- phone
                        gave the little folks intense delight for a time, after which they were all
                        grouped round a huge "horse-shoe” table, where tea, cake, and all sorts of
                        good things were provid- ed for them.</p>
                    <p>We will close our notice by saying that the Municipality deserves great
                        credit for having taken over Nouzha. Considering that it is scarcely two
                        months since the work was taken in hand, the results already obtained are
                        simply marvellous. Avenues have been opened up, fine specimens of trees
                        hidden away have been brought to light, valueless shrubs have been removed,
                        etc, thus obtaining vistas pleasing to the eye.</p>
                    <p>We have no doubt that if the tram lines reach Nouzha, these gardens will
                        resume their pristine glory, and become a fashionable resort for
                        Alexandria.</p>

                    <p>The "Globe" remarks:- There are many in- teresting facts in the papers about
                        the pigmies who are coming over to this country. “Life in the forest,” says
                        the "Express,” “is dreary in the extreme. It is always twilight, the sun
                        never penetrates through the dense foliage, and for nine months of the year
                        it pours with rain.” An English summer will make the poor fellows feel quite
                        homesick.</p>
                    <p>They are not dandies. Their whole personal belongings, we read, consist of a
                        poisoned spear or two, an old day cooking-pot, and a scrap of skin round the
                        waist. They should create a sensation on church parade.</p>

                    <p>It has been ruled that in future the em- ployment of officers as attachés of
                        foreign armies in the field will not reckon as active service in the field
                        for the purposes of the grant of a foreign decoration. The grants of medals
                        and clasps by the Egyptian and other Governments and the reckoning of war
                        service of officers in the employment of those Govern- ments will be
                        dependent on the express sanc- tion of the Army Council.</p>
                    <p>Captain C. G. Grazebrook, 2nd Battalion Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, Cairo,
                        has been ordered home for two years’ duty at the Depot, Omagh.</p>
                    <p>Major J. A. Hope, Depot, King's Royal Rifle Corps, on promotion, has been
                        posted to the 3rd Battalion in Bermuda, and Captain H.C. Warre, D.S.O., on
                        return to regimental duty from staff employment, has been posted to the same
                        battalion.</p>
                    <p>The 2nd Battalion K.R.R.C., at Bareilly, defeated the 1st Battalion Seaforth
                        High- landers in the final of the Infantry Polo Tournament in India lately.
                        The Seaforths, it may be remembered, had a splendid reputa- tion when at
                        Cairo last year, and the defeat of their team came as a bit of a
                        surprise.</p>
                    <p>The cruise of the combined Atlantic and Mediterranean Fleets in the Levant
                        will last for a month. Much useful practical manoeuvring based on the
                        "blue-water school” doctrine of crushing an enemy to our naval supremacy
                        will be carried out, and ports will be visited by detached cruisers for the
                        purpose of showing the flag.</p>

                    <dateline>London, April 27.</dateline>
                    <p>As was anticipated in these notes some time ago, Brigadier-General G.M.
                        Bullock, C.B., who has been in temporary command of the British troops in
                        Egypt since the retirement of Major- General Slade, has been confirmed in
                        that appointment, to the great gratification of the many friends of the hero
                        of Colenso and Honingspruit.</p>
                    <p>In the new infantry drill sanctioned by the Army Council the ancient custom
                        of rifle regi- ments presenting arms with unfixed bayonets, and marching
                        past at the trail, has been resum- ed. These differences from the Line
                        regiments were highly prized by the gallant "Green Jackets” and their
                        revival will be learned with pleasure by the foreign service battalions of
                        the Cameronians, Royal Irish Rifles, King's Royal Rifle Corps, and the Rifle
                        Brigade.</p>
                    <p>It is very gratifying to learn that the Cape- to-Cairo Railway, the life
                        dream of Cecil Rho- des, is making good progress, having been . completed
                        almost to Ralomo, which is about 100 miles north of the Victoria Falls. From
                        the latter point the line will be continued via Broken Hill to tap that
                        mining country, rich in copper and zinc. The Falls Bridge will be open early
                        in June for traffic. In addition to the important bearing which the line
                        will have on British commerce, it will be possessed of immense strategical
                        importance, not the least of which will be the easy transfer of troops from
                        Egypt to the Cape and vice-versa. A French settlement at Fashoda would have
                        been fatal to that.</p>
                    <p>A London contemporary has just caused a great sensation by announcing that
                        fifteen of our battleships are unfit to go into action owing to faulty guns.
                        A lengthy article on the subject alleges that the 12-inch mark VIII. guns,
                        which constitute the principal armament of fifteen out of thirty-seven of
                        our battleships of the latest type, are incapable of firing more than fifty
                        full charges under active service conditions. The most recent type of the
                        6-inch gun, which is largely mounted in the secondary batteries of our
                        battleships and cruisers, is also condemned. It is farther stated that the
                        12-inch guns of the “Majestic" class of battleship have also foiled to stand
                        the test of hard service, and still worse, that a shell burst in seven out
                        of sixteen big guns on board British-built Japanese battleships. The article
                        points out that the facts are indisput- able, and that now is the time to
                        act and have our fleet equipped with the best type of guns obtainable.</p>
