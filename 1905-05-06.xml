                        <p>Mr. Joseph Helpern, who had been brought up in Cairo and was of Roumanian
                            nationality, and by trade a cigarette-maker, 30 years of age, entered a

                            cup of tea, which was supplied. He was seen to drop the contents of a
                            white paper into the cup, and, after drink- ing, exclaimed to the
                            waiter, "Don't use it; there is poison in it. Take me to the hospital."
                            A constable who was called gave Helpern an emetic, and took him to the
                            London Hospital. He died on the way there. At the inquest, a letter,

                        the compounding and dispensing of drugs.</p>
                    <p>In relation to the regulations, the only regret of the society was that the
                        Sanitary Administration should not have stringently put in force the
                        application of the regu- lations, as in Egypt's commercial capital there are
                        a number of so called pharmacists who have never conformed to the
                        regulations and thus openly set the Government at de- fiance. The society
                        demand nothing better than a stringent and permanent application of the
                        regulations which are now accepted as law.</p>

                    <head>A HORRID SPECTACLE.</head>
                    <p>Yesterday's express to Upper Egypt ran over three camels, just past the
                        Embabeh bridge. At this point there is a crossway, but instead of there
                        being a proper gate, to close this up when the trains are passing, there is
                        only a chain, that is pulled across, not a foot from the ground. The poor
                        beasts, who had got over this, were run down, and jammed between the line
                        and the railings of a garden, belonging to some railway employés. The
                        animals were not quite dead, hut they could not be moved, as between the
                        railing and the train there is just enough space for a man to pass. The
                        train moved slowly on, with the natural consequence that the animals were
                        drawn under the wheels, and the train had to stop, then moved again and
                        stopped, till at last, they did what they ought to have done at first, that
                        is, cut down the wooden railing and draw the animals away. It would have
                        also been more humane if they had killed them at once.</p>

                    <head>GARDEN PARTY AT NOUZHA.</head>
                    <p>A delightful garden party was given by Mrs. Chataway yesterday afternoon in
                        Nouzha Gardens. From five to six hundred persons were present, including all
                        the rank and fashion of Alexandria and Ramleh. The gardens form a unique
                        site for a garden party in the neighbourhood of Alexandria, and yesterday
                        afternoon they looked their best. After tea dancing was indulged in on an
                        excellent floor, which had been laid down for the occasion. An Egyptian Army
                        band played a charming selection of music. During an interval in the dancing
                        Baron René de Menasce and Mr. Ramsay gave an exhibition of the Cake Walk.
                        The guests did not disperse till 7 o'clock, after enjoying a most pleasant
                        afternoon.</p>
                    <p>The host and hostess were indefatigable in entertaining their numerous
                        guests; Mrs. Chataway after having greeted, with her usual courtesy and
                        charming manner, all arrivals, went round to each table and had a chat with
                        her friends, looking after them herself.</p>
                    <p>The display of handsome gowns was quite a feature; it is impossible to give a
                        detailed description. Whilst the grown-ups were enjoy- ing themselves, over
                        a hundred children were being entertained. A conjurer and a gramo- phone
                        gave the little folks intense delight for a time, after which they were all
                        grouped round a huge "horse-shoe" table, where tea, cake, and all sorts of
                        good things were provid- ed for them.</p>
                    <p>We will close our notice by saying that the Municipality deserves great
                        credit for having taken over Nouzha. Considering that it is scarcely two
                        months since the work was taken in hand, the results already obtained are
                        simply marvellous. Avenues have been opened up, fine specimens of trees
                        hidden away have been brought to light, valueless shrubs have been removed,
                        etc, thus obtaining vistas pleasing to the eye.</p>
                    <p>We have no doubt that if the tram lines reach Nouzha, these gardens will
                        resume their pristine glory, and become a fashionable resort for
                        Alexandria.</p>

                    <p>The "Globe" remarks:- There are many in- teresting facts in the papers about
                        the pigmies who are coming over to this country. "Life in the forest," says
                        the "Express," "is dreary in the extreme. It is always twilight, the sun
                        never penetrates through the dense foliage, and for nine months of the year
                        it pours with rain." An English summer will make the poor fellows feel quite
                        homesick.</p>
                    <p>They are not dandies. Their whole personal belongings, we read, consist of a
                        poisoned spear or two, an old day cooking-pot, and a scrap of skin round the
                        waist. They should create a sensation on church parade.</p>

                    <p>As was anticipated in these notes some time ago, Brigadier-General G.M.
                        Bullock, C.B., who has been in temporary command of the British troops in
                        Egypt since the retirement of Major- General Slade, has been confirmed in
                        that appointment, to the great gratification of the many friends of the hero
                        of Colenso and Honingspruit.</p>
                    <p>In the new infantry drill sanctioned by the Army Council the ancient custom
                        of rifle Regiments presenting arms with unfixed bayonets, and marching past
                        at the trail, has been resum- ed. These differences from the Line regiments
                        were highly prized by the gallant "Green Jackets" and their revival will be
                        learned with pleasure by the foreign service battalions of the Cameronians,
                        Royal Irish Rifles, King's Royal Rifle Corps, and the Rifle Brigade.</p>
                    <p>It is very gratifying to learn that the Cape- to-Cairo Railway, the life
                        dream of Cecil Rho- des, is making good progress, having been . completed
                        almost to Ralomo, which is about 100 miles north of the Victoria Falls. From
                        the latter point the line will be continued via Broken Hill to tap that
                        mining country, rich in copper and zinc. The Falls Bridge will be open early
                        in June for traffic. In addition to the important bearing which the line
                        will have on British commerce, it will be possessed of immense strategical
                        importance, not the least of which will be the easy transfer of troops from
                        Egypt to the Cape and vice-versa. A French settlement at Fashoda would have
                        been fatal to that.</p>
                    <p>A London contemporary has just caused a great sensation by announcing that
                        fifteen of our battleships are unfit to go into action owing to faulty guns.
                        A lengthy article on the subject alleges that the 12-inch mark VIII. guns,
                        which constitute the principal armament of fifteen out of thirty-seven of
                        our battleships of the latest type, are incapable of firing more than fifty
                        full charges under active service conditions. The most recent type of the
                        6-inch gun, which is largely mounted in the secondary batteries of our
                        battleships and cruisers, is also condemned. It is farther stated that the
                        12-inch guns of the "Majestic" class of battleship have also foiled to stand
                        the test of hard service, and still worse, that a shell burst in seven out
                        of sixteen big guns on board British-built Japanese battleships. The article
