                        <p>The Duke and Duchess of Connaught arrived at Luxor to-day at 10.55 a.m. A
                            number of official personages were on the platform awaiting the arrival
                            of the Royal train. Among them I noticed the British consular agent, Mr.
                            Hazell, Mr. Western, the Moudir of Keneh and the Mondirieh officials, M.
                            Legrain and Mr. Quibell, of the Antiquities Department, and others, with
                            whom the Duke wes pleased to exchange salutations. On leaving the
                            station, the Duke and Duchess of Connaught drove to the temple, over
                            which they were shown by Mr. Quibell and M. Legrain. Their Royal
                            Highnsesses spent about half an hour in inspecting the ruins, in which
                            the Princesses took especial interest. They did not proceed to Karnak,
                            as was intended, owing to the delay caused to the Royal train by the
                            “train de luxe," which stopped for about an hour and a half on its up
                            journey and prevented the Royal train from arriving here at the
                            scheduled time. After visiting the temple, the Royal party went on board
                            the S.S. “Ibis,” which was anchored near the Anglo-American Nile Steamer
                            and Hotel Company's landing-stage^ which Mr. Simpson, the company’s

                            kept in order by the polios, whose arrangements were excellent. The

                            landing-stage, was crowded with visitors, anxious to see our Royal

                        the magnificent ball-room at the height of the ball was animated and pretty,
                        some of the fair dancers being garbed in exquisite "creations,” which it is

                    <p>Judgment was given at the Mixed Coart, Alexandria, this morning in the case
                        brought by Messrs. Boutros Brothers, the well-known Syrian capitalists,
                        against the Khedivial Bourse, the Alexandria Stock brokers Associations, and

                    <head>THE ORIENT BANK.</head>
                    <p>Our Constantinople Correspondent writes respecting the Orient Bank, which is
                        about to establish branches in Egypt. The Orient Bank intends to obtain a
                        great position in the Levant, and in an interview I had recently with a
                        well-known German financier, he said that the Bank expected to' do great
                        things when it came to Egypt. M. L Zarifi, M. E. Bugenides, and M. Eliases
                        have been appointed members of the board oi the Constantinople branch of the
                        Orient Bank. It is said also that M. Neef of the Deutsche Bank, has been
                        appointed manager of the same brauch. M. Neef, who was formerly sectioual
                        chief at the Imperial Ottoman Bank, is very well-known in our city. He
                        accompanied M. Gwinuer, general manager of the Deutsche Bank, when that
                        gentleman came to Constantinople in connection with the unification of the
                        Ottoman Debt.</p>

                    <head>SAVOY HOTEL</head>
                    <p>The concert given by the Committee of Fetes at the Savoy Hotel on Friday
                        night was a great success. M. Nani, who has a very powerful baritone voice
                        which he knows how to use, was loudly applauded for his splendid rendering
                        of the prologue to Pagliacci, and Mme. Bracale gave a fine interpretation of
                        Elisabeth's Aria in Don Carlos. Mascagni's "Hymn to the Sun” was also well
                        given by the orchestra and chorus. Altogether the concert was a thorough
                        success. Saturday evening's dance at the Savoy was attended with the usual
                        success, all the Savoy habitues being there. The Restaurant was full both
                        for dinner and sapper. We noticed Mrs. Muriel Campbell and a party of 6, Mr.
                        Thubron and a party of 7, Mr. Charles Royle entertaining 6 guests, Mrs.
                        Curtis and 5 guests, Mr. and Mrs. Livingston and 2 guests, Mr. and Mrs.
                        Faber, M.P. and a party, Mrs. K. Simon and 6 guests, Fabricius Pasha and
                        Madame Fabricins; Mr. Coats and a large party, Mr. Elliot-Smith and a party,
                        etc. Owing to the ever-increasing success of the Savoy dances, the
                        management have decided to give an extra small dance on Tuesday, 7th proxo.
                        There will also be a bal poudre and costume at the hotel on Shrove
                        Tuesday.</p>

                    <p>The small dance given at the Ghezireh Palace Hotel last Thursday was, as
                        usual, a great success and showed that the season in Cairo was at its
                        height. At dinner-time the splendid restaurant was overcrowded and it was
                        difficult to obtain a table. Dancing began at half-past nine and was very
                        animated. At 12 o’clock the majority of those present part took of sapper,
                        which is quite a Ghesireh speciality. We will not attempt to mention the
                        names of the guests as it would take up too much space, but we may say that
                        the best of Cairo society and the most prominent of the visitors attended
                        the dance. Next Thursday's dance promises to be even more successdul as
                        already a good many dinners have been ordered for that evening.</p>

                    <p>The Empress Eugenie intends paying a visit to Assouan. The Mistress of
                        Donegall, who is among the latest arrivals in Cairo, is a charming and one
                        of the sweetest singers in society. Her son, the present Marquis, is just
                        over a year old, and was born when his father was over eighty years of age.
                        Lady Donegall's marriage in 1902 was a notable function. Lord Stratchcona,
                        her distinguished compatriot, gave the bride away. The Earl and Countess of
                        Lendesborough entertained a distinguished party at dinner at the Savoy
                        Restaurant yesterday evening, the guests including General, Mrs. and Miss
                        Blade, Sir William Garstio, Mr. Marshall, Mr. George Chobnondeley. Mr.

                        passengers on board for Egypt, including Earl and Countess Howe, Sir Edward
                        and Lady Colebrooke, Gen. Sir R. Biddulph, and Sir. Ernest Cassel. The Earl
                        and Countess of Carnarvop are passengers for Ceylon by the same steamer. </p>
                    <p>We regret to state that Countess Howe is still an invalid and had to be
                        carried in an invalid chair from her carriage to the train at Victoria
                        station, London, on Saturday week. Lord Howe and Mr. Churchill, M.P., were
                        at the station to see her off. Earl Howe joined the Countess on Wednesday
                        last at Paris and they both then left for Egypt. Sir Ernest Cassel travelled
                        in the same train en route for Egypt He has reserved his usual magnificent
                        suite at the Savoy.</p>
                    <p>With the arrival of Sir Ernest Cassel and Mr. William Waldorf Astor, the
                        Savoy will house four of the great millionaires of the world, for Mr. Astor
                        is the richest ground landlord in the world, and is reputed to be worth
                        £40,000,000, while the Duke of Devon-shire and Sir Thomas Lipton, who are
                        also at the Savoy, are respectively worth £10,000,000 and £5,000,000. That

                        Cairo, are going as for as Khartoum. Count Bolesta von Kosziedrowski
                        returned to Cairo from Alexandria yesterday. A marriage has been arranged
                        and will shortly take place between Miss Nana Maeredie of Sydney, Australia,
                        and Mr. J. W. Williamson of Cairo.</p>
                    <p>On Saturday afternoon last, Mrs. Carton de Wiart gave a small and very smart
                        “at home” at her charming house et Kasrel-Doubere. The arrangements were
                        perfect in every respect. A dainty tea was served on the large verandah
                        overlooking the garden, where the Blue Hungarians played interesting
                        selection of aire in their best style. Among the number of guests were Mrs.
                        and Miss Rblyle, Lady Willcocks, Mr. and Mrs. Langley, Dr. and Mrs. Nolan,
                        Lady Rogers, Captain and Mrs. Westropp, Izzct Pasha, Mr. and Mrs.

                        after spending about a week at the Savoy Hotel, Cairo. Mr. and Mrs.
                        Watmouth, of New York,have returned to Cairo after a long trip on the Nile
                        in the steam dahabieh "Mena.” Lieut Colonel H. S, McGill. R.AM.C., will be
                        on promotion, probably be posted to Egypt. Colonel G. P. Gorringe, C.M.G.,
                        D.S.O., R.E is shown in this month's “Army list" as still borne on the
                        establishment of the Egyptian Army. This is clearly an error, for we
                        announced some time ago his resignation of his Egyptian appointment, and it
                        is announced from Aldershot that he has joined the Army Corps , there—as it
                        has now become again— as Officer in Charge of Public Lands within the area
                        of the command, vice Major F. V. Jeffreys, who has left the station.</p>
