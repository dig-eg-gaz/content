                <div type="item"><head>Sphrigao</head><p>The ancient Greeks had in their language an admirable verb, originally applied to the young of animales and then 00, by an easy and obvious transition, to the human kind. The word signifies at once to be overfed, to take no exercise and to behave as might be ex¬pected from snob a manner of life; and it would have been employed, instinctively and appropriately, by an Athenian to describe the present condition of the Liberal Party. Swollen into rank luxury by the surfeit of majority, and blundering blindly along, hon- ouroed by the charioteer of reason or of decency, the Government and its adherents are endeavoring to overbeat wantonly any¬thing and everything which is, in the least degree the handiwork of their predtoeskois, regardless even though it be to their own detriment.
                    </p><p>An eminent public servant retired last year from the theatre of his toils and his triumphs, broken in health and worn by anxiety: he returned to his county ungreeted by ovation, and remained for nearly a twelve-month, without pension or gratuity, in an unhonour- ed obscurity. Not he it was, bat the Govern¬ment, whose loyal servant he bad been, that introduced into South Aria that slavery (to accept a comic definition) which served an Opposition with the cheapest and most in- sincere election or ever yet howled from the hosting’s; and it might have been a statesman¬like, as it certainly had been a chivalrous policy for the new Government to disarm and facilitate imperialism by honouring a neglected upholder of Empire. Or-well might have been left alone.
                    </p><p>But an incorrigible optimism would be needed to cherish .any such hopes in a Hooligan" Ministry; and it should have surprised no one that the first Parliamentary notice taken of Lord Milner was notice of affront and of infamy. For one little trip, generously ad¬mitted though in reality unproven, a great man was held up to public censors and a vilification the enormity of which staggered even ite abettors and perpetrators. ' Let ns beware,” cried Mr. Winston Churchill, rising with his theme, as he proved the politics! Nonentity of his victim, "Let ns beware lest by pursuing him* too far, we recreate h.m." “The Ministerial party is strong,” be con- tinues in his unctuous peroration, "and can afford to be generous." And the lofty-soled statesman sinks back amid thunders of applause,_ and his cowardly hedging amendment is carried, and seared for ever across the annals of Westminster.
                   </p><p> For what, in all truth, has it served the nation, or even the party) Om bono, murmur, the astounded onlooker. It is not easy to see. Yet we will make bold to say that this amended motion, misconceived and ill-begotten though it has bean, may yet prove the salvation of the Unionist party; ti natura ntgai, Jacit in dignatio wrtum is true of societal endeavors in politics no less then in the realm of satire, and the indignant digest of colonies and mother-country is already calling with no certain voice for justice and for appre¬ciation of mispriced greatness. For a year Lord Milner has rested^ and when he takes the field—and that must be at no distant date — he will stand forth strong in the confidence that be is supported enthusiastically by all those whose enthusiasm and devotion a states¬man Would desire to command.

               <p> ENGLAND’S RESOLUTE ATTITUDE.</p>
               <p> LONDON, Saturday.</p>
                <p>The “Times” correspondent at Constantino¬ple says that negotiations between the British Embassy and the Porte for the withdrawal ni the Turkish troops from TaVah are still in progress and there is every hope of a satis¬factory oonolusion. The Bri'ish Government is fimlv resolved to maintain the rights of the Khedive bat wishes to give the Turks every opportunity to escape with as little loss of dig- ity as possible from the impasse whioh they have been led into by the aggressive aotlon of their local agents. In well-informed quarters it is not thooght that the Porte is in any danger of misunderstanding England’s attitude or forgetting that there are limits to the patienoe of the Foreign Offioe.
                </p><p>Nothing is yet known in official oiroles in Cairo regarding the question of Akaba beyond the faots already reported by Renter’s Agency from Constantinople. Negotiations are being panned at the Turkish Capital, and it is therefore from London or from S'amboul that the first news of a settlement or a further impaste will reach us.
               </p><p> Ghsci Mukhtar Paoha has interviewed the Khedive on the subject and has doubtless given his Hi?hne"S a f >ll explanation of the Turkish offi ial view of the situation. As far as we can understand it, the Porte’s contention runs thns : "Akaba is oun, Tabsh is part of Akaba- therefore Tabah is onn.” Tabsh lies from 8 to 10 miles S of th9 fort and village rf Akaba. As it oomprises only one hot, a well, and a palm it oan hardly be described as a suburb of Akaba,— but the possibilities of diplomatic language are inexhaustible and we daresay 'hat, SUPZ will some day beolaimed as a part of Tabah.
                </p><p>In the House of Commons last week, Mr. Ruro:m n (Parii - mentary Secretary to the Lroal Government Board), on behalf of the Porfign Secretary, informed Mr. Ashley (U, Blackpool) that Turkish troops were still in ooonpation of Tabah. Negotiations on the subject are still proceeding with the 8nblme Porte, but the Foreign Secretary was at pre¬sent nnable to give any farther information.

                <p>Dr. Clemow, doctor of H.B.M.’s Embassy at C -nstantinople and British delegate on the Ottoman Board of Health, Ahmed lUghib Bey, member of the B >ard of Health, and Dr. Balili, d 'Otor of ihe Greek Legation at Constantinople and delegate for Greeoe on the above Board, have called at Beyrout en route to Constan¬tinople after inspecting the Ottoman hzaretios in *he Red Sea.
                </p><p>I !e»rn that the main objeot of the delegate*’ visit to Beyrout ia the reorganisation of oor lazaretto, or failing a radical ref irm, the im¬provement of f-x sting conditions. The plan of rsd’ca1 reform embodies the ereotion ot upro¬late fir-t olass accommodation, on atriotly bygienio lines, and other constructions, the zbole cost being estimated at about £• 0 f 00.

                </p><p>Dr. Clemow remained seme days behind h:s lolleagues, and sailed from here only on Sator- lay last. Considering the prominence of Brit- sh interests in shipping it was natural tfot re should devote an extra amour t r-f time and mercy on a soheme of this kind. Dr. Clemow ypifies Eng ish steadfastness and thorough' lass of method, and it wpnld Rat be too san- [uine to hope that our lazaretto, which has so ar existed in a primitive condition and been •ondnoted on mnoh the same lines, would be mlsed to a higher standard worthy of its rank rod importance. The rare topography of out asaretto, perched as it is an a h:gh oliff jit- ing into the spa, lends itself with peculiar fit- ipsg to the acoompli'hmeot of the prejeot the le'eTates have in view.
