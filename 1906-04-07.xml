                    <p>The ancient Greeks had in their language an admirable verb, originally
                        applied to the young of animales and then 00, by an easy and obvious
                        transition, to the human kind. The word signifies at once to be overfed, to
                        take no exercise and to behave as might be expected from snob a manner of
                        life; and it would have been employed, instinctively and appropriately, by
                        an Athenian to describe the present condition of the Liberal Party. Swollen
                        into rank luxury by the surfeit of majority, and blundering blindly along,
                        hon- ouroed by the charioteer of reason or of decency, the Government and
                        its adherents are endeavoring to overbeat wantonly anything and everything
                        which is, in the least degree the handiwork of their predtoeskois,
                        regardless even though it be to their own detriment. </p>
                    <p>An eminent public servant retired last year from the theatre of his toils and
                        his triumphs, broken in health and worn by anxiety: he returned to his
                        county ungreeted by ovation, and remained for nearly a twelve-month, without
                        pension or gratuity, in an unhonour- ed obscurity. Not he it was, bat the
                        Government, whose loyal servant he bad been, that introduced into South Aria
                        that slavery (to accept a comic definition) which served an Opposition with
                        the cheapest and most in- sincere election or ever yet howled from the
                        hosting's; and it might have been a statesmanlike, as it certainly had been
                        a chivalrous policy for the new Government to disarm and facilitate
                        imperialism by honouring a neglected upholder of Empire. Or-well might have
                        been left alone. </p>
                    <p>But an incorrigible optimism would be needed to cherish .any such hopes in a
                        Hooligan" Ministry; and it should have surprised no one that the first
                        Parliamentary notice taken of Lord Milner was notice of affront and of
                        infamy. For one little trip, generously admitted though in reality unproven,
                        a great man was held up to public censors and a vilification the enormity of
                        which staggered even ite abettors and perpetrators. ' Let ns beware," cried
                        Mr. Winston Churchill, rising with his theme, as he proved the politics!
                        Nonentity of his victim, "Let ns beware lest by pursuing him* too far, we
                        recreate h.m." "The Ministerial party is strong," be con- tinues in his
                        unctuous peroration, "and can afford to be generous." And the lofty-soled
                        statesman sinks back amid thunders of applause,_ and his cowardly hedging
                        amendment is carried, and seared for ever across the annals of Westminster. </p>
                    <p>For what, in all truth, has it served the nation, or even the party) Om bono,
                        murmur, the astounded onlooker. It is not easy to see. Yet we will make bold
                        to say that this amended motion, misconceived and ill-begotten though it has
                        bean, may yet prove the salvation of the Unionist party; ti natura ntgai,
                        Jacit in dignatio wrtum is true of societal endeavors in politics no less
                        then in the realm of satire, and the indignant digest of colonies and
                        mother-country is already calling with no certain voice for justice and for
                        appreciation of mispriced greatness. For a year Lord Milner has rested^ and
                        when he takes the field—and that must be at no distant date — he will stand
                        forth strong in the confidence that be is supported enthusiastically by all
                        those whose enthusiasm and devotion a statesman Would desire to command.

                        <p>"Al Moayad," referring to the tragedy of the pilgrimage recounted in our

                            under Egyptian law for his crime. 8urely Artiole 8 of the Penal Code
                            answers the question plainly enough. As oor readers are aware the Hagi
                            shot his wife during the march from Mecoa to Medina and asserted that a
                            Bedouin had murdered the woman. The seoority of tho Hedjiz daring this
                            year's pilgrim'ge made the statement most improbable and the maD was
                            tbareforc arrested. </p>

                    <p>LONDON, Saturday.</p>
                    <p>The "Times" correspondent at Constantinople says that negotiations between
                        the British Embassy and the Porte for the withdrawal ni the Turkish troops
                        from TaVah are still in progress and there is every hope of a satisfactory
                        oonolusion. The Bri'ish Government is fimlv resolved to maintain the rights
                        of the Khedive bat wishes to give the Turks every opportunity to escape with
                        as little loss of dig- ity as possible from the impasse which they have been
                        led into by the aggressive aotlon of their local agents. In well-informed
                        quarters it is not thooght that the Porte is in any danger of
                        misunderstanding England's attitude or forgetting that there are limits to
                        the patienoe of the Foreign Offioe. </p>
                    <p>Nothing is yet known in official oiroles in Cairo regarding the question of
                        Akaba beyond the faots already reported by Renter's Agency from
                        Constantinople. Negotiations are being panned at the Turkish Capital, and it
                        is therefore from London or from S'amboul that the first news of a
                        settlement or a further impaste will reach us. </p>
                    <p>Ghsci Mukhtar Paoha has interviewed the Khedive on the subject and has
                        doubtless given his Hi?hne"S a f >ll explanation of the Turkish offi ial
                        view of the situation. As far as we can understand it, the Porte's
                        contention runs thns : "Akaba is oun, Tabsh is part of Akaba- therefore
                        Tabah is onn." Tabsh lies from 8 to 10 miles S of th9 fort and village rf
                        Akaba. As it oomprises only one hot, a well, and a palm it oan hardly be
                        described as a suburb of Akaba,— but the possibilities of diplomatic
                        language are inexhaustible and we daresay 'hat, SUPZ will some day beolaimed
                        as a part of Tabah. </p>
                    <p>In the House of Commons last week, Mr. Ruro:m n (Parii - mentary Secretary to

                        Mr. Ashley (U, Blackpool) that Turkish troops were still in ooonpation of
                        Tabah. Negotiations on the subject are still proceeding with the 8nblme
                        Porte, but the Foreign Secretary was at present unable to give any farther

                        rrigation during the hot months, by severe otations, and to damages by worms

                    <p>The increased value paid for land might be ostified by the very high prioes
