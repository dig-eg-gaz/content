                    <p>The ancient Greeks had in their language an admirable verb, originally
                        applied to the young of animales and then 00, by an easy and obvious
                        transition, to the human kind. The word signifies at once to be overfed, to
                        take no exercise and to behave as might be ex¬pected from snob a manner of
                        life; and it would have been employed, instinctively and appropriately, by
                        an Athenian to describe the present condition of the Liberal Party. Swollen
                        into rank luxury by the surfeit of majority, and blundering blindly along,
                        hon- ouroed by the charioteer of reason or of decency, the Government and
                        its adherents are endeavoring to overbeat wantonly any¬thing and everything
                        which is, in the least degree the handiwork of their predtoeskois,
                        regardless even though it be to their own detriment. </p>
                    <p>An eminent public servant retired last year from the theatre of his toils and
                        his triumphs, broken in health and worn by anxiety: he returned to his
                        county ungreeted by ovation, and remained for nearly a twelve-month, without
                        pension or gratuity, in an unhonour- ed obscurity. Not he it was, bat the
                        Govern¬ment, whose loyal servant he bad been, that introduced into South
                        Aria that slavery (to accept a comic definition) which served an Opposition
                        with the cheapest and most in- sincere election or ever yet howled from the
                        hosting’s; and it might have been a statesman¬like, as it certainly had been
                        a chivalrous policy for the new Government to disarm and facilitate
                        imperialism by honouring a neglected upholder of Empire. Or-well might have
                        been left alone. </p>
                    <p>But an incorrigible optimism would be needed to cherish .any such hopes in a
                        Hooligan" Ministry; and it should have surprised no one that the first
                        Parliamentary notice taken of Lord Milner was notice of affront and of
                        infamy. For one little trip, generously ad¬mitted though in reality
                        unproven, a great man was held up to public censors and a vilification the
                        enormity of which staggered even ite abettors and perpetrators. ' Let ns
                        beware,” cried Mr. Winston Churchill, rising with his theme, as he proved
                        the politics! Nonentity of his victim, "Let ns beware lest by pursuing him*
                        too far, we recreate h.m." “The Ministerial party is strong,” be con- tinues
                        in his unctuous peroration, "and can afford to be generous." And the
                        lofty-soled statesman sinks back amid thunders of applause,_ and his
                        cowardly hedging amendment is carried, and seared for ever across the annals
                        of Westminster. </p>
                    <p>For what, in all truth, has it served the nation, or even the party) Om
                        bono, murmur, the astounded onlooker. It is not easy to see. Yet we will
                        make bold to say that this amended motion, misconceived and ill-begotten
                        though it has bean, may yet prove the salvation of the Unionist party; ti
                        natura ntgai, Jacit in dignatio wrtum is true of societal endeavors in
                        politics no less then in the realm of satire, and the indignant digest of
                        colonies and mother-country is already calling with no certain voice for
                        justice and for appre¬ciation of mispriced greatness. For a year Lord Milner
                        has rested^ and when he takes the field—and that must be at no distant date
                        — he will stand forth strong in the confidence that be is supported
                        enthusiastically by all those whose enthusiasm and devotion a states¬man
                        Would desire to command. </p>

                        Egyptian law for his crime. 8urely Artiole 8 of the Penal Code answers the
                        ques¬tion plainly enough. As oor readers are aware the Hagi shot his wife
                        during the march from Mecoa to Medina and asserted that a Bedouin had
                        murdered the woman. The seoority of tho Hedjiz daring this year’s pilgrim’ge
                        made the statement most improbable and the maD was tbareforc arrested. </p>

                    <p>LONDON, Saturday.</p>
                    <p>The “Times” correspondent at Constantino¬ple says that negotiations between
                        the British Embassy and the Porte for the withdrawal ni the Turkish troops
                        from TaVah are still in progress and there is every hope of a satis¬factory
                        oonolusion. The Bri'ish Government is fimlv resolved to maintain the rights
                        of the Khedive bat wishes to give the Turks every opportunity to escape with
                        as little loss of dig- ity as possible from the impasse which they have been
                        led into by the aggressive aotlon of their local agents. In well-informed
                        quarters it is not thooght that the Porte is in any danger of
                        misunderstanding England’s attitude or forgetting that there are limits to
                        the patienoe of the Foreign Offioe. </p>
                    <p>Nothing is yet known in official oiroles in Cairo regarding the question of
                        Akaba beyond the faots already reported by Renter’s Agency from
                        Constantinople. Negotiations are being panned at the Turkish Capital, and it
                        is therefore from London or from S'amboul that the first news of a
                        settlement or a further impaste will reach us. </p>
                    <p>Ghsci Mukhtar Paoha has interviewed the Khedive on the subject and has
                        doubtless given his Hi?hne"S a f >ll explanation of the Turkish offi ial
                        view of the situation. As far as we can understand it, the Porte’s
                        contention runs thns : "Akaba is oun, Tabsh is part of Akaba- therefore
                        Tabah is onn.” Tabsh lies from 8 to 10 miles S of th9 fort and village rf
                        Akaba. As it oomprises only one hot, a well, and a palm it oan hardly be
                        described as a suburb of Akaba,— but the possibilities of diplomatic
                        language are inexhaustible and we daresay 'hat, SUPZ will some day beolaimed
                        as a part of Tabah. </p>

                        Mr. Ashley (U, Blackpool) that Turkish troops were still in ooonpation of
                        Tabah. Negotiations on the subject are still proceeding with the 8nblme
                        Porte, but the Foreign Secretary was at pre¬sent unable to give any farther

                        •ondnoted on mnoh the same lines, would be mlsed to a higher standard worthy

                        rrigation during the hot months, by severe otations, and to damages by worms

                    <p>The increased value paid for land might be ostified by the very high prioes
