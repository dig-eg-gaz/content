                        <p>We beg to tender in the name of all Anglo- Egyptians our hearty
                            congratulations to the Khedive of Egypt on the anniversary of his
                            accession. On an occasion like the present it is both customary and
                            opportune to paas in review the chief events of the sovereign's reign.
                            But such a survey would be inadequate without endeavouring to estimate
                            the bearing of such events upon the preeont situation and their probable
                            iufluence on the future. The most important of these events from this
                            point of view, as standing out prominently from among the rest, and as
                            calculated to make his Highness's reign famous even in the lengthy roll
                            of Egypt’s history, are the extension of her dominions by the
                            restoration of her lost provinces in the Sudan and the building of the
                            Assouan Dam. The former has assured to this country durable peace upon
                            her borders and has manifested to the world at large the bravery and
                            capacity of her soldiers when pitted against a most valiant foe. But
                            that brilliant feat of arms has been rivalled, if not surpassed, by the
                            greatest of engineering triumph, which the modern world has witnessed,
                            and which must necessaarily be chief amongst the factors contributing to
                            her future prosperity. These events, even if unaccompanied by many
                            useful ameliorations in almost every department of the Administra- tion,
                            would be sufficient to lend lustre end distinction to his Highness's
                            reign. At a moment like the present, one naturally asks oneself what are
                            the main features of the era inaugurated by the association of the
                            Khedive, and the conclusion suggested is that coming ages will note this
                            epoch as a period of peace- ful progress and prolonged prosperity.</p>
                        <p>Called suddenly to the throne at the age of eighteen, the Khedive was
                            brought face to face with a most difficult situation. But despite his
                            youth and consequent inexperience and the absence of far-seeing
                            eadvirers, his High- ness has risen superior to all the intrigues to
                            which many a ruler of maturer years, though less richly endowed with the
                            qualities of firm- ness, courage, and discrimination, might vary well
                            have succumbed. It is manifest to those, who have closely watched his
                            Highness's career that the dangers by which he was formerly surrounded
                            are now entirely removed, and recent years have shown that the future
                            which awaits him has all the elements of permanent well-being and
                            advancement. Coming to the incidents of the past year, the Anglo- French
                            Agreement signed by the Great Powers of Europe is, impartially
                            considered, an event of paramount significance in that it has rendered
                            signal service in liberating Egypt’s finances from their former shackles
                            and will impart to her institutions a stability which was previously
                            lacking. We must not leave out of account what, in these days, is one of
                            the essentials of statecraft and diplomacy, namely, that the Ruler shall
                            prove himself a social success. The cordial reception given to his
                            Highness by the King, his Ministers, and the cream of our aristocracy,
                            which organised receptions to do him honor, as well as the special marks
                            of favor shown to him by the Sultan on his recent visit to Con-
                            stantinople, afford the most cogent testimony that the Khedive has not
                            failed in this im- portant respect, but is, on the contrary, as wel-
                            come a guest in the West as in the East. Furthermore, if proof were
                            needed of his cordial goodwill towards England, and of his graceful
                            recognition of the services we have rendered to his oountry, bis
                            presences at the Birthday Review is an effective assurance. His urbanity
                            and personal charm have undoubted- ly won for him many sincere frieuds
                            and Ad- mirers in England, where, owing to his frequent visits of late
                            years, he bids fair to be as well known a figure in London society as
                            Edward VII. in Paris, whilst his popularity in Egypt itself is, with
                            every class, ever on the upward grade. If we have accurately gauged the
                            situation and rightly cast the horosoope of coming events, there lies
                            before his Highness Abbas II. a future of such promise as may well be
                            envied by many an ambitious potentate on the European continent, a
                            future, indeed, which should amply satisfy the aspirations of one so
                            practical in his aims and so reasonable in his desires.</p>

                        <p>The establishment of branches of the great European banks in Egypt is
                            viewed with mixed feelings by many financiers here. It is quite possible
                            for a country to have too much loan- able capital, and the recent fall
                            in the price of our staple produce has already set free a con- siderable
                            portion of the temporary capital that is invariably brought to Egypt at
                            this time of the year. A seasonable word of warning is not out of place
                            to those gentlemen who are respon sible for advising their banking
                            houses to come to Egypt, lest by endeavouring to attract custom by
                            lending money too freely, they should add a most unneccesary sti- mulus
                            to this country's overweenig propen sity to speculation. These
                            considerations are not put forward with tho slightest intention of
                            discouraging the introduction of new capital into Egypt, where it is
                            intended to employ it with prudence and foreaght in the develop ment of
                            the commercial and financial interests of Egypt.</p>

                <p>Port Arthur, January 6.</p>
                <p>Generals Nogi and Stoessel had a two hours conference yesterday. It is proposed
                    to distri- bute the sick and wounded among the hospitals in the Chinese
                    ports.</p>
                <p>The Russian battleships here have not yet been officially inspected, but it is
                    believed that in the haste with which they were blown up they were only damaged
                    in the upper parts. It is hoped they may be repaired.</p>

                    the city to preserve order. Japanese sailors are removing the mines and the
                    Japanese hulks at the entrance of the harbour.</p>

                        first musical training at the hands of her father, and was for a time
                        soloist in a fashionable church in New York. Going to England in 1888, she
                        soon made a great repu- tation in that country, achieving great success at
                        the Crystal Palace Handel festivals, Mon- day Popular and other Ballad
                        concerts. She made a festival tour through Australia and New Zealand, and a

                        she remained till her death.</p>

                        the public at the mass meeting this evening, the general opinion will be

                        the inhabitants of Ramleh we acknowledge to be the only prudent course in
                        face of the outburst of po- pular discontent which has greeted the impo-
                        sition of the tarif on New Year’s Day. The discontent thereby aroused will
                        thus be as- suaged, and the storm and stress of the past week will be
                        followed by a feeling of relief at the crisis having been brought to an end,
                        by the way in which the capitalists who guide the destinies of the company
                        have bent before the blast of popular fury and indignation which the

                        population of Ramleh.</p>
                    <p>The Ramlehites are to be heartily congra- tulated on having secured such a
                        signal victory on this important point. The magnates, who form the board,
                        have fully recognised the justice of the outcry which they have raised ; and
                        hare been obliged to confass that the heavy exactions, which the recently

                        gratitude of the public, for owing to their having adopted a forward policy

                        lehites, we may state that these two bodies are quite distinct from one
                        another. The delegates of the Ramlehites are the party of the Extreme Left,
                        who, in view of the exigences of the situ- ation, embarked on a “forward"
                        policy. It is they who summoned the public meeting, issued the manifestoes
                        and indulged in the manifesta- tions which took place at the beginning of
                        the week. It is they who awoke the Ramlehites to a sense of the impending
                        danger and, by their activity and organisation and insistence tarif, have
                        made themselves the champions of the popular cause.</p>

                    <head>LA SEMAINE FINANCIERE.</head>
                    <p>Le march de cette semaine a presente une grande animation, en depit des
                        fetes. La plu- part des veleurs de soot raffermies et certaines d’entre
                        elles accusent une hausse sensible. La mauvais humour qui avait jusque-la
                        regne sur le marche a completement disparu pour faire place a l'entrain. Ce
                        resultat est du a ce que le marche des valeurs est presque indepen- dent de
                        celui des contrats. La plupart des fortes positions en titres, detenues par
                        le* speculateurs en cotons ayant ete liquidees pour faire face aux pertes de
                        ces der- niers temps, il n’y a plus, pour le mo- ment du moins, a craindre
                        ces ventes forcees qui ont exerce une si funeste influence sur le marchs des
                        valeurs. De plus, bon nombre de courtiers abandonnent peu a peu la corbeille
                        des contrasts, ou le calme domine maintenant, pour passer dans la corbeille
                        des valeurs ou les operations sont devenues plus lucratives. On espere que
                        cette fois les prix ne seront pas poysses a des niveaux trop dangereux,
                        comme cels s’est produit il y a quelques semaines.</p>
                    <p>Les marches europeans paraissent fort peu affectes des derniers nouvelles de
                        la guerre: au contraire, le ton y est plus ferme. L'escompte qui etait tombe
                        jusqu'a 2 3/8, (e* qui montre que le numeraire abonde), remonte aujour-
                        d'hui a 2 1/2. Le consolide, qui avait attaint 88 7/8, reactionne a 88 3/8.
                        Les valeurs egyptiennes sont en faveur a Londres, tres probablement par
                        suite de forts ordres d'achats provenant d'Egypte.</p>

                        decided on Tuesday next by the Cairo Mixed Court, when judgment in the case

                        d’in- struction (examining magistrate). In many parts of Europe newspapers
                        have only the right of indicating the results of the ma- gisterial
                        examination, and are prohibited from detailing the considerations that led
                        up to it. The Ministers Public in the case in question has pronounced in
                        favor of the exercise of such a right by the Press.</p>

                        Signor Tomisani appeared, and was, if possible, even better than in Mignon.
                        He has an exception- ally good voice, and should certainly be heard of again
                        in Europe. Signa. Malaspina sang very well on the whole, though a trifle
                        shrill and too loud at times. The orchestra were also at times guilty of the
                        same fault, but they amply compensated for that by their admirable rendering

                        <p>Quite a large number of visitors and re sidents had gathered at Mena
                            House for the Gymkhana yesterday, and though the weather was neither
                            very warm nor very sunny, it was infinitely better than at the last
                            Gymkhana, which was spoiled by the wet. The arrangements made were as
                            good as ever and the prizes greatly admired. Two races, the 7th and the
                            9th, were not run through lack of entries, but in all the rest there
                            were plenty, especially in the 5th(Umbrella and Cigarette Race on
                            Donkeys) where many unsuccessful aspirants for lady partners had to be
                            literally driven from the course. The following are the results of the
                            various events:-</p>
                        <p>Donkey Race for Gentlemen. — A fairly good race ended in a victory for
                            Mr. Cotton Fox. Osman Bey Rodwan was second.</p>
                        <p>Hack Race (Ponies and Galloways).—Won by Mr. Michaelides by over a length
                            from Mr. Cotton Fox. The rest were nowhere.</p>
                        <p>Egg and Spoon Race for Ladies on Don- keys-—This event caused great
                            amusement and several eggs came to grief. Mrs Bailey won, Mrs. Campbell
                            being a good second.</p>
                        <p>Hack Race (Horses).—After a good race Mr. Michaelides beat Kamel
                            Effendi.</p>
                        <p>Cigarette and Umbrella Race on Don- keys—The course was crowded with com
                            petitors. Mr. Moore and Miss Briscoe were the winners, Mme. and Saleh
                            Bey Cherif being good seconds.</p>
                        <p>Mena Cup.—In this event, Mr. Lockett checked Mr. Michaelides' list of
                            successes and won narrowly, Mr. Michaelides being second and Mr. Millar
