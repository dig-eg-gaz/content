                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed
                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.
                        Najem Houry proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the
                        sea. Magnificent Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For

                        Army Contractor, Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia
                        (on Railway) to Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin
                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the
                        world. Also the tower or palace, the scene of "Othello'' and of Ford's
                        "Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus in the winter months is
                        delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                    <head>IS THE CLIMATE OF EGYPT CHANGING?</head>
                    <p>THis is a question that one often hears at the present time. It is sometimes
                        said that rain was formerly unknown in Egypt, whilst now it is a yearly
                        occurence. Various theories are advanced to account for this alleged change,
                        the most popular of which are the opening out of the Suez Canal and the
                        great extension of works of irrigation during the last twenty years. In his
                        recent work, "The Physiography of the Nile and its Basin," Capt.
                            <persName>H. G. Lyons</persName>, F.R.G.S., Director General of the
                        Survey Department, speaking of the Nile Valley from Assouan to Cairo, says,
                        "A few rainstorms occur every winter, but they are usually very local in
                        their effect. On the eastern side the much larger area and the steeper
                        slopes, together with the greater frequency of rain near the Red Sea hills,
                        make the winter rainfall a more important factor. In about every second year
                        one or other of the large wadis comes down in flood, somemtimes so suddenly
                        as to carry away camels and sheep which may be grazing in the valleys, and
                        pours a large volume of water into the Nile. These seils (or rain floods)
                        are less rare than is usually supposed, and the dry, arid appearance of the
                        desert, together with the rareness of rain, cause the effect of such storms
                        as do occur to be understimated." A reference to the Memoirs of the learned
                        staff brought to Egypt by Napoleon at the end of the eighteenth century
                        shows that as the climate was then so it is now. "But at least," says the
                        tourist, "no rain falls in Upper Egypt." It is pardonable therefore on
                        looking out from the hotel verandah at Assouan and seeing the clouds pouring
                        forth their supply that the visitor should think that the season of his
                        visit is an exceptional year. With regad to the recent cold weather,
                        although perhaps more severe than usual, visitors always seem surprised on
                        arriving in Egypt to find that their preconceived ideas as to the climate
                        were wrong. Occasionally it is so cold at to make people regret leaving
                        their warm winter clothing at home, and the wearing of furs, however absurd
                        it may sound to people previous to leaving England for Egypt is quite common
                        during the winter months. As a matter of fact, unless people are warmly clad
                        during the evening after sunset in Egypt at the present time they are very
                        liable to many of the ills incidental to exposure to cold. In this respect
                        it is often cruel to see the foolish fashion which prevails of dressing
                        children in short socks, thus exposing the lower limbs and consequently
                        reducing their resisting powers. Although Egypt has one of the best Winter
                        climates in the world yet there are timesalbeit few and far between- when
                        one requires to be even as careful as in countries further North. </p>

                    <head>POSTAGE OF LOTTERY TICKETS.</head>
                    <dateline>LONDON, Saturday.</dateline>
                    <p>Complaints are again appearing in the London Press in reference to the way
                        the services of the Egyptian Post Office are being abused owing to the
                        introduction of penny postage between Egypt and England in order to flood
                        the country with lottery circulars emanating from a Hungarian lottery
                        syndicate, which are depatched in vast quantities from Alexandria. </p>
                    <p>Complaints, to which the above telegram alludes, appeared first some months
                        ago, and a question was asked in the House of Commons on the subject. The
                        Egyptian postal authorities are, however, quite powerless to move in the
                        matter, and there is no way of checking the despatch of lottery tickets from
                        Alexandria to England. As soon as the penny post was introduced between this
                        country and England the promoters of European lotteries took advantage of
                        it, for by this means they can send their circulars to England in a sealed
                        or closed letter for the same price as they can despatch them from their own
                        countries in open envelopes. As the latter are liable to be confiscated by
                        the postal authorities on their arrival in England, while closed letters
                        cannot be tampered with, the advantages of Egypt for their business are
                        obvious. Shortly after the lowering of the postal rates an enormous traffic
                        developed, and just after penny postage had been introduced no less than
                        200,000 lottery circulars were sent through the Alexandria Post Office to
                        England in a single day. It is not known whether these lottery circulars are
                        printed here or imported in bulk from Europe. It is very lucrative for the
                        Egyptian Post Office and there is every likelihood that this source of
                        revenue will continue, for it is difficult to devise any means of preventing
                        the despatch of closed envelopes to England. </p>

                    <head>SUEZ CANAL CHARGES.</head>
                    <p>AUSTRALIAN PREMIER"S LETTER.</p>
                    <p>In Thursday's issue we gave a summary of the discussion between the Foreign
                        Office and the Federal Prime Minister of Australia on the subject of the
                        Suez Canal charges. Australian traders are much incensed with the Foreign
                        Office by reason of the attitude the department has taken up with regard to
                        the question of a reduction in the Suez Canal charges on Australian trade.
                        The correspondence between <persName>Mr. Deskin</persName> and
                            <persName>Lord Elgin</persName> on the subject has recently been
                        published in Australia. In making his demand, the Australian Prime Minister
                        said:- "Seeing that the canal dues enable shareholders to receive a dividend
                        of 28 per cent.. the time has arrived for their reconsideration and perhaps
                        for a substantial reduction."</p>
                    <p>The reply of <persName>Lord Elgin</persName> encloses a long examination of
                            <persName>Mr. Deskin</persName>'s demand by the three British directors
                        of the Canal Company, and intimates that their statement is approved by the
                        Treasury and the Board of Trade. The Colonial Secretary adds that the two
                        Departments named "do not think that anything would be gained by an attempt
                        to pursue that object (reduced charges for vessels coming to or from
                        Australia) without due regard to the interest of those who have a purely
                        financial concern in the affairs of the Suez Canal."</p>
                    <p>The point made by the canal directors can be given in very few words:-</p>
                    <p>"We submit that any further reductions of the tariff would practically amount
                        to a subsidy to ships using the canal at the cost, to a great extent, of
                        pecuniary loss to His Majesty's Government."</p>
                    <p>The directors deny that the dividend of 28 per cent. on the 500 francs share
                        is exorbitant, for "owing to the large increase in the market value of the
                        shares, the return to the purchasers for some years past has ranged between
                        3 and 4 per cent." Elsewhere in the letter they say:- "That the inter Empire
                        trade would be beneficially affected [by the proposed reductions] is no
                        doubt a very valid reason for both the home and colonial Governments to
                        press for further reductions; but these would obviously have a precisely
                        opposite effect upon the foreign rivals of our maritime commerce through the
                        casual, and it would be futile to urge this argument upon our Continental
                        colleagues."</p>

                    <head>MINING IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>A circular issued by the Egyptian Options, Limited, states that in October,
                        1905, the company obtained a concession from the Egyptian Government of two
                        areas containing approximately 10,000 square miles, and known as the Eigat
                        and Jebel Eiba Concessions, which they hold jointly with the London
                        Johannesburg and Cairo Trustees Limited. The directors have received a
                        report made by Mr. <persName>Francis Merton</persName>, the manager of the
                        prospecting party, which is now circulated. The news of the discovery was
                        made by <persName>Mr. Merton</persName> and his party was conveyed to the
                        shareholders on the 6th, April, 1906. Since the date the work of development
                        has been actively prospected, with the result that no less than seventy-five
                        different places have been discovered along the strike of the reefs
                        disclosing ancient working, and exposing reefs showing visible gold. Twelve
                        of these old workings have been cleared cut with most satisfacory results
                        and in the opinion of the miners who have been sent to the property from the
                        Great Boulder Mine in Western Australia, it is the biggest surface show they
                        have ever seen, and there is enough stone in sight to at once start a 100
                        head mill. The directors have put themselves in communication with an
                        importnat group with a view to the formation of a company with a sufficient
                        working captial to successfully work the property.</p>

                        president of the Anti-Tuberculosis League, had convoked a number of ladies
                        with the object of forming from among them a committee for the purpose of
                        organising some form of entertainment whereby the funds of the league would
                        be benefited. Schiess Pasha's invitation was largely responded to and the
                        council chamber presented an unusual, but at the same time charming
                        appearance, with the members of the fair sex seated round the City Fathers'
                        large table. Among those present were Baroness Jazques de Menasce, Mesdames
                        Chataway, Aicard, Vallasopoulos, Joannides, Beneducci, Norra, Mettioli,
                        Rubino, Nahman, Tilche, Luzzette, Alderson, etc.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Schiess Bey opened the proceedings with an appropriate speech in which he
                        said that he felt sure he had only to make an appeal in behalf of the
                        deserving instituion in questsion for it to have an immediate and hearty
                        reponse from the ladies who had gathered there that afternoon. He spoke of
                        the excellent work which the league had done, but said that there was a need
                        for the extension of its usefulness. They could help by forming a committee
                        among them whose object would be to devise some means of increasing the
                        league's revenue. A ballot was then held, with the result that the following
                        ladies were selected to sit on the committee; Mesdanes Isaac de Joseph
                        Aghion, Charles Bacos, J. Bouan, Lady Blomfield, Countess Caprara, P.
                        Chataway, P. Girard, E.B. Gould, Joannides, Kingham, Emin Karam, H.
                        Lindemann, Lugzatto, G. Mettioli, Baroness Jacques Fel x de Menasce, A.
                        Morrison, F. Planta, Michel Salvago, Constantin Sinadino, Christian
                        Sinadino, Jacques Suares, Joseph Suares, Alexander Sursock, A. Torells, C.
                        Wunderlich, Emmanue Zervudachi, Countess Alex de Zogheb.</p>
                    <p>After the business of the meeting, the ladies were entertained at tes, which
                        was laid out very tastefully on side tables.</p>
                    <p>Liberal contributions to the funds of the league were made at the meeting,
                        the following ladies contibuting the sums mentioned against the names; Mme.

                    <p>Before closing our report of the proceedings we must pay a tribute to the
                        seal and energy displayed in the cause of this charity by Schiess Pasha, the
                        president, and Norsa Bey, the secretary, who have been untiring in their
                        efforts to make it a success.</p>
                    <p>The first meeting of the newly-formed general committee will take place on
                        the 28th inst. in order to elect a president and an executive committee.

                    <head>IMPORT OF ANTIQUITIES.</head>
                    <p>To import antiquities to Egypt is as much a work of supererogation as to
                        carry coals to Newcastle. A highly enterprising Greek, however, has just
                        embarked on this new line of business, but his career has been promptly
                        checked by the Hellenic consular authorities at Alexandria. This person,
                        whose name is <persName>A. Pissarakis</persName>, a short time ago brought a
                        valuable marble statue of the best epoch of Greek art to Alexandria, which
                        he had stolen from Greece. Here he offered it to some well known Greek
                        residents, but they all refused to buy it as they were suspicious as to how
                        it came into the possession of the vendor. Then he offered it to the Greek
                        proprietor of a second class restaurant here and they went into partnership
                        and succeeded in disposing of it to a wealthy native here for L.E. 1200. The
                        purchaser went to Cairo with his statue and tried to resell it at a
                        considerable profit to a European connoisseur. This gentleman was astonished
                        to see such a magnificent specimen of statuary in the hands of a native and
                        informed the police, who impounded the statue. The consular authorities at
                        Alexandria were apprised and they at once wired to the Piraeus, whither
                        Pissarakis had gone after securing his share of purchase money and the
                        police there secured him and he is now awaiting trial. Meanwhile the
                        masterpiece is now at the Hellenic Consulate at Cairo. </p>

                    <head>THIRD WINTER MEETING.</head>
                    <p>Never this season have we had a larger or better meeting than that at
                        yesterday's races at <placeName>Ghezireh</placeName>, and as the sun's
                        warmth was most genial most of the ladies had graced the occasion with their
                        prettiest of frocks. Indeed, some of these were a most fragile and summery
                        description, and those who still clung to thicker garments had chosen those
                        of dainty colourings. The racing, too, was of more than ordinary interest,
                        and both the Steerlechare and the Challenge Cup Race excited great
                        enthusiasm and were well worth the watching. It was good, too, to watch the
                        English horses in the Velocity Cup Race excited great enthusiasm and were
                        well worth the watching. It was good, too, to watch the English horses in
                        the Velocity Cup Race, and to note their action, so different to that of the
                        Arabs. VIcomte G. Fontaroe's Caprice came a nasty cropper with Galley during
                        the third race; and though that plucky little jockey did his level est with
                        Lady Meldrum in the Velocity Race, Caprice had to be scratched for the
                        Consolation Race. There was a great deal of interest in the Consolation
                        race, which was a long one giving plenty of scope to both horses and their
                        jockeys. Ghazi and Timsah, both from Ibrahim Bey Cherif's stables, made the
                        pace tremendously at starting; but Jupiter forged well ahead half-way,
                        Doughan, ridden excellently by Jenkins, catching him up later on. Other two,
                        Jupiter and Doughan, made a most excellent finish to the final advantage of
                        the former. Mr. A. Schreiber's luck was with him all the afternoon, for not
                        only did the Rabah come in first the steplechase, but he also won the
                        Challenge Cup; Mulberry, also belonging to Mr. Schreiber, making a good
                        second in the Intter race. The handicapper (who is of course a much abused
                        person, like the wretched referee at football) brought his horses together
                        very successfully. The Pari Mutuel did a great trade, about £3,000 changing
                        hands. The two extrememly handsome Cups presented by Mr. D.K. Reid, for the
                        Club Challenge CUp, and by Mr. Hogg for English horses were exhibited and
                        very much admired.</p>

                    <dateline>Luxor, Wednesday.</dateline>
                    <p>The up-river season is at its full height, and the accommodation of the
                        hotels at Luxor is being taxed to its utmost to cope with the demands for
                        rooms. Many well-known faces are to be seen just now. Lord Cromer arrived
                        here last week in his boat with Lady Cromer and their little son also on
                        board. They spent a few days at Luxor then, and stopped again on their
                        return journey, and they were to be seen on more than one occassion in the
                        Winter Palace Hotel, while the little boy was an interested spectator at the
                        Gymkhana on Thursday. Sir. William Garstin and Captain and Lady Valda
                        Machell have also been seen about during the last few days.</p>
                    <p>Amongst distinguished visitors staying at the Winter Palace this week are the
                        Earl and Countess of Carnarvon, Susan Countess of Malmesbury, Sir Vincent
                        Corbett, Mustapha Pasha Kamel, Sir John Ardagh, the Comte and Comesse de
                        Pourtales and party, Judge Hatton, and Mr. Tabot Kelly and family. </p>
                    <p>The weekly dances at this hotel are being kept up with much spirit and next
                        Tuesday, the 26th, there is to be a "bal poudre." in place of the usual
                        fancy dress dance. THe tickets are 25 P.T. for gentlemen and 15 P.T. for
                        ladies, and the proceeds are to go to the Luxor Hospital for Natives. </p>
                    <p>Dr. Theodore Acland, who is staying at the Luxor Hotel, is well known to fame
                        in Egypt, having been sent out by the British Government in 1883 to deal
                        with the cholera epidemic. He was then selected for special service in the
                        Egyptian Army, and became P.M.O. He is now taking a holiday in the country,
                        and must find much that is new to insert him since last he visited it. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Talbot Kelly, who is now at the winter Palace, has been painting at
                        Assouan, and is also working here for a short time before returning to Cairo
                        for the rest of the season.</p>
                    <p>The gymkhana on Thursday attracted an unusually large number of spectators.
                        Besides the usual races for natives, the visitors' events comprised a donkey
                        race, a goolah pegging race, and a nomination race. </p>

                    <head>MENA HOUSE.</head>
                    <p>SUCCESSFUL FANCY DRESS BALL.</p>
                    <p>It is many seasons since the beautiful dining-hall of Mena House has been
                        utilized for dancing; and one can only hope that the most successful ball
                        held there on Wednesday night may prove the first of many under Mr.
                        Klinger's able management. Busy hands had hung the walls and arches with the
                        flags of many countries, adding welcome touches of colour to the scene and
                        giving a very gala appearance to the occasion. A great number of original
                        and pretty costumes were donned before the dinner hour, many cheery parties
                        assembling to partake of the very excellent menu provided for their
                        delectation. H.R.H. the Prince Bena of Siam, who is staying at the hotel,
                        was a very interested spectator throughout the evening, occupying a table at
                        dinner where he had a full view of all the guests as they entered the ball.
                        The Earl and Countess of Meath were also present at dinner, and the Hon.
                        Mrs. Cubitt was with a party. Dr. Hayward of Port Said also had a party of
                        6; and a large contingent of 18, from Ghezireh Palace, had chartered a
                        special tram to convey them out in time for dinner. Amongst this contingent
                        were Mrs. and Miss Crofton, Mrs. and Miss Carey, Mrs. Marou, Mrs. Norman
                        Smith, Miss Fox, Messrs. Adams, Boys and Hicks; and there were various
                        others well known in Cairo present.</p>
                    <p>Many hands make light work. As soon as dinner was finished an army of
                        attendants fell upon the dining hall packing away the tables and chairs,
                        rolling up and carrying away the immense carpet, and giving a final polish
                        to the well-laid floor in an incredibly short space of time, and before ten
                        o'clock the sextett orchestra was in its position and the first strains of
                        music recalled the visitors back to the scene of action. The dances at Mena
                        are always successful; but this one proved even more so than usual, and Mr.
                        and Mrs. Klingler deserve the personal thanks of all who were present for
                        one of the cheeriest entertainments of the season.</p>
                    <p>Some of the costumes worn were extremely original and well carried out, and
                        three at least deserve special mention. That of Miss Geddes was of white
                        silk most beautifully painted and designed by herself with the frontpieces
                        of well-known pieces of music, et. Indeed she might well have represented
                        the spirit of the waltz, for as she lightly squng round the room to her
                        favourite measure one caught glimpses of her favourite music from skirt and
                        sack and corsage, while her high head decoration carried out the same idea.
                        Mrs. Wentworth Shields had chosen cigarettes as a novel schema of
                        decoration. Many of these were piled upon her powdered hair, fringes of them
                        also appearing on the decoletage and sleeves of her bodice, while the sash
                        draped across her frock bore the legend "Salem Aleikim." Miss Handasyd
                        Dick's decorations of flywhisks was distinctly original and pleasing. A row
                        of these hung round the fulness of the skirt, and another waved like the
                        fashionable paradis above her coiffure, and the remainder of her dress was
                        swathed about and hung with many chains of the white shells and green bends
                        so well known in Egypt. Capt. Trefusis as "Forty Years Hence" had completely
                        veiled his identity beneath a white wig and beard and tired wrinkles across
                        his forehead and about his eyes. His sturdy stick also was necessary to
                        steady his feeble footsteps, though there was little trace of age about him
                        when he joined the dancers. Mirs. Bull made an excellent Turkish lady with
                        scarlet cap crowning her dark hair, and with many particoloured sashes
                        draped about her, and Mr. Bull was very well got up as a syce. Miss Lyon
                        Campbell was not in fancy dress, but her sister was wearing a real old
                        costume of brocade worn over a scarlet skirt and trimmed with beautiful
                        lace, which became her well. Miss James also donned a white wig with her
                        pretty grandmother's dress of pink with a big white fichi; but she also
                        danced with all the abandon of youth in spite of her assumed character. Mr.
                        Blomfield was a wonderful mandarin with shaved forehead, oblique eyebrows
                        and most truly Chinese shoes, and Mr. D. Bennett appeared in the embroidered
                        robes of real Japan. Miss Dumaresq looked most effective in her Tyrolean
                        costume, and Mlle. Gussard was a <!-- Unclear --> and very youthful
                        Charlotte Corday. There were two Norwegian peasants, one being Mrs. Maron,
                        who were dressed with absolute attention to deatils. and Miss Fox's pretty
                        Directoire costume was most becoming to her. Miss Crofton, too, looked
                        extremely well in her costume entitled "Monte Carlo, and Miss Carey as
                        Carmen could not have chosen anything to suit her better. Mr. Adams in his
                        glittering Crusader suit excited much attention, and Mr. Triman too was very
                        impressive in his Joseph coat of many colours and his tall white hat. Mr.
                        Heron was in a Russian blouse and furry cap, Dr. Wakeling in the flowing
                        robes of a Bedouin sheikh, Mr. Hicks in a very handsome Eastern toilette,
                        Mr. Wentworth Shields as a chef; while memory fails as to the wearer of a
                        magnificent tunic and turban of gold embroidery, which were perhaps the most
                        handsome garment in the room.</p>
                    <p>Amongst others noticed during the evening, were Mrs. Lyon Campbell, Mrs.
                        Ludlow, Mrs. Koch, Mrs. James, Mrs. Norman Smith, poudree, Miss Eveline
                        Hodgson, poudree Mrs. Timins, poudree, Miss Felix Brown and Mrs. Rigden.</p>

                    <p>The S.S. Sicillia left Southampton yesterday with troops on board for Crete
                        Malta and Egypt. The Sicillia will call at Alexandria on the 26th inst. to
                        disembark drafts and details, and will leave the following day.</p>
                    <p>There are details and drafts on board for most of the suits in Egypt, and 181
                        noncommissioned officers and men for the 1st Battalion King's Royal Rifle
                        Corps at Khartoum.</p>
                    <p>The 1st Battalion Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers left Belfast on the afternoon
                        of the 12th inst. for Crete, via Southampton, where it embarked the
                        following day on the S.S. Sicillia. The departure of the battalion from
                        Belfast was marked by extraordinary scenes of enthusiasm, mixed with regret,
                        for this is one of the few Irish stations where the soldier is welcomed for
                        his own sakeand not for what can be made out of him. The battalion was
                        played to the Heysham boat, the S.S. Antrim, by the bands of the Rifle
                        Brigade and 4th Battalion Royal Irish Rifles, whilst thousands of civilians
                        of all classes thronged the streets to give the gallant old 24th a suitable
                        send-off. The scenes were very pathetic in some cases, for many of the rank
                        and file are Belfast men, the regiment having always been looked upon as the
                        North of Ireland one, from its ancient associations. At the boat, the throng
                        was so great that the civil police had to draw their batons to keep back the
                        people. It was an injudicious act, for a Belfast crowd sending off a
                        regiment is not to be trifled with. Fortunately nothing untoward happened,
                        and the Inniskillings steamed down the Lough to the cheers of thousands. At
                        the Queen's Island, where the Atlantic greyhounds are built, the 27th came
                        in for another send off from the thousands of work-men there employed. THe
                        officers accompanying the battalion are- Lieutenant Colonel Davidson,
                        D.S.O., commanding Majors Hickman Hancocks, and Blenuerhassett; Captians
                        Kenny, Mitchell, Crawford, Stewart, Ridings Gordon, and Smyths (adjutant);
                        Lieutenants Manderson, Pike Kirkpatrick, Dunbar, Crofton, Henderson-Scott,
                        Hammond-Smith and Lieutenant and Quartermaster Morris. In the brigade orders
                        of the 11th inst. the following paragraph appears- "Farewell Order- The
                        Brigadier General commanding (Brigadier General Dawson, C.V.O.) wishes to
                        place on record his appreciation of the good conduct of the battalion during
                        the time it has been quartered in Belfast. The good behavior and
                        soldier-like conduct and turn out of the non-commissioned officers and men
                        in the streets reflects great credit on all ranks, and the Brigadier General
                        hopes that the battalion will earn for itself as good a reputation in its
                        new station as it has borne in Bellfast." There was practically no serious
                        "crime" in the battalion for the simple reason that all "undesirables" were
                        at once removed from it when they showed themselves. The old 27th carried
                        away very pleasant memories of their sixteen months in Ireland's commercial
                        capital. </p>
                    <p>The details of the 1st Battalion Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers- just gone to
                        Creteand those of the Connaught Rangers, will proceed to Tidworth Camp,
                        Salisbury Plain, on the 19th inst. for attachment to the Provisional
                        Battalion until the return home of their respective 2nd Battalions next
                        trooping season.</p>
                    <p>After all, the reported action of Lord Charles Beresford in refusing to
                        accept the command of the Channel Fiest until it was in a perfect state for
                        the defence of the waters for which it was brought into existence, did not
                        create the sensation one expected. If the statement be true it is on all
                        fours with Lord Charlie's conduct in naval affairs, for he has previously
                        given an ultimatum to the Government. The country will back the gallant
                        Irishman, for it knows his value, and in any cases the affair is a proper
                        exposure of the miserable thriftness of the administration of all the
                        virtues.</p>

                    <p>Cotons.</p>
                    <p>Nous avons sommes ouvent recries contre le systems de la propagation des
                        nouvelles que l'on siat pertinemment etre infondees et nous le ferons encore
                        une fois aujourd'hui. Certes, nous n'avons pas la pretention de corriger ce
                        defaut chez ceux qui ont recours a ce moyen pour influencer le marche, ni ne
                        voulons nous poser en detenseurs des naifs qui se laissent souvent prendre a
                        ce petit jeu; ce role de Don Quichotte ne nous incombe pas! Aussi, si nous
                        revenons sur ce point, ce n'est que pour repeter ce qui a ete deja dit, a
                        savoir que ces trucs sont simplement odieux, car, generalement, ce ne sont
                        que les petitis qui en sont les victimes. On nous repondra par ce
                        pseudoaxiome que la fin justifie les moyens, que d'ailleurs ces choses la
                        passent pour des peches veniels a la Bourse et au'apres tout ceuz qui ne
                        sont pas au courant de la veritable situation du march d'ont qu'a se
                        renseigner avant de se laisser entrainer. Tout cela est bel et bon et nous
                        ne tonsn pas a le discuter, mais est-ce que la partie ne serait pas bien
                        plus noble si, au lieu de transiger avec leur conscience, les manipulateurs
                        des marches se contentaient de profiter d'une fecon loyale des occasions que
                        les circumstances leur offrent parfois?</p>
                    <p>Pour ne pas avoir l'air de faire un cours de morale que personne ne nous
                        demande, nous nous arretons la dans ces reflextions qui nous ont ete
                        inspirees par les faits de samedi dernier et nous nous contenterons de
                        constrater que c'est tout simplement en telephonant au Caire qu'une
                        combinaison avait ete conclue pour prendre livreaison du mars, que le
                        devouvert sur le mois en question etait enorme et qu'il n'y aurait aucuue
                        emission de titieres, que l'ou est parvenu a chauffer la speculation de la
                        captiale et a l'induire a racheter ete au dela, ce que la veille et
                        l'avent-veille elle avait vendu en contrats mars. Premier resultat obtenu,
                        hausse de 1/8 pour la matinee. </p>
                    <p>Ces dispositions ayant paru assex chaudes a nos haussiers, la mancelivre a
                        ete continuees lundi, et cette fois elle a eu plein succes, etant donne que
                        dans l'apres midid le cours du mars a finir par atteindre le niveau de 22
                        tallaris. En attendant, nombre d'interesses de notre place avaient reussi a
                        passer a leurs confreres du Caire leurs paquets de mars, et comme la demande
                        surgie pour ce mois avait reduit le report pour mai a 7/16 de tallri,
                        beaucoup d'arbitragistes en ont profite pour revendre le mars, au transfert
                        duquel ils avaient deja consenti, avec l'idee, bien entendu, de la reprendre
                        par la suite avec des differences baucoup plus sensibles en leur faveur.</p>
                    <p>Au fond, il faut bien le reconnaitre, le tout etait bien joue, et ceux qui
                        avaient donne dans le panneau a fete baissee, s'en sont bien apercus, mais
                        un peu trop tard! En tous cas, la consequence de leur precipitation a croire
                        tout ce qui leur avait ete raconte, a consiste dans l'elargissement du
                        report de Mars a Mai a 11/16, justifiant de la sorte les calculs
                        <!-- Unclear --> qui avaient specule sur cette evantualle. Pour le moment,
                        les nouveaux detendre du Mars luttent dans le secret espoir qu'il n'y aura
                        pas de fieres, mais, comme on peut bien le comprendre, ce n'est la qu'une
                        illusion, car avec l'enorme quantite pour le mois prochain que la
                        speculation s'est mise sur les epaulez, il n'y aurait, pour emptcher les
                        mises a disposition, qu'un report plus large encore que l'actuel et
                        suffisant pour tenter tous les vendeurs, meme les plus avides. Nous
                        convenons qu'avec cela les haussiers n'ameliorent pas leur position, mais,
                        somme toute, et, comme d'habitude, ils gagneront du temps et apres tout
                        l'Imprevu existe toujours.</p>
                    <p>Malgre la retraite des principaux faisuers, la tenue de Mardi a ete femre,
                        mais la journee de Mercredi et la matinee d'hier ont ete marquees du coin de
                        la fablesse. Toutefois, apres un recul a 21 15/32, il y a eu de nouveau
                        reprise et la cloture de ce soir s'est faite sur la cote de 21 22/32.</p>
                    <p>Comme on le voit, tout le borit meme pendant la semaine aboutit tout
                        simplement a 1/8 de hausse. Ce n'est pas beaucoup, mais comme les choses
                        recelles, soit la continuation des grosses recettes et la persistance de la
                        filature danse son abstention seraient deux causes de faibles-<cb n="2"/>se,
                        on n'aurait jamais pu s'attendre a meiux. Dans tous le cas, la chose aurait
                        ete difficile, avec cette mance de la filiere. Mars qui nous pend sur la
                        fete et qui pourrait nous valoir un veritable coup de massuer. Reste, il est
                        vrai, la tenue de l'Egyptien et la hausse qui en a ete la consequence; mais
                        est-on bien sur que cette demande si inattendue de ces temps derniers duera
                        longtemps encore et que nous ne courons aucun risque d'assister a une de ces
                        voltefaces qui tres souvent se sont proudited d'une facon
                        <!--Unclear-->inopionee? Bref, nous traversons pour le moment une periode
                        transitoire et aucune tendance marquee ne pourra, se de siner avant que la
                        question du Mars n'ait ete liquidee, ou pour le moins, elucidee. </p>
                    <p>On se demande quel peut avoir ete la cause du reveil si soudain de Liverpool
                        pour nos cotons. Sur la foides renseignements recueillis, il y a un peu de
                        tout, soit couvertures pour compte d'Alexandrie trouvant plus de convenance
                        a acheter la bas pour liverer, ventes de files que, snas perdre de temps, la
                        filature a tenu a couvrir en disponsible et demande de l'etranger, etc. Tous
                        ces detials importent peu, sauf le premier point, car au fond c'est de la
                        marchandise qui passe en filature. Quant a ce qui est de la premiere
                        eventualite, nous avons deja dit dernierement qu'elle pourrait nous valoir
                        pour la suite une certaine diminuition dans nos exporations.</p>
                    <p>A ce propos nous relevons qu quelwues personnes ont cru mettre en avant comme
                        une cause de hausse tout refus de la filature anglaise de vendre des viles
                        pour livraisions a date rapprochees. Comme il n'est pas admissible que la
                        consommation sit pris des engage meints sans les courvrir, cela reviendrait
                        a dire, d'apres notre jugeotte, que les chances pour de nouvelles affaires
                        sur la recolte actuelle ne sont pas grandes. S'il y a des besoins d'acheter
                        du disponsible pour les couvrir, d'autant plus que la prochaine recolte est
                        en deport de 2 tallaris! Cela ne semble-t-il pas logique pour le moins. </p>
                    <p>L'activite a ete grande pendant la semaine pour la recolte actuelle, mais a
                        laisse a desirer pour ce qui regarde la nouvelle.- Il est cependant
                        indeuiable que la tenue du Novembre a ete plus reguiliere, exempte de
                        fluctuations voilentes et que la hausse acquise a pu etre facilment
                        maintenue. Elle consiste en 9/16 de tallaris, la coue du Novembre affichee
                        en cloture de ce soir etant de 19 11/16.</p>
                    <p>QUant au calme relatif qu s'est fait remarqur, il provient de deux canses, la
                        reserve montree par la filature et le desir chez beaucoup de detentuers de
                        vouloir s'alleger, car certaines positions sont tres surchargees et le prix,
                        apres tout, est trop eleve pour ne pas inspirer un peu de prudence. Par
                        contre, il n'y a presque pas de vendeurs en blanc pour peser sur le marche,
                        ce qui est une chance pour les haussiers.</p>
                    <p>Da cote de l'Amerique, il n'y a rien de serieux: nous haussons et nous
                        baissons, mais en definitive nous sommes comme les carabiniers toujours en
                        place. Il y a manque de speculation, ce qui contrebalance l'effet de la
                        demande de la part de la falature, sans compter la surrabondance de coton.
                        Tout n'est pas utilisable, et une partie du surplus restera a l'annee
                        prochaine aux finis de malange, mais en attendant le visible supply, qui
                        tieut le record, offre encore suffisamment de choix.</p>
                    <p>Le marche du disponible n'a pas ete bienactif, mais is finit ferme, avec un
                        hausse de 3/8 pour les Mit Affifi et de 1/4 pour les provenances.
                        Haute-Egypte et cela a la suite de la situatuion des contrats. L'Abassi par
                        contre et le Joannovich sont sans changement. </p>
                    <p>La demande est moderes pour le spot, mais elle porte un peu sur toutes les
                        qualities. </p>
                    <p>Les exportations ont ete une veritable surprise cette semaine: on
                        s'attendrait a quelque chose de tres deduct et on a finin par avoir 6,000
                        Balles en plus de l'annee passee, les chiffres etant de 23,000 contre
                        17,000. Cela a un peu contribue au soutien. </p>
                    <p>Pour la semaine prochaine il y aura revanche, ditons pour notre part nous ne
                        saurions faire de pronostics, surtour apres ce qui est arrive ces dernieres
                        semaines. Nous porrons expedier moins que la semaine correspondante en 1906,
                        mais comme total due mols, nous n'aurons pas la reduction pre-<cb n="3"
                        />conisee de 20% sur Fevrier 1906. Si la chose atteint 15% environ ce sera
                        encore beau.</p>
                    <p>Comme mouvement de la recolte, nous constatons que les recettes jusqu'ici
                        sont de 6,315,000 cantars, que les exportations sont de 82.000 balles
                        superieures a l'annee derniere a la meme date et que finalement le stock est
                        de 1.807.000, contre 1.435.000 cantars.</p>
                    <p>Liverpool, tres actif pour les egyptiens disponsibles, nous signale pour la
                        semaine une hausse de 1/4 pour le spot et de 29/64 pour le Mars qui ont
                        respectivement fini a 11 1/8 et 11 5/64.</p>
                    <p>Quant aux americains, la cloture du spot a 6.03, celle du Mars-Avril a 5.65
                        et celle du Juillet-Aout a 5.60, nous montrent qu'en tout et pour tout il
                        n'y a que deux points de hausse et sur la derniere echeance seulement. </p>

                    <p>Le marche de Londres a ete cette semanie franchement mauvais. Non-seulement
                        le taux prive d'escompte a hausse de 1/8 a 4 7/8% et le Consolide a baisse
                        d'une demi-livre a 86 5/8, mais encore les valeurs egyptiennes sans
                        exception ont subi une depreciation plus ou moins notable: 1/8 pour la Daira
                        a 17 3/8, 1/4 pour l'Agricole et la Delta Light a 9 3/4 et 11 1/2 et 1/2
                        pour la National Bank a 27 7/8. La reserve de la Banque est de plus tombee
                        de 50 1/4 a 48 1/8% soit plus de 2% de perte. </p>
                    <p>A Paris, si la Rente Francaise 3% a beneficie d'une legere reprise de 10
                        centimes a 95.50, les valeurs egyptiennes ont montre, par contre, une toute
                        aussi mauvaise tenue qu'on Angleterre: le Credit Foncier Egyptien est tombe
                        a 755; il est vrai qu'il faut tenicompte du coupon detache nagnere, mais ce
                        motif n'existe pas pour le Credit Franco-Egyptien qui a neanmoins perdu 5
                        fr. a 158; la Land Bank a egalement flechi a 228.</p>
                    <p>Pour notre place la semaine qui vient de s'ecoulera ete la plus terne que
                        nous ayions eue a analyser depuis la morte saison, c'est-a-dire depuis le
                        mois d'sout. En titres de placement, la nullite a ete complete; sur les
                        valeurs meme legeres et de pure speculation les affaires au comptant n'ont
                        en aucune importance; tout a ete pour fin et encore les transactions
                        ont-elles ete forcement limitees par suite du malaise croissant qui pere sur
                        notre marche. Les operations en nouvelles emissions se sont elles-memes
                        rareifiees au point de rendre icomprehensible la hate que mettent les
                        lanceurs d'affaires a nous doter de leurs brillantes cominaisons. Des
                        samedi, la position generale est aux ventes, amis sans succes, faute de
                        contrepartie. Meme situation lundi. Le lendemain la nullite persiste pour le
                        comptant; quelques transactions s'effectuent pour fin, de preference sur les
                        nouvelles emissions pour lesquelles il n'y a rien a verser. Mercredi la
                        situation ne fait qu'empirer; on commence a reporter pour fins mars:
                        quelques-uns, trop surcharges, cherchent a s'alleger d'une partie de leur
                        stock, ce qui entraine une baisse generale. Les deux dernieres seances, hier
                        et aujourd'hui, ont les memes caracteristiques; debut en pleine debacle pour
                        reprendre un peu vers la fin, mais cloturer en somme a un niveau
                        generalement inferieur a celui de la veille.</p>
                    <p>Sur ne soixantaine de valeurs inscrites a la cote officielle de notre bourse,
                        trente et une sont en baisse, cinq seulement en hausse et les autres
                        demeurent stationnaires.</p>
                    <p>Les fluctuations les plus sensibles sont: a la hausse, la Nile Land qui
                        beneficie d'une livre et demie d'avance a 24; et a la baisse, la National
                        Bank qui perd 1/4 a 27 3/4, les Privilegiees Tramways 5 fr. a 192, la Behera
                        1 livre a 39, la Cassa di Sconto 4 fr. 50 l'ancienne a 271 1/2 et 6 fr. la
                        nouvelle a 264. La Ramleh, la Delta Light, la Deferred Delta, le Comptoir,
                        l'Union Fonciere, les Cotton Ginners, et les Constructions reculent

                    <p>L'assemblee generale des actionnaires de la Nile Land and Agricultural
                        Company a ete tenue lundi, 18 courant, au siege social a Alexandrie. Il a
                        ete decide de distribuer un dividende de 5% soit 25 P.T. par action, payable
                        a partir du 4 du mois prochain a l'Anglo Egyptian Bank. Il ressort du
                        rapport du conseil d'administration, qui sera publie ces jours-ci que sur
                        une etendue de terrain de 285,000 metres carres environ, la societe en a
                        rovendu 144,000 pour une somme de 1.300.000 L.E. environ. Le prix global
                        d'achat etant de 1.500.000 L.E., on voit que la vente des 135.000 metres qui
                        restent constituera un benefice presque net. On concoit dans ces conditions
                        la hausse presque ininterrompue du titre qui a cette semaine atteint 24
                        livres, en depit de la baisse generale. De tels resultats font evidemment
                        honneur au conseil d'administration et la satisfaction des actionnaires dont
                        le capital s'accroit de facon prodigiuse est le plus bel eloge qu'on puisse
                        faire de leur gestion. </p>
                    <p>Il est question depuis quelques temps de l'absorption des Nungovich Hotels
                        par les Estates. Ceux-ci ont deja achete le Savoy Hotel et sont en
                        pourparlers pour l'acquisition du Grand Continental au prix de 800,000
                        livres.</p>
                    <p>On nous informe qu'un dividende de 1 shelling, equivalant au 20% du capital,
                        appele, sera declare le 28 courant a l'assemblee generale de l'Egyptian
                        Investment and Agency qui sera tenue a Londres.</p>
                    <p>Au nombre des nouvelles emissions qui ont eu lieu cette semaine, signalons
                        celles de la Nile Transport Co., de la Levico et de la Banque d'Escompte et
                        de reports. Lundi prochain sera ouverte la souscription a la Bourse and
                        Banking (Arditi). La succes de cette derniere est d'ores et deja assure,
                        grace a la prime de 1/4 dont jouit cette valeur. </p>
                    <p>A l'assemblee de l'Egyptian Delta Land and Investment Co. tenue samedi par

                        creation. L'administration, qui avait donne lieu a d'innombrables
                        tiraillements entre Londres et le Caire au grand detriment des interests
                        sociaux, a ete centralisee en Egypte, Le conseil de Londres a demissionne et
                        un conseil local a ete elu qui offre toutes les garanties de bonne gestion:

                        Menasce et J.W. Williamson. Un membre de la maison Suares du Caire sera
                        egalement adjoint conseil, des que certains pourparlers auront abouti. Une
                        assemblee generale des actionnaires va etre incessamment tenue a Londres

                    <p>Mrs Mois Parizeau, Ste. Julie de Vercheres, P.W., Canada, writes: </p>
                    <p>"I hardly know how to thank you for the good Peruna has done me." </p>
                    <p>"I suffered five years with the pain in the stomach. About a year ago it
                        became so bad I could hardly bear it." </p>
                    <p>"I coughed day and night and grew weaker and weaker. The pains extended
                        through my body and I also had difficulty breathing, which made me cough.
                        Everyone thought I had consumption."</p>
                    <p>"My husband heard of Peruna and bought five bottles."</p>
                    <p>"This treatement virtually cured me and now I recommend Peruna to everyone
                        who is suffering."</p>
                    <p>"I thank Dr. Hartman for this excellent remedy." </p>
                    <p>--- MRS. MOIS PARIZEAU</p>
                    <p>A NEGLECTED cold is generally the first cause of catarrh.</p>
                    <p>Women are especially liable to colds. These colds occur more frequently
                        during the wet, sloppy weather of winter and spring than any other time of
                        the year. Often they are not considered serious and so are allowed to run
                        on, or they are treated in such a way as to only palliate the symptoms,
                        while the cold becomes more deep-seated and the patient finally awakens to
                        the fact that she has a well-developed case of catarrh. </p>
                    <p>By reason of their delicate structure, the lungs are frequently the seat of a
                        cold, especially if there is the slightest weakness of the organs. The
                        treatment of catarrh of the lungs is also more difficult and discouraging
                        than catarrh of any other organ of the body.</p>
                    <p>It would be wise, therefore, to guard against it by every precaution
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>Peruna has been found the most reliable of all remedies for coughs, colds,
                        and catarrh, by reason of the fact that it foes at once to the very seat of
                        the trouble.</p>
                    <p>It searches out every crevice, every duct of the body. It quickens and
                        equalizes the circulation of blood, thus relieving the congested mucous
                        membranes. It exercises a healing and soothing effect upon the mucous
                        membranes no matter whether they are the exposed membranes of the head and
                        throat, or whether they line the remotest cells of the lungs.</p>
                    <p>A word to the wise woman is sufficient. Take Peruna at the first appearance
                        of a cold.</p>
                    <p>Those desiring special instructions regarding the use of Peruna, should
                        address <persName>Dr. S.B. Hartman</persName>, President of The Hartman
                        Sanitarium, Colombus, O.</p>

                        druggists at five shillings per bottle or six bottles for twenty-five
                        shillings.</p>

                        amelioration, que nous annoncions depuis deux ou trois jours, on est oblige
                        de reconnaitre que la cote a attteint pour les valuers de placement un
                        niveau de depreciation qu'il sera difficile de depasser, en mettant les
                        choses au pire, ce qui n'est pas le cas.</p>

                    <p>Le taux de l'escompte libre a Londres a ete eleve hier de 1/8 a 4 7/8 pour
                        cent. Au Stock Exchange, le Consolide anglais s'est maintenu a 86 5/8, de
                        meme que l'Unifee a 102 3/4. La National Bank a perdu 1/4 a 27 7/8 et
                        l'Agricole 1/8 a 9 3/4. La Daira est restee invariee a 17 3/8 ainsi que la
                        Delta Light a 11 1/2. </p>
                    <p>A Paris, le Credit Foncier Egyptien a retrograde de 3 francs a 756 et la
                        Banque d'Athenes de 1 franc a 134.</p>
                    <p>Influence, d'une part, par les circunstances d'ordre local que nous avons
                        suffisamment exposees a cette place et, d'autre part, par la tenue de moins
                        en moins, favorable des Bourses de Londres et de Paris, notre marche des
                        valeurs continue a montrer de mauvaises dispositions. La seance de ve matin
                        a ette aussi peu satisfaisante que celle d'hier et il y a encore a
                        enregistrer des moins-vales sur un grand nombre de titres de la cote. Il
                        faut decidement, sauf cas imprevu, renoncer a voir une reprise stable, sinou
                        une amelioration, se produire avant que la situation se soit eclaircie a la
                        suite de la liquidation de fin de mois. Toutefois il serait en meme temps
                        temeraire de s'attendre a une accentuation notable de la depression, la
                        baisse paraissant avoir plus ou moins dit son dernier mot, specialement sur
                        les bonnes valeurs, dont les cours deviennent de plus en plus tentants pour
                        le placement aussi bien que pour la speculation.</p>

                        1/8. Les Egyptian ont recule a 12 1/8. Les Excelsior ont regagne 1/2 sur la
                        nouvelle que la Societe a recu une nouvelle offre pour son terrain du square
                        Soliman-Pacha. La part National Hotel s'est raffermie a 67.</p>

                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
                        vitality—vigour--</p>
                    <p>VITAL STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY</p>
                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night
                        succeeds the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the
                        celebrated life-reviving tonic</p>
                    <p>THERAPION No.3</p>
                    <p>than by any other known combination. So surely as it is taken in accordance
                        with the printed directions accompanying it, will the shattered health be
                        restored,</p>
                    <p>THE EXPIRING LAMP OF LIFE LIGHTED UP AFRESH,</p>
                    <p>and a new existence imparted in place of what had so lately seemed worn-out,
                        "used up," and valueless. This wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and
                        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative
                        essence, which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had
                        preceded it for this wide-spread and numerous class of human ailments.</p>
