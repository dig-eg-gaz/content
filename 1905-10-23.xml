                    <head>TRAFALGAR AND TSUSHIMA</head>
                    <p>The fact that Togo's crowning success at Tsushima took place in the
                        cententary year of Nelson's great victory at Trafalgar has not escaped the
                        public and the press, and the real- isation of the influence of sea-power on
                        history is now stronger than it ever has been in our history. The great
                        battles which destroyed the fleets of Napoleon and the Tsar will go down to
                        history as decisive and epoch-making encounters : the first saved the
                        British, the second the Japanese from the menance of inva- sion, and both
                        resulted in the total overthrow of the hostile fleets. But in celebrating
                        the great sea flight on Saturday last the British people had no desire to
                        wound the feelingso f their erstwhile foes and present cordial friends. The
                        French navy is now in better condiiton than it ever was, its vessels are
                        among the best, its officers gallant and highly trained, and it is pleasant
                        to hope that this most efficient force will never again be ranged against
                        our navy. The success of Japan is also a subject for rejoicing among
                        Britons, who feel a certain, pride at the fact that Admiral Togo was trained
                        on the Worcester, and that his best vessels were armed and built by our
                        yards; but it need not prevent us from hoping tha our own rela- tions with
                        great Power defeated in the Eastern Seas may become more and more friendly.
                        Defeat, unless followed by dismem- berment, seldom leaves a lasting pain,
                        and our people have long ago forgotten or forgiven Beachy Head and Yorktown,
                        Fontenay, and Saratoga.</p>

                    <head>THE SUCRERIES</head>
                    <p>The second report of Sir William Willcocks on the situation of the Sucrecries
                        Company from the agriculutral point of view is of pain- ful interest to the
                        Egyptian public, which, till the first rumours of a crash, had obstinately
                        refused to criticise or even to think of question- ing the excellance of the
                        company's manage- ment of its estates in Upper Egypt. In future, we hope,
                        the would-be shareholder (we do not refer to the speculative buyer) will
                        take a little more trouble to acquaint himself with the actual working of
                        the undertakings in which he wishes to invest ; the information is generally
                        procurable with very little trouble, though cases can easily be imagined in
                        which it has to be taken with a grain or two of salt. A discharged servant,
                        for example, is not always a fountain-head of truth.</p>
                    <p>Sir Williams Willcock's criticism are numer- ous and important. He points out
                        that over- centralisation has been fatal to the proper management of the
                        factories, the Cairo head- quarters fixing the rates for transport and
                        taking into its hands other questions of detail which might have been far
                        more rapidly and profitably settled by local managers. Managers have
                        obviously failed at times to "hit it off" with local growers, so
                        emphatically does Sir William state that necessity of dispensing with the
                        services of managers who do not succeed in winning the confidence of the
                        cultivators. The premiums and percentages allowed to managers should be
                        expressed. Two suggestions which Sir William makes are of special im-
                        portance : that an attempt should be made to adopt the system of payment for
                        sugar-cane according to its quality- the system adopted in the early days of
                        cotton culutre in Egypt- and that a hardly variety of cane that can resist
                        frost should be imported, and that the Government, aided by the Khedivial
                        Agri- cultural Society, should aid its acclimiatisation.</p>
                    <p>As to the future of the Secreries, we are left in truly Egyptian darkness.
                        Sir William Willcocks deals with the problem from the point of view of the
                        agriculutral expert, but the future is for the financier to decide. Those
                        few members of the public who still talk op- timistically of reconstruction
                        by the efforts of Sir X.Y. or Mr. A. B. deserve the utmost credit for their
                        optimism, but we should like to remind them that financier does not ne-
                        cessarily spell philanthropist.</p>

                        the heading'Bulletin de la Bourse," a movement is said to be advocated by a
                        Cairo firm of brokers and a certain number of local shareholders of the
                        above company, with a view to suppress the <placeName>London</placeName>
                        board of administration, and to substitute an Egyptian board of directors to
                        take over the entire management of the affairs of the com- pany, on the
                        supposed grounds of continued friction between the present

                    <p>A letter which has reached us from <placeName>Syria</placeName> shows that
                        the stories of a general conflict be- tween <placeName>Bedouins</placeName>
                        and <placeName>Druses</placeName> in the <placeName>Hauran</placeName> have
                        been much exaggorated. It appears that a Druse caravan, while returning to
                        the Hauran from Damascus some six weeks ago, was attacked by a gang of
                        Bedouins, and lost two men and most of its camels. On the news reaching the
                        Hauran 300 Druse cavaliers decided to make reprisals. Riding some days over
                        desolate country in the east of the Hauran, they surprised the offending
                        tribe and took 700 camels. Two hundred of the raiders returned with their
                        spoil, the remainder, unsatisfied with their booty, rode on and captured
                        some cattle, only to find themselves face to face with an overwhelming force
                        of Bedouins who had gathered to repel the attack. Heavily out- numbered, the
                        hundred Druses had to retire after two days’ fighting, losing twenty men and
                        as many horses.</p>
                    <p>Among the fallen notables were the sons of <persName>Sheikh Selim</persName>
                        <persName>el Atrash</persName> and of <persName>Sheikh</persName> Said Nasr
                        both only seventeen years of age. Five Bedouin leaders were killed. The
                        whole force of the Hauran now prepared to attack the Bedouins,when Nazn
                        Pasha, Vali of Damasons, intervened, end the Druses, whose feelings toward
                        this excellent governor are most friendly, agreed to submit the dispute to

                            <persName>Mr. Richards</persName> was appointed student interpreter in
                        1877, became vice-consul at Mosul in 18 -3 and at Bourgas in 1885. He was
                        then promoted to be Consul for the E. Coast of the Red Sea (August 16, 1892)
                        and was attacked and severely wounded by Bedouins in May, 1895, receiving
                        compensation from the Turkish Go- vernment. In 1896 he was transferred to
                            <placeName>Damascus</placeName>. An excellent linguist, a firm and
                        energeetic consul, always willing to give in- formation and advice,
                            <persName>Mr. Richards</persName> won the respect of all who knew him.

                        him by <persName>Mr. Richards</persName>, who was then in very poor health,

                        <p>After a 50 yards race, easily won by <persName>Mr. Seeger</persName>, of
                            the Deutacher Sports Verein, came the greasy pole competition, in which
                            most of be competitors dived or fell ingloriously into the water after
                            the first two steps. The scowling ended in an easy victory for

                            a bad course which obliged him to stop short to avoid collision with a
                            lighter. The competition between "home-made" boats, few of which
                            supported their occupants for any length of time, and the blindfold race
                            were most amusing, especially the latter, some of the competitors in
                            which, after reaching the half-way point in a 'there and back’ race of
                            twenty yards, turned and made courageously for Fort Agame. The mop
                            tournament was also most amusing, and the spectacle of one combatant
                            after another losing his balance and going over the side was most comic.
                            The swimming under under water was the last item of an ejoyable

                        <dateline>Port Said, Saturday.</dateline>
                        <p>This afternoon Port Said opened their football season with a practice
                            match with their natives. They were short of a few players, but managed
                            to raise a fall team. The following represented Port Said: —goal,
                                <persName>F. Buck</persName>; back, Wallis (capt.) and
                                <persName>William</persName>s ; half-backs, King, Jones, and
                            Goodwin; forwards, Howe, Ghesman, Ingram, Gunnery and Jary. In the first
                            half <placeName>Port Said</placeName> were decidedly the better eleven,
                            and it was marvellous on many occasions how the native goal escaped
                            downfall. For full 20 minutes they kept their op- ponents in their 25
                            line, and it was only the very fine play of the backs and goalkeeper
                            which prevented them scoring. Towards the end of the first half the
                            natives got away with a rush and after some splendid passing the ball
                            found the net, but whether it was a native or King, (<placeName>the Port
                                said</placeName> half-back) who actually scored, it is hard to say,
                            but it certainly was no fault of the goalkeeper. The second half was
                            contested at as fast a pace as before, and again <placeName>Port
                                Said</placeName> attacked, but- the shooting was very poor. Neither
                            tide scored, and when the whistle went for time, the score remained as
                            at half-time. There wire several "new faces" in the <placeName>Port
                                Said</placeName> string who gave promise, but on the whole play was
                            not of a scientific order. <persName>Gunnery</persName>,
                                <persName>Ingram</persName>, <persName>Jary</persName> and
                                <persName>Williams</persName> were prominent for <placeName>Port
                                Said</placeName>, while the right wing was the backbone of the
                            natives.</p>
                        <p>A football match was played at <placeName>Boulac</placeName> on Friday
                            last, between the home team and the R.A.M.C., in the presence of fully
                            150 specta- tors. Boulac lost the toss and kicked off from the Embabeh
                            end. Before the game was a few minutes' old, it soon became evident that
                                <placeName>Boulac</placeName> were the stronger team in every
                            respect, and they consequently won after an easy’ but enjoyable game, by
                            10 goals to nil. The goal scorers for <placeName>Boulac</placeName>
                            were: Mr. C. J. Esau, 5; Mr. <persName>J. Rodway</persName>, 2 ; Mr. L.
                            II. Lion, 1; Mr. <persName>W. M. Hates</persName>. 1.</p>
                        <p>After the match was over, tea was provided for the players, and thus
                            ended another of those pleasant afternoons which are so frequent at

                    <p>The third ordinary general meeting of the shareholders of the Central Egypt
                        Exploration Company (Limited) was held on the 19th October at Winchester
                        House, Old Broad- street, London, EC., under the presidency of <persName>Mr.
                            Tyndale White</persName>, the chairman of the company.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary (<persName>Mr. E. S. G. Malins</persName>) having read the
                        notice convening tho meeting and the report of the auditors, the Chairman
                        said I "Ladies and Gentlemen- I shall not detain you very long, as Mr.
                        Alford, my colleague on the board of the company, who is also our
                        superintending engineer, and to whose fore- sight the re-discovery of the
                        Egyptian Gold- fields is due, will tell you all about out work in Egypt and
                        explain things much better than I should.</p>
                    <p>“I should like, however, to say that, although j the statement of accounts
                        shows only about £1,503 in hand, our fiancial position is much better than
                        appears in the balance sheet, which is made up to the 30th June. We bad no
                        diffi- culty at all in placing a further 3,500 shares, which leaves us
                        35,000 working capital shares in hand for disposal. The whole of the working
                        capital shares are under call, and the develop- ments on the property are so
                        good that I have very little hesitation in saying that the call will be
                        exercised. Your directors, therefore, have with this knowledge authorised
                        the Expenditure of a considerable sum of money in sinking a main shaft,
                        which will have the result of proving tho Ataliah Mine at depth. The
                        expenditure was entered into with the fall knowledge and consent of the
                        group which is financing us, and hitherto all our demands for working
                        capital have been promptly met "I think you will all agree with me that the
                        record of the work we have done at Atallah is satisfactory in the very
                        highest degree. We have bad the good fortune to strike an ore shoot 700 ft.
                        long of a highly payable charac- ter, and there is no question in my mind
                        that when our main shaft is finished we shall be in the possession of a very
                        rich and completely proven property.”</p>

                    <p>brief for the Egyptian Government, which he in-several instances gone it own
                        way to it own detriment, but I do maintain that, generally, its regulation*
                        dealing with theee miniog matters are the best that, under the
                        otronmstanoes, oonld be devised. Had more care bpen ex ^raised athirst in

                        Egyptian mlping wonld have stood in a much more prominent and important
                        position before the public than it stands to-day. "That prospeoting areas
                        should not be snblet or out np, at least nntil the original holder has spent
                        a considerable sum of money on explore- tion work, is, as I said before, a
                        most ralntary condition. It te 'da to prevent that nndoe infla- tion of
                        o\fii a1, whioh paralyses so many mining ventures in other lands. Another
                        regulation made by the Egyptian Government is that no mining company should
                        be formed having a snbfcribed working capital of less than one- third of its
                        nominal oapital. This it also a most excellent regulation ; the pity is that
                        it does not refer to all oompanies, mining or otherwise. The mining lease
                        issned by the Egyptian Government has lately been the snbjeot of some
                        discussion ; taking it generally, it is a very good lease, although some of
                        its provisions certainly require more explioit statement. Payment of
                        royalty, as a sort of inoome-tax on distributed profits, is a very sonnd
                        arrangement The anneal rental of £2 per aore charged on the area mining
                        leases is high, bnt does not form a crippling impost on leases of 200 to 800
                        ' acres. So far, in the Egyptian form of lease, the area leaseable has not
                        been limited or the 1 shape of the ioolnded land defined, and I do 1 not
                        think they shonld be. The high rental is a check on exorbitant acquisition
                        of land, and, - as the geologiosl conditions of the country do ' not point
                        to any long lines of olosely contigu- ous mines, the shape of a lease is of
                        no oon- | sequence, and a regulation defining it might be very anno} ing
                        nnder some circumstances. | "In the Sudan the mining lease is somewhat ‘
                        different ; the royalty is the same as in the Egyptian form, a tax of 10 per
                        oent on distri- buted profits, but the rental of mining proper- ties is £1
                        instead of £2 per aore. There ‘ ! appears to me no reason why these mining 1
                        leases should not be identical.</p>

                    <p>"The whole of those parts of Egypt and of ' the Sudan where there is any
                        probability of the discovery of mineral deposits of eoonomio ' value appears
                        now to have been allotted in ( prospecting areas. From some 200 miles sooth
                        of Kbartotm the remains of anoient mine workings have been discovered. It is
                        not within the bounds of reasonable expectation that all of these
                        discoveries should tom oot to be payable mines when re-opened, but I am sure
                        many of them will do so; neither is it t) be expected that all the exploring
                        expedi- ; tions sent out will find anything at all to work 1 upon. Many
                        disappointments are inevitable in so speculative an undertaking as the ex-
                        ploration of what is praotioally a new and so vast a mining oonntry, bat the
                        prizes to for- trnate shareholders in the disooveries will be very great. I
                        look back upon the early days of the Indian mines, whioh these Egyptian '
                        mines so mnoh resemble, when the same apathy nnder whioh we are labouring
                        now was cloud- , ing them, and hindering the day of.their pros* parity.
                        Where were the Mysore, the Cham- pion Reef, and the Ooregum Mines in the
                        early eighties t I was in Johannesburg in its earliest days, when nothing

                        in those most profitable mines. Then all at onoe the soene ohsnged, as if by
                        magic, and in the winter of 1889 came one of the maddest speculative mining
                        , booms that the world has ever seen ; shares which could find no sale at a
                        modest sovereign were esgerly bought at fifty, and some few made fortune*,
                        whilst others lost their little all. I desire to see no such mad boom in .
                        Bryptian mines, whioh in the' end doss far ' more harm than good, but I do
                        desire some . recognition and support for what I believe will shortly be an
                        important and profitable mining industry.</p>

                        snooeases, and l mean to crown it with the snooeaa of Egyptian mining. So
                        far I feel that I have been ploagh- ing a lonely farrow, bat I have pat my
                        hand to the ploagh, and shall not look back." I Lord Dormer then moved the

                        seoonded by Mr. W. N. Tonlmin, and agreed to nnanimonsly. On the motion of

                        were re-appointed auditors, r Mr. W. F. Goodwin proposed a vote of thanks to
                        Mr. Alford for his interesting aooonnt of Egyptian miniog, and remarked that
                        he per- sonally believed greatly in the future of Egypt as a mining centre.
                        The Chairman, in seoonding the motion, said the directors valoed very mnoh

                        the highest opinion and the most sanguine hopes. “I will not take up yonr
                        time now by dis- cussing the Eridia and Semca mines, which, with yonr mine
                        of Atallab, form what we may call the Eeueh group. Thero aro others which
                        may later on be brought into this circle of operations, bnt these three,
                        whioh are now bring actively developed, form the centre of present interest
                        A diagram of yonr Atallah mine hangs on the wall, and, lest we altogether
                        forget at whioh of the craopinie*' meetings we are aow attending, I will
                        describe this mine as a type of the o'hsrs, which it ranch re- sembles.”
                        (Here Mr. Alford dasoribel the Atallah Mine with the aid of the diagram, and
                        then continued.) “Yon see that we have in this mine some very rich and
                        extensive zones of rock. Now all the interest ceotres in getting that new

                        which wo have already developed, and which I have just described. Probably
                        there will not be much of interest to report whilst that work is going on,
                        though the winze on the vein from the 260ft level will tell ns the size and
                        value of the vein as we go down on it. "It sometimes occurs to me that
                        sharehold- ers are apt to be disappointed when, in these exploration works,

                        world. The radix-1 oovery of these mines in 1899 led to nn- morons
                        applications for prospecting rights being made to the Egyptian Government,
                        by all manner of persons, which were met by the granting of large
                        prospecting areas on the distinct understanding that the oonoesxbn- nairas
                        shonld explore the grqnnd at their own oo*t, not seeking to gain a^immediate
                        profit from the fact of having obtained a oonoession, and when payable mines

                        mining oompanies to work them. From the first the Govern- ment, led astray

                        the matter, looked npon the very cxistenoe of these ancient gold mines,
                        still more their possible re-apening, with incre- dality. The financial
