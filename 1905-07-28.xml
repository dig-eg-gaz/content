                            landed in the vicinity and attacked the place on the 24th. 200 prisoners
                            were taken. The redoubts to the east of the town stubbornly resisted but
                            were re-attacked and then captured on the 25th instant. (Reuter.)</p>

                            p.m. at the High School in the Missala quarter. A large marquee was

                            friends of the pupils, and its capacity was fully taxed. A varied
                            programme was submitted, and was greatly enjoyed by the audience. A most
                            exemplary programme it was, as each piece was both short and under-
                            stood by the pupils ; it was evident they were not merely repeating by
                            heart, but that pains had bean taken to make the children understand the
                            meaning of what they were saying. It is needless almost to add that the
                            pupils acquitted themselves with great distinc- tion, and their
                            appearance and their work reflect the greatest credit upon Mr. Buchanan
                            had his staff, a credit that is all the greater as we are given to
                            understand that, owing to circumstances beyond the control of the ma-
                            nagement, the school has been understaffed for some time. We hear that
                            this defect will be remedied in October, when the school re-opens; MrT
                            William Thom having been appointed to the place of Mr. James Gordon, who
                            was transferred to Beyrout After the programme had been submitted, a
                            table literally groaning with prizes was lifted to the platform, and
                            these were kindly presented to the boys by Mrs. H.P. Reid. The dux of
                            the school was L. Rosenberg, who, in addition to five book prizes,
                            carried off: the silver medal given by Major Allan,of Glasgow, for
                            Scripture knowledge. The medallist for painting was George Potins, and
                            the other Scripture medallist was L. Loulloup. The other chief
                            prizetakers were Frances Burigans, Giacomo Benveniste, and Rinaldo
                            Benveniste. The whole proceedings were carried through in less than two
                            hours, and the management are to be heartily con- gratulated upon it At
                            the close Mr. Buchanan invited the audience to pass into one of the
                            rooms in the school to inspect the work of the pupils, and from this one
                            could understand what an infinite amount of pains and care are taken in
                            the education of the children.</p>

                    <head>NEW HARBOUR WORKS. DESCRIPTION OF IMPROVEMENTS.</head>
                    <p>The new pass into the harbour, which is now being dredged to a depth of 37
                        feet by the St Lawrence, will be 600 feet in breadth, and something over
                        half a mile in length. It will pass quite close to the wreck of the Cairo
                        and bears on the light near Mex at an angle of 61°E.</p>
                    <p>It is hoped that the new pass will be ready for steamer traffic in two years’
                        time ; about 1,000 feet by 200 have been dredged so far, and the sand and
                        silt brought up are being dropped to the south of the breakwater. The reason
                        for this is the necessity of facilitating the prolongation of the
                        breakwater, Which will be carried on for some 800 yards to within a short
                        distance of the red gas buoy.</p>
                    <p>A new breakwater is to be earned out from the abattoir mole which is now
                        under con- struction. This mole will form a harbour where vessels of deep
                        draught carrying cattle can accost at the side of the quay, and the cattle
                        can be driven over gangways straight to the abattoir, while the profungating
                        of the mole for some 200 yards will screen the port from N.-westerly gales
                        much more effectually than has hitherto been possible.</p>
                    <p>Altogether about L.R. 120,000 is to be spent on the new moles and nearly
                        £100,000 on dredging in the near future, but these sums do not exhaust the
                        list of credits voted for har- bour improvements. Beyond the abattoir six
                        now timber quays are to be commenced in the quarantine anehotegh, and a line
                        Of railway carried from'thèsé quays to Gabbari. The old port of Omsk Kabebe
                        is to be levelled, the shallows between the site of the proposed quays and
                        the shore reclaimed, and more quays will probably be taken in hand after the
                        completion of the first six.</p>
                    <p>The coal quay is to be widened, and the present “bottle neck,” where half a
                        dozen lines of rails cross in bewildering confusion, will be at least
                        trebled in breadth by reclama- tion on the S.W. ride of the quay. Five new
                        quay berths are also to be constructed on the same side of the coal quay
                        beyond the "bottle neck.”</p>
                    <p>Finally, Quay “K” is to be prolonged and widened, so as to close the southern
                        entrance into the careening basin, the isolated mole opposite being in part
                        joined to it and in part removed, so as to allow vessels entering the
                        Arsenal basin to enter the careening basin with the minimum of difficulty.
                        To effect this the N.E. end of this isolated mole, which commences opposite
                        the Khediviad Mail S.S. Company’s berth, is to be done away with. About
                        £8,000 is to be spent on this and on the widening of Quay “K,” while about
                        £180,000 has been allowed for the construc- tion of the six timber quays off
                        the quarantine anchorage.</p>

                    <p>A very enjoyable afternoon was spent yesterday at Mustapha barracks, when the
                        2nd Battalion Royal Berkshire Regiment held their annual athletic sports on
                        the anniversary of the battle of Maiwand, where the regiment displayed such
                        conspicuous bravery. The events were varied and amusing, and the proceedings
                        were only finished at 6.45 p.m., when Mrs. Cave gave away the prizes.</p>
                    <p>Amongst those present we noticed Mr. and Mrs. Mansfield de C. Findlay,

                    <p>The Khedivial S.S. Assouan, which left Beyrout on Tuesday, has been the scene
                        of a daring and ingenious theft. After leaving Jaffa on Wednesday evening,
                        the steward discovered that the strong-room of the vessel had been forced
                        and that £1,000 in gold and specie had disappeared. It was remarked
                        afterwards that a first-class passenger, believed to be a European, who had
                        embarked at Beyrout and booked a passage for Egypt, had disappeared at Port
                        Said, where he went ashore with many other passengers, leaving behind all,
                        or almost all, his personal effects.</p>
                    <p>As soon as the theft was discovered careful inquires were made on board and
                        the captain communicated with the Egyptian police autho- rities.</p>
                    <p>When the Assouan arrived in harbour this morning, she was boarded by Mr.
                        Freeman, H.B.M.’s Vice-Consul, and the secret police. We are assured that
                        the steward of the Assouan, on being shown a photograph by the police,
                        recognised the missing first class pas- senger, in spite of the fact that
                        the suspect, While on board, wore bandages which partly concealed his face,
                        as,if he had sustained some disfiguring injury.</p>
                    <p>The police confidently expect to be able to lay hands on the supposed thief
                        within a very short time.</p>

                    <p>Akhmim, July 96. Thé omdeh of El Awama reported to the Markas authorities
                        here yesterday that a murder had taken place in his village. The mamour el
                        markaz, Mohamed Effendi Fehmy, went to the spot and learned that the sheikh
                        of the ghaffirs met a fellah who had just stolen a sheep and questioned him
                        as to how he came by the animal. The father of the thief then same up and
                        threatened to shoot the sheikh it he did not leave his son alone and then,
                        in spite of the entreaties of a bystander, fired point blank at the
                        unfortunate man and killed him. The culprit has been arrested.</p>
                    <p>Abdallah Bey Wahby who replaced Hussein Bey Wassif of the Irrigation

                        Ottoman Bank, which has occurred at Castlebar, County Mayo, Ireland. Mr. and
                        Mrs. MacLoughlin were only married in September last. After spending the
                        winter with her husband in Cairo Mrs. MacLoughlin went to Castlebar to spend
                        the summer there, and about a fortnight ago gave birth to a daughter. The
                        many friends of Mr. MacLoughlin will sympathise most deeply with him in his

                    <p>ENGLAND, GERMANY AND TURKEY IN THE NEAR EAST.</p>
                    <p>BY WILHELM MEISTER. Translated</p>
                    <p>II.-(Continued from July 25). We must now take note of the forces that are
                        capable of preventing the fulfilment of such a scheme. Dangerous yesterday
                        and irresistible to-morrow, whether considered in- dividually and
                        collectively, for the moment they constitute the mere unsubstantial shadow
                        of an obstacle and may almost be said to favor decisive action on the part
                        of Great Britain. These forces are five in number, bach of which represents
                        a European Power, and first and foremost we must consider Turkey, as the
                        Power most interested. Then come Germany, Russia, France, and Italy. At the
                        present mo- meant the two last-named elements would greet either of the
                        solutions— Occupation or Neutral- isation—with satisfaction. The remaining
                        powers could effect nothing by their own re- sources, as I propose to
                        demonstrate.</p>
                    <p>First let us take Turkey and consider what resistance she could offer to the
                        amputation of Syria from her political organism. In the pre- sent incomplete
                        condition of the Syrian railway system, not yet linked with Diarbekir and
                        the great central trunk line, the idea of an offensive movement against
                        Egypt is chimerical, and the Turks, in case of war, would be hard put to it
                        to make head against the Christian popula- tion of the mountains, openly
                        revolting and found in arms and munitions of war by the masters of the
                        seas.</p>
                    <p>The sea-routes,till now used by the Ottoman Government in the suppression of
                        all revolu- tionary or separatist movements in the distant provinces of the
                        Empire, by which it is now dispatching soldiers to the Yemen, and which
                        enabled it six years ago to transport forces against the Druses of the
                        Hauran, would be closed in case of war with a naval Power, and it is
                        difficult to see how the communications between Syria and Asia Minor could
                        be main- tained in default of roads and railways, or practicable passes
                        through the formidable carrier of the Taurus and its Eastern gorges.</p>
                    <p>Assuming that the present garrison of Syria composed of the forces quartered
                        in the districts of Damascus and Aleppo would suffice if aided by a corps of
                        Redifs raised in the province, for in offensive movement to the south, how
                        could the provisioning and the supply of these forces be assured? The
                        Ottoman soldier can exist on the scantiest nations, but his rifles require
                        as many cartridges, and his field guns as many shells, as those of other
                        nations. An officer of the Turkish General Staff stationed at Da- mascus
                        informed the writer, whom he met at Djevad Pashe’s house and with whom he
                        became intimate, this in spite of all efforts the military reforms could not
                        be properly applied in Syria till their first article had been carried out,
                        and the first article and condition of the reform scheme is the construction
                        of a complete railway system in Syria, Mesopotamia, and Asia Minor. For the
                        moment the Syrian Corps d’Armée, in spite of the ability of their com-
                        manding officer, are armies in the rough, and brave and soldierly as is the
                        human material of these forces, they lack, and must lack, till the military
                        reforms are finally carried out, the immense extrinsic value conferred by
                        modern armament and organisation</p>
                    <p>This being the case it is hard to see how the above mentioned forces, the
                        Nizam of Aleppo and Damascus and the Redifs of Syria, could undertake an
                        offensive campaign against Egypt, before the completion of the strategic
                        railways and advance through desolate or mountainous regions while their
                        communications were harassed by the Christians and Druses of the Lebanon and
                        the Hauran, and their rear was threatened by the menace of a disembarkation
                        of an expedition dispatched after the begin- ning of the war from England or
                        Idia. The offensive being therefore a physical impos- suability, we have to
                        consider what rule these forces could play on the defensive. Anyone who
                        knows the coast strip that formed the Phoenicia of the ancients, its people
                        and their history, will be ready enough to admit that from the opening of
                        hostilities, that is, at the first gleam bringing a hope, however distant,
                        of freedom from a detested yoke, these people, whose narrow and rugged home
                        borders the sea for its whole length, would instantly im- provide forces and
                        take the field against the Turks under British officers. The mountainous
                        ridge of the Lebanon would be fortified on both tis flanks, on the west or
                        maritime side, to aid the warships to prevent any movement of the enemy
                        along the coast road, and on the eastern side, which commands the depression
                        of the B’aka or Coele-Syria, to aid the guerrillas of the hills to check any
                        movement along the plain below them. The defending forces stationed on the
                        coast between Tripoli and Tyre would be condemned to inaction — or
                        extermination. Those echeloned in the Coelesyrian depres- sion would be
                        exposed to constant guerilla attacks and virtually isolated from their base.
                        These fractions, representing a good third of the central forces, and the
                        central force itself, its effective strength reduced, deprived of
                        ammunitions and of a proper transport service, would have no other
                        alternative but to cling to their cantonments and waste away there or to
                        dash themselves in reckless assaults upon the artillery that would guard the
                        passes of the unsurveyed and dangerous mountain barrier, in whose dangerous
                        clefts and am- bushes many an army has been swallowed up.</p>

                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette. Dear Sir - Some years ago the
                            Krupp firm had a contract with the Egyptian Government at a little over
                            half the coat of supplying the same quality of rails to their own
                            government. In Germany rails were delivered by Krupp’s factory to the
                            german Government at about $9 per ton, the government paying all trans-
                            port charges. The same firm supplied the Egyptian Government with rails
                            at about $5 a ton, franco to Gabbari, paying every penny for freights,
                            transport, unloading, etc. Surely this startling difference in the
                            prices is entirely due to the imposition of a protective tariff, as the
                            Krupp firm has nothing to fear in Ger- many from foreign competition in
                            Egypt or elsewhere at excessively low prices.</p>

                        <head>A BATHING NUISANCE.</head>
                        <p>To the editor of the Egyptian Gazette. Dear Editor,- I should like to
                            bring the following to your notice. I live at Halte 1, Ramleh, ad have
                            hired a bathing box for the season down at a small bay near a Coastguard
                            station immediately behind this station. I had the intention of bathing
                            there most after- noons but unfortunately I am hindered from so doing by
                            the following most revolting circumstances. Every afternoon about ten
                            Arab families congregate there and bathe, the children naked, the
                            mothers can boast of some little clothing which is hardly a shade better
                            than nothing, they leave their clothes and babies lying over the beach
                            where space is very limited, and they are very unclean in their habits,
                            consequently the beach is pervaded by most unpleasant odours.</p>
                        <p>A low class of Europeans also frequent this same small bay ; they undress
                            promiscuously on the beach, on the rocks and behind the bathing boxes.
                            Is this right? Should not the owners of the bathing boxes be considered,
                            who pay rent or hire for the erection of the You will understand how
                            limited space is when I tell you that there is only room for six boxes,
                            including my own. These people, besides crowding us out, make use of our
                            boxes to undress themselves behind them and to screen their uncleanness.
                            What is Egypt doing to allow this filthy state of affairs? I hear
                            complaints from many that the coast from Ibrahimieh to San Stefano and
                            beyond is made unbearable for the respectable European residents. No
                            decent woman can at any time of the afternoon walk along the shore
                            without being insulted and seeing indecent sights. Egypt is no doubt
                            improving for the Egyptians, but the Egyptians are not improving it.
                            Among the many things that lord Cromer is having taught to the Egyptians
                            might it not be advisable to include decency !!! A. Mermaid. Hate 1,
