                        requires the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is quickly and
                        easily applied with a whitewash brush, with half the labour and at one third
                        the cost of paint. HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures cleanliness, and is pleasing to
                        the eye. It appeals alike to artistic and practical house decoration.</p>
                    <p>HALL’S DISTEMPER is of special value in hot climates. Owing to its cool,
                        pleasing colours, great weather-resisting and germ-destroying properties, it
                        lends itself to every kind of wall, wood, brick or stone coating, possessing
                        all the advantages of paint, colour- wash, and disinfectant at one third the
                        cost of oil paint. It never blisters in the hottest sun, and the fact that
                        it can be washed adds greatly to its sanitary advantages.</p>

                    <dateline>London, June 28. </dateline>
                    <p>Lloyd's reports from Odessa that all work in the port is stopped. The crew of
                        a battleship in tho roads has mutinied and murdered the officers It is
                        reported that they threatened to bombard the town. (Later). The battleship
                        was the "Knyaz Potemkin Tavritcheski." The mutiny was due to the commander
                        having caused a sailor to be shot for presenting a petition of the crew for
                        Better food. The crew thereupon attacked the officers, and it is reported
                        that they murdered several. In the morning the sailors bore their comrade's
                        body ashore, where a bareheaded crowd of strikers and others viewed the
                        corpse, amidst general interest and excitement The police and Cossacks
                        attempted to disperse the crowd, which resisted, and some fighting en- sued.
                        The affair has greatly aggravated the situation caused by the strike.
                        Frequent colli- sions are taking place between the strikers and the troops.
                        A workman threw a bomb at a policeman, and both were killed by the
                        explosion. (Reuter.)</p>

                        the latter cannot limit the questions to be discuss- ed at it, yet displays
                        a disposition to utilize the Moroccan dummy later on for the purpose of

                        and spa nous staircase and corridors make the house an ideal one for

                    <p>In our issue of yesterday we gave a short account of the prize distribution
                        by El Miralai Matchett Boy to the cadets of the Military School, Abbassieh,
                        and we now give farther details with a list of prizes and the names of those
                        who have been granted commissions. Mr. Brian, senior master, read his report
                        on tho year s work in which he remarks that he considers the present
                        standard of tire school to be distinctly below the average, and that neither
                        could ho consider the results of the recent examination to be altogether
                        satisfac- tory The fault however, does not lie with either the instructors
                        of the school or the pupils themselves, but is due, Mr. Brian point- ed out,
                        to the contiuoed demand for officers, which compelled them to commission men
                        who had only gone through a two-years' course of instruction, whereas they
                        should spend three or even four years at the school before they could be
                        considered to be really ready tor a commission. Out of the 84 cadets at
                        present on the school's lists only 24 had been present at last June’s
                        examination, and all of these, with only one exception, were in the 3rd and
                        4th classes It was from these 24 that it had been found necessary to form
                        the N.C.O.'s class in January la»i Out of the 32 cadets of the first class
                        24 had only joined last October, and the remaining 8 of these had joined
                        less than six months ago. Mr. Plunkett, in presenting his report on the
                        outdoor work it the school (football, athletic sports, eta), remarked that
                        he consi- dered that the work done in this department towards the physical
                        training of the cadets was fairly satisfactory, hut less time had been
                        devoted to it, so that here, too, a certain falling-off was unavoidable. He
                        suggested that in future years the athletic sports should be held in April
                        as they had been this year, as he considered it preferable to holding them
                        in March, as had been done in previous years. El Miralai Matchett Bey,
                        Commandant, after distributing the prizes to the successful candidates, gave
                        a short address to the cadets. He greatly regretted the absence of their Ex-
                        cellencies the Minister of War and the Sirdar, but the time of year at which
                        the distribution took place rendered their attendance impossible. He was
                        p.ui-ed to be able to express himself as satisfied with the work which had
                        been done by them and with the general tone of the school, and he was also
                        glad to learn from the report of the chief medical officer that the health
                        of the cadets was good. He agreed with Mr. Brian that the standard of the
                        school was below that of former years, and said that it was his intention to
                        remark in his confiden- tial reports on those who were to receive com-
                        missions that he considered that in some cases they were hardly qualified to
                        fulfil the duties of officers owing to an insufficient period of time having
                        been devoted to their training. He trusted, however, that the continual de-
                        mand upon tho school for officers would soon cease and that they would then
                        be able to reattain their previous high standard, as the cadets would thus
                        be enabled to spend a mini- mum period of three years in the school, which
                        was necessary for the sound and thorough training in tho various branches of
                        work with which an officer must be acquainted. It was then announced that
                        H.H. the Khe- div had been most graciously pleased to confer commissions on
                        the following :—Moha- n,ed Harden, Cavalry. Ahmed Atieh, Artillery; Ahmed

                    <byline>BY W.M.</byline>

                    <head>THE DANGER.</head>
                    <p>The political shortsightedness that seems to afflict the English people—which
                        bears a repu- tation second to none for a clear and precise comprehension of
                        the practicable—at certain moments in its career, and notably, when
                        confronted with that critical phase in its history, the outlines of which we
                        propose to trace, is one of the most remarkable pheno- mena of contemporary
                        history. Springing from the union of carelessness and inattentiveness, and
                        from a combination of morbid causes and 1 effects, this political myopia
                        grows more and more serious. What oan be stranger or more meloncholy than
                        the torpor into which "watch- ful" Britain appears to be sinking when faced
                        by the danger that menaces her from every . quarter of the horizon, a danger
                        ubiquitous and manifold, that may sot aim at the heart of the empire which
                        is guarded by the seas but none the lees threatens to lop its members in
                        Africa end Asia and to sever its arteries 1 Germany prepares for the Titanic
                        struggle of Empires that draws rapidly nearer, and with a science and
                        sagacity only equalled by her foresight, testa and examines every point in ,
                        the world wide armour of the British Empire; . and like Prussia before Sedan
                        or Japan before Mukden she calculates and prepares die decisive blow.
                        Meantime England, who recog- nises the imminence of the stroke as thoroughly
                        ' as her rival, concentratas her attention on her rival and nothing else and
                        falls asleep again as thoroughly satisfied that her head is safe as the
                        proverbial ostrich, and as 1 careless of the rest The British refuse to !
                        recognise that they are still exposed, that there are one or two points
                        where an ! suomy’s blow will one day fall, points where the essential parts
                        of the Empire may be separated from its brain-centre and the whole body
                        brought to ruin by their separa- tion. They will learn too late that their
                        terri- ble armada will be of little value in the day of battle against the
                        foresight and calculation of her opponent, whose armed forces will, that '
                        day, move unhindered against the British 1 Empire—on land. It is strange and
                        almost stupefying to note, the one-sidedness and superficiality of the poli
                        tixal apperception of this people of sailors who seem incapable of realising
                        that Germany, the 00 on try of thinkers and calculators par excel Lence, is
                        doing her best to bring her continental strength to bear on her foe should
                        England check the complete development of her strength ' on blue water. It
                        is obvious that in case of war she would keep her fleet in Kiel harbour or
                        up the channels, which no longer fear the menace of the White Ensign based
                        on Heligo- land—the "Nasenklemmer" of the Elbe—and would sow every channel,
                        every strait and sea- pass from Wilhelmshaven to the Belt and from the Belt
                        to the Konigsberg with the submarine mines—sleeping but vigilant—to whose
                        terrible power the Russo-Japanese war bears witness, while her torpedo
                        flotillas and submarines would emerge from the Jahde and the Bins, from all
                        the havens and creeks of the North Sea and the Baltic, to harass the hostile
                        fleets. But can one even speak of coast attack by fleets pitted alone
                        against forts and mines after the lessons taught by the Eastern war and the
                        Port Arthur campaign ! What fleet, ware it four times as strong as the
                        combined squadrons of Britain, would dare assail unsupported the coasts of
                        the North Sea or the entrance to the Baltic defended by all the organised
                        might of German genius It The German Fleet once secures in its inacces sible
                        havens, what part is the British Navy to play I It must confine itself to
                        the observation of the German coast and to attacks on German commerce,—a
                        species of warfare that is unlikely to be attended by much glory or profit.
                        Its results would be practically nil. The German merchant fleet would lie
                        quietly immobilised in home or neutral ports while Gorman commerce would
                        still be carried on under over of a transfer to a neutral flag on every
                        ocean. And while England waits unable to grapple with her elusive foe the
                        main strength of Germany, her continental strength, will come into play
                        perhaps without the employment it a single Pomeranian Grenadier, against the
                        crack in Britain's armour whicb it will pierce like a wedge. It is with this
                        end in view that Germany has concluded tacit agreements and has—so to
                        say—added new members to her Empire to which she is communicating her stark
                        efficiency. At the given moment she will have but to im- press the given
                        movement on these new wheels of her military machine and they will tarn
                        irresistibly to fulfil her imperial designs. It is the erstwhile "Sick Man"
                        of Europe rescued in his many death agonies by Eng land’s active
                        intervention, who trill be the prin- cipal weapon, the steel wedge driven
                        home by German hands into the gaps of England's weakened armour. Slowly,
                        insidiously and steadily Wilhelm II. has slipped through the doors of the
                        sublime Porte left open by his rival enthusiastically bound for the Talley
                        it the Nile. Bash English step in retreat was balanced by a German stop in
                        advance, while the Kaiser's policy was marked throughout by consummate
                        ingenuity and amazing discretion and tact. When England after Omdurman,
                        showed her- self vanquished by the attractions of the Dark Continent, the
                        last trace of Turkish sympathy or confidence in her policy disappeared while
                        England, logically pursuing her policy of expansion in African and in
                        Mussulman — territories did not hesitate to meet the surly resentment of the
                        'Turk with defiance on the Aden frontier and in the Arabian wastes. : Then
                        it was that Wilhemll. went in person seal his pact with the shades of
                        Ertoghrahl and Saladin. For eight years his diplomatists had prepared the
                        completion and his officers had ensured the utility of the treaty. Deaf to
                        the appeals of humanity horror-stricken by heca- tombs of slaughtered
                        Armenians, blind to the stain on tho escutcheon of the German Empire, he had
                        eyes only for tho end of his polioy, the creation of an Oamanli army that
                        could serve his ambition. Already imperfectly reorganised by the great
                        Moltke, the Turkish military organisation had gone to rest again, and had
                        become an antiquated machine jarring and creaking with every movement But
                        Moltke's work was taken in hand ones more, this time with greater rigour,
                        science, and continuity, and above all with greater freedom, greater
                        secrecy, and a fuller apprecia- tion of the military material of the Ottoman
                        Empire. Sober, teachable, sturdy, healthy, fanatical with the desperation of
                        those who have all to lose, the Turkish troops possess •very factor of brute
                        force and only need the coefficients of scientific leadership and organi-
                        sation to fulfil all the conditions imposed by modern war. In the few years
                        in which Germany has applied herself to satisfy this head all has bean
                        renewed and reforged : the military law, the general staff, commissariat,
                        communications, armament, fortifications, all have been remodelled by
                        Germans after the German methods. In the midst of an unpro- gressive Empire
                        towers one great monument of Progress—a new Tarldsh Army—and a part of
                        Germany’s armed strength. Under the old organisation—or want of
                        organisation—what was most utterly lacking and most urgently demanded by the
                        military reformer was a system of mobilisation and con- centration dependent
                        on strategic railway* Under the pretext or economic or religions needs Abdnl
                        Hamid II. brought them into being. In every province of his empire rail- way
                        construction began, confided to German or at least to Continental companies,
                        or carried out at the expense of the Government —as in the case of the
                        Hedjaz line—and the dames of the concessions in all that referred to traffic
                        or construction were drawn op by the Turoo-German General Staff. Chemin de
                        for" spells "chemin de guerre" in the Ottoman Empire and the most
                        insignificant branch lines have their value as means of concentration and
                        helpers in the scheme of attack. In a series of articles appearing in the
                        "Egyptian Gazette" it has been shown dearly enough (to those who read
                        between the lines) that the Hedjaz Railway is before everything, not a line
                        destined to serve the religious inter- ests of Islam—as our credulous
                        Moslems of Egypt vainly believe—but a purely military railway built to link
                        the outlying provinces of the Arab world with the Turkish centre, to conjure
                        thoughts of autonomy or independ- ance in the turbulent provinces of the
                        Hedjaz, Aar, and Yemen, and to preserve the Black stone of the Kaaba in the
                        jewelled diadem of the Imam of lstamboul.</p>

                        July to ratify the agreement entered into with the Credit Foncier Egyptien.
                        By the terms of the contract the latter bays or takes over all the outstand
                        ing debts of the Daira Sanieh Company, amounting to some eight millions
                        sterling, by the purchases of its lands payable by annual installments
                        extending over a certain fixed period. The Credit Ponoier will, on its side,
                        charge interest at the rate of 5 per cent per annum upon all sums repayable
                        in fifteen years; and in order to refund the £8,000,000 still due to the
                        company an arrangement has been arrived at whereby the Credit Foncier will
                        augment its capital by a further issue of debentures or shares. The balance
                        has been offered to be foind for the latter by a group, with Sir Ernest
                        Caasel at its head, in Paris and London at 3 % annual interest plus
                        commission, besides dividing between the group and the Credit Foncier the 1
                        % represent- ing the difference between the rate of interest and commission
                        of 4 % for the money to be advanced, and the 5 % annual interest charged by
                        the latter, on sums repayable in 15 years, the higher rate of 5 % for
                        repayments extending over 20 years not being taken into account in the

                    <head>THE MOROCCAN CRISIS.</head>
                    <p> "Times." The analysis of tho French Note on the Moroooo question which onr
                        Paris Corres- pondent sends os to-day shout that the French Government have
                        taken np a very clear and straightforward attitude on the subject of the
                        proposed conference..................... She will not be a party to a
                        conference with ,uch unlimited powers as the vague language of the Sultan's
                        invitation might oover and was doubtless designed to cover. She has entered
                        into agreements with this oountry and with Spain in regard to the
                        introduction of reforms in Morocco, and before she takes part in a
                        conference she wants some guarantee that it will not bo asked to arrogate to
                        itself a right of revising those arrangements. As tho "Temps'' observes,
                        when people negotiate in good faith they must speak clearly.•'France is
                        negotiating in good faith, and accordingly she begins by an honest endeavour
                        to solve that ditiiculty with Germany which is the only solid obstacle to a
                        satisfactory settlement of the whole Moroooo question.</p>
                    <p>“Morni.no Post." In the matter of national organisation and training Germany
                        has drifted into a position of pro-eminence on the European Continent such
                        as was hold at the close of the 16th cen- tury by Spain, and at the close of
                        the 17th and again of the lath century by France. Each of those Powers in
                        turn sought to sup plement its great Continental position by crushing
                        England. German policy seems to be moving on closely analogous lines, and
                        our duty is, regardless of the misrepresentations of our viows which may be
                        given to the German public, to warn our countrymen, while there is time,
                        that it Great Britain is to preserve her independence, to say nothing of her
                        Empire, she most prepare for a renewal in more diffi- cult conditions of the
                        struggles which ended the 16th, tho 17th, and the 18th centuries.</p>
                    <p>“Daily News.” If France made a mistake at the beginning in not acquainting
                        Germany with the Anglo- French agree, .int, the has abundantly repair- ed
                        the oversight M. Delcasse has disappear ed as tho result of his attitade,
                        and Franoe has adopted an entirely conciliatory tone. Nor mast it be
                        forgotten that Germany’s action in the matter leaves something to be
                        defended. Sha'did not protest when she should have protested— that is, when
                        the incident which wounded hor pride occurred—but a year later, when the
                        course of events in the Far East had entirely altered the position of
                        Franoe. If a sinister motive is not to be attributed to this fact, it will
                        be necessary for Germany now to give the world some proof that she does not
                        desire to keep the difficulty open any more than France
                        ............................ It is certainly desirable that the work of
                        keeping the peace should be delegated to some- one, and Germany as well as
                        the rest of Burope would profit from a regenerated commerce. Germuny has won
                        a legitimate snooess so far in enforcing her title to be considered. It re-
                        mains now for her tJ show that it is not merely success in this affair that
                        she desires ; but a certain thundery atmosphere ;—not good rela- tions with
                        Franoe, bat strained relations.</p>
                    <p>“Chronicle” There is no necessary quarrel between the Germans and the English
                        unless we hold it wrong for Germany to do that which we have done for a
                        thousand years. In the memory of living people the German boy has become a
                        man and is now a giant While there is no reason why Englishmen should fear
                        this giant, there is every reason for trying to nnderatand</p>
                    <p>“Globe” We must make it clear both to France and to tho Sultan, who will
                        communicate it to his Royal Brother and Friend the Kaiser, that ia no
                        circumstances will the conference be permitted to discuss the provisions of
                        the Anglo-Prencb entente. If Moroooo, why not «Opt l We do not desire to
                        wake up some fins morning and discover that the German Ea*le has taken the
                        Khedive nnder his wing, tod in proposing an Egyptian conference based on the
                        “status qno ante" Tel el-Kebir.</p>
                    <p>“Temps." When people negotiate without arriire l-n-r they must speak dearly
                        and not in- dulge in verbiage. Morocco invited the Powers to a conference.
                        That is all right; bet Mo- rocco acted at the instigation of Germany. If it
                        were to be urged that Germany is fort oo thing in it, that we most wait for
                        the con- j ferenceand let things take their ooorre, it would not be sinoere.
                        Id this whole affair there is a Franco-German difficulty and nothing •he. It
                        is consequently logical and salutary first of all to solve that difficulty.
                        . . . Ger- man diplomacy has affirmed its desire to apply a really
                        conciliatory spirit in the negotiations opened by M. Ronrier. The moment is
                        at band wbc? ebf ‘will have the opportunity o j suiting her actions to her
                        words. Franoe Iras taken a first step, it now behoves Germany to
                        reciprocate. Tho note oommnnioated yesterday weighs in the scales to the
                        advantage of France. For the first time sinoe pourparUn begau they have an
                        opportunity of soeing in Berlin that the friendly assurances given whon thoy
                        began were not vain assurances. That consideration, which is not of less
                        importance for the fnturo of Franoo-German relations than for tho settlement
                        of the Moroocan affair, will not escape the perspicacity of tho Gorman
                        Chancellery.</p>
                    <p>“Aurork.” M. Clemenoean obierves in the "Aurora" that "France :md England can
                        go to the oonfo- ronoe only on condition of not having traps laid for them
                        at every step. That ia why M. Rouvier is quite right to ask Germany to be eh
                        good as to dofine the questions for discussion. For whatever reason it may
                        be, Germany is not particularly disposed to throw light on the sub- ject.
                        She encumbers her reply with considera- tions which would seom to be
                        iutendod merely to complicate the problem and increase the difficulties. It
                        may be disagreeable for her to analyso ber frame of mind on paper. It is
                        groatly to our interest to obtain from bor an unchangeable text whereby we
                        can ascertain exactly what ber arguments are and in the precise form which
                        she must be in a position to give them. When the two documents can bo
                        compared, then will begin tho difficult but decisive part of the
                        negotiation.”</p>
                    <p>“Prtit Parisien," The "Potit Parisien'' announces that Lord Lansdowne assured
                        M. Gambon of the complete identity of the views of the British Government
                        with those expressed in M. Ronvier's Note.</p>
                    <p>“Lokalanzeiger" (Berlin) The numeroas advantages which France, even if a
                        conference were held, wishos to re- serve for herself hardly accord with the
                        Sultan of Morooco's absolutely negative attitude towards the French reform
                        proposals, and therefore unless M. Ronvior changes his mind Germany will
                        have to be careful to safeguard her interests by continuing direct

                    <head>A STANDARD TIME FOR INDIA.</head>
                    <p> After much correspondence with oommeroial bodies and other representative
                        organisations, the Government of India have ordered the introduction of a
                        standard time, with effeot from July l\n the railways (other than small
                        local lines, where the change might be incon- venient) and in all telegraph
                        offioes in the country, and also in Burma. The local timo in the Peninaola
                        varies considerably. At II o'clock noon, Greenwich mean time, it ia 4.51 p
                        in. in Bombay,5.21 in Madraa,and 5.53'in Cal- cutta. On most of the Indian
                        railways the ■confusion inseparable from frequent changes of time tone baa
                        been avoided by the adoption of Madras time. The standard now to be
                        introduced is nine minutes in advance of the "railway time," as it is called
                        in all parts of India, and is thus 5} hours in advance of Greenwich, being
                        the local time of the 82.30 degree of longitude- The standard for Burma is
                        to be exactly an hoar earlier—viz., 6} hoars in advance of Greenwich and
                        five minutes earlier than Rangoon local time. In inland plaoes it has been
                        found convenient to generally follow railway time bnt the great seaports of
                        Calcutta, Bombay, and Karachi have followed the local time of their res-
                        pective longitudes. The Government of India do not prescribe the new
                        standard for these and other places following local time, as jt is deemed
                        desirable to leave the ultimate decision to local opinion. Bat it is
                        intimated that, if a general desire to adopt the new standard is evidenced.
                        Government will be prepared to support the change and to tro- opers te in
                        bringing it about. In all probability, therefore, there will, ere long, be a
                        uniform time throughout India exactly 54 hoars in advance of Greenwich,
                        while that of Burma will be 6j hoars in advance.</p>

                        a sickly apostle of the “precious:" Lord Kitchener puts what he has to say
                        in the simplest words and sen ten oea, and the manner is as potent as the

                        how Kitchener does it and how the Bntler Com- mitte ought to have done it.

                    <p>The first class battleship “Hibernia" was succesfully launched at Devonport
                        on the 17th inst. in the presenoe of a large and fashionable assembly. The
                        christening ceremony was gracefully performed by the Marchioness of Ormonde.
                        The "Hibernia” ia of the “King Edward VII.” class, from the designs of Sir
                        W. H. White, late Assistant Controller of the Navy and Director of Naval
                        Constrootion. The other Bhipe of the type now building or com- pleted are —

                        monwealth." The “Hibernia" measures 425 feet on the water line, with a beam
                        of 78 feet, a draught of 26 feet 9 inches, and a load displacement of 16,350
                        tons. Her 18,000 h.p. engines, by Harland and Wolff, Belfast, it is expected
                        will give her a speed of 18.5 knots per hour (oontract). The armament will
                        include four 12 inch 60-ton wire-wound guns — so sharply criticised lately —
                        mounted in pairs in hooded barbettes, ioor 9.2 guns, one on each corner of

                    <p> King Oscar’s speoch to the 8wediah Riksdag is in every respect worthy of a
                        constitutional Monarch. His Majesty repels, with all the dignity of absolute
                        sincerity, the oharge that he has, by a breach of the Constitution on his
                        part, given cause for the step which his Nor- wegian subjects have seen fit
                        to take. He be- lieves that the Union is “important for the safety of the
                        Scandinavian nation," and be regards the action of the Storthing as an
                        encroachment on his own rights. Neverthe- less, “it is not intended to repel
                        injustice by force,” and the King oonaenta to the recom- mendation of the
                        Government that powers be obtained from tho Riksdag to arrange the matter
                        with the Norwegian Storthing. This is a consent whioh does honor to his
                        Majesty, although it is one which has. been neither sought nor given without
                        deep emotion. Nor way being irrevocably bent upon separation, she oonld only
                        be prevented from having her way by the compulsion of ^fratricidal strug-
                        gle. There will bo no sooh calamity ; but, for the foot that there will not,
                        both Norway and Sweden have largely to thank the vener- able Sovereign.</p>

                    <p> Like England, Italy is much occupied with the project of oolonial
                        cotton-growing. The manufacturers of Northern Italy some time ago began to
                        organise ootton-planting experi- ments in Brythrea, and these have resulted
                        so well that the question as to whether or not Erythrea may be regarded as a
                        profitable ootton-growing oountry has been permanently decided in the
                        affirmative. Meantime the ex- ports of the oolony oontinue to grow steadily.
                        MANUFACTURERS TAKE THOUGHT. Odb of the best pieces of oommoroial news that
                        has been published for "an eternity or two" is the announcement that a
                        Manufac- turers’ Association for Great Britain is at last really in oonrse
                        of formation. It will be model- led on the lines of the associations which
                        assist business enterprise in Canada and the United States, and will set
                        itself a number of osefol objects. One of them—perhaps the most im-
                        mediately practical and prospectively advan- tageous of the lot—ia the
                        appointment of cor- respondents in all parts of the world to report on
                        openings for trade and on local changes and conditions. If the British
                        manufacturer will read, mark, and learn the teachings of sooh reports, his
                        reproach will be oleaxed away. For he will no longer persist in sending
                        goods of a particular pattern into plaoes which urgently require another
                        pattern and will be oontent with none other. The association sbonld have
                        been founded years ago, bnt it is not yet too late for it to have an immense

                    <head>ITALY AND HER NAVY.</head>
                    <p> The Government of Signor Fortis has won a remarkable victory in the Italian
                        Chamber, on the question of the augmenta- tion of the Navy. Admiral
                        Mirabello had proved the neceasity of following the example of the English
                        Admiralty, and Hi«ra»wt;ng 0i,j and worthless ships, and replacing them by
                        modern vessels. This, of oonrse, meant the expenditure of large sums of
                        money, and tho Finanoe Minister declared that the flourish- ing state of the
                        finances would enable him to provide the necessary funds. 8ignor Fortis, for
                        his part, annonnoed his intention ofdfr voting the surplus to the better
                        protection of the oountry, and though the augmentation of the Navy was
                        violently opposed by the Socialists and the Extreme Left, a vote of
                        confidence in the Ministry was carried by two hundred and aeveaty-two votes
                        to eighty- five. This is largely in excess of the usual Government majority,
                        and it is particularly satisfactory, as it shows that when the safety ot the
                        oountry ia involved, all but -the Socialists will unite to strengthen the
                        hands of a Ministry with which they do not see eye to eye in most matters.
                        The Deputies realise that Italy is in a very peculiar and embar- rassing
                        position. She ia a Mediterranean Power, and all her interests lie on the
                        shores of the inland sea; hot, at the same time, she is still a member of
                        the Triple ADianoe, and, therefore, is bound to Germany, with much oi* I
                        whose present policy the is, by the nature of things, greatly at varianoe.
                        Above all things, it ia necessary for her to poetess a strong fleet, and it
                        is of good omen for peeoe that the Chamber has so emphatically reoogniaed

                        ordered retinues, held high revel through the early hoDrt of the sum- mer

                        there were all the other cards, grown wondrous big, with pretty beads above
