                            <p>Lloyd's reports from Odessa that all work in the port is stopped. The

                                (Later). The battleship was the "Knyaz Potemkin Tavritcheski." The
                                mutiny was due to the commander having caused a sailor to be shot
                                for presenting a petition of the crew for Better food. The crew
                                thereupon attacked the officers, and it is reported that they
                                murdered several. In the morning the sailors bore their comrade's
                                body ashore, where a bareheaded crowd of strikers and others viewed
                                the corpse, amidst general interest and excitement The police and
                                Cossacks attempted to disperse the crowd, which resisted, and some
                                fighting en- sued. The affair has greatly aggravated the situation
                                caused by the strike. Frequent colli- sions are taking place between
                                the strikers and the troops. A workman threw a bomb at a policeman,
                                and both were killed by the explosion. (Reuter.)</p>

                    <head>CAIRO MILITARY SCHOOL. LOWER STANDARD NOTED</head>
                    <p>In our issue of yesterday we gave a short account of the prize distribution
                        by El Miralai Matchett Boy to the cadets of the Military School, Abbassieh,
                        and we now give farther details with a list of prizes and the names of those
                        who have been granted commissions. Mr. Brian, senior master, read his report
                        on tho year s work in which he remarks that he considers the present
                        standard of tire school to be distinctly below the average, and that neither
                        could ho consider the results of the recent examination to be altogether
                        satisfac- tory The fault however, does not lie with either the instructors
                        of the school or the pupils themselves, but is due, Mr. Brian pointed out,
                        to the contiuoed demand for officers, which compelled them to commission men
                        who had only gone through a two-years' course of instruction, whereas they
                        should spend three or even four years at the school before they could be
                        considered to be really ready for a commission. Out of the 84 cadets at
                        present on the school's lists only 24 had been present at last June's
                        examination, and all of these, with only one exception, were in the 3rd and
                        4th classes It was from these 24 that it had been found necessary to form
                        the N.C.O.'s class in January la»i Out of the 32 cadets of the first class
                        24 had only joined last October, and the remaining 8 of these had joined
                        less than six months ago. Mr. Plunkett, in presenting his report on the
                        outdoor work it the school (football, athletic sports, eta), remarked that
                        he consi- dered that the work done in this department towards the physical
                        training of the cadets was fairly satisfactory, hut less time had been
                        devoted to it, so that here, too, a certain falling-off was unavoidable. He
                        suggested that in future years the athletic sports should be held in April
                        as they had been this year, as he considered it preferable to holding them
                        in March, as had been done in previous years. El Miralai Matchett Bey,
                        Commandant, after distributing the prizes to the successful candidates, gave
                        a short address to the cadets. He greatly regretted the absence of their Ex-
                        cellencies the Minister of War and the Sirdar, but the time of year at which
                        the distribution took place rendered their attendance impossible. He was
                        p.ui-ed to be able to express himself as satisfied with the work which had
                        been done by them and with the general tone of the school, and he was also
                        glad to learn from the report of the chief medical officer that the health
                        of the cadets was good. He agreed with Mr. Brian that the standard of the
                        school was below that of former years, and said that it was his intention to
                        remark in his confiden- tial reports on those who were to receive com-
                        missions that he considered that in some cases they were hardly qualified to
                        fulfil the duties of officers owing to an insufficient period of time having
                        been devoted to their training. He trusted, however, that the continual de-
                        mand upon tho school for officers would soon cease and that they would then
                        be able to reattain their previous high standard, as the cadets would thus
                        be enabled to spend a mini- mum period of three years in the school, which
                        was necessary for the sound and thorough training in tho various branches of
                        work with which an officer must be acquainted. It was then announced that
                        H.H. the Khe- div had been most graciously pleased to confer commissions on
                        the following :—Moha- n,ed Harden, Cavalry. Ahmed Atieh, Artillery; Ahmed

                    <head>THE DANGER.</head>
                    <p>The political shortsightedness that seems to afflict the English people—which
                        bears a repu- tation second to none for a clear and precise comprehension of
                        the practicable—at certain moments in its career, and notably, when
                        confronted with that critical phase in its history, the outlines of which we
                        propose to trace, is one of the most remarkable pheno- mena of contemporary
                        history. Springing from the union of carelessness and inattentiveness, and
                        from a combination of morbid causes and 1 effects, this political myopia
                        grows more and more serious. What oan be stranger or more meloncholy than
                        the torpor into which "watch- ful" Britain appears to be sinking when faced
                        by the danger that menaces her from every . quarter of the horizon, a danger
                        ubiquitous and manifold, that may sot aim at the heart of the empire which
                        is guarded by the seas but none the lees threatens to lop its members in
                        Africa end Asia and to sever its arteries 1 Germany prepares for the Titanic
                        struggle of Empires that draws rapidly nearer, and with a science and
                        sagacity only equalled by her foresight, testa and examines every point in ,
                        the world wide armour of the British Empire; . and like Prussia before Sedan
                        or Japan before Mukden she calculates and prepares die decisive blow.
                        Meantime England, who recog- nises the imminence of the stroke as thoroughly
                        ' as her rival, concentratas her attention on her rival and nothing else and
                        falls asleep again as thoroughly satisfied that her head is safe as the
                        proverbial ostrich, and as 1 careless of the rest The British refuse to !
                        recognise that they are still exposed, that there are one or two points
                        where an ! suomy's blow will one day fall, points where the essential parts
                        of the Empire may be separated from its brain-centre and the whole body
                        brought to ruin by their separa- tion. They will learn too late that their
                        terri- ble armada will be of little value in the day of battle against the
                        foresight and calculation of her opponent, whose armed forces will, that '
                        day, move unhindered against the British 1 Empire—on land. It is strange and
                        almost stupefying to note, the one-sidedness and superficiality of the poli
                        tixal apperception of this people of sailors who seem incapable of realising
                        that Germany, the 00 on try of thinkers and calculators par excel Lence, is
                        doing her best to bring her continental strength to bear on her foe should
                        England check the complete development of her strength ' on blue water. It
                        is obvious that in case of war she would keep her fleet in Kiel harbour or
                        up the channels, which no longer fear the menace of the White Ensign based
                        on Heligo- land—the "Nasenklemmer" of the Elbe—and would sow every channel,
                        every strait and sea- pass from Wilhelmshaven to the Belt and from the Belt
                        to the Konigsberg with the submarine mines—sleeping but vigilant—to whose
                        terrible power the Russo-Japanese war bears witness, while her torpedo
                        flotillas and submarines would emerge from the Jahde and the Bins, from all
                        the havens and creeks of the North Sea and the Baltic, to harass the hostile
                        fleets. But can one even speak of coast attack by fleets pitted alone
                        against forts and mines after the lessons taught by the Eastern war and the
                        Port Arthur campaign ! What fleet, ware it four times as strong as the
                        combined squadrons of Britain, would dare assail unsupported the coasts of
                        the North Sea or the entrance to the Baltic defended by all the organised
                        might of German genius It The German Fleet once secures in its inacces sible
                        havens, what part is the British Navy to play I It must confine itself to
                        the observation of the German coast and to attacks on German commerce,—a
                        species of warfare that is unlikely to be attended by much glory or profit.
                        Its results would be practically nil. The German merchant fleet would lie
                        quietly immobilised in home or neutral ports while Gorman commerce would
                        still be carried on under over of a transfer to a neutral flag on every
                        ocean. And while England waits unable to grapple with her elusive foe the
                        main strength of Germany, her continental strength, will come into play
                        perhaps without the employment it a single Pomeranian Grenadier, against the
                        crack in Britain's armour whicb it will pierce like a wedge. It is with this
                        end in view that Germany has concluded tacit agreements and has—so to
                        say—added new members to her Empire to which she is communicating her stark
                        efficiency. At the given moment she will have but to im- press the given
                        movement on these new wheels of her military machine and they will tarn
                        irresistibly to fulfil her imperial designs. It is the erstwhile "Sick Man"
                        of Europe rescued in his many death agonies by Eng land's active
                        intervention, who trill be the prin- cipal weapon, the steel wedge driven
                        home by German hands into the gaps of England's weakened armour. Slowly,
                        insidiously and steadily Wilhelm II. has slipped through the doors of the
                        sublime Porte left open by his rival enthusiastically bound for the Talley
                        it the Nile. Bash English step in retreat was balanced by a German stop in
                        advance, while the Kaiser's policy was marked throughout by consummate
                        ingenuity and amazing discretion and tact. When England after Omdurman,
                        showed her- self vanquished by the attractions of the Dark Continent, the
                        last trace of Turkish sympathy or confidence in her policy disappeared while
                        England, logically pursuing her policy of expansion in African and in
                        Mussulman — territories did not hesitate to meet the surly resentment of the
                        'Turk with defiance on the Aden frontier and in the Arabian wastes. : Then
                        it was that Wilhemll. went in person seal his pact with the shades of
                        Ertoghrahl and Saladin. For eight years his diplomatists had prepared the
                        completion and his officers had ensured the utility of the treaty. Deaf to
                        the appeals of humanity horror-stricken by heca- tombs of slaughtered
                        Armenians, blind to the stain on tho escutcheon of the German Empire, he had
                        eyes only for tho end of his polioy, the creation of an Oamanli army that
                        could serve his ambition. Already imperfectly reorganised by the great
                        Moltke, the Turkish military organisation had gone to rest again, and had
                        become an antiquated machine jarring and creaking with every movement But
                        Moltke's work was taken in hand ones more, this time with greater rigour,
                        science, and continuity, and above all with greater freedom, greater
                        secrecy, and a fuller apprecia- tion of the military material of the Ottoman
                        Empire. Sober, teachable, sturdy, healthy, fanatical with the desperation of
                        those who have all to lose, the Turkish troops possess •very factor of brute
                        force and only need the coefficients of scientific leadership and organi-
                        sation to fulfil all the conditions imposed by modern war. In the few years
                        in which Germany has applied herself to satisfy this head all has bean
                        renewed and reforged : the military law, the general staff, commissariat,
                        communications, armament, fortifications, all have been remodelled by
                        Germans after the German methods. In the midst of an unpro- gressive Empire
                        towers one great monument of Progress—a new Tarldsh Army—and a part of
                        Germany's armed strength. Under the old organisation—or want of
                        organisation—what was most utterly lacking and most urgently demanded by the
                        military reformer was a system of mobilisation and con- centration dependent
                        on strategic railway* Under the pretext or economic or religions needs Abdnl
                        Hamid II. brought them into being. In every province of his empire rail- way
                        construction began, confided to German or at least to Continental companies,
                        or carried out at the expense of the Government —as in the case of the
                        Hedjaz line—and the dames of the concessions in all that referred to traffic
                        or construction were drawn op by the Turoo-German General Staff. Chemin de
                        for" spells "chemin de guerre" in the Ottoman Empire and the most
                        insignificant branch lines have their value as means of concentration and
                        helpers in the scheme of attack. In a series of articles appearing in the
                        "Egyptian Gazette" it has been shown dearly enough (to those who read
                        between the lines) that the Hedjaz Railway is before everything, not a line
                        destined to serve the religious inter- ests of Islam—as our credulous
                        Moslems of Egypt vainly believe—but a purely military railway built to link
                        the outlying provinces of the Arab world with the Turkish centre, to conjure

                        <p>The wind was rather fresh-from the N.W.by W., which necessitated most of

                            halyards and was towed home Iu Class II., although the Jessica had on
                            her small suit of sails, she cams in first The Akraba was disqualified
                            through Mating the Bog has Pass Mark buoy on je port hand instead of the

                            her total number of points up to 11, whereas the Jessica had only 10.
                            The prize for June in Class L went to the Sans Pareille and in (Bass IL

                        the lighters which were left behind at Ras Gharib laden with rice, entered
                        the Canal this morning at 3 o'clock. Up to now neither the tog which was

                        occurred in the port is absolutely unfounded. The cook of a new vessel
                        making her first trip from Bonder- land appears to have celebrated the
                        occasion and to have taken advantage of his position to such good purpose,
                        that he was brought on shore suffering from collapse due to over-

                    <p>A special meeting of the above company 1 will be held in Cairo on the 8th
                        July to ratify the agreement entered into with the Credit Foncier Egyptien.
                        By the terms of the contract the latter bays or takes over all the outstand
                        ing debts of the Daira Sanieh Company, amounting to some eight millions
                        sterling, by the purchases of its lands payable by annual installments
                        extending over a certain fixed period. The Credit Ponoier will, on its side,
                        charge interest at the rate of 5 per cent per annum upon all sums repayable
                        in fifteen years; and in order to refund the £8,000,000 still due to the
                        company an arrangement has been arrived at whereby the Credit Foncier will
                        augment its capital by a further issue of debentures or shares. The balance
                        has been offered to be foind for the latter by a group, with Sir Ernest
                        Caasel at its head, in Paris and London at 3 % annual interest plus
                        commission, besides dividing between the group and the Credit Foncier the 1
                        % representing the difference between the rate of interest and commission of
                        4 % for the money to be advanced, and the 5 % annual interest charged by the
                        latter, on sums repayable in 15 years, the higher rate of 5 % for repayments
                        extending over 20 years not being taken into account in the agreement. The
                        above terms for the liquidation of the outstanding debts of the Daira Sanieh
                        Company are, we are given to understand, correct in every detail and will be
                        submitted, at the extraordinary meeting of the shareholders of the Credit

                    <head>THE MOROCCAN CRISIS.</head>
                    <p>"Times." </p>
                    <p>The analysis of tho French Note on the Moroooo question which onr Paris
                        Corres- pondent sends os to-day shout that the French Government have taken
                        up a very clear and straightforward attitude on the subject of the proposed
                        conference..................... She will not be a party to a conference with
                        ,uch unlimited powers as the vague language of the Sultan's invitation might
                        oover and was doubtless designed to cover. She has entered into agreements
                        with this country and with Spain in regard to the introduction of reforms in
                        Morocco, and before she takes part in a conference she wants some guarantee
                        that it will not bo asked to arrogate to itself a right of revising those
                        arrangements. As tho "Temps'' observes, when people negotiate in good faith
                        they must speak clearly.•'France is negotiating in good faith, and
                        accordingly she begins by an honest endeavour to solve that ditiiculty with
                        Germany which is the only solid obstacle to a satisfactory settlement of the
                        whole Moroooo question.</p>
                    <p>"Morni.no Post." </p>
                    <p>In the matter of national organisation and training Germany has drifted into
                        a position of pro-eminence on the European Continent such as was hold at the
                        close of the 16th cen- tury by Spain, and at the close of the 17th and again
                        of the lath century by France. Each of those Powers in turn sought to sup
                        plement its great Continental position by crushing England. German policy
                        seems to be moving on closely analogous lines, and our duty is, regardless
                        of the misrepresentations of our viows which may be given to the German
                        public, to warn our countrymen, while there is time, that it Great Britain
                        is to preserve her independence, to say nothing of her Empire, she most
                        prepare for a renewal in more diffi- cult conditions of the struggles which
                        ended the 16th, tho 17th, and the 18th centuries.</p>

                    <p>If France made a mistake at the beginning in not acquainting Germany with the
                        Anglo- French agree, .int, the has abundantly repair- ed the oversight M.
                        Delcasse has disappear ed as tho result of his attitade, and Franoe has
                        adopted an entirely conciliatory tone. Nor mast it be forgotten that
                        Germany's action in the matter leaves something to be defended. Sha'did not
                        protest when she should have protested— that is, when the incident which
                        wounded hor pride occurred—but a year later, when the course of events in
                        the Far East had entirely altered the position of Franoe. If a sinister
                        motive is not to be attributed to this fact, it will be necessary for
                        Germany now to give the world some proof that she does not desire to keep
                        the difficulty open any more than France ............................ It is
                        certainly desirable that the work of keeping the peace should be delegated
                        to some- one, and Germany as well as the rest of Burope would profit from a
                        regenerated commerce. Germuny has won a legitimate snooess so far in
                        enforcing her title to be considered. It re- mains now for her tJ show that
                        it is not merely success in this affair that she desires ; but a certain
                        thundery atmosphere ;—not good rela- tions with Franoe, bat strained
                        relations.</p>

                    <p>There is no necessary quarrel between the Germans and the English unless we
                        hold it wrong for Germany to do that which we have done for a thousand
                        years. In the memory of living people the German boy has become a man and is
                        now a giant While there is no reason why Englishmen should fear this giant,

                    <p>We must make it clear both to France and to tho Sultan, who will communicate
                        it to his Royal Brother and Friend the Kaiser, that ia no circumstances will
                        the conference be permitted to discuss the provisions of the Anglo-Prencb
                        entente. If Moroooo, why not «Opt l We do not desire to wake up some fins

                    <p>When people negotiate without arriire l-n-r they must speak dearly and not
                        in- dulge in verbiage. Morocco invited the Powers to a conference. That is
                        all right; bet Mo- rocco acted at the instigation of Germany. If it were to
                        be urged that Germany is fort oo thing in it, that we most wait for the con-
                        j ferenceand let things take their ooorre, it would not be sinoere. Id this
                        whole affair there is a Franco-German difficulty and nothing •he. It is
                        consequently logical and salutary first of all to solve that difficulty. . .
                        . Ger- man diplomacy has affirmed its desire to apply a really conciliatory
                        spirit in the negotiations opened by M. Ronrier. The moment is at band wbc?

                        words. Franoe Iras taken a first step, it now behoves Germany to
                        reciprocate. Tho note oommnnioated yesterday weighs in the scales to the
                        advantage of France. For the first time since pourparUn begau they have an
                        opportunity of soeing in Berlin that the friendly assurances given whon thoy
                        began were not vain assurances. That consideration, which is not of less
                        importance for the fnturo of Franoo-German relations than for tho settlement
                        of the Moroocan affair, will not escape the perspicacity of tho Gorman
                        Chancellery.</p>
                    <p>"Aurork." </p>
                    <p>M. Clemenoean obierves in the "Aurora" that "France :md England can go to the
                        oonfo- ronoe only on condition of not having traps laid for them at every
                        step. That ia why M. Rouvier is quite right to ask Germany to be eh good as
                        to dofine the questions for discussion. For whatever reason it may be,
                        Germany is not particularly disposed to throw light on the sub- ject. She
                        encumbers her reply with considera- tions which would seom to be iutendod
                        merely to complicate the problem and increase the difficulties. It may be
                        disagreeable for her to analyso ber frame of mind on paper. It is groatly to
                        our interest to obtain from bor an unchangeable text whereby we can
                        ascertain exactly what ber arguments are and in the precise form which she
                        must be in a position to give them. When the two documents can bo compared,
                        then will begin tho difficult but decisive part of the negotiation."</p>

                    <p>The "Potit Parisien'' announces that Lord Lansdowne assured M. Gambon of the
                        complete identity of the views of the British Government with those
                        expressed in M. Ronvier's Note.</p>

                    <p>The numeroas advantages which France, even if a conference were held, wishos
                        to re- serve for herself hardly accord with the Sultan of Morooco's
                        absolutely negative attitude towards the French reform proposals, and
                        therefore unless M. Ronvior changes his mind Germany will have to be careful

                        varies considerably. At II o'clock noon, Greenwich mean time, it ia 4.51 p
                        in. in Bombay,5.21 in Madraa,and 5.53'in Cal- cutta. On most of the Indian
                        railways the confusion inseparable from frequent changes of time tone baa
                        been avoided by the adoption of Madras time. The standard now to be
                        introduced is nine minutes in advance of the "railway time," as it is called
                        in all parts of India, and is thus 5} hours in advance of Greenwich, being
                        the local time of the 82.30 degree of longitude- The standard for Burma is
                        to be exactly an hoar earlier—viz., 6} hoars in advance of Greenwich and
                        five minutes earlier than Rangoon local time. In inland plaoes it has been
                        found convenient to generally follow railway time but the great seaports of
                        Calcutta, Bombay, and Karachi have followed the local time of their res-
                        pective longitudes. The Government of India do not prescribe the new
                        standard for these and other places following local time, as jt is deemed
                        desirable to leave the ultimate decision to local opinion. Bat it is
                        intimated that, if a general desire to adopt the new standard is evidenced.
                        Government will be prepared to support the change and to tro- opers te in
                        bringing it about. In all probability, therefore, there will, ere long, be a
                        uniform time throughout India exactly 54 hoars in advance of Greenwich,
                        while that of Burma will be 6j hoars in advance.</p>

                    <p>Major E. A. Diokinson, Royal Dublin Fusi- liers, the new Governor of tho Blue
                        Nile Province, is a very smart officer whoee con- nection with the Khedive's
                        forces dates back to the end of 1898. Throngh no fault of his be has not had
                        an opportunity of seeing much active service, but is well known as one
                        possessed of much ability and he is great at organisation.</p>
                    <p>Captain C.H. Townsend, East Surrey Regiment, wlo lately took up the the
                        appointment of A.A.G. of the Egyptian Army, donned the fez in March, 1899,
                        in time to share in the Nile Expedition of that year and the final hunt
                        after the Khalifa, for which ho rooeived the medal with clasp. It is exactly
                        thirteen years since he was appointed to a commission in the "Yonng Buffs,"
                        and he got his oompany in January, 1901. No fewer than seven officers of the
                        East Surreys are serving in extra-Regimental employment in Africa.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant E. St. G. Lowther, R.P.A., serving with the 43rd Battery at
                        Woolwioh, has been posted to a battery in the Khe- dive's army, which he has
                        boen ordered to join at an early date. Lieutenant Lowther was a subaltern of
                        twelve months' aervioe when the Boer war oommeuoed, and wfth the 8th Battery
                        R.F.A. he went to the front and was severely wounded in aotion (men- tioned
                        in despatches, medal with clasp).</p>
                    <p>Captain G.V.B. Steward, Royal InDiskilling Fusiliers, on promotion to that
                        rank, has been transferred from the 2nd Battalion at Cairo to the 1st
                        Battalion at Londonderry.</p>
                    <p>From Baudolaire, father and idol of decadent poets, to Lord Kitchener, is a
                        far cry. But if, as Bandelaire said, energy is the supreme literary graoe,
                        Lord Kitchener's report on the administration of tho Indian Army should
                        serve for an example to those official investi- gators who, in their desire
                        to write finely, afieot a fantastic whirl of words. The Bntler Committee
                        presented the nation with a docu- ment which might have come from the pen of
                        a sickly apostle of the "precious:" Lord Kitchener puts what he has to say
                        in the simplest words and sen ten oea, and the manner is as potent as the
                        effeot is triumphant "I would certainly not continue a rotten system because
                        I was afraid to stretch out my hand to take a sound one." "Onr Indian
                        military administration has been framed mainly to meet peace requirements,
                        and the considera- tion that an army exists for war has been over, looked."
                        "Offioeebeoome paper logged with more or less unnecessary verbiage." That is
                        how Kitchener does it and how the Bntler Com- mitte ought to have done it.
                        Energy is the supreme literary grace—for administrators as well as
                        Baudelaires.</p>
                    <p>Brevet Major Percy G. Rigby, Notts and Derby Regiment who was rooently
                        specially selected for servioe with the King's African Rifles, has boen
                        appointed second in oommand of tho -4th Battalion in Uganda. Major Rigby got
                        bis first commission in the Sherwoods in November, 1890,_and his oompany in
                        April, 1898. Ho *as employed with the West African Frontier Force for some
                        time and went throngh tho Niger campaign of 1897, including the expedition
                        to Egbon (medal with clasp). With the 1st Battalion—now at Sin- gapore—he
                        saw further active servioe in the Boor War, and was pro.o it at the actions
                        of Bethulio Bridge, Winburg, Lindley, Hontnek, Vet River, Welkom, Zand
                        River, Doornkop, Pretoria, and Diamond Hill, and was in' oommand ot the
                        battalion in most of these engagements and in the subsequent opera- tions in
                        the Transvaal against General De- larey and General Kemp (mentioned in des-
                        patches, promoted brevet major, medal wiJi four clasps).</p>
                    <p>The harrying of British ships by the rem- nants of the Russian Nsvy has
                        reached •such a pitch that it is announced that in- structions have been
                        issued to the comman- ders of the China and the East Indies Squadrons to put
                        a stop to it at onoe. Sir Gerard Noel is the very man who will Btand no
                        nonsense in the area over which he rules. The cruise of the Second Cruiser
                        Squadroo to Canada and the United States will depend on the aspect of
                        Morrocan affairs. Mean- while Lord Charles Beresford has disposed his naval
                        forces in the Mediterranean to the best advantage.</p>
                    <p>The first class battleship "Hibernia" was succesfully launched at Devonport
                        on the 17th inst. in the presenoe of a large and fashionable assembly. The
                        christening ceremony was gracefully performed by the Marchioness of Ormonde.
                        The "Hibernia" ia of the "King Edward VII." class, from the designs of Sir
                        W. H. White, late Assistant Controller of the Navy and Director of Naval
                        Constrootion. The other Bhipe of the type now building or com- pleted are —
                        "Africa," "Hindustan," "New Zealand," "Britannia," "Dominion," and "Com-
                        monwealth." The "Hibernia" measures 425 feet on the water line, with a beam
                        of 78 feet, a draught of 26 feet 9 inches, and a load displacement of 16,350
                        tons. Her 18,000 h.p. engines, by Harland and Wolff, Belfast, it is expected
                        will give her a speed of 18.5 knots per hour (oontract). The armament will
                        include four 12 inch 60-ton wire-wound guns — so sharply criticised lately —
                        mounted in pairs in hooded barbettes, ioor 9.2 guns, one on each corner of
                        the superstructure in armoured turrets, ten 6-inch qaiok-firers in the
                        maindeck central battery, fourteen 12-pounders and the same number of
                        8-poundere and two Maxims. The torpedo eqnipment includes four sob merged
                        tubes of 18-inch oalibre. The water line and other vital parts are protected
                        by a 9 to 2-inch belt of Krnpp steel, the central battery'on the maindeck is
                        protected by 8-inoh armour after the fashion of the "Mikaaa"— Admiral Togo's
                        flagship, — the barbettes by 8 to 12-inch armour, and the turrets of the 9.2
                        guns 7-in'ch armonr. The protective steel deck, under which the engines,
                        boilers, marines, and other important machinery are placed, is from 1 to 2
                        inches in thickness When in commission the battleship will oarry a crew of
                        777 officeri and men. Her cost when she hoists the pennant will be dose on a
                        million and a quarter iterling.</p>

                        constitutional Monarch. His Majesty repels, with all the dignity of absolute
                        sincerity, the oharge that he has, by a breach of the Constitution on his
                        part, given cause for the step which his Nor- wegian subjects have seen fit
                        to take. He be- lieves that the Union is "important for the safety of the
                        Scandinavian nation," and be regards the action of the Storthing as an
                        encroachment on his own rights. Neverthe- less, "it is not intended to repel
                        injustice by force," and the King oonaenta to the recom- mendation of the
                        Government that powers be obtained from tho Riksdag to arrange the matter
                        with the Norwegian Storthing. This is a consent which does honor to his
                        Majesty, although it is one which has. been neither sought nor given without
                        deep emotion. Nor way being irrevocably bent upon separation, she could only
                        be prevented from having her way by the compulsion of ^fratricidal strug-
                        gle. There will bo no sooh calamity ; but, for the foot that there will not,

                    <p>The Government of Signor Fortis has won a remarkable victory in the Italian
                        Chamber, on the question of the augmenta- tion of the Navy. Admiral
                        Mirabello had proved the neceasity of following the example of the English
                        Admiralty, and Hi«ra»wt;ng 0i,j and worthless ships, and replacing them by
                        modern vessels. This, of oonrse, meant the expenditure of large sums of
                        money, and tho Finanoe Minister declared that the flourishing state of the

                        violently opposed by the Socialists and the Extreme Left, a vote of
                        confidence in the Ministry was carried by two hundred and aeveaty-two votes

                        and it is particularly satisfactory, as it shows that when the safety ot the
                        country ia involved, all but -the Socialists will unite to strengthen the
                        hands of a Ministry with which they do not see eye to eye in most matters.
                        The Deputies realise that Italy is in a very peculiar and embar- rassing
                        position. She ia a Mediterranean Power, and all her interests lie on the
                        shores of the inland sea; hot, at the same time, she is still a member of
                        the Triple ADianoe, and, therefore, is bound to Germany, with much oi* I
                        whose present policy the is, by the nature of things, greatly at varianoe.
                        Above all things, it ia necessary for her to poetess a strong fleet, and it
                        is of good omen for peeoe that the Chamber has so emphatically reoogniaed
                        the doty of providing it</p>

                    <head>A NOVEL GAME OF WHIST.</head>
                    <p>At Dalwich last week, on a wide lawn en- circled by forest trees, dreams of
                        wonderland came tree, and Kings and Queens of the world of cards, with their
                        ordered retinues, held high revel through the early hoDrt of the sum- mer
                        evening.</p>
                    <p>The speotaole opened by the entry of the oarda in slow time—the Aces, robed
                        in white, leading their suits into the lists. Fonr of a kind they were with
                        regard to stateliness and grace. Black and gold were the dresses of the
                        Spades, black and silver the Clubs, while the Hearts were arrayed in red and
                        gold, and the Diamonds in red and silver. The familiar features and costumea
                        of the four Kings and Queens and Knaves distinguished the royal party—and
                        there were all the other cards, grown wondrous big, with pretty beads above
                        and dainty feet below.</p>
                    <p>The Knaves with the Aoes, and the Kings with their Queens, were dancing a
                        royal minuet when the clash of a cymbal recalled them to the business of the
                        night. Then, to qaiok mosio, there was a tndden shnfflieg of the cards, a
                        out, and those behind took pre- oedenoe of those before...and then, one by
                        (me, the oarda were dealt, dancing to their plaeiea on the fonr tides of the
                        lawn, and there sorted, each hand taking its position with ite back turned
                        towards tho others. Then, as the cards were played, they advanced in tom to
                        the centre of the field, and the three which were taken, curtseying
                        obeisance to the winning card, marched away behind the victor. In the .
                        final game the winning tide revoked, and wore declared the loser* as three
                        disconsolate tricks were transferred eoroee the illuminated lews.</p>
