                        tastefully furnished homes. It is made in 70 artistic tints, and only
                        requires the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is quickly and
                        easily applied with a whitewash brush, with half the labour and at one third
                        the cost of paint. HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures cleanliness, and is pleasing to
                        the eye. It appeals alike to artistic and practical house decoration.</p>
                    <p>HALL’S DISTEMPER is of special value in hot climates. Owing to its cool,
                        pleasing colours, great weather-resisting and germ-destroying properties, it
                        lends itself to every kind of wall, wood, brick or stone coating, possessing
                        all the advantages of paint, colour- wash, and disinfectant at one third the
                        cost of oil paint. It never blisters in the hottest sun, and the fact that
                        it can be washed adds greatly to its sanitary advantages.</p>

                    <p>London, June 28. Lloyd's reports from Odessa that all work in the port is
                        stopped. The crew of a battleship in tho roads has mutinied and murdered the
                        officers It is reported that they threatened to bombard the town. (Later).
                        The battleship was the "Knyaz Potemkin Tavritcheski." The mutiny was due to
                        the commander having caused a sailor to be shot for presenting a petition of
                        the crew for Better food. The crew thereupon attacked the officers, and it
                        is reported that they murdered several. In the morning the sailors bore
                        their comrade's body ashore, where a bareheaded crowd of strikers and others
                        viewed the corpse, amidst general interest and excitement The police and
                        Cossacks attempted to disperse the crowd, which resisted, and some fighting
                        en- sued. The affair has greatly aggravated the situation caused by the
                        strike. Frequent colli- sions are taking place between the strikers and the
                        troops. A workman threw a bomb at a policeman, and both were killed by the
                        explosion. (Reuter.)</p>

                        yet displays a disposition to utilize the Moroccan dummy later on for the

                        and spa nous staircase and corridors make the house an ideal one for

                    <p>In our issue of yesterday we gave a short account of the prize distribution
                        by El Miralai Matchett Boy to the cadets of the Military School, Abbassieh,
                        and we now give farther details with a list of prizes and the names of those
                        who have been granted commissions. Mr. Brian, senior master, read his report
                        on tho year s work in which he remarks that he considers the present
                        standard of tire school to be distinctly below the average, and that neither
                        could ho consider the results of the recent examination to be altogether
                        satisfac- tory The fault however, does not lie with either the instructors
                        of the school or the pupils themselves, but is due, Mr. Brian point- ed out,
                        to the contiuoed demand for officers, which compelled them to commission men
                        who had only gone through a two-years' course of instruction, whereas they
                        should spend three or even four years at the school before they could be
                        considered to be really ready tor a commission. Out of the 84 cadets at
                        present on the school's lists only 24 had been present at last June’s
                        examination, and all of these, with only one exception, were in the 3rd and
                        4th classes It was from these 24 that it had been found necessary to form
                        the N.C.O.'s class in January la»i Out of the 32 cadets of the first class
                        24 had only joined last October, and the remaining 8 of these had joined
                        less than six months ago. Mr. Plunkett, in presenting his report on the
                        outdoor work it the school (football, athletic sports, eta), remarked that
                        he consi- dered that the work done in this department towards the physical
                        training of the cadets was fairly satisfactory, hut less time had been
                        devoted to it, so that here, too, a certain falling-off was unavoidable. He
                        suggested that in future years the athletic sports should be held in April
                        as they had been this year, as he considered it preferable to holding them
                        in March, as had been done in previous years. El Miralai Matchett Bey,
                        Commandant, after distributing the prizes to the successful candidates, gave
                        a short address to the cadets. He greatly regretted the absence of their Ex-
                        cellencies the Minister of War and the Sirdar, but the time of year at which
                        the distribution took place rendered their attendance impossible. He was
                        p.ui-ed to be able to express himself as satisfied with the work which had
                        been done by them and with the general tone of the school, and he was also
                        glad to learn from the report of the chief medical officer that the health
                        of the cadets was good. He agreed with Mr. Brian that the standard of the
                        school was below that of former years, and said that it was his intention to
                        remark in his confiden- tial reports on those who were to receive com-
                        missions that he considered that in some cases they were hardly qualified to
                        fulfil the duties of officers owing to an insufficient period of time having
                        been devoted to their training. He trusted, however, that the continual de-
                        mand upon tho school for officers would soon cease and that they would then
                        be able to reattain their previous high standard, as the cadets would thus
                        be enabled to spend a mini- mum period of three years in the school, which
                        was necessary for the sound and thorough training in tho various branches of
                        work with which an officer must be acquainted. It was then announced that
                        H.H. the Khe- div had been most graciously pleased to confer commissions on
                        the following :—Moha- n,ed Harden, Cavalry. Ahmed Atieh, Artillery; Ahmed

                    <head>THE DANGER.</head>
                    <p>The political shortsightedness that seems to afflict the English people—which
                        bears a repu- tation second to none for a clear and precise comprehension of
                        the practicable—at certain moments in its career, and notably, when
                        confronted with that critical phase in its history, the outlines of which we
                        propose to trace, is one of the most remarkable pheno- mena of contemporary
                        history. Springing from the union of carelessness and inattentiveness, and
                        from a combination of morbid causes and 1 effects, this political myopia
                        grows more and more serious. What oan be stranger or more meloncholy than
                        the torpor into which "watch- ful" Britain appears to be sinking when faced
                        by the danger that menaces her from every . quarter of the horizon, a danger
                        ubiquitous and manifold, that may sot aim at the heart of the empire which
                        is guarded by the seas but none the lees threatens to lop its members in
                        Africa end Asia and to sever its arteries 1 Germany prepares for the Titanic
                        struggle of Empires that draws rapidly nearer, and with a science and
                        sagacity only equalled by her foresight, testa and examines every point in ,
                        the world wide armour of the British Empire; . and like Prussia before Sedan
                        or Japan before Mukden she calculates and prepares die decisive blow.
                        Meantime England, who recog- nises the imminence of the stroke as thoroughly
                        ' as her rival, concentratas her attention on her rival and nothing else and
                        falls asleep again as thoroughly satisfied that her head is safe as the
                        proverbial ostrich, and as 1 careless of the rest The British refuse to !
                        recognise that they are still exposed, that there are one or two points
                        where an ! suomy’s blow will one day fall, points where the essential parts
                        of the Empire may be separated from its brain-centre and the whole body
                        brought to ruin by their separa- tion. They will learn too late that their
                        terri- ble armada will be of little value in the day of battle against the
                        foresight and calculation of her opponent, whose armed forces will, that '
                        day, move unhindered against the British 1 Empire—on land. It is strange and
                        almost stupefying to note, the one-sidedness and superficiality of the poli
                        tixal apperception of this people of sailors who seem incapable of realising
                        that Germany, the 00 on try of thinkers and calculators par excel Lence, is
                        doing her best to bring her continental strength to bear on her foe should
                        England check the complete development of her strength ' on blue water. It
                        is obvious that in case of war she would keep her fleet in Kiel harbour or
                        up the channels, which no longer fear the menace of the White Ensign based
                        on Heligo- land—the "Nasenklemmer" of the Elbe—and would sow every channel,
                        every strait and sea- pass from Wilhelmshaven to the Belt and from the Belt
                        to the Konigsberg with the submarine mines—sleeping but vigilant—to whose
                        terrible power the Russo-Japanese war bears witness, while her torpedo
                        flotillas and submarines would emerge from the Jahde and the Bins, from all
                        the havens and creeks of the North Sea and the Baltic, to harass the hostile
                        fleets. But can one even speak of coast attack by fleets pitted alone
                        against forts and mines after the lessons taught by the Eastern war and the
                        Port Arthur campaign ! What fleet, ware it four times as strong as the
                        combined squadrons of Britain, would dare assail unsupported the coasts of
                        the North Sea or the entrance to the Baltic defended by all the organised
                        might of German genius It The German Fleet once secures in its inacces sible
                        havens, what part is the British Navy to play I It must confine itself to
                        the observation of the German coast and to attacks on German commerce,—a
                        species of warfare that is unlikely to be attended by much glory or profit.
                        Its results would be practically nil. The German merchant fleet would lie
                        quietly immobilised in home or neutral ports while Gorman commerce would
                        still be carried on under over of a transfer to a neutral flag on every
                        ocean. And while England waits unable to grapple with her elusive foe the
                        main strength of Germany, her continental strength, will come into play
                        perhaps without the employment it a single Pomeranian Grenadier, against the
                        crack in Britain's armour whicb it will pierce like a wedge. It is with this
                        end in view that Germany has concluded tacit agreements and has—so to
                        say—added new members to her Empire to which she is communicating her stark
                        efficiency. At the given moment she will have but to im- press the given
                        movement on these new wheels of her military machine and they will tarn
                        irresistibly to fulfil her imperial designs. It is the erstwhile "Sick Man"
                        of Europe rescued in his many death agonies by Eng land’s active
                        intervention, who trill be the prin- cipal weapon, the steel wedge driven
                        home by German hands into the gaps of England's weakened armour. Slowly,
                        insidiously and steadily Wilhelm II. has slipped through the doors of the
                        sublime Porte left open by his rival enthusiastically bound for the Talley
                        it the Nile. Bash English step in retreat was balanced by a German stop in
                        advance, while the Kaiser's policy was marked throughout by consummate
                        ingenuity and amazing discretion and tact. When England after Omdurman,
                        showed her- self vanquished by the attractions of the Dark Continent, the
                        last trace of Turkish sympathy or confidence in her policy disappeared while
                        England, logically pursuing her policy of expansion in African and in
                        Mussulman — territories did not hesitate to meet the surly resentment of the
                        'Turk with defiance on the Aden frontier and in the Arabian wastes. : Then
                        it was that Wilhemll. went in person seal his pact with the shades of
                        Ertoghrahl and Saladin. For eight years his diplomatists had prepared the
                        completion and his officers had ensured the utility of the treaty. Deaf to
                        the appeals of humanity horror-stricken by heca- tombs of slaughtered
                        Armenians, blind to the stain on tho escutcheon of the German Empire, he had
                        eyes only for tho end of his polioy, the creation of an Oamanli army that
                        could serve his ambition. Already imperfectly reorganised by the great
                        Moltke, the Turkish military organisation had gone to rest again, and had
                        become an antiquated machine jarring and creaking with every movement But
                        Moltke's work was taken in hand ones more, this time with greater rigour,
                        science, and continuity, and above all with greater freedom, greater
                        secrecy, and a fuller apprecia- tion of the military material of the Ottoman
                        Empire. Sober, teachable, sturdy, healthy, fanatical with the desperation of
                        those who have all to lose, the Turkish troops possess •very factor of brute
                        force and only need the coefficients of scientific leadership and organi-
                        sation to fulfil all the conditions imposed by modern war. In the few years
                        in which Germany has applied herself to satisfy this head all has bean
                        renewed and reforged : the military law, the general staff, commissariat,
                        communications, armament, fortifications, all have been remodelled by
                        Germans after the German methods. In the midst of an unpro- gressive Empire
                        towers one great monument of Progress—a new Tarldsh Army—and a part of
                        Germany’s armed strength. Under the old organisation—or want of
                        organisation—what was most utterly lacking and most urgently demanded by the
                        military reformer was a system of mobilisation and con- centration dependent
                        on strategic railway* Under the pretext or economic or religions needs Abdnl
                        Hamid II. brought them into being. In every province of his empire rail- way
                        construction began, confided to German or at least to Continental companies,
                        or carried out at the expense of the Government —as in the case of the
                        Hedjaz line—and the dames of the concessions in all that referred to traffic
                        or construction were drawn op by the Turoo-German General Staff. Chemin de
                        for" spells "chemin de guerre" in the Ottoman Empire and the most
                        insignificant branch lines have their value as means of concentration and
                        helpers in the scheme of attack. In a series of articles appearing in the
                        "Egyptian Gazette" it has been shown dearly enough (to those who read
                        between the lines) that the Hedjaz Railway is before everything, not a line
                        destined to serve the religious inter- ests of Islam—as our credulous
                        Moslems of Egypt vainly believe—but a purely military railway built to link
                        the outlying provinces of the Arab world with the Turkish centre, to conjure
                        thoughts of autonomy or independ- ance in the turbulent provinces of the
                        Hedjaz, Aar, and Yemen, and to preserve the Black stone of the Kaaba in the
                        jewelled diadem of the Imam of lstamboul.</p>

                        left behind at Ras Gharib laden with rice, entered the Canal this morning at

                        July to ratify the agreement entered into with the Credit Foncier Egyptien.
                        By the terms of the contract the latter bays or takes over all the outstand

                        sterling, by the purchases of its lands payable by annual installments
                        extending over a certain fixed period. The Credit Ponoier will, on its side,
                        charge interest at the rate of 5 per cent per annum upon all sums repayable
                        in fifteen years; and in order to refund the £8,000,000 still due to the

                        of 4 % for the money to be advanced, and the 5 % annual interest charged by

                <p>THE MOROCCAN CRISIS. "Times." The analysis of tho French Note on the Moroooo
                    question which onr Paris Corres- pondent sends os to-day shout that the French
                    Government have taken np a very clear and straightforward attitude on the
                    subject of the proposed conference..................... She will not be a party
                    to a conference with ,uch unlimited powers as the vague language of the Sultan's
                    invitation might oover and was doubtless designed to cover. She has entered into
                    agreements with this oountry and with Spain in regard to the introduction of
                    reforms in Morocco, and before she takes part in a conference she wants some
                    guarantee that it will not bo asked to arrogate to itself a right of revising
                    those arrangements. As tho "Temps'' observes, when people negotiate in good
                    faith they must speak clearly.•'France is negotiating in good faith, and
                    accordingly she begins by an honest endeavour to solve that ditiiculty with
                    Germany which is the only solid obstacle to a satisfactory settlement of the
                    whole Moroooo question.</p>
                <p>“Morni.no Post." In the matter of national organisation and training Germany has
                    drifted into a position of pro-eminence on the European Continent such as was
                    hold at the close of the 16th cen- tury by Spain, and at the close of the 17th
                    and again of the lath century by France. Each of those Powers in turn sought to
                    sup plement its great Continental position by crushing England. German policy
                    seems to be moving on closely analogous lines, and our duty is, regardless of
                    the misrepresentations of our viows which may be given to the German public, to
                    warn our countrymen, while there is time, that it Great Britain is to preserve
                    her independence, to say nothing of her Empire, she most prepare for a renewal
                    in more diffi- cult conditions of the struggles which ended the 16th, tho 17th,
                    and the 18th centuries.</p>
                <p>“Daily News.” If France made a mistake at the beginning in not acquainting
                    Germany with the Anglo- French agree, .int, the has abundantly repair- ed the
                    oversight M. Delcasse has disappear ed as tho result of his attitade, and Franoe
                    has adopted an entirely conciliatory tone. Nor mast it be forgotten that
                    Germany’s action in the matter leaves something to be defended. Sha'did not
                    protest when she should have protested— that is, when the incident which wounded
                    hor pride occurred—but a year later, when the course of events in the Far East
                    had entirely altered the position of Franoe. If a sinister motive is not to be
                    attributed to this fact, it will be neoessary for Germany now to give the world
                    some proof that she does not desire to keep the difficulty open any more than
                    France ............................ It is certainly desirable that the work of
                    keeping the peace should be delegated to some- one, and Germany as well as the
                    rest of Burope would profit from a regenerated commerce. Germuny has won a
                    legitimate snooess so far in enforcing her title to be considered. It re- mains
                    now for her tJ show that it is not merely success in this affair that she
                    desires ; but a certain thundery atmosphere ;—not good rela- tions with Franoe,
                    bat strained relations.</p>
                <p>“Chronicle” There is no necessary quarrel between the Germans and the English
                    unless we hold it wrong for Germany to do that which we have done for a thousand
                    years. In the memory of living people the German boy has become a man and is now
                    a giant While there is no reason why Englishmen should fear this giant, there is
                    every reason for trying to nnderatand</p>
                <p>“Globe” We must make it clear both to France and to tho Sultan, who will
                    communicate it to his Royal Brother and Friend the Kaiser, that ia no
                    circumstances will the conference be permitted to discuss the provisions of the
                    Anglo-Prencb entente. If Moroooo, why not «Opt l We do not desire to wake up
                    some fins morning and discover that the German Ea*le has taken the Khedive nnder
                    his wing, tod in proposing an Egyptian conference based on the “status qno ante"
                    Tel el-Kebir.</p>
                <p>“Temps." When people negotiate without arriire l-n-r they must speak dearly and
                    not in- dulge in verbiage. Morocco invited the Powers to a conference. That is
                    all right; bet Mo- rocco acted at the instigation of Germany. If it were to be
                    urged that Germany is fort oo thing in it, that we most wait for the con- j
                    ferenceand let things take their ooorre, it would not be sinoere. Id this whole
                    affair there is a Franco-German difficulty and nothing •he. It is consequently
                    logical and salutary first of all to solve that difficulty. . . . Ger- man
                    diplomacy has affirmed its desire to apply a really conciliatory spirit in the
                    negotiations opened by M. Ronrier. The moment is at band wbc? ebf ‘will have the
                    opportunity o j suiting her actions to her words. Franoe Iras taken a first
                    step, it now behoves Germany to reciprocate. Tho note oommnnioated yesterday
                    weighs in the scales to the advantage of France. For the first time sinoe
                    pourparUn begau they have an opportunity of soeing in Berlin that the friendly
                    assurances given whon thoy began were not vain assurances. That consideration,
                    which is not of less importance for the fnturo of Franoo-German relations than
                    for tho settlement of the Moroocan affair, will not escape the perspicacity of
                    tho Gorman Chancellery.</p>
                <p>“Aurork.” M. Clemenoean obierves in the "Aurora" that "France :md England can go
                    to the oonfo- ronoe only on condition of not having traps laid for them at every
                    step. That ia why M. Rouvier is quite right to ask Germany to be eh good as to
                    dofine the questions for discussion. For whatever reason it may be, Germany is
                    not particularly disposed to throw light on the sub- ject. She encumbers her
                    reply with considera- tions which would seom to be iutendod merely to complicate
                    the problem and increase the difficulties. It may be disagreeable for her to
                    analyso ber frame of mind on paper. It is groatly to our interest to obtain from
                    bor an unchangeable text whereby we can asoertain exactly what ber arguments are
                    and in the precise form which she must be in a position to give them. When the
                    two documents can bo compared, then will begin tho difficult but decisive part
                    of the negotiation.”</p>
                <p>“Prtit Parisien," The "Potit Parisien'' announces that Lord Lansdowne assured M.
                    Gambon of the complete identity of the views of the British Government with
                    those expressed in M. Ronvier's Note.</p>
                <p>“Lokalanzeiger" (Berlin) The numeroas advantages which France, even if a
                    conference were held, wishos to re- serve for herself hardly accord with the
                    Sultan of Morooco's absolutely negative attitude towards the French reform
                    proposals, and therefore unless M. Ronvior changes his mind Germany will have to
                    be careful to safeguard her interests by continuing direct negotiations at
                    Per.</p>
                <p>A STANDARD TIME FOR INDIA. After much correspondence with oommeroial bodies and
                    other representative organisations, the Government oi India have ordered the
                    introduction of a standard time, with effeot from July l\n the railways (other
                    than small local lines, where the change might be incon- venient) and in all
                    telegraph offioes in the country, and also in Burma. The local timo in the
                    Peninaola varies considerably. At II o'clock noon, Greenwich mean time, it ia
                    4.51 p in. in Bombay,5.21 in Madraa,and 5.53'in Cal- cutta. On most of the
                    Indian railways the ■confusion inseparable from frequent changes of time tone
                    baa been avoided by the adoption of Madras time. The standard now to be
                    introduced is nine minutes in advance of the "railway time," as it is called in
                    all parts of India, and is thus 5} hours in advance of Greenwich, being the
                    local time of the 82.30 degree of longitude- The standard for Burma is to be
                    exactly an hoar earlier—viz., 6} hoars in advance of Greenwich and five minutes
                    earlier than Rangoon local time. In inland plaoes it has been found convenient
                    to generally follow railway time bnt the great seaports of Calcutta, Bombay, and
                    Karachi have followed the local time of their res- pective longitudes. The
                    Government of India do not prescribe the new standard for these and other places
                    following local time, as jt is deemed desirable to leave the ultimate decision
                    to local opinion. Bat it is intimated that, if a general desire to adopt the new
                    standard is evidenced. Government will be prepared to support the change and to
                    tro- opers te in bringing it about. In all probability, therefore, there will,
                    ere long, be a uniform time throughout India exactly 54 hoars in advance of
                    Greenwich, while that of Burma will be 6j hoars in advance.</p>
                <p>Loader., juno 20. Major E. A. Diokinson, Royal Dublin Fusi- liers, the new
                    Governor of tho Blue Nile Province, is a very smart officer whoee con- nection
                    with the Khedive’s forces dates back to the end of 1898. Throngh no fault of his
                    be has not had an opportunity of seeing much active service, but is well known
                    as one possessed of much ability and he is great at organisation.</p>
                <p>Captain C.H. Townsend, East Surrey Regi- ment, wlo lately took np the the
                    appointment of A.A.G. of the Egyptian Army, donned the fez in March, 1899, in
                    time to share in the Nile Expedition of that year and the final hunt after the
                    Khalifa, for which ho rooeived the medal with clasp. It is exactly thirteen
                    years sinoe he was appointed to a commission in the “Yonng Buffs," and he got
                    his oompany in January, 1901. No fewer than seven officers of the East Surreys
                    are serving in extra-regi- mental employment in Africa.</p>
                <p>Lieutenant E. St. G. Lowther, R.P.A., serving with the 43rd Battery at Woolwioh,
                    has been posted to a battery in the Khe- dive’s army, which he has boen ordered
                    to join at an early date. Lieutenant Lowther was a subaltern of twelve months’
                    aervioe when the Boer war oommeuoed, and wfth the 8th Battery R.F.A. he went to
                    the front and was severely wounded in aotion (men- tioned in despatches, medal
                    with clasp).</p>
                <p>Captain G.V.B. Steward, Royal InDiskilling Fusiliers, on promotion to that rank,
                    has been transferred from the 2nd Battalion at Cairo to the 1st Battalion at
                    Londonderry.</p>
                <p>From Baudolaire, father and idol of decadent poets, to Lord Kitchener, is a far
                    cry. Bnt if, as Bandelaire said, energy is the supreme literary graoe, Lord
                    Kitchener's report on the administration of tho Indian Army shonld serve for an
                    example to those official investi- gators who, in their desire to write finely,
                    afieot a fantastic whirl of words. The Bntler Committee presented the nation
                    with a docu- ment whioh might have come from the pen oi a sickly apostle of the
                    “precious:" Lord Kitchener puts what he has to say in the simplest words and sen
                    ten oea, and the manner is as potent as the effeot is triumphant "I would
                    oertainly not continue a rotten system because I was afraid to stretch out my
                    hand to take a sound one.” “Onr Indian military administration has been framed
                    mainly to meet peace requirements, and the considera- tion that an army exists
                    for war has been over, looked." "Offioeebeoome paper logged with more or less
                    unnecessary verbiage.” That is how Kitchener does it and how the Bntler Com-
                    mitte ought to have done it. Energy is the supreme literary grace—for
                    administrators as well as Baudelaires.</p>
                <p>Brevet Major Percy G. Rigby, Notts and Derby Regiment who was rooently specially
                    selected tor servioe with the King's African Rifles, has boen appointed second
                    in oommand of tho -4th Battalion in Uganda. Major Rigby got bis first commission
                    in the Sherwoods in November, 1890,_and his oompany in April, 1898. Ho *as
                    employed with the West African Frontier Force for some time and went throngh tho
                    Niger campaign of 1897, includ- ing the expedition to Egbon (medal with clasp).
                    With the 1st Battalion—now at Sin- gapore—he saw further active servioe in the
                    Boor War, and was pro.o it at the actions of Bethulio Bridge, Winburg, Lindley,
                    Hontnek, Vet River, Welkom, Zand River, Doornkop, Pretoria, and Diamond Hill,
                    and was in' oommand ot the battalion in most of these engagements and in the
                    subsequent opera- tions in the Transvaal against General De- larey and General
                    Kemp (mentioned in des- patches, promoted brevet major, medal wiJi four
                    clasps).</p>
                <p>The harrying of British ships by the rem- nants of the Russian Nsvy has reached
                    •such a pitch that it is announced that in- structions have been issued to the
                    comman- ders of the China and the East Indies Squadrons to put a stop to it at
                    onoe. Sir Gerard Noel is the very man who will Btand no nonsense in the area
                    over whioh he rules. The cruise of the Second Cruiser Squadroo to Canada and the
                    United States will depend on the aspect of Morrocan affairs. Mean- while Lord
                    Charles Beresford has disposed his naval forces in the Mediterranean to the best
                    advantage.</p>
                <p>The first class battleship “Hibernia" was succesfully launched at Devonport on
                    the 17th inst. in the presenoe of a large and fashionable assembly. The
                    christening ceremony was gracefully performed by the Marchioness of Ormonde. The
                    "Hibernia” ia of the “King Edward VII.” class, from the designs of Sir W. H.
                    White, late Assistant Controller of the Navy and Director of Naval Constrootion.
                    The other Bhipe of the type now building or com- pleted are — "Africa,"
                    "Hindustan," “New Zealand,” "Britannia,” “Dominion," and “Com- monwealth." The
                    “Hibernia" measures 425 feet on the water line, with a beam of 78 feet, a
                    draught of 26 feet 9 inches, and a load displacement of 16,350 tons. Her 18,000
                    h.p. engines, by Harland and Wolff, Belfast, it is expected will give her a
                    speed of 18.5 knots per hour (oontract). The armament will include four 12 inch
                    60-ton wire-wound guns — so sharply criticised lately — mounted in pairs in
                    hooded barbettes, ioor 9.2 guns, one on each corner of the superstructure in
                    armoured turrets, ten 6-inch qaiok-firers in the maindeck central battery,
                    fourteen 12-pounders and the same number of 8-poundere and two Maxims. The
                    torpedo eqnipment includes four sob merged tubes of 18-inch oalibre. The water
                    line and other vital parts are protected by a 9 to 2-inch belt of Krnpp steel,
                    the central battery’on the maindeck is protected by 8-inoh armour after the
                    fashion of the "Mikaaa”— Admiral Togo’s flagship, — the barbettes by 8 to
                    12-inch armour, and the turrets of the 9.2 guns 7-in'ch armonr. The protective
                    steel deck, under which the engines, boilers, marines, and other important
                    machinery are placed, is from 1 to 2 inches in thickness When in commission the
                    battleship will oarry a crew of 777 officeri and men. Her cost when she hoists
                    the pennant will be dose on a million and a quarter iterling.</p>
                <p>KITCHENER’S SUPREME GRACE. “EVERY INCH A KING.” King Oscar’s speoch to the
                    8wediah Riksdag is in every respect worthy of a constitutional Monarch. His
                    Majesty repels, with all the dignity of absolute sincerity, the oharge that he
                    has, by a breach of the Constitution on his part, given cause for the step which
                    his Nor- wegian subjects have seen fit to take. He be- lieves that the Union is
                    “important for the safety of the Scandinavian nation," and be regards the action
                    of the Storthing as an encroachment on his own rights. Neverthe- less, “it is
                    not intended to repel injustice by force,” and the King oonaenta to the recom-
                    mendation of the Government that powers be obtained from tho Riksdag to arrange
                    the matter with the Norwegian Storthing. This is a consent whioh does honor to
                    his Majesty, although it is one which has. been neither sought nor given without
                    deep emotion. Nor way being irrevocably bent upon separation, she oonld only be
                    prevented from having her way by the compulsion of ^fratricidal strug- gle.
                    There will bo no sooh calamity ; but, for the foot that there will not, both
                    Norway and Sweden have largely to thank the vener- able Sovereign.</p>
                <p>ERYTHREAN COTTON. Like England, Italy is much occupied with the project of
                    oolonial cotton-growing. The manufacturers of Northern Italy some time ago began
                    to organise ootton-planting experi- ments in Brythrea, and these have resulted
                    so well that the question as to whether or not Erythrea may be regarded as a
                    profitable ootton-growing oountry has been permanently decided in the
                    affirmative. Meantime the ex- ports of the oolony oontinue to grow steadily.
                    MANUFACTURERS TAKE THOUGHT. Odb of the best pieces of oommoroial news that has
                    been published for "an eternity or two" is the announcement that a Manufac-
                    turers’ Association for Great Britain is at last really in oonrse of formation.
                    It will be model- led on the lines of the associations which assist business
                    enterprise in Canada and the United States, and will set itself a number of
                    osefol objects. One of them—perhaps the most im- mediately practical and
                    prospectively advan- tageous of the lot—ia the appointment of cor- respondents
                    in all parts of the world to report on openings for trade and on local changes
                    and conditions. If the British manufacturer will read, mark, and learn the
                    teachings of sooh reports, his reproach will be oleaxed away. For he will no
                    longer persist in sending goods of a particular pattern into plaoes which
                    urgently require another pattern and will be oontent with none other. The
                    association sbonld have been founded years ago, bnt it is not yet too late for
                    it to have an immense effeot upon British industry.</p>

                <p>QUITE FRANK. The word seems to have gone forth, from the high plaoes of the
                    Wilhelmstrasse, that the German Frees is to spare no pains to cajole (or to
                    bully, as expediency may dictate) France into renouncing Ler friendship jrith
                    England. All aorta of personages are being pat np to point oat that Franoe has
                    all to gain, and nothing to lose, by becoming the obedient humble servant of
                    William U. There is Prinoe Henckel von Donnersmark and Professor 8chiemann (has
                    not German history been made, as well as written, by German Profes- sors 1), and
                    there are others. But, though the voioee are many, their language is identical.
                    So far, indeed, have they gone in the way of perfect (tho "Times” correspondent
                    in Paris calls it “brutal") frankness that they admit with abeolnte aplomb, that
                    the Moroooo matter is a mere pretext It is England that is aimed at all
                    throngh—England, from whom Prance has never gained anything, and never will gain
                    anything. In short, Germany is m»Hnj a tremendous effort to ruin the
                    Anglo-French friendship. Will she snooeed J Upon the answer to that question
                    depends, in all pro- bability, the course of the world's history for many years
                    to oome. Forewarned, therefore, the parties it primarily oonoems shonld be
                    forearmed.</p>
                <p>ITALY AND HER NAVY. The Government of Signor Fortis has won a remarkable victory
                    in the Italian Chamber, on the question of the augmenta- tion of the Navy.
                    Admiral Mirabello had proved the neceasity of following the example of the
                    English Admiralty, and Hi«ra»wt;ng 0i,j and worthless ships, and replacing them
                    by modern vessels. This, of oonrse, meant the expenditure of large sums of
                    money, and tho Finanoe Minister declared that the flourish- ing state of the
                    finances would enable him to provide the neoessary funds. 8ignor Fortis, for his
                    part, annonnoed his intention ofdfr voting the surplus to the better protection
                    of the oountry, and though the augmentation of the Navy was violently opposed by
                    the Socialists and the Extreme Left, a vote of confidence in the Ministry was
                    carried by two hundred and aeveaty-two votes to eighty- five. This is largely in
                    excess of the usual Government majority, and it is particularly satisfactory, as
                    it shows that when the safety ot the oountry ia involved, all but -the
                    Socialists will unite to strengthen the hands of a Ministry with which they do
                    not see eye to eye in most matters. The Deputies realise that Italy is in a very
                    peculiar and embar- rassing position. She ia a Mediterranean Power, and all her
                    interests lie on the shores of the inland sea; hot, at the same time, she is
                    still a member of the Triple ADianoe, and, therefore, is bound to Germany, with
                    much oi* I whose present policy the is, by the nature of things, greatly at
                    varianoe. Above all things, it ia neoessary for her to poetess a strong fleet,
                    and it is of good omen for peeoe that the Chamber has so emphatically reoogniaed
                    the doty of providing it</p>
                <p>A NOVEL GAME OF WHIST. At Dalwich last week, on a wide lawn en- circled by forest
                    trees, dreams of wonderland came tree, and Kings and Queens of the world of
                    cards, with their ordered retinues, held high revel through the early hoDrt of
                    the sum- mer evening.</p>
                <p>The speotaole opened by the entry of the oarda in slow time—the Aces, robed in
                    white, leading their suits into the lists. Fonr of a kind they were with regard
                    to stateliness and grace. Black and gold were the dresses of the Spades, black
                    and silver the Clubs, while the Hearts were arrayed in red and gold, and the
                    Diamonds in red and silver. The familiar features and oostumea of the four Kings
                    and Queens and Knaves distinguished the royal party—and there were all the other
                    cards, grown wondrous big, with pretty beads above and dainty feet below.</p>
                <p>The Knaves with the Aoes, and the Kings with their Queens, were dancing a royal
                    minuet when the clash of a cymbal recalled them to the business of the night.
                    Then, to qaiok mosio, there was a tndden shnfflieg of the cards, a out, and
                    those behind took pre- oedenoe of those before...and then, one by (me, the oarda
                    were dealt, dancing to their plaeiea on the fonr tides of the lawn, and there
                    sorted, each hand taking its position with ite back turned towards tho others.
                    Then, as the cards were played, they advanced in tom to the centre of the field,
                    and the three which were taken, curtseying obeisance to the winning card,
                    marched away behind the victor. In the . final game the winning tide revoked,
                    and wore declared the loser* as three disconsolate tricks were transferred
                    eoroee the illuminated lews.</p>
