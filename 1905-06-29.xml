<p>London, June 28.
Lloyd's reports from Odessa that all work in
the port is stopped. The crew of a battleship
in tho roads has mutinied and murdered the
officers It is reported that they threatened to
bombard the town.
(Later). The battleship was the "Knyaz
Potemkin Tavritcheski." The mutiny was due
to the commander having caused a sailor to be
shot for presenting a petition of the crew for
Better food. The crew thereupon attacked the
officers, and it is reported that they murdered
several. In the morning the sailors bore their
comrade's body ashore, where a bareheaded
crowd of strikers and others viewed the corpse,
amidst general interest and excitement The
police and Cossacks attempted to disperse the
crowd, which resisted, and some fighting en-
sued. The affair has greatly aggravated the
situation caused by the strike. Frequent colli-
sions are taking place between the strikers and
the troops. A workman threw a bomb at a
policeman, and both were killed by the
explosion.	(Reuter.)</p>

<p>Paris, June 28.
Tb«- general feeling here is that the sting
has been taken out of the question of Morocco
by tho conciliatory tone of the German reply,
which, while pointing out that, as Morocco
and not Germany proposed the Conference, the
latter cannot limit the questions to be discuss-
ed at it, yet displays a disposition to utilize
the Moroccan dummy later on for the purpose
of meeting the views of France. (Reuter.)</p>

excellent rendering of several scenes from

<head>CAIRO MILITARY SCHOOL</head>
<head>LOWER STANDARD NOTED</head>
<p>In our issue of yesterday we gave a short
account of the prize distribution by El Miralai
Matchett Boy to the cadets of the Military
School, Abbassieh, and we now give farther
details with a list of prizes and the names of
those who have been granted commissions.
Mr. Brian, senior master, read his report on
tho year s work in which he remarks that he
considers the present standard of tire school
to be distinctly below the average, and that
neither could ho consider the results of the
recent examination to be altogether satisfac-
tory The fault however, does not lie with
either the instructors of the school or the
pupils themselves, but is due, Mr. Brian point-
ed out, to the contiuoed demand for officers,
which compelled them to commission men who
had only gone through a two-years' course of
instruction, whereas they should spend three
or even four years at the school before they
could be considered to be really ready tor a
commission. Out of the 84 cadets at present
on the school's lists only 24 had been present
at last June’s examination, and all of these,
with only one exception, were in the 3rd and
4th classes It was from these 24 that it had
been found necessary  to form the N.C.O.'s class
in January la»i Out of the 32 cadets of the
first class 24 had only joined last October, and
the remaining 8 of these had joined less than
six months ago.
Mr. Plunkett, in presenting his report on
the outdoor work it the school (football,
athletic sports, eta), remarked that he consi-
dered that the work done in this department
towards the physical training of the cadets
was fairly satisfactory, hut less time had been
devoted to it, so that here, too, a certain
falling-off was unavoidable. He suggested
that in future years the athletic sports
should be held in April as they had been this
year, as he considered it preferable to holding
them in March, as had been done in previous
years.
El Miralai Matchett Bey, Commandant,
after distributing the prizes to the successful
candidates, gave a short address to the cadets.
He greatly regretted the absence of their Ex-
cellencies the Minister of War and the Sirdar,
but the time of year at which the distribution
took place rendered their attendance impossible.
He was p.ui-ed to be able to express himself
as satisfied with the work which had been
done by them and with the general tone of
the school, and he was also glad to learn from
the report of the chief medical officer that
the health of the cadets was good. He agreed
with Mr. Brian that the standard of the school
was below that of former years, and said that
it was his intention to remark in his confiden-
tial reports on those who were to receive com-
missions that he considered that in some cases
they were hardly qualified to fulfil the duties
of officers owing to an insufficient period of
time having been devoted to their training.
He trusted, however, that the continual de-
mand upon tho school for officers would soon
cease and that they would then be able to
reattain their previous high standard, as the
cadets would thus be enabled to spend a mini-
mum period of three years in the school, which
was necessary for the sound and thorough
training in tho various branches of work with
which an officer must be acquainted.
It was then announced that H.H. the Khe-
dive had been most graciously pleased to
confer commissions on the following :—Moha-
n,ed Harden, Cavalry. Ahmed Atieh, Artillery;
Ahmed Fahmi Ouni, Artillery , Mohamed
H unmet, 7th Battalion , Hasaan Mohamed,
8th Battalion . Hassan Suliman, 7th Battalion;

<head>GERMANY AND TURKEY</head<
<head>VERSUS</head>
<head>ENGLAND IN THE NEAR EAST</head>
<head>BY W.M.</head>
<head>THE DANGER.</head>
<p>The political shortsightedness that seems to
afflict the English people—which bears a repu-
tation second to none for a clear and precise
comprehension of the practicable—at certain
moments in its career, and notably, when
confronted with that critical phase in its
history, the outlines of which we propose to
trace, is one of the most remarkable pheno-
mena of contemporary history. Springing from
the union of carelessness and inattentiveness,
and from a combination of morbid causes and 1
effects, this political myopia grows more and
more serious. What oan be stranger or more
meloncholy than the torpor into which “watch- 
ful" Britain appears to be sinking when faced
by the danger that menaces her from every .
quarter of the horizon, a danger ubiquitous
and manifold, that may sot aim at the heart
of the empire which is guarded by the seas
but none the lees threatens to lop its members
in Africa end Asia and to sever its arteries 1
Germany prepares for the Titanic struggle of 
Empires that draws rapidly nearer, and with 
a science and sagacity only equalled by her
foresight, testa and examines every point in ,
the world wide armour of the British Empire; .
and like Prussia before Sedan or Japan before
Mukden she calculates and prepares die 
decisive blow. Meantime England, who recog-
nises the imminence of the stroke as thoroughly '
as her rival, concentratas her attention on
her rival and nothing else and falls asleep 
again as thoroughly satisfied that her head 
is safe as the proverbial ostrich, and as 1
careless of the rest The British refuse to !
recognise that they are still exposed, that
there are one or two points where an !
suomy’s blow will one day fall, points where
the essential parts of the Empire may
be separated from its brain-centre and the
whole body brought to ruin by their separa-
tion. They will learn too late that their terri-
ble armada will be of little value in the day 
of battle against the foresight and calculation 
of her opponent, whose armed forces will, that '
day, move unhindered against the British 1
Empire—on land.
It is strange and almost stupefying to note,
the one-sidedness and superficiality of the poli
tixal apperception of this people of sailors who
seem incapable of realising that Germany, the
00	on try of thinkers and calculators par excel
Lence, is doing her best to bring her continental
strength to bear on her foe should England
check the complete development of her strength '
on blue water. It is obvious that in case of
war she would keep her fleet in Kiel harbour
or up the channels, which no longer fear the
menace of the White Ensign based on Heligo-
land—the "Nasenklemmer” of the Elbe—and
would sow every channel, every strait and sea-
pass from Wilhelmshaven to the Belt and from
the Belt to the Konigsberg with the submarine
mines—sleeping but vigilant—to whose terrible
power the Russo-Japanese war bears witness,
while her torpedo flotillas and submarines
would emerge from the Jahde and the Bins,
from all the havens and creeks of the North
Sea and the Baltic, to harass the hostile fleets.
But can one even speak of coast attack by
fleets pitted alone against forts and mines after
the lessons taught by the Eastern war and the
Port Arthur campaign ! What fleet, ware it
four times as strong as the combined squadrons
of Britain, would dare assail unsupported the
coasts of the North Sea or the entrance to the
Baltic defended by all the organised might of
German genius It
The German Fleet once secures in its inacces
sible havens, what part is the British Navy to
play I It must confine itself to the observation
of the German coast and to attacks on German
commerce,—a species of warfare that is unlikely
to be attended by much glory or profit. Its
results would be practically nil. The German
merchant fleet would lie quietly immobilised in
home or neutral ports while Gorman commerce
would still be carried on under over of a
transfer to a neutral flag on every ocean. And
while England waits unable to grapple with
her elusive foe the main strength of Germany,
her continental strength, will come into play
perhaps without the employment it a single
Pomeranian Grenadier, against the crack in
Britain's armour whicb it will pierce like a
wedge.
It is with this end in view that Germany
has concluded tacit agreements and has—so to
say—added new members to her Empire to
which she is communicating her stark efficiency.
At the given moment she will have but to im-
press the given movement on these new wheels
of her military machine and they will tarn
irresistibly to fulfil her imperial designs.
It is the erstwhile "Sick Man” of Europe
rescued in his many death agonies by Eng
land’s active intervention, who trill be the prin-
cipal weapon, the steel wedge driven home by
German hands into the gaps of England's
weakened armour. Slowly, insidiously and
steadily Wilhelm II. has slipped through the
doors of the sublime Porte left open by his
rival enthusiastically bound for the Talley it
the Nile. Bash English step in retreat was
balanced by a German stop in advance, while
the Kaiser's policy was marked throughout by
consummate ingenuity and amazing discretion
and tact.
When England after Omdurman, showed her-
self vanquished by the attractions of the Dark
Continent, the last trace of Turkish sympathy
or confidence in her policy disappeared while
England, logically pursuing her policy of
expansion in African and in Mussulman —
territories did not hesitate to meet the surly
resentment of the 'Turk with defiance on the
Aden frontier and in the Arabian wastes.
: Then it was that Wilhemll. went in person
seal his pact with the shades of Ertoghrahl and
Saladin. For eight years his diplomatists had
prepared the completion and his officers had
ensured the utility of the treaty. Deaf to the
appeals of humanity horror-stricken by heca-
tombs of slaughtered Armenians, blind to the
stain on tho escutcheon of the German Empire,
he had eyes only for tho end of his polioy, the
creation of an Oamanli army that could serve
his ambition. Already imperfectly reorganised
by the great Moltke, the Turkish military
organisation had gone to rest again, and had
become an antiquated machine jarring and
creaking with every movement
But Moltke's work was taken in hand ones
more, this time with greater rigour, science,
and continuity, and above all with greater
freedom, greater secrecy, and a fuller apprecia-
tion of the military material of the Ottoman
Empire. Sober, teachable, sturdy, healthy,
fanatical with the desperation of those who
have all to lose, the Turkish troops possess
•very factor of brute force and only need the
coefficients of scientific leadership and organi-
sation to fulfil all the conditions imposed by
modern war. In the few years in which
Germany has applied herself to satisfy this
head all has bean renewed and reforged : the
military law, the general staff, commissariat,
communications, armament, fortifications, all
have been remodelled by Germans after the
German methods. In the midst of an unpro-
gressive Empire towers one great monument
of Progress—a new Tarldsh Army—and a part
of Germany’s armed strength.
Under the old organisation—or want of
organisation—what was most utterly lacking
and most urgently demanded by the military
reformer was a system of mobilisation and con-
centration dependent on strategic railway*
Under the pretext or economic or religions
needs Abdnl Hamid II. brought them into
being. In every province of his empire rail-
way construction began, confided to German
or at least to Continental companies, or
carried out at the expense of the Government
—as in the case of the Hedjaz line—and the
dames of the concessions in all that referred
to traffic or construction were drawn op by
the Turoo-German General Staff. Chemin de
for" spells “chemin de guerre" in the Ottoman
Empire and the most insignificant branch lines
have their value as means of concentration and
helpers in the scheme of attack.
In a series of articles appearing in the
"Egyptian Gazette" it has been shown dearly
enough (to those who read between the lines)
that the Hedjaz Railway is before everything,
not a line destined to serve the religious inter-
ests of Islam—as our credulous Moslems of
Egypt vainly believe—but a purely military
railway built to link the outlying provinces of
the Arab world with the Turkish centre, to
conjure thoughts of autonomy or independ-
ance in the turbulent provinces of the Hedjaz,
Aar, and Yemen, and to preserve the Black
stone of the Kaaba in the jewelled diadem of
the Imam of lstamboul.</p>

Suez, Wednesday.
The German steamer “Helene Rickmere,”
not being able to wait any longer for the
lighters which were left behind at Ras Gharib

<head>DAIRA SANIBH COMPANY</head>
<p>A special meeting of the above company 1
will be held in Cairo on the 8th July to ratify
the agreement entered into with the Credit
Foncier Egyptien. By the terms of the contract
the latter bays or takes over all the outstand
ing debts of the Daira Sanieh Company,
amounting to some eight millions sterling, by
the purchases of its lands payable by annual
installments extending over a certain fixed
period. The Credit Ponoier will, on its side,
charge interest at the rate of 5 per cent per
annum upon all sums repayable in fifteen years;
and in order to refund the £8,000,000 still due
to the company an arrangement has been
arrived at whereby the Credit Foncier will
augment its capital by a further issue of
debentures or shares. The balance has been
offered to be foind for the latter by a group,
with Sir Ernest Caasel at its head, in Paris and
London at 3  % annual interest plus 
commission, besides dividing between the
group and the Credit Foncier the 1 % represent-
ing the difference between the rate of interest
and commission of 4 % for the money to be
advanced, and the 5 % annual interest charged
by the latter, on sums repayable in 15 years,
the higher rate of 5  % for repayments
extending over 20 years not being taken into
account in the agreement.
The above terms for the liquidation of the
outstanding debts of the Daira Sanieh Company
are, we are given to understand, correct in
every detail and will be submitted, at the
extraordinary meeting of the shareholders of
the Credit Foncier Egyptian convoked for the
lame date, m, 8th proximo, for their approval</p>
