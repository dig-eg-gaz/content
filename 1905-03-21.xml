                    <head>THE RESULTS OF THE BATTLE.</head>
                    <p>The only news of the Russian Army today is that attempts have been made to
                        hinder the progress of the pursuers by destroying the bridges at Kai-Yueu,
                        which is a station north of Tieling on the line to Kharbin, and was
                        evacuated by the Russians on Saturday. We are in ignorance as to whether a
                        decision has been taken to halt only at Kbarbin, which is about 200 miles
                        north of Kai Yuen, or to keep up a show of fighting with the victorious
                        enemy at every point of vantage. But it is clear that no serious resistance
                        can he offered, for the other mighty host is an army only in name, a mob
                        with, or in many cases without, rifles, (duns, stores, ammunition,
                        transport, all are gone, and with them the morale of the army, the last
                        shred of confidence in its leaders. The demoralisation which it took two
                        months of the retreat from Moscow to accomplish, has been effected in and
                        fortnight of battle. The narratives which are now arriving, though they only
                        tell what one knew must be happening, represent the whole district to the
                        north of Mukden as an inferno of human suffering ; no medical service in the
                        .world could cope with the mass of wounded that have been flung upon the
                        Russian surgeons ; antiseptics, anesthetics, all that modern science has
                        devised for the mitigation of suffer, ing, are lost or exhausted, and amid
                        horrors indescribable, and confusion inconceivable, has come the end of the
                        great Manchurian Army. Yet for the moment Pharaoh has hardened his heart The
                        tales of horror and unparalleled disaster have had no effect upon the Tsar,
                        except to strengthen his determination. At the Imperial Council held last
                        week it was resolved to continue the war to the last gasp, to call out fresh
                        Reserves, and to mobilise another 400,000 men. In any country hut Russia it
                        would he impossible to treat such madness in earnest It took over a year to
                        bring up from Russia the army which has just undergone so frightful a
                        defeat; yet the rail way was in full working order, during the earlier part
                        of the war the confidence of the nation and the soldiery was unbroken, and
                        an unbroken force guarded the railhead. To collect a fresh army and
                        transport it to Men-ohuria is, probably, beyond the capacity of the Russian
                        Empire, however much the truth may be disguised from its ruler; and even it
                        such an army were to be organised, the inferiority of the Russians in the
                        battlefield has been only too painfully manifested. Yet^"granting all this,
                        we believe that for the present, at any rate, there is small likelihood of
                        pacific counsels being listened to. The Tsar has always believed implicitly
                        in the ultimate triumph of Holy Russia, and his obstinate disposition,
                        backed by his evil genius in the shape of Admiral Alexeieff, shows no signs
                        of yielding. You may break an autocrat, but you cannot bead him. The
                        Government, more over, have only too good a reason to dread the return of
                        the beaten army ; the tales which the disbanded soldiery would have to tell
                        must add fuel to the flames of revolution that already are gathering head
                        through every portion of the Empire. We can understand that a man so utterly
                        unacquainted with the realities of war as the Tsar has shown himself may
                        point to the vast untapped reserves of men in Russia, and to the nucleus of
                        an army still in Manchuria, and may declare that in his opinion the war is
                        only just begun. Nevertheless, there are signs that at the latest Council of
                        War the Tsar was made conscious of the gross decepitious of which he has
                        been the victim, and of the crisis to which ambition has brought him. There
                        is yet another card, however, which is being played by the war party.
                        Kodjest-veuskys squadrons are still intact, and by this time, alter their
                        practice in drill and in maneuvers, are a really formidable fighting force.
                        The stories of their unseaworthiness may be put aside ; ships can be
                        cleansed and scoured in still water without the necessity of being docked.
                        Still less is there any foundation for the idea that the Baltic Fleet will
                        be recalled. Rodjestveusky is a man of determination, and orders are
                        imperative, to seek out the foe now that there is no Port Arthur to be
                        relieved, and deal a blow which may, at. any rate, save the Russian naval
                        honor and give the Government at home something with which to allay public
                        despair. A drawn engagement, or even a lost battle in which the Japanese
                        suffered material damage, would be the first step to peace. We do not wish
                        to be understood as thinking that anything which Rodjestveusky may achieve
                        can alter the balance in the Far East He has come much too late, and even
                        supposing, what we do not think either probable or possible, that be
                        inflicted a decisive defeat of Togo, could he now do any. thing to interfere
                        with the Japanese army> in Manohuria 1 Oyama by this time is well nigh
                        independent of sea transport, and he has, apart from his own magazines, the
                        whole to the Chinese province to draw supplies from Besides this the
                        completion of the Chemulpo Pusan Railway has reduced the length of sea that
                        has to be traversed to a matter of 50 miles, while the tonification of the
                        Tsu-sima islands would render an effective block and most difficult even to
                        a more numerous and more efficient fleet. Rodjestveusky is not a real factor
                        in the operations of the war, but his failure or success may make a groat
                        difference in the willingness of the Tsar to accept terms of peace. There is
                        still another consideration even more potent than the obstinacy of a
                        military despot, and that is finance. It is clear that Russian resources and
                        Russian credit are strained to breaking .point. The gold reserve may not all
                        be exhausted, but the patience of French investors and German financiers is
                        wearing out The Russia debt coupons continue to be paid, but only by fresh
                        and reckless borrowings, and the time mast be near at hand when the stream
                        will run dry. Then, if not before then, will peace becoming inevitable, </p>

                    <p>The fifth ordinary general meeting of the shareholders, the National Bank of
                        Egypt was held in Cairo yesterday afternoon, when the directors submitted
                        the balance sheet and profit and loss account for the year ending the 31st
                        December, 1904. These show a gross profit of £397,737. 7. 8, of which
                        £154,630. 3. 3, derived from special investments, are exceptional profits.
                        Deducting rebate of interest, £13,656. 5. 3, and the current expenses,
                        £58,692 7. 2, there remains a net profit of £325,38$. 15.3. The following
                        distribution is hid down by the statutes of the Bank : 4 % to the capital,
                        or 8s. per share, £80,000, 10 % of t tenet profit to the reserve fund,
                        £32,538.17.6, 10 % to the directors, £21,284.19.9, leaving a balance of
                        £191,564.18, to which must be added the balance carried forward last year,
                        viz., 23,882.10.1, making a total of £215,447.8.1. The directors recommended
                        the payment of a dividend of an additional 6s. per share, which will absorb
                        £60,000 and leave £155,447.8.1. They further recommended that a sum ot
                        £125,000, to be taken from the exceptional profits referred to above, be
                        carried to an extraordinary reserve fund to be employed specially for
                        equalising future dividends, and that £30,447.8.1 be carried forward to
                        profit any loss new account. Each share will thus be entitled to 14s,
                        equivalent to 7 per cent, on the capital. </p>
                    <p>The following is the text of the speech of the chairman (Sir Elwiu Palmer) : </p>
                    <p>Gentlemen,I am glad to be able to lay before you smother satisfactory
                        balance-sheet Tho year 1904 has been a very prosperous one for the bank, as
                        the figures in the profit and loses account show. Irrespective of the
                        profits derived from the sale to part of our holding of agricultural Bank
                        shares, we are able to pro- pose a dividend at the rate of 7% as against 6%,
                        the dividend paid for 1903. in addition to the sum of £32,538, which, in
                        accordance with the statutes, is added to the ordinary reserve fund, we
                        propose to carry £125,000 to the extraordinary reserve fund, to which we
                        have also added the premium, less expenses of issue, on the 50,000 shares
                        issued in 1904. If you approve of the £125,000 mentioned above being carried
                        to reserve, we shall then show a total reserve amounting to £862,000, which
                        would be about doubled if we took into account the present prices of the
                        Agricultural Bank shares u e still hold, instead of showing them at their
                        nominal value. The . work of the bank in all its branches has considerably
                        increased. Our deposits, which at the end of 1903 amounted to £1,670,000,
                        wore at the end of 1904 £2,131,000. Since the close of the year we have
                        opened branches iu the chief town of each province to cope with the
                        Government work ; the surplus Government funds being now paid over to us and
                        on our branches by the different Government Departments by cheque. Tho
                        opening of these branches involves no doubt extra expenditure, but I hope
                        that in course of time they will be of considerable profit to the bank.
                        Another very satisfactory feature of the year is the increase in the
                        circulation of notes. The average circulation during tho year 1904 was
                        L.E.454,000, against L E.218,000 in 1903. On the 31st December, 19u4, there
                        were in circulation L.E.5^8,000, while on the 51st December, 1903. the
                        circulation was only L. E. $82,000. Since tho close of the year the
                        circuation has exceeded L.E. 800,000. It is evident that the notes are
                        becoming much more popu- lar and it will not be long, I hope, before we
                        reach a circulation of a million. The increase of work generally has
                        involved higher salaries and a larger staff. Much credit is due to the whole
                        staff for the efficient way in which they performed their duties. In the
                        course of the year Mr. Abdy, who has rendered considerable service to the
                        bank, resigned his appointment of Sub Governor and we were lucky in obtain-
                        ing the services of Mr. Dickson, who was mana- ger of the Ionian Bank at
                        Athens, to take his place. Mr Rowlatt, whose services are invaluable, has
                        .become the senior Sub-Governor.</p>

                        the presidency of Boghos Pasha Nubar, on the 17th inst, deliberated upon the
                        proposed building to a national school, and after a lengthy dis- cussion
                        decided on erecting the new school, not within the precincts of the church,
                        as was at first intended, but in a fashionable quarter of the city Three of
                        the members were deputed to secure a plot of ground of about 3,000 metres in
                        a suitable position. The new building is to contain three different
                        sections, for boys, girls, and a Kindergartern. </p>
                    <p>Before dispersing, the chairman, Boghos Pasha N Ubar, expressed his
                        astonishment at the fact that iu the whole of Egypt not a single institution
                        for the commercial training of the European youth existed, and expressed his
                        intention of erecting, at his own expense, a Commercial High School for the
                        Armenian youth in Cairo. All present congratulated his Excellency on this
                        munificent offer and the session closed. </p>
                    <p>We understand that Boghos Pasha Nubar has set aside a sum of 1,000,000 fre.
                        for this school, and has already secured the site for its erection.</p>

                        him well He was repeatedly called before the curtain and received an ovation

                    <p>Egyptians are very strong on the London Stock Exchange. The "Financier" of
                        March 13 remarks : </p>
                    <p>Whether the present revival in Egyptians is the harbinger of a coming boom is
                        beyond our ken, but we can vouch for the quiet but persistent way in which
                        shares are being aK sorbed both on Cairo and home account This morning, for
                        instance, it was the only section with any vitality in it Practically all
                        the leading market counters met with supported, despite a steady downpour of
                        rain, dealings were kept up to a comparatively late hour in the Streeta
                        circumstance which clearly points to the fact that some, at any rate, are
                        nervous of being caught "short," as was the case when Nile Valleys had their
                        sharp spurt just before the close of last year. Some exception seems to have
                        been taken to the proposal of the Urarus Company to raise more capital in
                        order to increase th stamping power,seeing that the old shares still have a
                        liability of 5s. attaching to them. The market as a whole, however, was
                        disposed to regard the scheme with favor, it being argued that the
                        capitalisation can well stand a slight increase, and thus the company would
                        then be left with a substantial amount of uncalled capital for future
                        contingencies. It is, however, highly desirable that development work should
                        he pushed ahead with all speed, as the present 9,000 tons of ore available
                        will not go far even on the present basis of opera- tions, to say nothing of
                        the additional stamp- ing power on the tapis. </p>
                    <p>The "Financial Times" of March 14 remarks: </p>
                    <p>Chief interest centered on Egyptians in the Mining markets again to-day. A
                        very fair amount of business is reported to have been transacted in these
                        descriptions, and the result was that the improvement in values made further
                        progress. Market men are looking for continued activity in this section, in
                        connection with which there are greater potentialities than with either the
                        Kaffir or Westralian departments, the Egyptian gold mining industry being in
                        its infancy. It is the "glorious uncer- tainty" that encourages speculation,
                        as has been more than once remarked, and it is thought that Egyptians, by
                        reason of their unknown possibilities, and in view of the movement in prices
                        that has occurred during the last few days,are likely to receive increased
                        public attention in the near future. There was some profit takingly House
                        speculators during the latter part of to-day's session, and in some cases
                        closing quotations were under the best, but the movements on balance in this
                        section were all in favor of holders. The chief changes were in North Niles
                        and Block "Es," the former rising 5/32 to 2 15/32 and the latter 3/32
                        further to 1 27/32. Sudan Mining Syndi cates, which rose £ on Saturday, put
                        on 3/16 to-day, and "Mummies" closed Is. higher at 198. 6d. after touching
                        19s. atone time. A small advance was again scored by Um Rus, at which mine,
                        a cable now reports, crushing was commenced on the 6th instant The shares of
                        a new concern, "Egyptian Options," were introduced on the market to-day, and
                        after considerable dealing the price closed l£-lf. </p>
                    <p>The " Financier " of the same date also states: </p>
                    <p>Having repeatedly remarked on the absur- dity of the supposition that any
                        resumption of activity in these markets must necessarily take root in the
                        Circus, we may perhaps be pardoned a mild "chortle" at the seeming
                        correctness of our view. As on Saturday, Egyptians have again practically
                        monopolised attention in these markets. Precisely what has brought this
                        particular sphere of speculation into favor may be best explained by the
                        wonderful pro- gress the country is making, the growing po- tentialities of
                        the mining industry, the cheap- ness of money, and last, but not least, the
                        want of a speculative arena wherein the inves- for and the speculator alike
                        are afforded an excellent opportunity of stepping in on what practically
                        speaking, the ground floor. It is the natural course of things that the tide
                        of prosperity which at present permeates the gilt- edged markets should
                        gradually turn into more speculative channels. Egyptians have the ad-
                        vantage of starting with a dean slate. Thanks to the careful administration
                        of Lord Cromer, the "wild-cat" dement is non-existent All the companies are
                        floated on a sound commercial basis, and whatever the investor or the specu-
                        lator dabbles in, he may be sure of a fair run for his money. It need not
                        invasion surprise, therefore, that, with business waking up in all
                        directions, the Egyptian Mining market should be receiving serious
                        consideration. At any rate, the volume of business transacted in this sec-
                        tion to day, compared with that in other directions, justifies the
                        precedence we have given it Dealers again report a substantial demand from
                        Cairo, and, in addition to the business executed on home amount, there was
                        the further redaction in the hear posi- tion to take into account. Several
                        venturesome spirits, tempted by the lengthy stagnation of the market, have
                        allowed themselves to go jtort of certain shares, with the result that Khey
                        now stand a fair chance of being "caught," and are thus helping the movement
                        along by their efforts to take ©over. It seems invidious to single out any
                        share for special comment, as the rise is so general.</p>

                        PROCLAMATION</head>
                    <dateline>Jerusalem, March 12.</dateline>
                    <p>General Booth, the "Father" and founder of the Salvation Army, arrived here
                        in the afternoon of the 8th inst. on his first visit to the Holy Land,
                        accompanied by Commissioner and col, Major Cox, and other officers of his
                        staff, having been preceded a few days previously by Colonel Lawley, his
                        private secretary, and Colonel Roussel, Under-Secretary for "Foreign
                        Affairs," to make all necessary arrangements in connection with the
                        General's visit to the Holy City. It appears, however, that before leaving
                        England the Turkish Embassy in Loudon was communicated with in order that
                        they might obtain the Forte's sanction for holding an open-air public
                        meeting at Jerusalem, and that they received assurances that their
                        application would be attended to. The suspicions of the .Ottoman Government,
                        however, were aroused as to the real object to a meeting in Jerusalem,
                        considering the title of the organization, and more especially their motto
                        "Blood and Fire," which sounds to a Turk not unlike that of a revolutionary
                        body. Orders were consequently sent to the Governor of Jerusalem not to
                        allow General Booth and his followers to hold or address meetings in public
                        and to take all precautions to prevent Ottoman subjects attending any of
                        their meetings. These unexpected injunctions caused disappointment to the
                        aged leader and his party, but the difficulty put in their way was overcome
                        by au arrangement with the American Missionary Alliance to use their
                        "tabernacle" as a gathering-place, and accordingly a series of meetings were
                        held in that hall. On each occasion the place was densely crowded with
                        people of all sects and denominations to hear General Booth's addresses,
                        which were translated into the vernacular Arabic. The inhabitants were much
                        impressed by the earnestness and noble qualities of the great preacher, who
                        was listened to with deep interest throughout, the braided too lies and
                        jerseys attracting at the same tune up little attention. On Saturday, 11th,
                        the principal European residents, including the Consular Body and the heads
                        of the Christian religious missions and communities, were invited to meet
                        General Booth at the Hotel Hughes. Most to those invited attended, and alter
                        the usual introductions the General spoke of the romance of his work, and of
                        the shaping of that great fabric which is known to day as the Salvation
                        Army, relating how 35 years ago he was denounced,persecuted, and ridiculed
                        as an eccentric fanatic, but that despite all opposition he had resolved to
                        movement the films of the great cities of the world, and with perseverance
                        had worked on rusting in God and the Gospel to give him victory sooner or
                        later. How he toiled from one inside to another, regardless of all criticism
                        id opposition, until he laid a solid foundation, and be felt proud in saying
                        that now the rich and the poor, the king and the peasant, the Jhrfs'ian and
                        outcast, all recognized that be had introduced a new and effective agency to
                        battle with misery, misfortune, vice, and crime through Christian charity,
                        to which work he dedicated the whole of his life. The speech in general was
                        a review of the organization. General Booth enumerated the branches of the
                        work, and the number of the institutions and homes founded in 49 different
                        countries of the world, giving details and figures os to their inmates, and
                        the enormous masses benefiting by those charities. He referred with a
                        feeling of gratitude and emotion to his visit to Jerusalem as one of the
                        happiest events to his life. It was, he said, a ..Teat privilege bestowed
                        upon him by his Master to spare him until now to fulfill a life- me's dream.
                        At the close of his speech the general received a splendid ovation from the
                        audience, and the British Consul proposed a vote of thanks to General Booth
                        for the interesting address, to which he briefly rm s ponded. Despite his 76
                        years, General Booth is a hale and potent figure, vibrant with the energy
                        which testifies to an earnest purpose within. It is impossible to view his
                        patriarchal presence without an instinctive deference to the degree </p>

                        pedestal of esteem and obedience as he occupies. Though not gifted with
                        eloquence or suavity of speech he possesses a homely genuineness, a friendly
                        naïveté which is over in head, and a sympathy a broad as his purpose is
                        direct General Booth visited all the important historical places in and
                        around Jerusalem, and the most noteworthy event in connection with his visit
                        is that of bis reading and signing the following proclamation on Gordon's
                        Calvary, which was done privately in thou presence of his suite and a few
                        friends. During the signing of the document the Salvation Army banner was
                        unfurled over the head of the General. He leaves Jerusalem to-day for Jafla
                        and will embark to morrow lor Fort Said on his way to Australia for the
                        third time. The following is the text of General Booth's proclamation :— "On
                        behalf of the outcasts, a call from Jerusalem to all who name the name of
                        Christ throughout the world. " The dream of a lifetime is fulfilled. I am in
                        Jerusalem, at the very heart of scenes for aver hallowed by my Lord and
                        Master's life, buffering, and death. i " I have visited Bethlehem and in
                        imagination listened to the Seraphic anthems with which the Angels ushered
                        Him unto the world. I have walked the streets of the city once trodden by
                        His sacred feet I have stood on the brow of Olivet, and gazed in deepest
                        sympathy on the pitying tears wept over the Godforsaken people who were
                        about to shed his blood. "I have looked on other places made memorable by
                        their connection with the tragic incidents of His earthly career. For just
                        he, they have shown me the Pool of Siloam, the village of Bethany, while in
                        the distance they have pointed out to me Nazareth, Jericho, and the Jordan.
                        They have showtime the reputed sites on which the Temple stood ; the place
                        of the Master's betrayal; the Palace of Herod ; and the Judgment Hall where
                        Pilate condemned lira to die. And as I thought upon that Hall saw once wore
                        the Crown of Thomas, the Mocking Robe, the Mimic Reed, the cruel scourging,
                        while down through the ages I seemed to hear again the frantic cries of the
                        mob, 'Crucify Him, Crucify Him.' "With indescribable feelings I have prayed
                        in Gethsemane Garden, ascended the Hill called 'Calvary,' and worshipped
                        with reverent awe on the very ground where the Cross of Shame was erected on
                        which my Lord purchased by lis broken heart sufficient Sovereign saving
                        grace to meet the needs of the wild human race. I have looked into the empty
                        sepulcher where cold in the arms /of death my Savior lay. Then passing on I
                        have wonderingly beheld the mount from whose summit He ascended triumphant
                        over death aDd Hell to plead with the Father the cause of the world He had
                        so gloriously redeemed. And as my eyes rested on those sacred scenes, again
                        and again has the question suggested itself, "Why all this suffering, why
                        did He die, and for what did He die t" And then I have remembered the answer
                        which came from His own blessed lips. Luke XIX. 10. "That was His commission
                        received from the Father, and as His Father commissioned Him, so He
                        commissioned His Disciples. And if we are His disciples our task is the
                        same, namely: the Salvation of the Lost. "About the length and breadth of
                        that commission there can be no mistake. Beyond question it comprehended
                        then and comprehended to-day the conditional deliverance of every one from
                        sin, irrespective to nationality, character, aDd condition.— "By tho Grace
                        of God Ho tasted for every man," "Whosoever oomph to Him He will in nowise
                        cast out," "He was and is still the Savior of the world." "Judging from the
                        state of the world to-day, has not the unbeliever some ground for
                        pronouncing the Mission of Christ a failure I "Notwithstanding all oar proud
                        boasting respecting the advancement of the World, could this outcast section
                        be much more unlike the kingdom of Heaven He came to establish, or more
                        closely resemble the kingdom of Hell 1 "Look at the brutal, selfish,
                        senseless, inhuman wars by which the poorer classes are the greater
                        sufferers. "Look at the chronic state of starvation, in which millions
                        slowly waste and bitterly wail until delivered from their misery of the
                        pauper grave. "Look at the countless array of drunkards held in the iron
                        chains of demoralizing appetite. Think of their desolate wives, children and
                        homes, their rapid return to the jaws of death, their.exclusion from Heaven
                        and their doom in Hell. " Look at the hideous slavery involved in the
                        shameless harlotry abounding in the entries of Christianity, with all the
                        debasing results that fell in its brain. "look at the melancholy multitude
                        of criminals shut behind prison bars, for whose regeneration, for this world
                        or the next, little or no intelligent effort is made. "Look at the gay,
                        frivolous crowds abounding everywhere, who in the paltriest pursuits waste
                        the sacred opportunities given them to bless their people and prepare to
                        meet their God." </p>
