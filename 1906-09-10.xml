                <div type="item"> <head>THE FUTURE OF COTTON.</head>
<p>In an article on "The New Cotton Season," the "Manchester Guardian” gives some useful particulars regarding the future propects of the cotton supply.
The circumstances of the cotton market at the opening of the current season, 1906-7, says the writer, differ considerably from those which attended the opening of the last season. The visible supply is smaller, stocks are smaller,
but the growing crop looks larger, or much larger, than the last. Demand for goods and yarns and consequently for cotton seems fairly well assured for the present at least, although the congested state of some of the foreign markets suggests some doubts as to the probability of a persistence of the demand through out the whole season on the healthy and profitable scale of this year. Two years have been spent in filling up the depleted stocks of the world, and now some symptoms are apparent that this process has been approximately completed, if not already somewhat overdone. If such should prove to have been 
the case the season may be less profitable to both spinners and manufacturers than the last. But for the present, with old orders on
hand, no immediate change is in sight. New- crop cottons are likely to be in demand, and business may be done just as soon as the new
crop begins to supply those grades and staples the want of which has of late perplexed the spinner. As regards the supply, appearances favour larger crops of cotton in America, India, and Egypt, but in each case the planter has become more powerful to resist declines in price and has learned how to market his cotton to greater advantage. These circumstances forecast a time during which cotton may resist a decline, and also a time during which manufacturers and spinners may resist any serious attempts to reduce cloth and yarn values. In addition there is always speculation to be considered, and speculation in America is likely to be an effort to raise prices unless general opinion as to the size of the crop should decide that it is very large. In that case crop questions may overrule such resistance to a decline as may be offered by operators and planters. At the present time the appearances are in favour of an abundant supply, and unless some disaster is in store for the new crop there can be no scarcity this season.
If we assume that the demand for yarn will suffice to keep all spindles running during 1906-7 the actual consumption of cotton may be expected to expand. New mills spinning American and Egyptian cotton have come into active work, and more yarn is now being spun in Lancashire and elsewhere than ever before.
As some set-off against this increase there is the strong probability that the “wasty" character of the 1905-6 crop may not be repeated. On the Continent, outside Russia, trade would appear to be healthy, and in the United States large crops should continue to prolong healthy trade conditions. A large consumption may therefore be expected. There are, however, uncertainties in the outlook which may affect the situation. The probabilities as to price would on the whole appear to favour the view that during the current season a lower range of values may be seen than last season, even on a similar visible supply, but that good harvests and a full buying capacity throughout the world will tend to prevent the occurrence of very low prices at any time or will render them of temporary duration only. The strong and sustaining stimulus of a buoyant trade may be absent, but a sufficient business should be possible to prevent an extreme depression in prices. The increased demand has prepared the markets of the world for a large crop of American cotton, and they will not be demoralised should the present promise of plenty be generously fulfilled. On the other hand the markets are absolutely unprepared for a small crop, and have no sufficient reason at present to anticipate disaster. Still it may be remembered that crops which have looked promising enough have before now suffered terribly from frost in the autumn, and whether or not substantial damage occurs there may easily be enough unfavourable weather to afford an opportunity for influencing the market. All such considerations and possibilities may have to be taken into account, and precautionary measures may for a time prevent any decline of real importance ; but in the end the size of the crop will be decisive. In the meantime—for some months to come—uncertainty will continue, in the midst of such uncertainty the world’s cotton business will have to be done. At the present moment, looking forward six months, a full supply of cotton seems more assured than a full and sustained demand for cloth and yarn, but all the accidents and chances of the new season are before us and many changes in the outlook may occur before the season comes to an end.

And simple as it was, the oriental temperament managed to introduce into it a charm of its own, dashed by a diablerie that was quite western and “advanced” at that. The process, of course, necessitated the uncovering of the chest and shoulders, but at the doctor's approach, the Princess, with one graceful motion, brought down her hair in a rich mantle that covered her besom. Having enchanted him by this maidenly action, she then proceeded to astonish him by lighting a cigarette —and such a cigarette. The paper was encrusted with brilliants. She offered one to the doctor, but his confidences do not permit us to state whether or not the offer was accepted. The Princess is 18 years old.

                <p>The Maltese Colony at Alexandria celebrated on Saturday their national fête, which is on the anniversary of their delivery in 1565 from the Turks. On this occasion the Maltese Philharmonic Society, “La Valletta," gave a ball in its rooms at Minetel Bassal, and the function was in every respect a great success. The place crowded with “jiuvintur” and “shbeibiet," who did terpsichorical justice to the event. The rooms were artistically decorated with the flags of Malta, which included those of almost every epoch and what with the armoury of the Knights of St. Joho, Maltese Grosses, and the vernacular, the fancy translated one to far-off Strada Reale. The excellent orchestra was under the able conductorship of Maestro Pipiò. We congratulate the committee on the success which attended their efforts. The Maltese Colony in Alexandria numbers 8,000 souls, who are engaged in varions crafts and trades, the commercial sense being highly developed. The Maltese Benevolent Society was founded in 1882 by Mr. Salvatore Grech Borg, and in addition the Colony have a school, the Maltese Victoria School, which is a memorial to Queen Victoria, and a Philharmonic Society. the "Valletta.” Mr. Leandre Camilleri is the indefatigable president of all these institutions. The Benevolent Society does good work amongst the indigent of the Colony in the form of money, food, and medical relief, administered by the executive members. The entire Colony in Egypt numbers 15,000, and they are mostly the children of emigrants who landed here long ago. Under the Egyptian sun they have found more room for their activities than that afforded by their cramped little island home, and living a simple life, they have amassed considerable wealth.

            <div type="item"><head>THE SHOUBRA CRIME.</head> 
                <p>M. Hébert, the expert chemist, submitted his report to the French Consulate at Cairo, on Saturday morning. This report states that:
                    (1)	the stains found on the door are not blood
                    (2)	there were none on the pavement of the landing, (3) the marks on the bed-clothes might be due to some malady, or menstruation (4) but that the stains on the shirt are of blood. M. Hébert counted six on the cuff which had been smeared by washing, whereas those on the shirt front had been left untouched. The shirt belongs to Paillard senior, who however denies that the stains are of blood, declaring that they are due to melon juice or wine drops. He deposed to having washed tips shirt several times without being able to remove the stains, and called for a counter analysis. Pàillard senior some days after the crime having cashed a fifty pound note at a certain house, the Consular Court has summoned the proprietor of the house to compare his evidence with that of the witness who gave information regarding this payment. Paillard senior therefore has to hold himself at the disposal of the Court. Such was the tale of Saturday’s investigations into this mysterious affair. The Court had by then recovered from, its annoyance at the absurd conduct of a young Italian who after giving a lot of sensational evidence, withdrew it on Friday as having been given in jest. The majesty of the law took a different view of such foolishness, and severely reprimanded the clown. Had it condemned him for contempt of court it would have served him right.
                    In the afternoon the Arabs who saw the body of Scopeliti being carried from the house to the sakieh were examined, and they swore to its having been laid down thrice.

                <p>A native gentleman writes to “Al-Minbar” to the effect that, having asked one of his friends who recently returned from Europe by the “Hohenzollern” as to whether the statement published in “Al-Minbar” in connection with the Prince and Helbawi was true, he replied, “I was not present when Prince Mohamed Aly Pasha refused to hold out his hand to Helbawi Bey ; but I observed on board the steamer that the Prince, showed marks of discontent with everyone who had any conversation with Helbawi. As I made the  mistake of interviewing the Bey  on some business matter, I dared not in consequence approach the Prince in order to salute him.
                    Dr. Mohamed Bey Hassan sends a violent letter to “Al Minbar” on the character of Helbawi Bey, whom he accuses of inconstancy. He says. ;—
                    “Your fickle policy is evident for you first were a supporter of the Arabist Party against the English and the Khedive. Sometimes you hated and at other times you were friendly to the English. Your friendly policy is proved by the report you made to Lord Kitchener, while a sample of your Anglophobe sentiments is seen in your article, entitled “Where are we being led ?” After you published that you again became friendly to the English and adopted a policy hostile to Egypt and its people despite the fact that you are a native born Egyptian. The tendency of your policy is proved by the part yon played in the Denishwai case. which contented nobody. All these actions show the way your ambition leads you, or maybe they are dictated by a desire to be appointed, a judge in the Court of Appeal.
                    “However, each personal questions and quibbles are of no interest to me, but what does astonish me and everybody else, who was a passenger in the ‘Hohenzollern,’ is that you venture to contradict the fact that the Prince refused to receive you.”

            <div type= "item"><head>THE SUEZ CANAL ROUTE.</head></div>
            <div type= "item"><head>A NEW COMPETITOR.</head>
                <p>A new and serions competing route to that by way of the Suez Canal is coming into notice. In a little less than six and a half days, that splendid ocean-going steamer, the Empress of Ireland, has accomplished the passage from Liverpool to Quebec. This, surpasses the previous quickest voyage by over, six hours, and it is anticipated that mails to the Eir Fast by the Canadian route will be landed fully a week before those via Suez arrive. From a commercial stand-point, that is, in itself, a fine gain, but there are others and greater strategically. From start to finish, this newest connecting link between Great Britain and her Far Eastern possessions, including Australasia, is either on the ocean which she commands or on British territory. Being thus circumstanced, it is necessarily far safer for the transport of reinforcements than the Suez short out can ever be during war; that mast remain exposed to the danger of being blocked by an enterprising enemy, and also to flank attack through Asia Minor. Furthermore, it is quite possible that the All-British line of communication will be so improved as to render it preferable for the dispatch of troops to India as well as to the Far East. There is the additional consideration that Japan justifiably expects her Western ally to adopt all feasible methods for promoting mutual helpfulness, both naval and military, against a common enemy. Of course, the brilliant success of the Canadian endeavour, does not afford the slightest reason for neglecting the older lines of communioation. On the contrary, we should heartily welcome any material acceleration of the voyage round the Cape. But in the matter of Imperial connections, whether on sea or on land, England can hardly have too many strings to her bow.

                <p>To the Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette.”
                    Sir,— With reference to the announcement which appeared in the “Egyptian Gazette” of the 4th inst. under the above heading, that the Company have decided not to take over the business of Mr. E. Kirby and Co. As there must be grave mistake somewhere, I would ask for a correction, as by the letter from the Secretary dated 29th June last to the Share- holders—-which I enclose—it states “The purchase of the business of Messrs. Kirby. and Co has also been carried out on advantageous lines, etc., etc ” It is well known that the name of Mr. Louis Sinclair attached to anything means a guarantee of the success of the undertaking. If notices which are apparently erroneous, as in the present instance, appear, it must be detrimental to the undertaking.
                    Thanking yon in advance,
                    I am, Sir,
                    Yours faithfully.
                    "A Shareholder."
                    Cairo, 8th September.</p>
                    <p>The following is the text of the letter above referred to :— The Commercial, Industrial and Land Co. of Egypt Limited.
                    11, Queen Victoria Street,
                    London, E.C.
                    June 29th, 1906.
                    To the Shareholders.
                    Dear Sir or Madam,
                    I am instructioned by the Directors of the Commercial, Industrial and Land Company of Egypt. Limited, to inform you that in addition to the number of the shares taken up in England, more than £100,000 was subscribed in Egypt, and that therefore the underwriters were not called upon to make good their contracts.
                    On the incorporation of the Company the Directors appointed Mr. Louis Sinclair, of 7, Netherhall Gardens, London, N.W., as Managing Director, and he at once proceeded to Egypt to investigate the various properties which were under option as stated in the prospectes, with the result that he was able to make most satisfactory terms with the owners of those businesses which the directors have decided to acquire.
                    Most advantageous terms have been arranged for the purchase of the businesses of Messrs Koster and Co., and Messrs Kirby and Co., and Mr. Ablitt, the manager and partner of Messrs. Kuster and Co., has shown his confidence in the new undertaking by accepting Shares for almost the entire amount of his firm’s purchase price which has been considerably reduced, from the amount originally asked.
                    The purchase of the business of Messrs Kirby and Co. has also been carried out on advantageous lines -in this case the company taking over the business on payment of a sum equal to the value of the stock, less the amount of, the outstanding liabilities. This sum is to be fixed by valuation and in no case is to exceed the cost price of the stock, and payment is to be made by means of a certain sum in cash and an almost equal sum in shares. The Directors are confident that by the amalgamation and assimilation of these two and other businesses, they will shortly be able to meet in Egypt that great demand which exists tor steel and engineering goods and shipbuilding requisites, and that by strict economy and legitimate enterprise they will be able to place the business of this company on such a footing as will command the complete confidence of its many shareholders.
                    Yours faithfully,
                    Alfred Bunbury, Secretary.

            <div type= "item"><head>ALEXANDRIA MUNICIPALITY.</head> 
                <p>To the Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette."
                    Sir,—The Alexandria Municipality might take a lesson from the London County Council, which has just enacted one of the most useful by-laws which it has made in its eighteen years’ existence.
                    “No person shall deposit in any street or public place, to the danger of any passenger, the rind of any orange, banana, or other fruit, or, the leaves or refuse of any vegetable.”
                    Orange peel and banana skins have been responsible for a goodly share of London’s street accidents, and the careless wayfarer who flings fruit-rind into the roadway and on the pavement now runs the risk of having to pay a fine not exceeding forty shillings. The by-law has not come a moment too soon, for a London hospital surgeon estimates that during the present holiday season, with excursion parties casting their refute in every direction, 80 per cent, of the broken-leg cases treated at his institution were due to the patient having slipped on a banana-skin or the rind of other fruit.
                    Instance companies and medical men will also be affected by two other by laws which the County Council simultaneously commenced enforcing. They read as follows :—
                    "No person shall (1) sweep or otherwise remove from any shop, house, or vehicle into any street any waste-paper, shavings, or other refuse, or being a costermonger, newsvendor, or other street trader, throw down and leave in any street any waste paper, shavings, or other refuse ; (2) throw down and leave in any street, for the purpose of advertising, any bill, placard, or other substance; (3) throw down and leave in any street any bill, placard, or other paper which shall have been torn off or removed from any bill-posting station.
                    "No person shall throw, place, or leave any bottle or any broken glass, nail, or other sharp
                    substance (not being road material) on or in any street or public place in such a position as to be likely to cause injury to passengers or animals or damage to property.
                    If the Alexandria Municipality made similar by-laws, and insisted on their being carried out the amenities of existence in this city would be considerably enhanced.
                    Truly yours,
                    An Old Resident.
                    Alexandria, 3rd September.</p></div>
                <div type= "item"><head>PURIFICATION OF ALEXANDRIA.</head>         
           <p>(TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.")
               ir,—The police will be no more able to rid the streets of Alexandria of demi-mondaines than were their confrères of London, assisted as they were, some years ago, by the 'shrieking sisterhood’ of whom Mrs. Ormiston, Chant was the well-meaning prototype. The “Social Evil" is as rampant in the towns of England now as ever it was. Is it to be supposed for one moment that with the Capitulations in force and the hands of the Government more or less fettered in dealing with evils of any kind, that this particular evil, for which a remedy is now- sought, will be one jot abated ? I very much doubt it. Why not take the bull by the horns and, to a certain extent, recognize it and legalize it? Japan and everything Japanese is very much in evidence just now. Why not do as they do in Japan ? Streets of buildings are set apart for the occupation and use of this class and they are never seen in the streets.
               There is too much maudlin sentimentality over this question. Like the nettle it wants to be firmly grasped and dealt with first of all from a humanitarian point of view, and not merely in the hustling from pillar to post of these women, which your correspondent “J.P.‘ complains of. Let men remember that in very many cases their own sex has been primarily responsible for the occupation of these women, and let them devise merciful means in dealing with them. Chiveying them from street to street is no remedy, and only tends to ridicule. After all there are worse practices than these women cater for. Anybody who has practiced in Criminal Courts in the Levant knows that the vice generally imputed to the Turk is rapidly gaining ground amongst other nationalities ont here. So, Sir, there are worse things than these unfortunates, and if the Govern ment will localize and legalize them they will have adopted the only method which, up to this date, has been anywhere "devised to cope with or regulate an evil which may be "social,” but which the centuries have taught us will always be a necessary one.—Your faithfully, 
               J. Gooding.

            <div type="item"> <head>COLLECTIVE REPRESENTATION.</head>
                <p>There is a book just published which ^e should like to see in the hands of every British manufacturing engineer and every agent who has to deal with British machinery. 
                   It is not because such people are likely to find in it anything which cannot be found by searching through a variety of catalogues ; but it is, to the best of our belief, the most practical and compact catalogue of a group of engineering firms which we have seen up to the present day. It is neither elaborate nor pretentious, but it is very much to the point Apart from its value as a work of reference, it serves to point a moral that we have often emphasised in these columns, and that is the advisability, when possible, of British manufacturers acting collectively with regard to their representation in countries where competition is keen and the market does not justify the establishing of individual branches for each firm. Essentially is this the case in Egypt, and it is to the catalogoe just issued by the Egyptian Engineering Company, Limited, of Chareh Kasr-el-Nil, Cairo, and 20, Tothill Street, Westminster, that we are now drawing attention. This company, started last year, must not be oonfounded with any other companies with somewhat similar names. It represents some twenty five British engineering firms, who between them profess to cover every conceivable item in the way of engineering products which are likely to be required in Egypt, and we understand that nearly all of the firms concerned are shareholders in the company. The chairman is Sir Thomas Richardson; of Messrs. Richardson, Westgarth and Co., and
                   his colleagues on the board of directors are Mr. T. Perceval Wilson, of Messrs. Easton and Anderson ; Mr. Walter May, of the Pulsometer Engineering Company ; Mr. Herbert Ballard, of the Tees Side Bridge and Engineering Works ; and Mr. H. K. Baynes, the managing direotor in Egypt. The specialities of the twenty-five firms, for the purpose of the catalogue, are divided into fifteen sections, as follows:—Waterworks and Irrigation Machinery;
                   Steam Turbines and Steam Engines ; Gas Engines and Gas Producer Plant ; Oil Engines of all types ; Steam Boilers of all classes; Steam, Water, and Gasfittings ; Electric, Hydraulic and Power Lifts ; Electric, Steel Hydranlic, Power, and and Cranes ; and Iron Bridges ; Constructional Steel and Iron Work and Wire Ropes; Refrigerating Machinery;
                   Agricultnral Machinery; Steam Dredgers;
                   Railway Material and Contractor's Plant ; and Electrioal Plant.
                   We have not space here to deal in detail with this very complete book, the whole of which has been embodied in but few more than 300 pages. The particulars are in every case as full as is possible within its compass, and its vaine is enhanced by the fact that at its commencement there is a carefully worked out system for comparing British, Continental, and Egyptian weights and measures and coinage.
                   The system of collective representation by British manufacturers is not new, and those attempts that have hitherto been made have not universally proved successful. The great and difficult problem to solve is to hit upon a group of manufacturers who can work together amiably, and whose products will not clash with each other. There is a secondary consideration which has to be borne in mind, and which in its way is almost equally important, and that is that steps must be taken at the other end to ensure that each manufacturer shall receive his due in the way of attention to his interest by the local representative.</p></div>

            <div type="item"> <head>MUNICIPAL. (With apologies to Ruyard Kipling and others.)</head>
                <p>It was an August morning about half past ten o’clock.</p>
                <p>I was driving in a buggy from the “Posto” tp the lock, .</p>
                <p>When presently the horses saw, and quivered on their feet, .</p>
                <p>A municipal steam roller careering down the street. .</p>
                <p>I couldn’t see the engineer behind the heaps of sand, .</p>
                <p>When suddenly it crossed my mind the ma-chine was out of hand. .</p>
                <p>I didn’t care to meet it, the horses would not stay, .</p>
                <p>So the driver turned the horses round and made for the subway. .</p>
                <p>The buggy was an old one, and wallahi it did bump, .</p>
                <p>And collided with the subway pier just by the drainage pump. .</p>
                <p>Twas there I fled for refuge while the horses put down uttered squeals, .</p>
                <p>As the roller fiercely crushed them with its seventeen ton wheels. .</p>
                <p>It seemed to want its driver, so I fled distraught with fear, .</p>
                <p>And left the awful chaos surveyed by its en-gineer. .</p>
                <p>Then I sought the City Elders and my words
                    were very plain, .</p>
                <p>And the bash mohandiz carries now a flag before the same. .</p>

            <div type="item"> <head>ATKINS IN AFTER LIFE.</head></div>
            <div type="item"> <head>SOME OBVIOUS AND OVERLOOKED CONSIDERATIONS.</head>
                <p>By at least five Parliamentary Committees which have taken evidence about the employment of discharged soldiers and sailors, and even by the lut and beat of these Committees, whose Report is fresh, one inquiry has been shirked. They have never ascertained the actual magnitude of the problem. This omission is strange- A number of time-expired soldiers come every year into the labour market, sound in mind and body, and it is suggested that, in view of their special merits and disabilities, places should, u far u possible, be found for them in certain departmental and municipal occupations. It would seem to be essential, in any inquiry u to this proposal, to know the annual numbers of such men and places.</p>
                <p>Until they are approximately known, and given to the public we can judge neither of the practicability of any such idea nor of what might and ought to be done, during the soldier’s term of life with the colors, to equip h'm for civil duties. Whatever is possible, whether in the way of finding public appointments for him or in preparing him for the open labour market, it will he done vaguely and wastefully if it is ever done at all, at all, and we shall never be sure that our responsibility towards Tommy Atkins is being discharged. It is a responsibility rather keenly realised just now. It not only induced the late Government to appoint the Committee whose Report is before us; it is felt, by all who dread compulsory service, to be a responsibility which can only be evaded at the cost of fostering the demand for that alternative. Beyond question, the difficulty of recruiting out present Army, and of getting intelligent men, especially, to join it, is largely due to the fact that soldiering handicaps for men for the rest of their lives. You may regret this for merely selfish reasons, then. Or you may say frankly and fairly, as the Committee do : “We require certain work to be done for the safety of the Em-
                    Pire, and young men to do it. As private employers our habit is to reward with higher wages or continued employment men who are diligent, or skilful, or well-behaved. As public employers we have to discharge the men after seven years, unable to compete on level terms with other out of-works. We ought to make it up to them.”</p>   
                <p>The Committee express regret that strong representations made by former Committees have had so little effect “The State should at once take steps," they say, “to carry out such important recommendations, and to place itself on at least as favourable a footing as other employers." They “most earnestly urge that definite instructions should be issued to the various departments that ex-soldiers and sailors are to be given a prior claim to employment in the various posts in the Government service” which they might fill. Can this be done more effectively on this Report than upon any other? We do not believe it can. Such "strong representations" beat the air. The effective inquiry, when made, will be a strict inquiry as to the number of men and the number of places. These latter being set out in detail, definite instructions may be enforced; and it may then appear that the State, after all, has not places enough to meet the demand.</p>
                <p>This is what we ought to know, absolutely and exactly. For it can easily be shown that, if we are to assume, as a State, the whole responsibility, there must be at least four times as many appointments given to soldiers and sailors as there are sound men annually discharged from the Army and Navy.</p>
                <p>Here are the bases of calculation : Let the average age at discharge be taken at twenty- seven years. (This may be found too low, in fact, but, until the fact is ascertained, no higher age can safely be assumed.) A discharged man received into civil employ by the State is retained, if he lives and remains serviceable, until he reaches the age of sixty-five. That is to say, he works (sixty-five minus twenty-seven) thirty-eight years. Roughly, that is five times as long as he serves with the colours, and means that five times as many men must be employed in any year as are token on that year. Allow for deaths and other casualties, and four times as many does not seem to be an excessive estimate.</p>
                <p>What is the number of men annually discharged? According to Captain H.F. Wilkinson, secretary to the National Employment Association, it. appears to be 44,000, and at these (or in addition to these—the Report is not dear) 4,000, are medically unfit, and incapable of performing hard work. Their condition is not, by the way, any fault of the Army or navy system. If the unfit be subtracted from the total we have 40,000 men in want of civil employment, and four times this number give a total of 160,000 places to be found for soldiers and sailors. If they ought not to be subtracted the places are 176,000.</p>
                <p>The Committee did attempt to obtain a return of the places actually filled by ex- soldiers and ex sailors in Government departments. The Office of Works and the Army Accounts Department failed to make this return. Their employees apart (not numerous), the number of such places appears to be only 16,013—a figure one obtains by making the addition of details for one’s self. What was not attempted, and should have been, was to get at a total of the number of places which, in the Committee’s opinion, might be available. They have set ont a list of such places (omitting the the Post Office) in four appendices, but have not ascertained the number of them for every kind of employ. The kinds of employ with numbers attached account, however (including the Post Office), for 30,283 place, and if the</p>
                <p>rest may be taken to afford as many in proportion the total will be about 32,000. This, or something like it appears to be the whole number of Government places which, with the best will in the world, this Committee could indicate u available. Five times u many are required, it seems. ("Pall Mall Gazette.")</p></div>

                <p>The German police in the Reichsland is busily purging the Christian names of the French inhabitants from their national taint It need scarcely be added, perhaps, that the means employed would not be called squeamish. A restaurant keeper had attention drawn to him because his name was Guillaume. In vain the man protested that he had been entered on the civic register as Gaillanme ; he was roughly told that the name would have to be Wilhelm or nothing, and so now he appears as "G.W.” After this the hairdresser by command to the Kaiser, when in Srasburg, whose name is François without giving ombrage to the Kaiser, was taken in hand. The police demanded that Franz be substituted, if he wanted the Emperor’s patronage to continue, and so now Franz it is. It seems a pity there are no means of testing the legality of these proceedings.</p></div>
            <div type="item"> <head>DIVORCONS !</head>
                <p>Even the Frenchman who wrote this incitement to untieing the marriage knot, and dramatised the idea to the delight of Paris, would probably be quite satisfied with the progress that is being made in. the United States. Mr. Rossiter, chief of the Census Bureau, has been investigating the unlovely subject, and the few figures in which his conclusions are embodied may almost startle the easiest in such matters. His researches go back for 20 years, and he finds that within this period the divorces granted in all the United States Courts touch the very round figure of one million. What results he would have discovered had he carried his inquiry back, say, to 1870, one almost trembles to think. Dakota doubtless graduates in this competition “with honours,” though we are left so far in the dark u to details, but New York City stands for 50,000 divorces. The system almost revives the system of marriage daring mutual pleasure in an ancient Rome.</p></div>
            <div type="item"> <head>FACTORY LASSES' FANCIES.</head>
                <p>The Lancashire correspondent of Lloyd’s News’, says the present boom in the
                    cotton trade is producing a noticeable spirit of vanity amongst the bulk of the
                    female operatives in the County Palatine. Dressmakers, costumiers, and dealers
                    in cosmetics in Bolton, Farnworth, Walkden, Eccles, Pendleton, and other south-
                    east Lancashire towns say they never remem­ber having had a more prosperous time
                    than daring the present sommer. Many of the weavers are earning 22s and 24s per week, and some of them think nothing of paying 18s and 20s for hats and £3 and £4 for dresses. They are also displaying a marked penchant for cosmetics and scents. They use the latter in such quantities, whilst following their employment, that the odour can be detected by all who the factories.</p></div>
