                    <p>If the statement that M. Delcasse is the real author of the now famous
                        articles in the "Matin" is correct, the ex-Minister of Foreign Affairs has
                        played his country a sorry trick in giving the world what common sense would
                        have left unwritten and unsaid. Germany is still a dangerous power to
                        provoke; the failure of her forces against the Hereos does not imply that
                        they are unfitted for European warfare, their tactics, however unlike those
                        of the Man- churian campaign, differing in no essential from those employed
                        in the French manoeuvers, and the idea that a great anti-German conspiracy
                        had been formed at the time of the first difficulties that arose from the
                        Kaiser's visit to Morocco might enlist millions who have hitherto offered
                        lukewarm support or frank opposition to the IMperial policy, in the cause of
                        "Gott, Kaiser, and Vaterland." There is no question that the German military
                        party, if unwilling to face France and Russia, would welcome the oppurtunity
                        of encountering France single-handed, and the British offer of 100,000 men
                        would not save the situation were the French armies to be overthrown on the
                        frontier. We prefer to believe that M. Delcasse is too good a friend of his
                        country and of the Anglo- French entente, to risk the future of both by so
                        strange an in- discretion. To publish the British offers to aid France, to
                        indicate the British plan of campaign, and to irritate German Chauvinists
                        and French and British diplom- atists alike is not worthy of a diplomatist.
                        The articles are more probable the work of some ingenious and sensational
                        journalist anxious to see the "Matin" sell well, but even so they will not
                        improve the continental situation, terribly strained by the efforts of
                        Chauvinists, and complicated by the Austrian difficulty and the financial
                        and military reverses of Russia. That an understanding between France and
                        England is necessary, we admit; understandings are often the parents of
                        alli- ances, but that the publication (or invention) of military and
                        diplomatic correspondence of the highest importance exchanged between the
                        two powers with a view to meeting an attack by the third, seems to us to be
                        an extra ordinary error of judgement, calculated, unless promptly denied; to
                        precipitate the event to avoid which the entente was sealed.</p>

                    <head>MESSAGE TO BRITISH ASSOCIATION.</head>
                    <p>On hearing of the impending visit of the members of the British Association
                        to Cairo, H. H. the Khedive immediately sent his aide- de-camp Major Watson,
                        D.S.O. to meet the scientists on their arrival,and to inform the President
                        that the Khedive wished to wel- come him and the other members of the
                        Association to Egypt, and expressed the hope that their stay would be most
                        pleasant. H. H. the Khedive was graciously pleased to put one of his Nile
                        steamers at the disposal of the visitors on whoso behalf the President sent
                        a warm message of respect and thanks to his Highness. </p>

                    <head>SUICIDE OF A BRITISH SOLDIER.</head>
                    <p>The adjourned inquest into the cicum- stances attending the death of Private
                        Charles Harris of the 2nd battalion of the Rifle Brigade, by shooting
                        himself in the head at the Citadel barracks on Monday morning, was resumed
                        yesterday at the British Consulate.</p>
                    <p>The first witness called was Sergeant Willian Walker, who was on duty at the
                        main quarter guard, and who related how he found the body of the deceased as
                        already mentioned in out previous issue. He stated in answer to a ques- ion
                        that about sic months ago he noticed a change in the demeanor of the man,
                        who seemed more than usually quiet and reserved.</p>
                    <p>Four other witnesses were then examined, but their evidence was of little
                        importance. The sixth witness was Private James Wood of the same company who
                        deposed that he had known the deceased for three years and was his best
                        friend. He met him last on Saturday at the canteen and he seemed in his
                        usual spirits, but about two weeks ago, Harris told him that he had quite
                        enough of the troubles at home. The deceased, however, did not say of what
                        nature, these troubles were. In answer to a question from one of the jurors
                        the witness said that Private harris had never in the cosafd of conversation
                        led him to think that he had any intention of taking his life. The next who
                        gave evidence was Colar Sergeant Michael Josephy, who had inspected the kit
                        of the dead man and found a letter addressed to his mother. This letter was
                        opened by the coroner and handed to the jury to read. It was undated, and
                        stated that the writer was quite tired of the troubles he had to go through.
                        The witness added that the deceased was a very dull man and backward in his
                        drill. In answer to a question from a juror Sergeant Joseph said that he had
                        never complained to him about being annoyed by any of his comrades.</p>
                    <p>Captain Claude Kidd Morgan, of the R.A.M.C., was the last witness called. He
                        deposed having been called at 6 o’clock on Monday morning to examine the
                        body, which was found near the tennis court with the rifle lying near it and
                        pointing upwards. The cause of death was a rifle bullet, which had entered
                        by the mouth and come out the back of the head, lacerat- ing the base of the
                        brain and causing instan- taaeous death. Witness had no doubt whatever that
                        the wound was self-inflicted, as he saw that deceased had attached one end
                        of his boot lace to his right foot and the other end to the trigger of the
                        rifle.</p>
                    <p>The jury at 1.15 p.m., without retiring, gave a verdict of suicide whilst
                        temporarily iusame.</p>

                        represented Plymouth in Parlis- ment from 1841 to 1852 and Marlebone from
                        1854 to 1859, when he resigned his seat owing to continued ill health, and
                        was called to the House of Lords. During his membership of the House of
                        Commons, he held the appointments of Lord of the Treasurt and Secretary to
                        the Poor Law Board, the former from 1846-7, the latter from 1849-51. The
                        deceased earl is succeeded by his son, Viscount Ebrington, born 1854.</p>

                            the S.S. Nabia, which went aibore in'the Red Soa some days ago. On his

                            Nabia had boon re- floated, that she was very badly damaged, and that
                            she would proceed to Suez at once, and asking him to oontinne on there
                            immediately. Aooordingly Mr. Brnoe went to Suez by this morning’s

                    <head>THE DAY OF ATONEMENT.</head>
                    <p>While in all countries it is interesting to note the observance of various
                        religious festi- vals and fasts, it becomes doubly so when, as is the case
                        in Alexandria, nationalities too numerous to mention are gathered to- gether
                        under one roof to take part in the service of the day. In the: “Referee,”
                        four years ago, Mr. G. R Sims (who writes as "Dagonet” under the heading
                        “Mustard and Cress"), gave a very graphic account of a visit he paid to the
                        East London Tabernacle in the Mile End road (which had been lent to the Jews
                        for the occa- sion) on the Day of Atonement. Here, of course, would be
                        gathered together a vast number of the foreign Jews who people White- chapel
                        and Bethnal Green, and Mr.Sims bore testimony to the earnestness that marked
                        the demeanour of all present at this solemn service. This was equally marked
                        in the synagogue in Rue Temple Menasce, where, under the gui- dance of my
                        friend Rudolph I attended the service on Sunday evening last. We entered the
                        buildiug-abont 6 o’clock and fonod it crowd- ed. Men, youths, and young
                        boys, almost with- out exception wearing white scarfs with coloured ends,
                        filled the synsgogaue to its utmost capacity, the porch also being full. In
                        the gallery high up ladies were sitting, but as only the front rows were
                        visible from below,their numbers could not be estimated. Shortly afterwards,
                        the Sanctuary was opened by the Chief Warden, Mr. Joseph Gore, and the
                        Scroll of the Law enclosed in elaborately ornamented silver vessels, three
                        in number, was brought out. The Reader then, from the steps of the
                        Sanctuary, read the Grand Prayer seven times, the congregation repeating it
                        after he had finished each recital.</p>
                    <p>The silver vessels containing the Scroll of the Law were then carried round
                        the building. During the progress of the procession the Chief Warden
                        beckoned us to come to the Sanctuary steps, and after he had restored the
                        scroll to its place an closed the Sanctuary doors for another twelve months,
                        kindly in- vited os to accompany him to his seat. For some time we sat and
                        listened to the prayers read from the marble desk in the centre of the
                        building by the Reader, which were attentively followed and responded to by
                        the congrega- tion. We stayed till what is called "the silent prayer,"
                        uttured in a very subdued tone by all present, had been said, and then left
                        the Syna- gogue. I learned that the service would be continued until about
                        10 o’clock, that the building would remains open all night, and that at an
                        early hour on Monday morning prayers would be resumed and continued all day
                        (with short intervals) terminating soon after six o’clock, when the
                        exhausting fast won d be at an end. On the following day I visited the
                        synagogue for a short time in the early afternoon, during an interval. A
                        subdued conversation was going on, but not of a character calculated in the
                        least to mar the solemnity of the occasion, and no signs of exhaustion were
                        apparent. This I thought somewhat remarkable, considering the strict nature
                        of the fast as from before sunset on the ninth day of the month Tisri till
                        after sunset on the tenth, no kind, of food whatever must he eaten, nor even
                        a drop of water taken.</p>
                    <p>When one reflects on the regularity with which this fast is observed year
                        after year in all countries—for there are few where the Jew is not found—it
                        is more easily understood how the race has survived all the persecutions of
                        past centuries, and the possibility of their reunion some day in a country
                        of their own, if not in Palestine. No more severe test of con- formity to
                        ancient laws and customs could be found than the “Black Fast” of the Jews,
                        and few religions could be found now-a-days, the professors of Which men,
                        women, and children—would go through the ordeal of 17 hours abstinence from
                        food at a stretch, once every year. The wonderful vitality of the Jewish
                        race remains as strong as ever. Efforts to proselytise meet with scant
                        success, and indeed such methods as those exposed in a letter written to the
                        editor, of the “Ga- zette” a few months ago—and allowed to pass
                        unchallenged—only go to show the im- mense stability of the ancient religion
                        of the children of Israel, and the difficulty in the way of those who would
                        lessen its influences.</p>

                    <p>It is recognised that emigration can seldom aot as a complete remedy for the

                        from ooontry to country, according to its proportion to the total popula-

                        on the vast population which finds itself in a sort of cul de tac whenoe
                        there is no going backwards towards the north or west, and the only escape
                        is by sea. There is still room for relief of congested districts by internal
                        migration, though, ao far, the pressor? of a short food supply has ‘not yet
                        reached a severity efficient to overcome' tho ' innate inclination of

                        enter more into the food supplies of nations is due to prejudice.
                        Grasshoppers are eaten by some tribes. Ground up; they make a meal that is
                        said to be both nourishing and agreeable. Many a white man has passed
                        through a country, believing himself nearly starving, as large game was not
                        to be had, when worms and various insects were at hand. The most singular
                        food, in all probability, is the larva of a fly common in certain portions
                        of Califoraia, and known as ephyara. This insect is found in such vast
                        quantities in Lake Mono, California, that it is washed up on the shores and
                        collected by bushels. The water of Mono is very singular, seemingly very
                        heavy and smooth, like oil, so much so that it resists ordinary wind and
                        refuses to become ruffled. When the larvae begin to appear the Indians
                        gather from far and near and scrape them up, place the wormlike creatures on
                        cloths and racks in the sun and dry them, when they are beaten up and
                        husked, looking then like rice. That the larvae are nutri- tious is shown by
                        the condition of the Indians, who soon grow fat on the rich diet. On Lake
                        Texcoco in Mexico, a curious fly is found which also is eaten by the
                        natives, and known as ahuatl; the eggse of the insect, which are dopsited on
                        edges, are also collected and eaten for food. On Lake Chalco a certain edge
                        is cultivated on which the eggs of a species of fly are deposited. Bundles
                        are made of these and placed in Lake Toxcoco for the purpose, and, when
                        covered, the sedge is beaten over pieces of cloth and the eggs secured.
                        These are collected and ground into a meal, also called abuatl, and are in
                        great demand on fast days, when fish is required, the insects of eggs not
                        being considered flesh, as they come from the water. The food is made into
                        small cakes, and tastes not unlike caviare. Not only the eggs, but the
                        larvae, themselves a disagree- able looking worm, are used as food , under
                        the name of puxi.</p>
                    <p>The civilised man, perhaps, turns from such food with disgust, but it is well
                        to remember that epicures in many countries are particularly fond of cheese
                        when in- habited by the larvae of a common fly. In England the large
                        octopus, or squid, common on many a coast, offends the pa- late, but the
                        Italian, Frenchman, or Port- ugnese eats it with avidity and considers it a
                        delicacy. The meat is clear and white, like chicken, and has the flavour of
                        crab. We find the Chinaman selling eggs of un- known age, especially duck
                        eggs containing ducklings ready to be hatched. Shark fins - a tough,
                        disagreeable food — are in demand, while deer horns in the velvet and
                        lizards of various kinds are eaten. The nest of the swallow, with its
                        embedded secretion of the mouth glands of the bird, is worth nearly its
                        weight in gold. Trepan, the tough, im- possible holothurian, is eaten, and
                        its col- lection is an important industry along the Malay coast, valued at
                        the least at £20,000 per annum. In France the sea anemone is used as food;
                        stuffed and boiled it calls to mind crab or crayfish. The sea-urchins of
                        various species are also used, cooked in their covering, like an egg, and
                        eaten with a spoon.</p>

                        tastefully furnished homes. It is made in 70 artistic tints, and only
                        requires the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is quickly and
                        easily applied with a whitewash brush, with half the labour and at one third
                        the cost of paint. HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures cleanliness, and is pleasing to
                        the eye. It appeals alike to artistic and practical house decoration. HALL’S
                        DISTEMPER is of special value in hot climates. Owing to its cool, pleasing
                        colours, great weather-resisting and germ-destroying properties, it lends
                        itself to every kind of wall, wood, brick or stone coating, possessing all
                        the advantages of paint, colour- wash, and disinfectant at one third the
                        cost of oil paint. It never blisters in the hottest sun, and the fact that
                        it can be washed adds greatly to its sanitary advantages.</p>

                    <p>Russia, of conrao, thoroughly grasps the fact that the Anglo- Japanoro
                        allianco is intended, in the first place, a» a guarantee against any attempt
                        upon her part to upsot the state of things created by the war. That is
                        nndouiable; but, as organa like die often inspired "Russ" perceive, and as
                        we are assured the Russian Government also perceivo, this does not mean that
                        the alliance embodies- a polioy of offence, whether directed against Russia
                        or against anybody else......................</p>
                    <p>We have given Russia a gage, by ouV - attitude in Persia throughout tho war,
                        that we do'not deairo to teko any unfair or un- generous advantage of her.
                        Wo might easily have adopted a forward polioy in that decay-, ing Monarchy
                        while Russia had Japan upon her hands, had we ohsrished the boundless and
                        unscrupulous ambitions so often assigned to ns. We did nothing of the sort,
                        and we may fairly hope that so signal a proof of our fairhess and of our
                        self-denial will be imputed to us for righteousness. Ciicumstauced as Great

                        been expected, eeems inclined to believed that the Treaty is not neoesa-
                        arily a menace to any jaat interests of her own. It. does guarantee Japan
                        and fygl*Dd •'against any idea of a Russian "revanche" for her late

                        reasonable object Further than that, it is aimed-solely at the conservation
                        of poace and, consequently, at . all who would make themselves mischievous

                        seconding his M»je*ty’« efforts. On the present oooasion, we gather,
                        considerable oontroverry is likely to be excited by the ' question of the
                        curative value of the collection of tubercolons patients in sanatoria. To
                        the mere layman it wonld seem that there is, obviously, something to b* said
                        both against'and for the practice. On the one hand, the opponents of
                        sanatoria argue that the congregation of patients together cannot mke for
                        the extirpation of the bacillar. On tbe other, it is unquestionable that it
                        is only- in establishments where a number of patients are treated together
                        that it is prao’ic ally possible to give them the fnll advantage of the best
                        treatment Tho question, however, is one which it wonld be idle for the

                        are pregnant with the greatest moaning to the British Empire. The Mtn in the

                    <p>Duriog he past few m,nths Germany's shipping in the Far East has been
                        advancing at an onermons rate. Not many yean ago tho passenger traffn to
                        China was divided betwoen the P. and 0. Company and (ho Me* aogeries
                        Maritime?, but from the tinte that the Norddentscher Lloyd started to
                        oompete with two or three of their smaller boats the po- pularity of the
                        older linee diminished. And the German company has steadily gone forward
                        since that time Bigger and better boats havo been pnt on tho service; other
                        fleets (indu- ing well-known British companies whioh were considered as
                        established for ever) have been acquired, until now perhaps the
                        Norddentsohnr Lloyd is the leading passenger line in the ! Par East.</p>
                    <p>Eomo of the best passenger ships soon at Hong KoDg are these fine liners
                        under the German flog, and a regular sorvico is ran between Hong Kong,
                        Borneo, Singapore, and the Southern seas. 8ince the 8oottiah Oriental Line,
                        sailing between Hong Kong and Bangkok was bonght up, the Kaiser's mercantile
                        flag has taken first place at the Siamese capital, while it is seen as olten
                        as the red ensign in Singapore </p>
                    <p>While some dozen yean ago British ship- ping was almost without a rival in
                        the Par East, it has now to contend against three or ifoer powerful
                        competitors, more or less sup- ported by their own Governments; 8inoe the
                        •United States acquired the Philippines their commerce has made giant
                        strides, and the Bri- tish tonnage trading with Manila is gradually growing
                        less. Japan, too, has boon slowly ob- taining a footing in these Far Eastern
                        ports, and bor competition will be felt more than ever now the war is ovep.
                        Most of tier best trading vessels have been employed by the Govern- ment
                        daring the war, and they will revert to their proper faqction, while tho
                        charters of foreign vessels which have taken their places will be cancelled,
                        although for the next, month or two large nombers of vesae's will doubtless
                        be required ’to carry the big army bock to" Japan. Also the Japanese have
                        become pos- sessed of a number of fioe merchant vessels daring the coarse of
                        hostilities, and these will be available for trade purpose?. And if an-
                        other eigh* are to be built on the Clyde it can easily be foreseen
                        whatstrenuous times for the shipping trade are ahead in the Far East, even
                        if the volume of trade Aritfij Korea and Man- if the volume of trade

                    <p>If Britain is to retain the bplfc'of this trade there mast be no conferences
                        and rioga to discriminate against British goods, and the Government mast
