                    <head>WHAT IS WHISKEY?</head>
                    <p>The decision of the London magistrate, Mr. Fordham, last week on the subject
                        of the whisky problem is described as momentous. The following article from
                        the "Daily Telegraph" on this epoch-making decision will therefore be read
                        with interest. It may be as well to state at once that indignation is a mild
                        term by which to describe the feeling excited in some quarters by the
                        magisterial pronouncement. Needless to say, however, opinion is divided on
                        the subject. In one direction there is something like jubilation at the
                        result of the Islington test case. In others it would hardly be too much to
                        say that consternation has been occasioned.</p>
                    <p>It seems, after all, that the queetion really ought to be—"When is whisky not
                        whisky?" But, in as much as the whole problem teems with complications and
                        technicalities — a "blend" to be avoided at all costs—a dear conception of
                        the main issue is at least desirable. Let it be understood, then, that there
                        are, roughly, two kinds of whisky. There is pot-still Whisky and there is
                        patent-still whisky. The difference is beautifully simple. The first— and
                        genuine—article is distilled from pure malt; the other is not. It may be
                        made, apparently, from almost anything. Technically, the "whisky" which is
                        not malt whisky is "grain," or "patent" spirit, and it may be derived from
                        maize, or rice, or molasses, or even potatoes. The question, then, upon
                        which Mr. Fordham had to adjudicate was whether spirits made in patent
                        stills, with an infusion— quantity unknown—of pot-still whisky, could be
                        legitimately sold to the public as Scotch, or Irish, whisky. And he decided
                        in the negative. He went further, and said that such staff was not whisky at
                        all. And, not to mince matters, be euded by calling it a "fraud."</p>
                    <p>This decision means, paradoxically enough, that a good many thousands of
                        people who have been drinking "whisky" ever since they grew up may now plume
                        themselves and comfort their teetotal friends—if they have any— with the
                        reflection that they have, probably never tasted it in their lives. And the
                        decision also means—unless it be reversed upon appeal —that in future a new
                        name will have to be invented for the "grain" spirit, which contains only a
                        proportion of malt whisky, and for the ''blends" which have become so
                        popular in recent years. Someone has suggested "whiskyette." But that would
                        be horrible. On the other hand it is hard to believe that anyone would like
                        to be overheard asking for "special patent-still spirit." It is a difficult
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, what is the opinion in the trade? As has been said, it is divided,
                        as was only inevitable. In order that a representative view might be
                        obtained on the side of the blenders,Messrs. James Buchanan were approached.
                        But at the London offices of this well-known firm nothing was to be elicited
                        except the laconic statement that "Mr. Buchanan is away, and in his absence
                        that matter cannot be discussed." In another quarter no less representative,
                        the assurance was forthcoming that the decision of the North London
                        magistrate would most certainly be contested, and that steps were already
                        being taken for an important meeting in the trade to be held, at which a
                        definite plan of action should be agreed to. In the meantime, this authority
                        added, it was desirable that Mr. Fordham's decision should not be "publicly
                        condemned."</p>
                    <p>A representative who called at Messrs. Gilbey's secured from one of the heads
                        of that firm a complete endorsement of the magisterial view. "We have always
                        maintained," he said, that when the public ask for whisky and get the
                        patent-still stuff they are being imposed upon. Of course, if people prefer
                        to drink a blended brand they are perfectly entitled to have it. But they
                        ought, at any rate, to know exactly what they are buying, and most certainly
                        they ought not to be made to pay as much for the one thing as for the
                        other."</p>
                    <p>In support of this view it was explained that the difference in the price
                        between pot-still and patent-still alcohol was as much as 2s 3d per gallon.
                        Yet practically the same is often charged for a bottle of "blended" whisky,
                        containing only a small proportion of pure malt, as for that which is
                        genuine pot-still "Scotch" or "Irish." "No wonder," it was added, "enormous
                        profits have been made by the sale, at prices charged for the more
                        expensively produced article, of blended brands, palmed off on the public as
                        'Old Highland Whisky.' Between the one thing and the other there is just as
                        much difference as exists between margarine butter and pure butter. And the
                        public have quite as much right to be protected against the one class of
                        brand as the other. Those who prefer margarine can always get it. But the
                        law allows of no deception in the matter."</p>
                    <p>In other directions similar views were expressed in support of the result of
                        the Islington proceedings. Incidentally the opinion was hazarded that far,
                        too much laxness has prevailed in regard to the Adulteration Acts. The
                        uninitiated will be interested to learn, on high authority, that Ireland, in
                        the matter of its whiskies, enjoys a far purer record than does Scotland.
                        "At no good distillery is Ireland," it was affirmed in one quarter, "is
                        patent spirit used" ; and in Dublin, at all events —whatever may be the case
                        in Belfast—there is probably no such thing as a patent-still." On the score
                        of the deleteriousness of much of the so-called whisky told all over the
                        country (London, it will be-readily believed, is felly supplied with the
                        article), there seem to be no two opinions. But, on the other hand, nothing
                        like unanimity, to judge from careful inquiries, exists as to whether the
                        "blended" concoction really is injurious, as compared with pure malt
                        whisky.</p>
                    <p>Certainly there is ample evidence that a large section of the public favours
                        the mild "whisky" (the description henceforth must be used with caution)
                        which is produced from a fusion of "silent" spirit and malt. But a fluid of
                        which 90 per cent. is innocent of the latter, and is only a year old, mast,
                        it will be generally admitted, leave a good deal to be desired. It was
                        asserted last weak that 70 per cent of the "Scotch" whisky put upon the
                        market consists of grain spirit. And it was further declared that the
                        "whisky" prepared for shipment to the Colonies, in the generality of cases,
                        was worse even than that concocted for consumption in England. This would
                        seem to be a matter in which some form of "protection" might even meet with
                        the approval of the present Government.</p>

                            a large and appreciative audience. The programme was quite up to the
                            usual standard of the concerts given by the society and would have been
                            difficult to improve upon, each item being received with warm approval.
                            Piano solos were excellently rendered by Miss Mary Lopez, violin solos

                            Miss Calogeropoulo, whose splendid singing was received with enthusiasm.
                            Messrs. Rynd and Dodwell also contributed to the programme and were very
                            successful. The sincere thanks of all present and of the society are due

                            and came in this morning to Abdeen Palace, where he received in audience

                        <p>His Highness will receive Lord Cromer this afternoon. Tomorrow morning he

                        <p>On the occasion of the departure of Baron Rucker-Jenisch the Khedive will

                        <head>THE FRONTIER QUESTION.</head>
                        <p>The Coast Guard cruiser Nour el-Bahr returned to Suez yesterday from
                            Akaba and reports that there is no change in the situation.</p>
                        <p>We may state, however, that the report published in the European Press to
                            the effect that upwards of 6,000 Turkish troops are encamped at Tabah,
                            is absolutely without foundation. Under ordinary conditions the water
                            supply at Tabah would not suffice for the needs of more than a hundred
                            at the outside. Even if new wells had been sunk by the Turks it is
                            highly improbable that the post they have established at this point is
                            held by more than 150 men. In fact it is considered to be unlikely that
                            the Turks could effect a concentration of more than 5,000 in the whole
                            district, which is notoriously waterless and produces nothing in the way
                            of vegetation but camel thorn.</p>

                        <p>Alert II. writes in the London "Financier" : —Egyptian Estates, Limited,
                            completes its first financial year on March 3, but as the report will
                            not be ready for a few weeks some information as to the company's
                            operations which I glean from recent issues of the "Egyptian Gazette"
                            may be of interest. One of the most important transactions was the
                            purchase of the entire capital of the Chaba Land Company, consisting of
                            40,000 shares of £1 each, whereby 2,600 faddaus of agricultural land in
                            the neighbourhood of Dossouk were acquired, together with a one sixth
                            interest in the Boullos Land Company, in which the Delta Land Company is
                            also interested to a similar extent. A further 2,200 feddans on the
                            Mahmondieh Canal, at Atteh were bought from Mr. Ama bile Cumbo. The
                            Egyptian Estates was victorions in both the cases of pre-emption brought
                            against it in regard to the purchase of land at Siouf, and it has now
                            entered into occupation of this property.</p>

                    <head>SOMETHING NEW FOR THE TOURIST.</head>
                    <p>In the latest issue of our East African contemporary "The Globe Trotter" the
                        Editor remarks :—</p>
                    <p>The new Cairo to Cairo route via the Uganda Railway offers the blase tourist
                        something new, novel and interesting. The diversity of scenery and the
                        continuous exhibition of wild game can nowhere be equalled. From Mombasa to
                        Nairobi thence to Entebbe on the great Lake Victoria Nyanza affords one a
                        continuous panorama of the wonders of nature. From this great inland sea to
                        Gondokoro and Khartoum, the oldest travellers will find a virgin route. I
                        learn from Messrs. Thomas Cook and Son that the large number of enquiries
                        have necessitated their compiling some information for intending travellers.
                        The comforts to be had on the Uganda Railway and the palatial Lake steamers
                        are too well known to dwell on. The journey from Entebbe to Butiabi on Lake
                        Albert Nyanza one hundred and eighty miles distant can now be done
                        comfortably in a ricksha. Rest-houses have been erected at a distance of ten
                        miles apart all along the road, which is kept in good condition. Telegraph
                        offices have been established at three stations along the line. From
                        Butiabi, Lake Albert is crossed to Nimule, a seven days journey, in smell
                        boats. Porters and food should be taken for the entire caravan, as neither
                        can be obtained at Nimule. From here on to Gondokoro the rivers seldom give
                        one much trouble and are easily crossed in canoes with the aid of a wire.
                        Regular steamers ply between Gondokoro and Khartoum, leaving the 29th of
                        each month and arriving at Khartoum the 10th of the following. The last
                        steamer from Gondokoro which will provide victualling and a cook, will leave
                        on Feb. 28th, after which date it will be necessary for one to make their
                        own arrangements for food and also take with them a cook. From Khartoum to
                        Wady Halfa you have the comforts the Sleeping and Dining Cars the Egyptian
                        Railway affords, after which Assouan, Luxor and Cairo by rail or Cook's
                        palatial Nile steamers.</p>

                        <p>With reference to the statement that the Bank of Abyssinia had offered to
                            take over the payment of the coupons in arrears of the Ethiopian Railway
                            Company in exchange for the privilege of levying a special custom duty
                            of 10 per cent., the Paris correspondent of a financial contemporary is
                            asked to state that there cannot be a question of coupons in arrears,
                            but rather of the surtax on the merchandise traffic to which the
                            Ethiopian Railway Company is entitled, and which could not be collected
                            during the last two years, thus rendering a distribution of dividends
                            impossible. The reported offer of the Bank of Abyssinia purports an
                            advance of 800.000 fr., which is about equivalent to the total of the
                            Burtax in arrears.</p>

                            "Marriage."</p>
                        <p>Although the subject is prehistoric, and legions have tried it with
                            varied experience, yet the reverend gentleman, with Irish wit and
                            amusing aneodotes, made the lecture most interesting both to the
                            initiated and to the uninitiated.</p>
                        <p>After a brief word of sound advice to the young man as affecting the
                            future happiness of his home, even onto the third and fourth
                            generations, the lecturer reviewed the various stages, the wooing, the
                            engagement, the ceremony, the honeymoon, the first quarrel, the last
                            word, widows and widowers, and finally the parted who hoped to meet
                            again.</p>
                        <p>Then followed an instrnmental and vocal entertainment. The programme
                            included a piano solo by Mrs. Banani, a duet by Miss Hayes and Miss

                    <p>The fancy-dress ball at the Savoy on Tuesday was every whit as successful as
                        the one given at Ghezireh the preceding week, and though a certain number of
                        the same costumes made a second appearance there were many others which had
                        all the charm of novelty. The evening commenced with many cheery dinner
                        parties, the excellent ladies' band discursing much sweet music during the
                        hour given over to the discussion of the menu. The restaurant and
                        dining-room were hardly sufficient to accommodate the guests, many of whom
                        appeared in the motley garb which they sustained all evening. Khairy Bey was
                        entertaining a large party of friends at a long and beautifully decorated
                        table in the centre of the restaurant. His guests included Prince Fouad, De

                    <p>A great many people were puzzled over the identity of the very skittish nurse
                        who appeared in a neat grey gown and blue tippet, with a white veil upon her
                        auburn tresses, and it was some time before the features of Mr. Bird were
                        recognised, in spite of his behaviour being passing strange for one of the
                        sisterhood. Two other gentlemen had elected to appear as ladies of the
                        harem, but the hang of their skirts, to say nothing of the garments that
                        appeared beneath them, betrayed at once their deception. Mr. Bennett was
                        once more seen as the Tomboy—or, as he preferred to call himself, Mellin's
                        Baby—and it was well he had no anxious chaperone to watch over his random
                        steps. The Mlle Zakrevaky appeared again in their beautiful and dignified
                        costumes of the Russian Court of ancient days, and were the cynosure of all
                        eyes. They are indeed to be envied, and are as charming as they look. Many
                        people declared that Mrs. Wilding's costume of La Camargo was the best in
                        the room, and certainly it would be difficult to find one better designed or
                        more becoming to her petite figure. The tight-fitting decollete bodice of
                        blue grey velvet was out with short full basque and worn over a very full
                        and short white satin, trimmed with tiny festoons of velvet. The little
                        velvet hat poised upon her powdered head was tilted forward by a mass of
                        feathers, and a stiff narrow ruff encircled her throat Mrs. Daniell wore a
                        wonderful Indian nautch dress, of flame coloured net and satin, a soft sash
                        and gold ornaments swathing the hips, and a short bolero like-coatee forming
                        the corsage. A long veil floated from her head and she wore many jewels and
                        ornaments of barbaric splendour. There were two Carmens, Mrs Andreas and
                        Miss Charnaud, one in scarlet skirt and sash, full white chemisette, and
                        rose decked mantilla, and the second in yellow satin with tiny purple
                        bolero. Miss Pepper and her sister were trim and neat in their dainty
                        serving gowns, the one in black, the other in grey, with caps and aprons to
                        sustain the characters, and Miss Hobson made a charming Marquerite in grey
                        with lace cap.</p>
                    <p>Barbario Splendour.</p>
                    <p>For real barbaric splendour the palm must be awarded to Mr. Jennings, who
                        looked twice as large as life in his magnificent garments of ancient Egypt.
                        The short double skirt or kilt was of brilliant shades of blue and green
                        striped with gold, and above the waist was a many-coloured broad belt with
                        the scarab and ibis wing design so often appearing in Egyptian art. Wide
                        semi-circular plaques of gold hung round his neck, and a bead anklet and
                        chains added further touches of colour, and his helmet-shaped cap was
                        striped with blue and white. Lieut. Cunningham was again resplendent in his
                        character of Knave of Diamonds, though why he chose the diamond in place of
                        better things, it would be hard to guess. The troupe of Anglo-Americans made
                        one ache to ask the reason for its thusness : for its variegated uniform
                        surely was of Manchester manufacture for the Indian market, and its headgear
                        was a riddle in itself. Dr. Madden as Mrs. Jarley was much admired, and the
                        same remark might also be applied to the shadow of Napoleon as he paced in
                        solemn stateliness among the light-hearted crowd. The following list
                        includes as many of the names and costumes as it was possible to procure

                        <p>Play began at 4.30 p.m. It was, however, carried on in such a way that it
                            is beyond our power to express the credit due to Mr. Clarke Shaw, the
                            tutor of athletic games in the school, who was acting as a referee, and
                            who jastly decided disputes. The spectators were much struck by the
                            gentle maneuvres practised by both sides. The goal-keeper of the Customs
                            team was decidedly a splendid player who manfully defended his post. The
                            forwards of the school were such gallant players, that thay were
                            unceasingly rushing and attacking their opponents, that their way of
                            discharging their duties was highly applauded by the lookers on. The
                            result was that Ras el-Tin beat the Customs three to one. The two
                            parties then exchanged thanks for the sympathies and gentle methods of
                            play exercised by both towards one another. The Customs players,
                            accompanied by their play-rivals, were at last led to a floor of the
                            school where they all were served with tea.</p>

                        <p>During the greater part of last year the pages of the "Westminster
                            Gazette" were enlivened once a week by a political parable by the
                            "Office Boy" (Mr. Francis Brown). The exceeding cleverness of these
                            skits on the late Government lies in their pungent ingenuousness. The
                            illustrations of the text are delightful and fall little short of Mr.
                            Gould's political caricatures. The parables have been collected in a
                            single volume, which have just been published by Mr. T. Fisher Unwin.
                            (1s. net). The volume forms most amusing reading and the moral conveyed
                            is as fresh as ever in view of the result of the recent general
                            election.</p>
                        <p>Another of Mr. Unwin's recent publications is Mr. Charles Wagner's
                            eloquent appeal to young men, entitled "Toward the Heights." A more
                            suitable gift for a youth or young man could not be found, for in spite
                            of the intense moral earnestness of the contents, it is most
                            interesting. The book is published in a convenient size and at a very
                            moderate price (1s. paper, 2s. cloth, net).</p>

                        <head>The Money Market.</head>
                        <p>Is the end of the stringency at last in sight? This is the question at
                            present engaging the attention of the money market, the influx of gold
                            into the Bank throughout the week having rendered that event possible.
                            The precious metal has been flowing in from many quarters, and the aim
                            received by the Bank since our last amounts on balance to over a million
                            and a half. The "expectation of ease" has not yet had any pronounced
                            effect upon the loan market, owing no doubt to the requirements in
                            connection with the Consols settlement and the heavy repayments to the
                            Bank of England, and the rate remains practically as 4%. There is,
                            however, just a faint glimmer of possible ease to be found even in this
                            market, as evidenced in the patchiness of the rate today, loans in some
                            few instances having been done at 3 3/4.</p>
                        <p>The discount market on the other hand has been working on anticipation
                            during the past week, the rate for three months' bills having fallen at
                            one time to 3 1/2%, but it has now hardened up to 3 5/8, being however,
                            still abont 1/4% easier than this time last week.</p>
                        <p>For many reasons it is to be hoped that rates will not be allowed to slip
                            away too rapidly, viz, dear money in Germany and America, the number of
                            English bills held on the Continent (with the consequent power to
                            withdraw gold) and last, but not least, the appearance of Japan as a
                            buyer of bullion, at a time when this market's indebtedness to her
                            stands at a very high figure.</p>
                        <p>The Bank's statement this week shows a fall in the proportion of reserve
                            of 1.5 per cent, owing to the addition to the other deposits of abont
                            three millions, and to public deposits of about £1.500,000, making this
                            figure now stand at £18,000,000. No doubt the Government will disburse a
                            considerable proportion of this last-mentioned sum during the present
                            month, thereby bringing some of the much desired ease to the money
                            market.</p>

                        <p>The feeling in the City has been gradually less and less confident as the
                            true intentions of the Government have become clearer. At the time of
                            the election it was understood that both the foreign and Colonial policy
                            of their predecessors would be continued, and in view of this
                            understanding many moderate men freely voted for the Liberals. It now
                            appears clear that the policy of impractical sentimen talism, which has
                            been so fatal in the Liberal administration in the past, is still the
                            leading principle of the party, and the lessons of days gone by, which
                            have been so costly to the country, are being entirely ignored. That a
                            man of the calibre of Mr. Winston Churchill should have the fortunes of
                            the country largely in his hands is enough in itself to create the
                            greatest uneasiness in financial circles. This, in addition to the
                            extraordinary mood of Germany, has been enough to keep everything on the
                            Stock Exchange more than dull. Millions are being lost every day in the
                            mining industry towards which the present Government seems to have a
                            peculiar antipathy, and it is feared that heavy failures may result.
                            Fortunately the markets are in a thoroughly sound condition. There has
                            been no over-speculation ; the banks and the public have been
                            particularly cautious, and there is no whisper of any real trouble
                            outside the unfortunate Kaffirs, some of which have reached a point at
                            which the future profit mast be very large if the mines are worked at
                            all.</p>

                            throughout last week, was again present at the beginning of this week,
                            and a considerable amount of liquidation took place. On the publication
                            of a further batch of good traffic returns, however, these stocks
                            received renewed attention, and some substantial buying followed. Today
                            the market has again displayed weakness. Were is not the case that
                            dullness is prevalent in every part of the "House," it would be
                            difficult to account for the persistent disregard of the prospects of
                            home railway shares. This week five of the leading lines record very
                            substantial increases in traffic, the North Western to the extent of
                            £10,000, as compared with a decrease in the corresponding week last year
                            of £2,000, and the Midland of £7,674, as against a reduction in 1905 of
                            £292. For the eight weeks to date the L. and N.W. has an increase of
                            over £60,000, and the North Eastern and Midland follow this up with
                            increases of £55,000 and £46,000 respectively. The Great Western's
                            previously recorded decrease has been cleared off with this week's again
                            of £4,300, which comes on the top of a gain last year of £2,300.</p>

                            the trade reports from Arnerica are not so good as has recently been the

                            kept firm, and are still being picked up at 1 7/8. There is yet no
                            mention of the preference shares. Delta Land have been largely dealt in
                            up to 3 3/8, closing also easier at 3 1/4. Delta Light Railway
                            preference had a very share move up to 12 1/2 buyers, with very few
                            shares changing hands, but they could not maintain this rise, and close
                            at 12 3/8 doubtful. National Bank of Egypt at 27 3/4 and Agricultural
                            Banks at 9 15/16 are quite unmentioned. Daira Ordinary are a little
                            better at 18, and the Deferred at 105 nominal. Daira Sugar are unchanged
                            at 4 15/16. Abyssinian Banks have been up to 1 premium on hears buying
                            back, but close at only 3/8 premium. There was a backwardation of 3s.
                            per share at the carry-over, but this soon ran off to evens. Union
                            Fonciere at 6 1/2, Corporation of Western Egypt at ¾ premium and
                            Egyptian Estates at 1 7/8 are firm. The Estates Deferred are quoted
                            nominally at 8––9. There is a general complaint that the Stock Exchange
                            cannot get enongh Egyptian Estates shares. There would be a very large
                            demand were there any stock but few shares being in the market, it is
                            hardly worth the dealers' trouble to push business. No doubt these
                            shares are very properly held in Egypt, but for the sake of the future
                            it would be a good thing if enough were held here to satisfy the
                            market.</p>
                        <p>The dividend on these is anxiously looked forward to, and it is expected
                            that it will cause substantial rise as soon as the rumours of the
                            excellent results of this company are verified.</p>

                        <p>Liquidation in the South African market continues to an extraordinary
                            degree, and prices all round are in consequence very considerably lower.
                            Yesterday Rand Mines were down to 5 19/32 sellers, which is 1 5/32 less
                            than the price at the end-February making-up. Goldfields were 4 15/32
                            sellers as against 5 5/16 at the last carry-over. Today Rand Mines close
                            at 5 13/16 and Bast Rands at 4 3/8.</p>
                        <p>The Egyptian mining market still shares the general depression. Nile
                            Valley have lost another shilling on the week at 5s., while United
                            Africans and Un Rus have shed 1/4 and 1/8 respectively. The report of
                            the Egyptian and Sudan Mining Syndicate, although considered very good,
                            does not seem to have had any effect upon shares, but this is natural,
                            as all mining shares are disregarded for the moment.</p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN TRADE. AMERICAN CONSULAR REPORT.</head>
                    <p>Mr. Morgan, of the American Diplomatic Agency and Consulate General at Cairo,
                        has sent a long report to Washington about Egyptian trade. He furnishes a
                        great many valuable facts regarding the present state of trade, suggestions
                        of how best to enter Egypt's markets, and how to remain there once a
                        foothold has been obtained. He writes :</p>
                   
                        <p>Local conditions must be reckoned with.</p>
                        <p>The important fact should not be overlooked that local conditions must be
                            conformed to, particularly that of credit. This is the rock upon which
                            all attempts to extend American trade interests in Egypt has split.
                            Credit—sometimes very long credit—must be given, until the ingathering
                            of the various crops. "After I have sold my cotton," is the invariable
                            reply of the large landowners when applied to for payment, and even the
                            government gives credit for the taxes due, collecting them by
                            installments after the crops have been gathered. It is as well to
                            remember that the follish, as soon as he has made a little money at once
                            invests it in land—he does not bank or speculate with it. He then
                            requires seed, cattle, and machinery to develop his land, so obtains
                            what he requires on credit and pays whan his crop is disposed of. It is
                            not many years since all accounts were settled once a year at the Tantah
                            fair, at which the produce of the country was disposed of. Allowed a
                            reasonable credit by American manufacturers, as credit must be given
                            here, there is no question that such a distributing agency as has been
                            suggested would enormously develop American trade interests in
                            Egypt.</p>
                    
                  
                        <p>Distributing Agencies Needed.</p>
                        <p>It would be in the interests of manufacturers and buyers alike to have
                            the distributing agencies handle the goofs of competing firms. The
                            system might not work in other countries, but it would work well in this
                            land of paradoxes and contradictions. From inquiries I have made it is
                            abundantly evident that "sole" or "exclusive" agencies are not always an
                            unmixed blessing to the possessor of them, and not always to the
                            advantage of the manufacturer granting such; but "sole agency" in the
                            sense in which it is taken is quite a misnomer. Neither the manufacturer
                            nor the sole agent here can prevent anyone purchasing goods in the
                            country of origin and bringing them into Egypt through whatever channel
                            they choose. Egypt was for years the happy hunting ground of the
                            monopolist, and the population suffered. It has not forgotten those days
                            ; it resents them bitterly, and when it sees "sole agent", displayed it
                            reads "monopoly," arid if a similar artiole can be obtained elsewhere,
                            the residents, European and Egyptian alike, will go there for it, One of
                            my informants did not wish to place an order with the "sole agent" of a
                            mannfacturing firm. He preferred to send the order to the firm. They
                            replied that they could only execute it through their local
                            representative. Neither got it; it want elsewhere. It would have been a
                            very simple matter to fill the order and make some arrangement with the
                            sole agent for a modified commission when orders were sent direct.</p>
                    
                   
                        <p>Importing Houses not Limited to Specialities.</p>
                        <p>Importing houses do not as a rule confine themselves to one specialty ;
                            some deal in dozens, others in hundreds, and nearly all I must break
                            bulk and become retailers in the accepted sense of the term. It goes
                            without saying therefore, that they should be prepared to satisfy the
                            whims and fancies of their customers for any particular brand, mark, or
                            fabric, but if the sole agency can not sell that particular article,
                            being bound down to deal in another brand or mark, the customer goes
                            where he can buy what he wants, and of course takes his custom for other
                            articles with him.</p>
                        <p>There are better opportunities for opening up new connections when you
                            can offer client a choice of similar goods. He knows then that you are
                            not trying to force upon him one particular article simply became you
                            have a local monopoly in it, and are debarred from trading in a similar
                            article produced by other firms with whom yon may not trade. Sole
                            agencies have their uses, if the foreign manufacturer knows how to use
                            them to his advantage, but they have their disadvantages for the
                            manufacturer also. But this is a subject for the trade expert to
                            determine, for no general rule could be laid down. Where a "sole agency"
                            might work satisfactorily in one direction it might be just the reverse
                            in another, so that cases would have to be decided upon their individual
                            merits.</p>

                        <p>Monsieur le Directeur del' "Egyptian Gazette."</p>
                        <p>Les quelques economies que j'avais amassees au cours de 15 annees de
                            travail et au prix de sacrifices iuouis, economies que j'avais
                            malheuheureusement placees en actions Sucreries, attire par le tort
                            dividende que distribuait cette societe, viennent de recevoir, avec la
                            decision du tribunal du Caire, leur dernier coup, le coup fatal.</p>
                        <p>Je m'entends fort pen aux questions de Loi, avec laquelle Dieu merci je
                            n'ai jamais en rien a faire. J'avoue cependant ne rien comprendre a la
                            facon dont la Justice est pratiquee ici, tant elle semble defier le bon
                            sens.</p>
                        <p>Des actions qui, avant le Krach valaient fr. 170, degringolent apres a
                            fr. 40. Tons les actionnaires sont terrasses ; Cronier se tue et le
                            monde entier fremit devant ce scandale effroyable. Intervient la
                            Justice. Un sentiment de soulagement gague les victimes. Mais quel n'eit
                            pas leur etonnement de se voir ruinees "completement" par celle-la meme
                            qui intervenait au nom de la Morale pour les defendre, car la faillite
                            c'est 0 pour nos actions et 15% au maximum pour les creanciers et les
                            obligataires.</p>
                        <p>Or, je me le demande, pourquoi vouloir aneantir d'un trait de plume notre
                            entreprise, alors que tout le monde, le Gouvernement compris, fait tout
                            son possible pour la relever et la reorganiser? Pourquoi vouloir amasser
                            de nouvelles ruines sur celles deja existantes?</p>
                        <p>Car, l'effet d'une declaration de faillite serait plus desastreux encore
                            que le Krach Cronier lui-meme. Elle serait une calamite pour le pays et
                            vouerait a une ruine complete les malheueux, comme moi, qui y avaient
                            engages avec toute leur fortune.</p>
                        <p>La mission de la Justice, telle que je, serait de defendre les faibles,
                            de er les torts des victimes et de sauver le qui leur reste, au lieu de
                            consommer leur ruine. Qu'on poursuive les administrateurs, mais qu'on ne
                            nous confonde pas avec eux—et surtout qn'on nenous fasse pas payer les
                            pots casses. Pour atteindre les administrateurs il n'est pas necessaire,
                            ni juste de nous frapper. Precipiter dans le gouffre l'edifice
                            sifortement ebranle par le krach est un crime, aux yeux de tous, aussi
                            grand que celni commis par ceux a qui nous avions confie la gestion de
                            nos affaires.</p>
                        <p>Au point de vue moral je ne puis done qu'accuser de complicite la justice
                            dans la perte da ma fortune.</p>
                        <p>Elle aura continue et acheve l'oeavre de destruction qu'avaient ai bien
                            commencee nos fideles administrateurs :</p>

                    <div type="item">
                        <head>LE "QUORUM" ET LE CONCORDAT</head>
                        <p>La raison principale pour laquelle le Tribunal Mixte du Caire a refuse de
                            tenir compte des actionnaires des Sucreries dans la recherche de la
                            bonne ou de la mauvaise foi necessaire pour l'homologation du concordat,
                            c'est qu'il ne constituaient pas, a son avis, "un element actif dans
                            l'organisation sociale."</p>
                        <p>Ce role passif, que leur prete le Tribunal et qui leur coute a 1'heure
                            actuelle pres de 32 millions 1/2 de frs. "constituerait" pourtant, nous
                            semble-t-il, une raison suffisante pour prouver amplement la bonne foi
                            de ces actionnaires qui representent la societe.</p>
                        <p>Pour attester leur indifference le jugement cite les quorums faibles
                            atteints dans les Assemblees Generales et en arrive a parler de l'
                            "abdication de la part des actionnaires" dans les mains du Conseil
                            d'Administration.</p>
                        <p>Pour une societe qui a les 11/12 de ses actions placees a l'Etranger il
                            n'y a pas lieu de s'etonner si ce quorum est faible. D'ailleurs le
                            quorum attaint ordinairement dans les Assemblees de societes, dont le
                            capital est presque entierement place dans le pays, n'est guere plus
                            important Ainsi, pour ne citar que la National, 1'Agricultural Bank, la
                            Salt and Soda, etc., nous dirons que le quorum n'est generalement pas
                            atteint. Les decisions ne sont prises qu'a la seconde convocation, quel
                            que soit alors le nombre d'actionnaires presents.</p>
                        <p>Faut-il eu conclure que ces derniers abdiquentleurs droits aux millions
                            de Livres Sterling dont se compose le capital de ces Societes?</p>
                        <p>Nous ne le pensons pas.</p>

                            vendeurs, n'est pas fait pour maintenir les cours.</p>
                        <p>Aussi plusieurs valeurs ont-elles baisse a un prix tres avantageux pour
                            ceux qui voudraient les mettre en portefeuille. De ce nombre sont la
                            Delta Light et l'Agricole.</p>
                        <p>En revanche la Nungovich est pousse a 16 7/16 et les Egyptian

                        <p>On a traite beaucoup les Estates et la New Egyptian.</p>
                        <p>En somme les valeurs lourdes sont delaissees au profit des nouvelles
                            emissions. La reaction actuelle est une consequence de l'imprudence de
                            certains speculateurs. C'est une epuration necessaire apres laquelle une
                            reprise est inevitable en faveur des titres serieux.</p>

                        <p>D'apres ce qu'on annouce d'Alexandria, le mouvement de hausse qui s'est
                            produit sur les actions Anglo-Egyptian Spinning and Weaving est attribue
                            a la nouvelle que cette Societe a vendu a M.A. Luzzato un terrain a

                        <p>Nous detachons d'une de nos Iettres d'AIexandrie le passage suivant:</p>
                        <p>"Les actionnaires de la Port-Said Salt Association protestent, paralt-il,
                            contre la fusion projetee avec la Salt and Soda, moyennant echange de
                            deux actions de la premiere Societe contre une de la seconde. Ils se
                            basent sur plusieurs raisons, dont voici les principales :</p>
                        <p>"L'abolition du monopole donne droit a la Port-Said de vendre le sel dans
                            le pays aux memes conditions que celles etablies pour les salines du
                            Mex, exploitees actuellement par la Salt and Soda. Or, la concession de
                            la Port Said a une duree de 45 aus, tandis que l'Etat pourrait modifier
                            ou annuler apres 12 ans le contrat actuel avec la Salt and Soda.</p>
                        <p>"Le capital actuel de la Port-Said Salt, soit £80,000, est represente par
                            un actif reel, sans compter la valeur commercials de l'affaire pour la
                            longue dures de la concession. Par suite, les actionnaires estiment
                            qu'avec un petit benefice sur la vente la Port-Said pourrait largement
                            retribuer son capital.</p>
                        <p>"Ils demandent donc que les negociations actuelles scient suspendues,
                            sauf a les repreudre sur des bases nouvelles dans la vue d'eliminer
                            toute concurrence entre les deux Societes."</p>

                        <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers
                            the accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by
                            which they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange
                            them as accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that
                            none of them are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home
                            there are several things to be considered. To begin with there is the
                            difference in climate between Egypt and the various points at which you
                            may arrive in Europe.</p>
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                            January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so
                            warm as Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more
                            uniformly warm than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt
                            far too early in the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is
                            perfect. The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                        <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent
                            at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on
                            each of the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of
                            Europe.</p>

                        <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth,
                            Southhampton, London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones
                            are as follows:—</p>

                        <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                            Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines
                            are also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by
                            travellers to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to
                            Alexandria, without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made
                            without change in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                        <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                            Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German
                            Levant line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                        <cb n="5"/>
                        <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by
                            P.&amp;O. Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd
                            Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
                        <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little
                            luggage is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several
                            good and responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed
                            charge to deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                        <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by
                            the fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these
                            leaves port Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the
                            Indian <cb n="6"/>mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                        <p>These express steamer's have enormously powerful engines, and attain a
                            very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having been
                            specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi. If
                            you are going straight through to England you will find the train
                            waiting at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It
                            has complete arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you
                            should arrive in London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                        <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers
                            which leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to
                            TAORMENA, one of the most charming and popular places on the island.
                            Giardini is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina
                            is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the town is
                            much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                            restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent
                            of Etna and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and
                            Saracenic remains that are found all over the island, are an endless
                            sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a
                            Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by
                            the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be
                            seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                            about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                            delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city.
                            The Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of
                            S. Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The
                            Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also
                            worth a visit.</p>

                    <div type="item">
                        <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                        <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every
                            Wednesday during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3
                            days.</p>
                        <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino
                            Co.'s steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave
                            it without wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely
                            places on its bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that
                            takes you to Sorrento [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                        <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can
                            will devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and
                            interesting portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are
                            too well-known to need comment here.</p>
                        <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five
                            hours brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent
                            admiring the City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence
                            itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the
                            local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is
                            the most attractive and fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the
                            Viale dei Colli, one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago,
                            goes winding up through the hills a distance of four miles. The most
                            delightful excursion outside Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its
                            Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is made first by ordinary
                            train from Florence to St. Ellero, thence by cog-wheel railway to
                            Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                            striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                        <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a
                            fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night
                            should if possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile
                            at sunset.</p>
                        <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near
                            Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient
                            half-way house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable
                            and the air and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy,
                            with the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European
                            cities and a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and
                            deliciously cool breezes from the surrounding mountains and the
                            Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                        <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                            gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings,
                            are a constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn
                            in Genoa. Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches
                            containing exquisite marble columns and historical paintings, and the
                            incomparable Campo Santo filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                        <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                        <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                            Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful
                            windows illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and
                            the monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                        <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                            SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal
                            springs, change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are
                            at Salsomaggiore.</p>

                        <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                            delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                            vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage
                            or bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every
                            turn. The approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any
                            other sea port. The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of
                            the sea, no hills behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of
                            Campaniles appear above the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering
                            town rises like a fairy mirage out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                        <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                            lakes.</p>
                        <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in
                            one-and-a-quarter hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                        <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is
                            very beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                            enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo,
                            Cadenabbia, and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio
                            opposite. The walk from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio
                            is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake
                            Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in
                            two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                            is an excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated
                            above the town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings,
                            "Entombment," by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>

                            steamers are those of the Khedivial Mail Co. and the Russian Steam
                            Navigation Co.</p>
                        <p>If possible tourists should arrange to be in Athens for the Orthodox
                            Easter in order to witness the Good Friday and Easter Eve ceremonies,
                            and to be present at the dancing on the Easter Tuesday festival held at
                            Megara for which a special train is run from Athens.</p>
                        <p>It is worth while to spend a few days in CORFU on account of the beauty
                            of the scenery. There is also good snipe and quail shooting to be
                            had.</p>
