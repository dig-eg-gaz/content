                    <head>THE AEROPLANE IN LONDON</head>
                    <p>A telegram, which we publish in to-day's issue, announces that London has
                        been treated to the wonderful sight of a dirigeable aeroplane circling
                        around St. Paul's Cathedral and paying a surprise visit to the War Office. </p>
                    <p>Captain Dunn, the son of a distinguished soldier, believing be bad hit upon a
                        suitable design for an aeroplane, or flying machine, submitted his plans and
                        models to the War Office authorities. The experts looked into the project,
                        and leave was given to the captain to proceed with his experiments, more or
                        less at his own expense; but they agreed to lend him assistance in the work
                        with men and officers from one of the Royal Engineers' departments. the
                        ballooning. The secure remoteness of Glen Tilt, with its surrounding hills
                        is admirably suited for the carrying out of experiments. The Dake of Atholl
                        and the Marquis of Tallibardine placed the district at their disposal. To
                        safe. guard the operations from carious and intrusive eyes, keepers were
                        stationed to prevent anyone wandering down the glen or over the neighbouring
                        hills. The high road is public, but as the | highway is ordinarily the low
                        way, nothing can be seen therefrom. </p>
                    <p>Captain Dunn's machine is a combination of the Albatross-wing type, with
                        guiding pinions, upon which is superimposed a second plane. The driving
                        power is imparted by twin screws, or propellers, placed upon either side.
                        The screws are set in motion by a 8-cylinder, French made motor engine,
                        Unfortunately, at present the engine does not give altogether satisfactory
                        results. The course of experiments were begun by launching the loaded
                        machine from the hill-sides, to see how it would go. Many long and
                        successful flights were made in that way, whilst the inventor and his
                        helpers, by their constant practice, came to know daily more and more of the
                        mysterious trieks of the air. In one of the flights the apparatus when
                        launched took &amp; downward dip and ran upon a dyke. It was much damaged,
                        but in a short time the framework was repaired, the cloth was stitched
                        again, and further trials made of a more fortunate nature. These confirmed
                        the inventor and his friends in their hopes for the future of the machine,
                        but all aeroplanes require a constant guiding touch. Unless kept on their
                        true course they eventually flounder and fail. It is so with Captain Dunn's
                        machine. The pinions and deflecting planes, otherwise the wings and sail of
                        the bird, have to be actuated by an instant and skilled touch, to meet the
                        variations of air currents and the deviations occurring in flight. It has
                        been found that this can be done, and Captain Dunn and his assistants have
                        been able on repeated occasions to fly for a considerable distance about
                        Glen Tilt. Latterly the three-cylinder air-cooled motor has been attached to
                        the apparatus, and still longer flights have been achieved. To see these
                        later trials the chief of the balloon establishment came down. He has
                        expressed his satisfaction at the results accomplished and the opinion that
                        still more could be done with an engine capable of developing more power. </p>
                    <p>There have been no serious mishaps since an occasion when the aeroplane
                        smashed itself against the wall, and but for the uncertainty connected with
                        the running of the engine, flights of several miles could have been made.
                        There is always the difficulty in aeroplanes of safely rising from the
                        ground, unless they are launched from some elevated position. Trouble is
                        equally grave to ensure their coming down to rest without getting broken in
                        alighting, but the Dupn machine has behaved in these respects remarkably
                        well, though it may be necessary by and by to attach to all aeroplanes
                        serews worked perpendicularly, to lift them as well as to lower them from or
                        back to the ground. The framework and wings are calculated to sustain a
                        weight when soaring of over half a ton. The frame is strongly lashed and
                        stayed, and the apparatus can be run forward upon light wheels. The
                        experimentalists have a secluded camp, in which they live and work. There is
                        still much to be done to perfect the apparatus, but something of real im.
                        portance has been accomplished towards solving the problem of flight in
                        bodies heavier than air. </p>

                    <p>A MONTH'S MURDERS.</p>
                    <p>Attention has frequently been paid in the columns of the “Egyptian Gazette"
                        to the alarming number of crimes which is committed in the provinces of
                        Egypt, and the still more disquieting fruitlessness of the efforts made by
                        the authorities of the interior to ensure the public safety outside the
                        principal towns of the country. Lawlessness, we are told by many of our
                        provincial readers, almost reigns supreme, and officialdom, it is alleged,
                        is becoming a hotbed of corruption and bribery. We trust that increased
                        efforts will be made by the Government to put an end to what is undoubtedly
                        a most serious evil, though perhaps exaggerated to a certain ex: tent by
                        some. Those qualified to express an opinion by their long residence in the
                        country assure us that the only method to adopt for the extermination of
                        crime is to largely increase the number of English officials in the
                        provinces, and to place them in charge of Modifiers and Markazes, and this
                        measure, we are assured, would be welcomed by Native and European alike. A
                        true charge of murder is seldom sustained against the murderer, who always
                        manages to secure six or seven | alibis. During last month twenty-three mur
                        ders were registered in the Markaz of Menouf, Menoufieh Moudirieh, the last
                        orime being tha murder by the omdeh of Gezai by his unele. After death the
                        man was announced by the Government doctor to have died from apoplexy, but
                        on an English inspector being called in it was found that the man had been
                        shot through the head! The omdeh was placed under arrest and taken to Shibin
                        el Kom for trial</p>

                        Scotland. He has now returned to London, and those interested in Egypt are

                    <head>EGYPT'S TRADE</head>
                    <p>THE IMPORT. POSITION</p>
                    <p>A marked improvement is reported in the import trade during the last month
                        and especially during the past fortnight. Relieved of the reckless and
                        unhealthy competition which culminated in the large failures of the early
                        summer, stocks of Madchoster goods in bond, which had accumulated and
                        increased by forty per cent between May and August, have now been reduced to
                        about the level of May.</p>
                    <p>The old import houses are gradually inducing a return to the system of four
                        months credit which had during the period of inflated imports been extended
                        with disastrous results to seven months. </p>
                    <p>The coal trade is also satisfactory and under threats of stoppage of
                        supplies, buyers in the interior have found money which they had previously
                        declared improeurable to meet their engagements. </p>
                    <p>Advice from Manchester reports a good demand for cotton goods for China,
                        Japan and India and exporters of cotton from Egypt anticipate satisfactory
                        prices during the season.</p>
                    <p>The trade of the country is therefore, as we have maintained throughout the
                        period of the late crisis, perfectly healthy, and the effects of the crisis
                        on the Bourse will gradually disappear. The Statist has recently found
                        occasion to lecture the banking community of London on their imperfect
                        knowledge of their business and if some of the fraternity here will
                        condescend to learn the alphabet of their business we may be spared &amp;
                        recurrence of the foolish but disastrous panic of the summer.</p>
                    <p>AN EXCELLENT MEASURE.</p>
                    <p>In pleasing contrast the following announcement will be read by the
                        mercantile community as showing the intelligent appreciation of their needs
                        by the financial advisers of the Government, and their readiness in
                        conjunction with the National Bank of Egypt to give all practical
                        assistance. In former years the money paid into the Caisse de la Dette for
                        the land tax, which comes in chiefly at this time of the year, was
                        accumulated in actual specie at the Mondirieh towns and afterwards remitted
                        in /specie periodically to Cairo. Further delay usually took place there and
                        it was probably several weeks from the date that the gold left the fellahs'
                        hands until it was again available for circulation. Under the new
                        arrangement whenever a sum of L.E. 1,000 has accumulated at any Modified
                        towns, it is paid into the local branches of the National Bank of Egypt. The
                        bank is in a position to utilise this same gold within a few days of its
                        having left the pockets of the fellaheen.</p>
                    <p>THE COTTON CROP &amp; GOLD IMPORTS. </p>
                    <p>The outflow of gold to Egypt has begun, remarks the "Globe," and next month
                        the cotton crop will begin to come forward. The extent of the crop has not
                        been estimated. What is definitely known, however, is that the ares soWD was
                        larger than previously, and as weather and other conditions have been
                        favourable, it is fair to assume that Egypt's cotton yield will this year be
                        of record dimensions. In the circumstances, it is reasonable to look for a
                        considerable trade revival. As a matter of fact, trade is not really bad
                        now, the recent crisis having been almost entirely due to inordinate Stock
                        Exchange gambling. The young men with £12 to £20 a month who, on the arrival
                        of the crash, were found balls of soores of thousands of pounds worth of
                        inflated securities will find their credit extinguished, or vastly limited,
                        and will not be able to play again a role so dangerous to the general
                        interest of the Egyptian public. Yesterday, we pointed out that the weak
                        bull has his nses; but he can well be dispensed with after a campaign has
                        fairly started, and he pnagent to be shaken out without compunction when it
                        is quite evident that capital has followed his lead. It may be roughly
                        reckoned that the moving of the cotton crop will mean the influx of about
                        £25,000,000 to Egypt. In spite of the concealment of gold by the fellaheen,
                        this sum of money cannot fail to exercise a beneficial effect on trade and
                        industry in the land of the Pharaohs. Anglo-Egyptians now leaving for Cairo
                        are uniformly optimistic, and better and busier times are predicted for the
                        coming season.</p>

                    <head>THE SCORPION DANGER</head>
                    <p>EFFECTIVE SERUM PREPARATION</p>
                    <p>In consequence of numerous deaths which occur annually in Egypt as the result
                        of scorpion stings, the Department of Public Health has taken up the
                        preparation of serum, Auli Boorpique." This serum which is analogous to the
                        serum “Auli Venimeux," of Dr. Calmette, is prepared by the repeated
                        injections of horses with the poison obtained from scorpiotis, beginning
                        with a very small quantity, increasing it gradually until the animal is fit
                        to support the poison of five or six hundred scorpions at one dose. As
                        horses are gery susceptible to the poison, the operation takes a long time
                        and should be made with great precaution. The serum of borse's blood which
                        has been treated in this manner will completely centralise the poison of a
                        scorpion sting, in such a manner that if the servin; and poison are mixed
                        together, the combination would be absolutely non-poisonous. In the case of
                        a person or animal stung by a scorpion, the serum should be immediately
                        applied to the affected part, the effect of the poison being neutralised as
                        soon as it comes in contact with the serum. It is important that the
                        application of the serum should be made as soon as possible after the sting
                        in order to prevent the poison passing into the circulation of the
                        blood.</p>

                        shots and brought down one of the men with a wound in the thigh. The noise

                    <head>MR. MITCHELL INES'S MEMOIRS.</head>
                    <p>It is said that Mr. Mitchell Innes intends compiling the memoirs of his
                        career. The work should be of great interest an account of the Cpomeric Age.
                        We have been unable to obtain any confirmation of this report which appears
                        in our contemporary, “LA Reforme." The following is a translation of the
                        passage: </p>
                    <p>We understand that the departure of Mr. Mitchell Innes from Egypt, which has
                        been decided in principle sing the beginning of this summer, will take place
                        before the end of the year. Nobody knew yet what new post this distinguished
                        official will be called upon to occupy, but it is settled that he will take
                        pne of the most important, pook in the diplomatic service. It is, however,
                        Announced that Mr. Mitchell Innes will not atol once return to an active
                        career as he has the intention to enjoy a well-deserved repose in his native
                        land and he will employ his leisure time in writing hist oins It is certain
                        that this work, the publication of which will be eagerly awaited will be of
                        extraordinary interest We hope to have further and more precise details on
                        this subject." </p>

                        contient quelques inexactitudes que je tiens à rectifier. 1 Cette lettre ne
                        constitue pas un avertissement à l'adresse de Gouvernement Ottoman. Elle
                        contient une exposition de la situation en Turquie destinée faire comprendre

                    <p>Encore une preuve que notre place a besoin de l'appui du Stock Exchange pour
                        aller de l'avant; à peine une réaction s'est-elle produite à Londres, qu'un
                        mouvement analogue s'est déolaré ioi. Nos valeurs dirigeantes sont
                        totalement délaissées à des prix en baisse sur ceux de vendredi dernier.
                        Cela ne veut pas dire que l'animation ait fait défant : il y a en autant de
                        brait que d'habitude et pour les non-initiés la séanoe a dû paraitre asgez
                        bonne. Ce sont les spéculateurs &amp; courte échéance qui opèrent presque
                        erclusivement. Leurs efforts ont porté ce matin en Nungovich Hotels,
                        Estates, Delta Land, United et Comptoir. Il y a eu également de la demande
                        en Bébéra mais sans affaires. Ce sont les Nungovich qui ont surtout absorbé
                        l'attention générale : leur courg a été poussé de 15 1/2 a 17; ce qui n'a
                        d'ailleurs pas trop éproaxé les acheteurs, car on se tient généralement sur
                        la réserve : on évalue à 2 ou 300 au maximum le nombre de ces titres qui ont
                        changé de mains. Au début la National Bank avait aussi donné lieu a quelques
                        petites transactions, pour se ralentir ensuite et terminer dépréciée. On a
                        constaté d'ailleurs que la tenue en général était beancoup mieux à
                        l'ouverture qu'en oldtare. Il a été venda aux enchères publiques 300 Estates
                        à 11/16 et 150 Building Lands à 2 1/16. La tendance est hésitante, les
                        acheteurs se tenant sur la réserve. - . L'Agricole, fléchit de 8.5/16 À 8
                        1/4, la National Bank de 22 1/16 à 21 7/8, la Delta Light de 10 1/2 à 10
                        3/8, la Daira de 13 5/8 à 18 1/2. Seule l'Obligation Crédit Poncier Egyptien
                        progresse de 300 à 301. En baisse encore les Eaux du Caire de 112 à 111, et
                        leg Splendid Hotels de 4 1/2 X 4 3/8. La Béhéra avance, au contraire, de 20
                        5/8 à 21 1/8 sons l'effet d'une demande, et la Banque d'Orient s'améliore
                        légèrement de 119 1/2 à 120. Parmi les titres d'ordre secondaire, les
                        Markets rétrogradent de 27/9 &amp; 27/6, les Batates de 11/16 à 21/32,
                        l'United de 11/32 # 5/16 et l'Investment de 17/32 á 1/2, tandis que la Cassa
                        di Sconto reprend de 44 à 44 1/2, la Delta Land de 1 11/16 à 1 8/4,
                        l'Ordinary Khedivial Mail de 21 à 21/8, la fondateur Comptoir do 1 13/16 à 1
                        7,8, et l'Aboukir de 28/3 &amp; 28/6. Sur le reste de la cote il n'y a pas
                        de changement à signaler. Comme on le voit, à part les Nungovich Hotels, les
                        variations sont peu importantes et indiquent platot une baisse. Quant aux
                        affaires, elles sont presque nulles, même sur les valeurs abordées. Les
                        dépêches nous apprennent que la Ban que d'Angleterre vient d'expédier en
                        Egypte 1,200,000 livres. C'est l'envoi le plus important que nous ayons eu

                    <p>BODY BLOATED WITH DROPSY.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. W. Brown, 5, South-Western Cottages, Dorchester, England, says: "For
                        fifteen years I suffered with my kidneys. It started with a confinement and
                        every confinement after wards left me worse than before. My back gave me the
                        most trouble ; across the small part of it was a dreadful feel. ing, just as
                        it a knife were being put into my back, the pain taking my breath away. I
                        did not know how to turn over in bed or how to get up in the mornings, for
                        there was always * gnawing ache in my back, and the least cold would settle
                        there. </p>
                    <p>The urinary secretions were in a dreadful condition. They caused awful pain,
                        and sometimes I was unable to pass them. I became very much bloated in the
                        body, legs and face, and there were bags of water under my eyes, making them
                        very tender. I was unable to fasten up my clothes properly because of the
                        swellings.</p>
                    <p>"I decided to try Doan's Backache Kidney Pills, and noticed relief soon after
                        I began using them, the first benefit being that I awoke feeling free of
                        pain, and with an appetite. Keeping on with the pills the pains grew less
                        frequent, I felt better in myself, and the kidney secretions became clear
                        and natural. Now I am feeling absolutely well - it is the first spell of
                        good health I have had for fifteen years. My care is all the more wonderful
                        because my complaint is inherited, being a family one </p>

                            <p> Mr. Winston Churchill, replying to the elected councillors' request
                                for increased popular representation, said that the Government
                                desired to associate the Maltese with the administration of their
                                own affairs. He would give fall weight to the advice of the elected
                                councillors, but he recalled the anti-Government action of the
                                councillors in 1902 which was incompatible with the orderly
                                Government necessary in a great fortress. Unless there was evidence
                                of the non-recurrence of such an incident it would be impossible to
                                re-open the Constitutional question. (<hi rend="italics"

                            <p>The Socialist leader Bernstein, in an article to the "Vorwaerts,"
                                attacks the section of Socialists desirons of discarding the

                                enjoyed by the Canadians. He cites British rule in Egypt as the most

                    <p>"In all this turmoil of racial and religious hatreds, this call for a 'white
                        Australia,' these brutal lynohings of negroes in the Southern States, it is
                        a little quaint that the world should have to wait for Prince Ito, the
                        Japanese statesman, to strike the required note," says the "Star" "In an
                        interview before his departure as Japanese Resident General in Korea he
                        declared his willingness to work with British missionaries for building up a
                        new Korea, and then he added this pregnant sentence: - "The thinking people
                        of the world approve of Japan's course. What does it matter about the colour
                        of my skin or my religious belief if I am working for the good of
                        humanity?</p>
                    <p>Working For Humanity</p>
                    <p>"Surely there never was a more bitter irony than this. Englishmen and
                        Americans, to name no others, have had fifteen centuries of Christian
                        civilisation behind them, and they cannot live up to this ideal yet. The
                        Christian missionary in India will not receive at his home the most cultured
                        Hindu nobleman, 'the Christian ministers in the Southern States do nothing
                        to stop their flooks from burning alive, soaked in kerosene, poor negroes
                        who are in many cases innocent of the offences charged against them. So far
                        from working with the coloured man for the good of humanity, the most
                        advanced sentiment is that of the Pharisaical verses of Kipling:</p>
                    <p>Take tip the White Man's Burden, The synge Wars of pence, Fill fall the month
                        of Famine, And bid the sickness case, And when your goal is nearest, The end
                        for other sought, Watch Sloth and heathen Folly, Bring all your hope to
                        nought.</p>
                    <p>"The Russo-Japanese war has perhaps partially awakened the complacency of
                        this sort of prophet ; indeed, we do not seem to remember that Mr. Kipling
                        has yet found words to celebrate that triumph of 'Sloth and heathen Folly'
                        over the soldiers of the Cross. The white man has so long looked down upon
                        'the heathen in his blindness' that the success of Japan in the arts, in
                        trade, and in war has been a real soul-awakener to him. He has discovered
                        that he is not the overlord of all the earth, and we hope Prince Ito's noble
                        words will bring some response (however shamefaced) from the professors of
                        faith, hope, and charity in European arsenals and churches." </p>
                    <p>Ito's Ideal for Korea.</p>
                    <p>Discussing his programme, Prince Ito further said :-"The ten millions of
                        people in Korea would become the friends of Japan more quickly if they were
                        acquainted with the fact that my programme is directed entirely to the
                        relief and assistance of the poorer classes by means of enactments
                        respecting the land laws, equitable taxation, education, and justice. It is
                        true that the Koreans themselves ) may prevent the accomplishment of our
                        propose to give them their own system of government and their own army, but
                        Koreans all the world over must understand, once for all, that the political
                        supremacy of Japan in Korea will remain firmly established. We are not
                        asking the advice of anyone regarding this policy. If the Koreans refuse to
                        accept fair and friendly assistance, then they will, by their own act, writo
                        annexation into history. As a nation divided in sentiment from Japan, Koren
                        cannot stand."</p>

                        literary education of any kind," says the "Times." "They date back to a time
                        when duration of any sort was almost wholly confined to the clergy. They
                        spring from moral and religious traditions, from family feeling, and from
                        class feeling. They have been nurtured and confirmed by education, it is
                        true, but mainly by an invention which is not that of Books. It is the
                        struggle of life in the field, in the factory, in the counting-house, house,
                        and on the high seas that has moulded and matured them. Mia in that struggle
                        that these classes have learnt their independence, their self respect, their
                        trust in each other, their enterprise, and their firmness of purpose. Book

                        able to do is to affirm with damnable iteration the first duty of all

                        keeping order for a few months or years, it is the problem of settling a
                        question that is bound to arise over and over again. If the alien question

                        question is nothing of the kind. It is neither peculiar to Canada nor to the
                        British Empire; it is a standing problem, and a problem of ever-growing

                    <p>Canada's Treaty with Japan.</p>
                    <p>"In the onset of British Columbia the circumstances are perhaps a little more
                        aggravated than usual by the fact that Canada went ont of her way to beg for
                        a share in the AngloJapanese Treaty of 1904. Only in January of this very
                        year that Treaty was adopted and given the force of law in the Canadian
                        dominion. By its first clause, the Japanese were specifically given the
                        right to enter, travel, or reside in any part of the dominions and
                        possessions of England, and thenceforward. Of course, in Canada itself. No

                        of this year, the Japanese had never descended upon the Vancouver coasts in
                        the hordes familiar to the more southern Pacific. But with the signing of
                        the Treaty the current of Japanese immigrants immediately bifurcated, with
                        the result that British Columbia is rapidly apI pronching the condition of

                        of Socialist era. There is nothing very abstruse or meta| physical about it.
                        ... Our remedy against alion immigration is to abolish the industries on
                        which aliens presumably flourish by imposing a minimum wage below which no
                        man shall soll his labour. Unless an industry can afford to pay ite workers
                        a European rate of wages, it is the most natural thing in the world that
                        capitalista should desire to import aliens whose standard of living
                        approximates to the lower rate. For the life of us we cannot see either that
                        the importing capitalists are to blame, or that the alien immigrants should
                        be described and treated as 'rats'. If we want to preserve the Empire for
                        white men, then we must pay whito men's wages, and nothing but white men's
                        wages. Every industry in the Empire that pays its workers less than a white
                        man's wage is a perpetual "yellow peril', even though no Japanese or Chinese
                        have ever set their alien feet upon the soil."</p>

                    <p>Marie Lutgen, former Countess du Pin de la Guérinière, now a licensed cab
                        driver, toll horrible tales of cruelty to Paris cab-horses.</p>
                    <p>She vouches for an almost incredible story of cruelty, practised for years in
                        the largest hackney cab stables of Paris. A wretched animal was kept to be
                        experimented upon with different foods, or so-called foods. It was harnessed
                        like a horse turning a merry-go round. New sorts of "fodder", such as
                        pounded wood shavings, were given to the long-suffering beast, and it was
                        kept going I round and round to see how much work it could do on how little
                        of the stuff. The rations were gradually reduced in order to find out the
                        minimum limit to which horses could be usefully starved. The cablady says
                        the wretched animal was thus experimenter on for its entire existence, and
                        was well known to the company's drivers, who called it the "chairman's hobby
                        horse." She tells other diabolical stories of cabmen keeping iron tipped
                        sticks wherewith to prod their worn ont beasts, and driving wounded bornes
                        day after day, purpose ly whipping them on their sores. If such fiendish
                        cruelty na this be practised, even by half-a-dozen onbren, the only thing
                        will be to give up cabs altogether. Everyone has pitied Paris horrors, half
                        of them lenn, weary, heart-broken judes, which when they are down wish only
                        to die. The cab woman's conclusion is that the unfortunate Paris horse will
                        have a better chance of a decent existence with a cabI woman than with A one
                        man. </p>

                    <head>DR. WILLIAMS' PINK PILLS.</head>
                    <p>Our uncertain climate is responsible for many ailments, of which few entail
                        more suffering than Rheumatism. Yet the fact is not fully recognised that
                        Rheumatism's acute agonies are the result of a vitiated condition of the
                        Blood, and only when the veins are replenished with new, good blood can the
                        poisons causing Rheumatism be driven out of the system. The one great remedy
                        capable of building up and purifying the blood is Dr. Williams' Pink Pills
                        for Pale People; and the manner in which they cure Rheumatism is illustrated
                        in the case of Mrs. Rooney, 51, Hayes-street, Haslingden, Lancs.</p>
                    <p>"In spite of warm clothing during changeable weather, I was attacked by Acute
                        Rheumatism," she said, "and it threatened to ruin my constitution. The pains
                        began in my hands, and gradually spread to my feet. All my joints became
                        inflamed, and pains shot through my limbs and muscles day and night, nearly
                        driving me mad. I couldn't work, and I couldn't sleep. Indeed, I could not
                        even bear the weight of bedclothes upon my body. My hands became so
                        contracted that I was crippled in every finger. Then my digestion was
                        affected, and food caused sharp pains through my chest and back. The least
                        change in the weather increased the tortures of Rheumatism, and every
                        draught punished me. I fought hard with every means in my power to conque
                        the Rheumatism, and besides taking medicine I applied powerful embrocations,
                        but nothing gave hope of the least improvement. My breathing became
                        difficult and the least excitement caused my heart to palpitte
                        distressingly, while all my strength vanished.</p>
                    <p>Friends then advised me to take a course of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills, and I
                        bought some, though I had no hope of ever being well again. To my joy I
                        found this wonderful medicine gradually restoring my strength. After the
                        third box I was well on my way to health, and after the sixth box I felt a
                        tingling through my veins, and a comfortable warmth all over my body. I
                        slept well at night, and food no longer caused indigestion. My breathing was
                        easy, and as I continued Dr. Williams' Pink Pills the inflammation left me,
                        my joints grew supple, and every trace of Rheumatism vanished. Dr. Williams'
                        Pink Pills cleared my veins of all the poisons of Rheumatism and gave me
                        rich, pure blood."</p>
                    <p>Not only Rheumatism but all diseases resulting from bad or impoverished blood
                        have been cured repeatedly by Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People: they
                        are invaluable in Anaemia, General Weakness, Indigestion, Eezema, Sciatica,
                        Neuralgia, Nervous Disorders, Paralysis and Ladies' Ailments. Sold at shops
                        (but take care that the full name, Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People,
                        is on every package). Sold by all chemists and druggists at P.T. 18 the box
                        and P.T. 70 for six boxes.</p>
