                <p>Let me ask yqn to look for a moment at Egypt as it was when \firrt kpew it and
                        as it Know. • When I went o^t to Egypt in 1-869, fi^id Pecha.was Khedive;
                        the fellaheen were oppres- sed and groned dawn by taxation,txtorfc d from
                        them under the lash. They saved nothing? of if they did they buried it, they
                        lived oft a balre pittance, life was a misery, the pbpuUtion did not
                        ioorease to any appreciable extent, aud&lt;io- ibort nothing but the
                        marvellous fertility of the soil saved the country at all. The boat native
                        blood Was taken either for the army or/ sent to^ie on the Suez Canal works,
                        .the revenues Were squandered Op'harti»s or palaces, and there was fto
                        security for native life or property at all.\'Things were as had or worse
                        under Lm.ail, and at last iq 187Tthe oouqtry became bankrupt and the
                        finanoes passed under the oontrol of the Powers. I will not dwell on
                        snbaequenfchistory. </p>
                <p>The series of events that brought abont the British . Occupation are familiar io
                        all tar. teres ted in Egypt, and the .crowning point has been the
                        agreement..with.Francs. The (ffeot of alt this on the prosperity of the
                        cqnntry has been of a very ¿narked nature. The seonrity for life and
                        property ur.der British ptotootion has given confidence to the fella- heen,
                        and when, in addition to this, yon consider that the * last :few yesrS\bave

                        of the inofeased security for life ard property which I alluded to just
                        now,* it is an interesting fapt that numbers of wealthy Syrian and Tor kb h

                        at the extraordinary >and. rapid rise in 'land valuesl and wherai may I ask,
                        i> the danger of any serious reactioi ? The rise has been can red, </p>
                <p>I am convinoeff, by the increase of Wealth in the chantry, and the land has been
                        bought forceebV agricultural land for development and «town land for
                        building, both of them well warranted by the' increasing population and
                        prosperity. Nothing short of a oatastrophe such as fanrne; pestilence, or
                        earthquake could in my opinion caus$ any serions -qollapee,- and so l say it
                        is -my firm oonyicton that this- improvement jin land values • has, to use a

                        speculation in ] industrial securitiei is. a more difficult one/ but lor the
                        reasons I have already given you* it is ah entirely different problem. The
                        public who deal in* stocks and shares are'a different elate of the
                        population, smaller in numbers and to a large extent of foreign, nationality
                        ; hut here also I think the danger has been* greatly exaggerated. The
                        securities of an industrial, nature current in Egypt have mostly been called
                        into existence by the increased spending power of the people generally, atd
