                <p>We should like to call the attention of our readers to the excellent work now being carried on by the Egyptian anti-tuberculosis League. Egypt, which might have been described as one of the most “immune” countries in the world till a few years ago, is undoubtedly beginning to suffer from an increase of phthisis and other tubercular  diseases, which, in too many oases, ap pear to have been imported by Europeans them selves in search of health. The change of habits and mode of life by a section of the native popula tion is also believed by some authorities to be a cause of the greater prevalence of phthisis among the Arabs and the risk that this and kindred diseases may become firmly established in the country is accentuated by the extraordinary ignorance of most of the native and of part of the European population in all matters connected with hygiene, The practice of spitting broadcast, which is so unpleasantly frequent in Egypt is fraught with great danger to the public in cases where a consumptive cannot relinquish the habit, and it is most necessary that public opinion here should support the undertaken by doctors against this pernicious practice on the part of persons suffering from phthisis. Government can do little to combat a widespread custom, however contrary it may be to the rules of health or good taste, An attempt to enforce a law against it would be doomed to failure, and its prohibi tion in public offices and conveyances is, for the present, the only practicable limitation of vice —for a habit dangerous to the safety of the public health is a vice—at which the State can aim. Bat public opinion can be educated, and a new generation may yet be trained to regard with disgust what passed unnoticed among its ancestors, and we urge the leaders of the present movement against the disease to show no discouragement if their ideas are slow in finding favor with the people. Edu-cation is really the best remedy for disease, and it is on the gradual spread of education among the masses, especially in the great cities, that our sanitary reformers must rely.

                  <div type="item"> <head>CRUELTY TO ANIMALS.</head>
                
                <p>"Man’s inhumanity to man” is too frequently accompanied by cruelty to animals, and no claims on humanity are greater than those advanced by the societies established for the purpose of repressing that cruelty, and lessening its results on the suffering victim. Com plaints on the parts of visitors daring the winter season have been so frequent of late years that we would urge upon all who can do so, the necessity of exerting any influence, however slight, in the direction of securing better treatment, not only of horses, mules, and donkeys, or other animals which the to cieties more especially protect, but of dogs, oats and birds, the latter more especially, in view of the scenes enacted before the eyes of tourists during their trips on the Nile, for the purpose of extorting money from the sympathetic. Two months will elapse before the tourist influx commences ; it promises to be greater than ever this year, and in proportion to the increase of visitors, will be the number of animals required for their use, and the scope for the practice of cruelty. If in the meantime some efforts can be made, individual and collective, to instruct the native, give him a few lessons on kindness to animals, or, if necessary, set before xxx the probability of punishment for wanton cruelty, a great step will have been taken towards in some measure reducing the shocking cruelty at present so rife, and so little thought of.
                </p>
                <p>There is flue scope in a country like Egypt for the introduction of the system inaugurated in England many years ago by that eminent philanthropist, Lord Shaftesbury. It is not too much to say that by his efforts in the East End of London, his lordship completely altered the treatment of the London donkey by the costermonger. Instead of treating him as a mere beast of harden, out of which the last ounce should be taken in the way of work, Lord Shaftesbury taught the lesson of kind ness, and by offering prises for the best-kept animals, induced a spirit of emulation among the costers that soon bore fruit in well-fed, well-groomed, and willing animals. The effect of this philanthropic work did not pass away with the man to which it owed its inception, and to this day the results of his life work may be seen by any one acquainted with the London costermonger and his ways. If we were to suggest what we think affords the best opening individual effort for ill-, used animals, we should say that there is much to be done towards inducing better treatment of mules. One has only to watch for a short time the painful straggles of the poor animals in two-wheeled carts, laden with building material, dragging their loads, through deep sands, and straining their utmost to bring them to their destinations, to see how these most tell upon the life of the animals. "The merciful man is merciful to his beast” and it is this lesson that wants enforcing, in and out of season, and at any and every opportunity.

                        were imported into Egypt. Wales sent 382,998, Newcastle 161,433, Scotland
                        92,415, Yorkshire 45,736 and other places 26,149 tons. During the same
                        period of 1904,715,501 tons were received. </p>
                    <p>Fire in the Labban Quarter.—A slight outbreak of fire occurred in the Labban
                        quarter yesterday in the house of an Italian named Espiro. Fortunately but
                        little damage was done and the fire was quickly extinguished, but Espiro
                        received severe burns, which necessitated his removal to hospital, and much
                        of the furniture was burned. Inquiry proves the fire to have caused by
                        lighted cigarette ends which were left lying on the floor. </p>
                    <p>Body Recovered After Two Weeks.—The body of a European woman was recovered
                        from the sea near the fort Kaid Bey yesterday. Examination proved that the
                        woman would bo about 25 years of age, and the conclusion arrived at from the
                        autopsy was that the body had remained two weeks in the water. The body is,
                        as yet, unidentified, but the police are making every effort to find some
                        clue which will lead to identification. </p>
                    <p>Soldiers’ Club.— The final match in the billiard handicap for Warrant and
                        N.C.Officers was played on Saturday last, and resulted in an easy win for
                        Sergeant Crane, 2nd Battalion Rifle Brigade (owing 40) who, playing in a
                        confident manner, ran out a winner by 70 points. His opponent, Sergeant
                        Bernet, 2nd Battalion Rifle Brigade (owing 50) was evidently not in his
                        usual form, although giving occasional evidence of his skill, by breaks of
                        24,21 and twice 19, was unable to pull up to his opponent and eventually
                        last by the number stated. </p>
                    <p>The Bubonic Plague.—There was only one case of plague notified in Egypt
                        during last week, namely at Alexandria on the 14th inst Eight cures were
                        effected, of which six at Alexandria, one at Damietta, and one at Assouan.
                        Last Saturday five cases remained under treatment, all which are in hospital
                        at Alexandria, and of these five only one is a native. Since January 1 there
                        have been in all 256 cases as against 799 during the corresponding period
                        last year. Yesterday’s bulletin reports one admission to hospital at
                        Alexandria, a native groom from a stable at Gincinet. </p>
                    <p>An Infant Found Drowned.—The body of a little girl of two years of age has
                        been found in the Mahmoudieh canal by the Karmous. The child, Zanouba bint
                        Mohamed by name, had not been at her father’s house for two days before her
                        body was discovered, and it is supposed that she fell into the canal whilst
                        playing on the bank. The occurrence of such an accident to a child only two
                        years of age can only be due to gross negligence on the part of the mother,
                        or the person who should have looked after the child, and to all
                        appearances, the parents must have been altogether indifferent as to its
                        safety. </p>
                    <p>A New Geography.—We have received from Ahmed Effendi Hafez, an official of
                        the Alexandria post office, a small work entitled "A New Geography” which
                        has been dedicated to Youssef Saba Pasha, director-general of the Egyptian
                        post-offices. This text book is intended for the pupils of Egyptian Schools
                        and has been compiled according to the recent syllabus drawn up by the
                        Ministry of Public Works. It is written in a simple style which can readily
                        be understood by any at all acquainted with the English language, and is
                        illustrated. Much information is given regarding the chief commerce of the
                        various oountries, and the populations are also numerically dealt with. </p>
                    <p>Leave of Absence.—Leave of absence has been granted to the following

                    <p>For the Calabrian Sufferers. — It is tonight that the special benefit
                        performance will be given at the Alhambra Theatre by the Della Guardia
                        Dramatic Company for the relief of the thousands of victims of the terrible
                        earthquake which has devastated a great part of Calabria. We are glad to be
                        able to announce that Alexandrians have responded well to the appeal for
                        their support which has been made by the Press of this city, and that the
                        "house” promises to be crowded in every part Yesterday afternoon a very
                        large number of people went to Mex to assist at the "grand festival” which
                        the management held for the same purpose, and the programme was a great
                        success and warmly applauded throughout. A vocal concert in which some
                        excellent singing was heard, was succeeded by the second part of the Italian
                        drama XXIX Luglio, and this was followed by the Spanish zarzuela La Gran
                        Via, but want of space prevents us referring to any of these in detaiL On
                        Friday Cairo will congregate at the Esbekieh Theatre to witness the
                        performance of Chemineau by the Gardet troupe, which is proving such a great
                        attraction to Cairo theatre-goers, and the proceeds of this performance will
                        also be devoted to the relief fund. The prices which have been fixed for the
                        entertainment are as follows first boxes P.T. 120, second boxes P.T. 70 ;
                        orchestra stalls P.T. 20 ; pit P.T. 15 ; gallery P.T. 5. As we have
                        announced previously the comedy Came le Foglie will be staged at the
                        Alhambra Theatre, Alexandria, this evening, and will be followed by the
                        farce Meglio soli che male accompagnati. </p>

                    <p>The number of pupils presenting themselves for secondary education has been
                        increasing so rapidly of late that it has been found necessary to provide
                        farther accomodation. Two new secondary schools are to be built in the
                        neighbourhood of Cairo to accommodate 400 pupils each, and the Government
                        has granted suitable sites,one at Ghizeh and the other at Abbas-sieh. About
                        this time last year the number of applicants for admittance was 430, whilst
                        this year the applications already number nearly 550. </p>

                    <p>This match, probably the last of the present season, was played on the A.C.C.
                        ground Friday afternoon. The Regimental XI. won the toss and went in first,
                        but started badly, losing two wickets in the first over. Captain Moore and
                        Murphy made a good stand, both hitting very freely and putting on 42 runs
                        for the fourth wicket, but after their dismissal Major Finch was the only
                        batsman to give much trouble. </p>
                    <p>The A.C.C. on going in made a bad start, losing two wickets for nine runs,
                        but J. G. Maclaren, who completed his 1,000 runs for the season amid
                        considerable applause, helped Stacey to carry. the score to 51 and H. B.
                        Carver and Stacey quickly made matters safe. Both hit very freely, Stacey
                        scoring 14 fours in his 69, while Carver hit two fives and eight boundaries. </p>
                    <p>The Cricket club was "at home” in honor of the occasion during the match and
                        the pavilion was crowded. Among those present were Mr. M. de C. Findlay,

                <p>Commissaires législateurs que o’était oet acoord seulement qui devait former le véritable contrat réglant les droits réciproques des parties.
                </p>
               <p>Attendu d’ailleurs queToxéoution matérielle donnée à cette disposition de la loi de liquidation en créant une administration spéciale intitulée au nom de S. A. le Khédive démontre bipn que dans l’idée du Gouvernement aussi bien que de Messieurs les Commissaires, les biens de la Daïra oontinuaiont à rester la propriété du Khédive, mais avec affectation spéciale au réglement du déûoit et aveo droit pour la Commission de les aliéner pour se procurer les ressource s nécessaires au dit réglement.
                </p>
               <p>Attendu d’ailleurs que l'esprit dominant de toute la relation de la Commission d’enqaêto adoptée par la Commission de liquidation c'était de rendre Ismaïl Pacha responsable du défioit, mais rien au delà.
                </p>
                <p>Que dans ces conditions, il serait exorbitant de prétendre qu’après avoit obtenu du Khédive et de sa famille tous leurs biens pour combler le déûoit leGouvernemeut ait encore le droit de bénéficier de ce qui pourrait rester sur le prix de veote de ces biens, après remboursement intégral de toute la dette.
                </p>
                <p>Attendu enfin que le Gouvernement ne saurait invoquer un droit quelconque à oe surplus, puisque il n’y a pas eu de confiscation prononcée à son profit et que la disposition de la loi de liquidation n’a été que la forme imaginée pour donner corps et exécution à l’accord de 1873, lequel seul forme la loi des parties.

              <p>Samedi, la Sooiété des Sucreries a déposé son bilan an greffe du Tribunal mixte. La situation arrêtée an 31 Août se résome en un déficit de 213.639 LE. MM Davey et Girard, le premier administrateur-délégué et le second cbef de la comptabilité des Sucreries et Raffinerie d’Egypto, ajoutent au compte profits et pertes la déclaration suivante que nous résumons eu qnelqnas lignes.
                </p>
                <p>La situation relative aux dix premiers mois de l’année et se soldant par le déficit ci-dessus est sujette à être considérablement modifiée suivant le sort des traites figurant au débit do la société balancées par la passation à son crédit d’an chiffre égal dû par H. Say et Gie en liquidation. Si la Société est reconnue débitrice réelle des traites acceptées en son nom et si, contrairement à ses engagements la liquidation H. Say et Cie ne paie pas à l’échéance, il s’ensuivra une perte du montant total des traites diminué du dividende que verserait éventuellement la dite liqnidatioD.
                </p>
                <p>MM. Davey et Girard signalent en ontre pour mémoire l’existenoe dans les coffres de la Société de traites non datées acceptées par la liquidation H. Say et Cie et dont la validité devra être déterminée.

Nous croyons savoir que des avocats ont été délégués par certains actionnaires pour assister à l’audience et an besoin prendre la défense de leurs intérêts.
                </p>
                <p>Un confrère cairote écrit
                </p>
               <p>“La Sooiété des Sucreries et de la Raffinerie d’Egypte a demandé le concordat préventif à la faillite ; elle a déclaré qn’à partir du 28 août elle se trouvait en état de cessation de paiements.
                </p>
                <p>“Or h la date du 15 septembre, c’est-à-dire la veille du dépôt du bilan, elle a réglé à raison de 50 p.o. environ, plusieurs comptes importants de ses fournisseurs habituels.
                </p>
                <p>“Le payement est irrégulier et illégal 11 n’a été fait que pour s’assurer le silenoe des créanciers à l’audienoe dn 19.
                </p>
                <p>“Dans ces conditions, nons croyons devoir rappeler aux créanciers qui ont bénéficié des faveurs des Sucreries, qu’aux termes de la Loi ils seront appelés à rapporter à la faillite les Bommes qu’ils ont encaissées.”

                    <head>THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION.</head>
                
                <head type="subtype">PHYSIOLOGICAL SECTION.</head>
                
                <p>Colonel D. Brace, in his presidential address at the recent meeting of the British Associa-tion at Johannesburg before the Pysiological Section, took as his snbjeot the advance in knowledge of the causation and methods of prevention of stock diseases in South Africa during the last ten years. South Africa, he said, was particularly rich in animal diseases, every species of domestic animal seemingly having one or more specially adapted for its destruction. The most important were East Coast fever, red water or Texas fever, biliary fever of horses, malignant jaundice of dogs, tsetse-fly disease, trypanosomiasis of cattle, rin- derpest, horse sickness, catarrhal fever in sheep, and heart water of sheep, goats, and cattle. The first known outbreak of East Coast fever in the Transvaal occurred some three and a half years ago in the Barberton district It had already produced an enormous amount of damage among stock, and was probably the most dangerous disease that the people of the Transvaal had to cope with at the present time. The disease only attacked cattle, but in them was an exceedingly fatal malady ; in every hundred cattle attacked only about five recovered from the disease. The duration of the disease after the first symptoms had oc- curred was about ten days. The cause of the disease was a minute blood parasite, which lived in the interior of the red blood corpuscles. This parasite was carried from the sick to the healthy by means of a blood-sucking parasite known as the brown tick. An immense amount of work had been done in combating the disease, thanks to the labours of Professor Koch. In May an intercolonial conference, held at Capetown, resolved that the only effective method of eradicating East Coast fever was to kill off all the cattle in the in-footed areas, and to leave such areas free of cattle for some eighteen months. By this means all the centres of infection would be destroyed, and at the end of eighteen months, as all the infecting ticks would be dead, it was evident that the disease would be completely stamped out. There was no doubt that this drastic method would be the quickest and most complete one of getting rid of this extremely harassing disease. If compensation were given, it could be done at a cost of, say, a quarter of a million. The Government decided, however, that on account of the difficulty of carrying out such a drastic scheme another policy had to be considered. This policy provided for the fencing-in of infected farms, places, lands, or roads on generous terms; the compulsory slaughter of stock, with compensation in the case of isolated outbreaks; the renoval of all oxen from infected or suspected farms ; and, lastly, the stabling of milch cows in infected areas. It was quite evident that under this less drastic policy the final stamp-ing-out of the disease would be a much slower process than if the more drastic scheme of compulsory slaughter of all cattle on infected areas had been carried out. The benefits, however, from the modified scheme were undoubted ; and if carried cut thoroughly and intelligently for a period of several years would probably result in the stamping-out of the disease. Though no method of conferring immunity on healthy cattle had been found out, or any medicinal treatment discovered which would cure the sick animal, yet the knowledge of the life-history of the parasite and of the tick, enabled regulations to be framed which, if patiently carried out, must be crowned with success.
                </p>
                <p>Red water or Texas fever only affected cattle and was found in almost every part of the world. It was introduced into South Africa about 1870 and was now endemic throughout the Colonies. For many years the native cattle c had been immune to the disease ; that was to say, on account of being bom and bred in a Texas fever locality they had inherited a degree of resistance to the disease which en-abled them to pass through an attack when they were young, and so they became immune. But there was one peculiarity about Texas lever, and that was that the blood of an, animal which had recovered from Texas fever remained infective—the germs remained latent -—and so the native cattle of South Africa though apparently healthy, were capable of in-fecting imported cattle with this very fatal malady. The disease had become of secondary importance to South Africa. The native cattle had become naturally immune, and the disease was only fatal to susceptible imported cattle. This, of course, discouraged the importation of prize stock ; but with the knowledge possessed it ought to be possible, by good stabling and prevention of contact with tick-infected cattle, to keep the prize stock alive for a reasonable time. The question of the feasibility of im-munising the prize stock while calves in Eng-land might be considered. In regard to methods of conferring immunity on susceptible cattle many had been tried, but none absolutely free from risk.

                <p>The tsetse fly rendered thousands of square miles of Africa uninhabitable. No horses, cattle, or dogs could venture, even for a day, into the so-called "fly country.” Ten years ago it was thought that the tsetse fly killed animals by injecting poison into them, in the same way a snake killed its prey. Nothing was known as to the nature of this poison in 1894. In 1895, on account of the serious losers among the native cattle in Zululand from this plague, the then Governor of Natal and Zululand, Sir Walter Hely-Hutchinson, started the investigation into this disease. The result of this investigation was the discovery that tsetse fly disease was not caused by a simple poison elaborated by the fly, as formerly, believed bat that the cause of the disease was a minute parasite which gained entrance to the blood of the animals. This parasite was known by the name trypanosome.
                </p>
                <p>Experiments where made which showed that the fly could convey the parasite from affected to healthy animals for at least forty-eight hours. It was a curious fact that among all the blood sucking flies the tsetse fly alone had this power, and up to the present the cause of this has not been thoroughly cleared up. Lately, however, evidence had been brought forward to show that enormous multiplication and development of the trypanosomes took place in the fly’s intestine, a few trypanosomes multiplying to masses containing numberless parasites within twenty-four hours. Since 1895 many other trypanosome diseases had been discovered all parts of the world. The latest and most important of these was one which affected human beings, and was known as “sleeping sickness.” This "sleeping sickness” which occurred on the West Coast of Africa, particularly in the basin of the Congo, had within the last few years spread eastward into Uganda, had already swept off some hundreds of thousands of victims, was spreading down the Nile, had spread all round the shore of Lake Victoria, and was still spreading southward round Lakes Albert and Albert Edward. The disease was in all respects similar to the tsetse-fly disease of South Africa, except that it was caused by another species of trypanosome, and carried from the sick to the Healthy by means of another species of tsetse fly. In spite of innumerable experiments directed towards the discovery of some method of vaccination or inoculation against these trypano- some diseases, nothing definite, up to the  present time, had been discovered. At present  there did not seem to be any likelihood that a  serum could be prepared which would render  animals immune to the tsetse fly disease. In  the same way it had also been found impossi- ble, up to the present, so to modify the  virulence of the trypanosome as to give rise to a modified, non-fatal form of the disease. Again, all attempts at discovering a medicine or drug  which would have the power of killing off the  parasites within the animal organism, without at the same time killing the animal itself, had  not as yet been successful, though some drugs, such as arsenic and certain aniline dyes, had a  very marked effect in prolonging the life of the animal. Rinderpest, which had overrun and devastated South Africa within the last ten  years, belonged to a group of diseases of which  the parasites causing them were unknown. In  all probability these parasites were ultra- microscopic—too small to be seen with our  present instruments. It was to Professor Koch that the honor was undoubtedly due of first  publishing a practical method of immunising cattle against rinderpest. He arrived at Kimberley on December 5, 1896, and in the incre-dibly short space of time of two months was  able to report two methods of immunising, namely, by the injection of rinderpest bile, and, secondly, by the injection of serum from im-mune animals. The discovery that the injunction  of bile taken from an animal dead of rinderpest  rendered cattle immune was particularly brilliant After he left South Africa his work  was continued by Kolle and Turner, who greatly improved the methods, and rinderpest had now lost its terrors. As soon as it appear- ed it could be immediately attacked and stamped out.
                </p>
                <p>Horse sickness only affected equines. It was very fatal disease, carrying off thousands of horses every year. If it could be coped with, the Transvaal might become one of the best horse-reeding countries in the world. At present was dangerous for anyone in Natal and many parts of the Transvaal to possess a valuable horse, for the chances of losing it by horse sickness were so great. This disease was caused by a blood parasite so small as to be absolutely invisible to the highest powers of he microscope. The particular insect which was the carrier of the disease bad not been discovered. A large amount of work has been done within the last ten years in regard to the prevention of this disease by protective inocula-ion. The man who discovered a practical method of dealing with horse sickness would be one of the greatest benefactors of South Africa.

                <p>In the first number there is a leading article by Lieut-Colonel K. Yokara, the Japanese Administrator of Niu-chwang. In the course of the article he states that China is now on the eve of a great awakening. She, however, needs friendly agencies from abroad to assist her in the progress of reform, and he urges the neces-sity of China accepting the help of Japan, who is ready to impart to her benighted sister” the knowledge she has already obtained from her ' Western elders.”

                <p>Few people know Napoleon III. in any other capacity than that of the Emperor of the French, but it seems that he had some claim to be considered a playwright The Alhambra Theatre at Brussels is at the present moment rehearsing a drama which at one time had some celebrity in Paris : "La Tireuse de Carte,” the authors of which were M. Victor Séjour—and Napoleon III. “La Tireuse de Cartes” was not the only play in which the Emperor was a collaborator. A writer in the “Gaulois” informs us that His Majesty also assisted in the production of a military drama in five acts, entitled "Les Massacre de Syrie,” a play in which Abd-el-Kader, the friend and the prisoner of France, was put upon the stage for the first time. This work was represented at the Imperial Circus on December 28, 1860, and on the bills it was announced as the production of M. Victor Séjour. But two others had assisted in its conception—Napoleon IH. and his secretary, M. Mocquard. At that time, M. Lemonnier, who is now mounting "La Tireuse de Cartes” at Brussels, was in Paris, and employed at the Théâtre du Cirque. One of his comrades took him apart one evening, and said to him : “You ought to come to rehearsal to-day.”
                </p>
                <p>“Why ?” asked M. Lemonnier. "I have no part in “Les Massacres de Syrie.”
                </p>
                <p>"Come all the same. You’ll see something worth looking at. I’m the only one in the secret"
                </p>
                <p>“Will there be anything extraordinary Y His friend, in a mysterious whisper : “The Emperor will take part in the rehearsal”
                </p>
                <p>M. Lemonnier thought he was being hoaxed, bat at rehearsal time he turned up “to see if there was anything in the information he had received
                </p>
                <p>As he passed the porter’s lodge at the stage door he was stopped by half-a-dozen men whom he took to be detectives. One of them stopped him and asked, somewhat abruptly :
                </p>
                <p>‘ Where are you going ?" “To the theatre, of course,” replied M. Lemonnier.
                </p>
                <p>After satisfying themselves by inquiries of the porter if he had any business at the theatre, the actor was allowed to pass in. The rehearsal commenced, with M. Hostein, manager of the theatre, and MM. Victor Séjour and Mocquard on the front of the stage. M. Lemonnier hid himself in the wings where he could see what was passing. About two o’clock a young man with a decoration in his coat arrived on the stage and said something in a low tone to M. Mocquard, who made a sign to the manager and his collaborator. A moment later Napoleon III., dressed like a good bourgeois, walked on. “Vive l'Empereur 1” cried the actors and actresses on the stage.
                </p>
                <p>Napoleon smiled and said : “There is no Emperor here, only the collaborator of MM. Séjour and Mocquard, curious to assist at the rehearsal on the one act he has written.” The Emperor then placed himself near the footlights, in an armchair placed there for him, and as naturally as if he had never done anything else in his life, he, with his cane, gave the signal to proceed, and in a good-natured tone said
                </p>
                <p>“Mes enfants, now for the fifth aot”
                </p>
                <p>The artistes, somewhat nervous in the presence of their Sovereign, hesitated a little, but the Emperor was so good-humoured, so smiling, and so amiable, that he was not long in putting them at their ease. When the well-known actor Dumaine had finished, Napoleon made one or two suggestions, and com-plimented him on his splendid diction. Then the diminutive comic Colbrun came on the scene. Colbrun was the real type of the Paris “gamin,” and be was so gay and spirituel, he had so little idea of reverence that it would not have astonished anyone if he had treated the Emperor as a comrade. So he was warned to be respectful. In the middle of the act Colbrun, who had already caused the Emperor to laugh heartily, stopped and rubbed his eyes.
                </p>
                <p>“What is the matter, M. Colbrun ?” asked Napoleon.
                </p>
                <p>"Excuse me, sire,” said the comedian. "But you have in your cravat there a little stone which blinds me, and prevents me going on.”
                </p>
                <p>Napoleon as a matter of fact was wearing a superb pin in his cravat, ornamented with a magnificent brilliant
                </p>
                <p>“Colbrun !” shouted the manager furiously. "You forget	.”
                </p>
                <p>"Let him alone,” said Napoleon, smiling."He is very funny, he amuses me.” And turning to the comedian:
                </p>
                <p>"Mon cher artiste,” he said. "Come nearer to me.”
                </p>
                <p>Then, detaching the pin from his cravat, the Emperor pinned it in the cravat of the actor.
                </p>
                <p>"Now that it cannot dazzle you any more,” added the Emperor, "you may go on with the rehearsal.”
                </p>
                <p>"Ah, Sire ! Majesté !” exclaimed the comedian. “Forgive my emotion! Accept my gratitude !” And not knowing what else to do he shouted in stentorian tones : “Vive l’Empereur !”
                </p>
                <p>“Colbrun, we are told, kept the Imperial present till the day of his death, although one day, when he was short of money, someone offered him 10,000 francs (£400) for the pin.

                <p>“What! Part with the present of my friend Louis ! cried the indignant actor. “No, not for a million !

                <div type="item" scope="international"><head>THE RUSSIAN OIL INDUSTRY.</head>
                
                <p>Although the gravity of the crisis with which the Russian petroleum industry is confronted is frankly and freely admitted in oil circles in London, it is reassuring to learn that the best-informed quarters regard it as unlikely that the home consumer will suffer by reason of the insurrection of which the Baku oilfield is the centre.
                </p>
                <p>'This,” said one of the leading oil importers to a representative of the "Westmininster Gazette,” "will be Russia’s loss entirely, and the opportunity of other oil-fields to step in and fill the gap. It is,of course, a most serious matter for the Russian oil industry, and involves its practical suspension for an indefinite period, but I do not think the English consumer will have to pay anything more for his oil. There is too much oil available. It might have been different a year or two back. In 1903 some 2,203,000 barrels of oil were imported from Russia here, and in 1904 2,029,000 barrels—roughly speaking, half the consumption. But already this year American oil has displaced Russian to the extent that it has supplied 70 per cent of the consumption; and the production of American oil this year is the largest in its history.
                </p>
                <p>"This fact would tend to prevent prion rising, and. moreover, there are other fields that would supply European requirements, Galicia, for instance, Boumania, and Texas— Texas is, of course, American, but is a comparatively new source. Then, in the Far East, there are the Dutch East Indies, the Borneo field, and the Burmah oil company, who will all have a chance should the Russian supply fall short. In do not think that any serious rise in the price of oil is, in the circumstances, to be apprehended.”
                </p>
                <p>"The English companies working round Baku stand, however, to make enormous losses ?”
                </p>
                <p>"No doubt though our advices seem to suggest that the reports as to damage to property are, if anything, exaggerated. The Russians are the people who are going to lose over this business, not only those working the oilfields but the whole commercial and industrial class. What this is equivalent to is a gigantic coal strike extending over several months. The consumption of oil-fuel in Russia for industrial purposes is something like ten million tons per annum, equal to twenty-two million tons of coal, and it would scarcely pay to import the oil from outside.”
                </p>
                <p>This opinion was confirmed at the London offices of several of the Russian oil companies. No matter what might happen to the Russian oil field there would be plenty of petroleum to meet English and Continental requirements. The different officials were, however, unwilling to admit that the reports as to the damage were exaggerated in any way.
                </p>
                <p>“The position is as serious as it can be; that all we can say for certain, and it would be difficult to exaggerate what it all means to the industry. You may, however, take it for granted that all statements as to £3,000,000 of damage being done here, and £2,000 000 of damage there, of £8 000,000 worth of English capital being in jeopardy, and of its needing a year at least to set things going again, are mere estimates based on no sure facts. We ourselves do not know what damage has been done to our property beyond, that is very great Our friends do not know what has been done to their properties. No one can get about to measure the extent of the damage, which extends over a very great area. Practically the only people who are certain of their position are those whose properties have escaped altogether, or have been very lightly touched. As to its taking twelve months to reorganise the industry, that is pure guesswork, too. In any case, the big stores of oil at Batoum. are so far safe.”

                <p>The naphtha fields at Tschimion, which began to attract general attention some two or three years ago, and which are situated in the province of Terzbana, in Russian Central Asia. have in the meantime been investigated, and the experimental borings are considered to promise well. The first reports stated that the borings had resulted in a naphtha fountain of some 60 ft. to 70 ft. high, which in a few days yielded 130 tons of naphtha, and the news was naturally received  with much satisfaction throughout the district The deposits are situated at a distance of some 85 versts from new Marghelan, the Government town of Terzhana, some 4 to 5 versts from the Tschimion locality, and some 20 versts from the railway station of Wannowskaja, on the Central Asian Railway. Naphtha is apparently to be found along a tine extending 4 versts (2 3/4 miles). The Tschimion naphtha deposits have for many yean been known to exist, and have probably been worked by the Chinese in bygone days. When the Terzhana district passed into Russian possession a somewhat primitive working of the naphtha deposits by meant of holes, some 70 ft deep, was commenced, but by degrees these shallow wells ran dry The building of the Samarkhand-Audidjan Railway, however, gave a fresh impetus to the idea of establishing a rational working A Terzhana naphtha company was formed and proper machine boring commenced. When the boring had been carried to a depth of some 1,000 ft good naphtha-carrying strata were reached, a temporary reservoir, for the reception of the naphtha was built, and the construction of one capable of holding 25,000 tons of naphtha taken in hand. Naphtha tanks and a kerosene factory were built at the nearest station, intended to supply the whole of Turkestan with kerosine, and the nearest railway companies with residue for fuel and a naphtha pipe is being constructed to the railway station. It has been decided to sink a number of new boreholes, and sanguine people have even gone so for as to prophesy that the Tschimion naphtha will prove a dangerous rival
