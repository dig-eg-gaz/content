                        <head>TUBERCULOSIS IN EGYPT.</head>

                        <p>We should like to call the attention of our readers to the excellent work
                            now being carried on by the Egyptian anti-tuberculosis League. Egypt,
                            which might have been described as one of the most “immune” countries in
                            the world till a few years ago, is undoubtedly beginning to suffer from
                            an increase of phthisis and other tubercular diseases, which, in too
                            many oases, ap pear to have been imported by Europeans them selves in
                            search of health. The change of habits and mode of life by a section of
                            the native popula tion is also believed by some authorities to be a
                            cause of the greater prevalence of phthisis among the Arabs and the risk
                            that this and kindred diseases may become firmly established in the
                            country is accentuated by the extraordinary ignorance of most of the
                            native and of part of the European population in all matters connected
                            with hygiene, The practice of spitting broadcast, which is so
                            unpleasantly frequent in Egypt is fraught with great danger to the
                            public in cases where a consumptive cannot relinquish the habit, and it
                            is most necessary that public opinion here should support the undertaken
                            by doctors against this pernicious practice on the part of persons
                            suffering from phthisis. Government can do little to combat a widespread
                            custom, however contrary it may be to the rules of health or good taste,
                            An attempt to enforce a law against it would be doomed to failure, and
                            its prohibi tion in public offices and conveyances is, for the present,
                            the only practicable limitation of vice —for a habit dangerous to the
                            safety of the public health is a vice—at which the State can aim. Bat
                            public opinion can be educated, and a new generation may yet be trained
                            to regard with disgust what passed unnoticed among its ancestors, and we
                            urge the leaders of the present movement against the disease to show no
                            discouragement if their ideas are slow in finding favor with the people.
                            Edu-cation is really the best remedy for disease, and it is on the
                            gradual spread of education among the masses, especially in the great
                            cities, that our sanitary reformers must rely. </p>

                        <head>CRUELTY TO ANIMALS.</head>

                        <p>"Man’s inhumanity to man” is too frequently accompanied by cruelty to
                            animals, and no claims on humanity are greater than those advanced by
                            the societies established for the purpose of repressing that cruelty,
                            and lessening its results on the suffering victim. Com plaints on the
                            parts of visitors daring the winter season have been so frequent of late
                            years that we would urge upon all who can do so, the necessity of
                            exerting any influence, however slight, in the direction of securing
                            better treatment, not only of horses, mules, and donkeys, or other
                            animals which the to cieties more especially protect, but of dogs, oats
                            and birds, the latter more especially, in view of the scenes enacted
                            before the eyes of tourists during their trips on the Nile, for the
                            purpose of extorting money from the sympathetic. Two months will elapse
                            before the tourist influx commences ; it promises to be greater than
                            ever this year, and in proportion to the increase of visitors, will be
                            the number of animals required for their use, and the scope for the
                            practice of cruelty. If in the meantime some efforts can be made,
                            individual and collective, to instruct the native, give him a few
                            lessons on kindness to animals, or, if necessary, set before xxx the
                            probability of punishment for wanton cruelty, a great step will have
                            been taken towards in some measure reducing the shocking cruelty at
                            present so rife, and so little thought of. </p>
                        <p>There is flue scope in a country like Egypt for the introduction of the
                            system inaugurated in England many years ago by that eminent
                            philanthropist, Lord Shaftesbury. It is not too much to say that by his
                            efforts in the East End of London, his lordship completely altered the
                            treatment of the London donkey by the costermonger. Instead of treating
                            him as a mere beast of harden, out of which the last ounce should be
                            taken in the way of work, Lord Shaftesbury taught the lesson of kind
                            ness, and by offering prises for the best-kept animals, induced a spirit
                            of emulation among the costers that soon bore fruit in well-fed,
                            well-groomed, and willing animals. The effect of this philanthropic work
                            did not pass away with the man to which it owed its inception, and to
                            this day the results of his life work may be seen by any one acquainted
                            with the London costermonger and his ways. If we were to suggest what we
                            think affords the best opening individual effort for ill-, used animals,
                            we should say that there is much to be done towards inducing better
                            treatment of mules. One has only to watch for a short time the painful
                            straggles of the poor animals in two-wheeled carts, laden with building
                            material, dragging their loads, through deep sands, and straining their
                            utmost to bring them to their destinations, to see how these most tell
                            upon the life of the animals. "The merciful man is merciful to his
                            beast” and it is this lesson that wants enforcing, in and out of season,
                            and at any and every opportunity. </p>

                        <head type="sub"> A.C.C. v. 2nd ROYAL BERKSHIRE REGT.</head>
                        <p>This match, probably the last of the present season, was played on the
                            A.C.C. ground Friday afternoon. The Regimental XI. won the toss and went
                            in first, but started badly, losing two wickets in the first over.
                            Captain Moore and Murphy made a good stand, both hitting very freely and
                            putting on 42 runs for the fourth wicket, but after their dismissal
                            Major Finch was the only batsman to give much trouble. </p>
                        <p>The A.C.C. on going in made a bad start, losing two wickets for nine
                            runs, but J. G. Maclaren, who completed his 1,000 runs for the season
                            amid considerable applause, helped Stacey to carry. the score to 51 and
                            H. B. Carver and Stacey quickly made matters safe. Both hit very freely,
                            Stacey scoring 14 fours in his 69, while Carver hit two fives and eight
                            boundaries. </p>
                        <p>The Cricket club was "at home” in honor of the occasion during the match
                            and the pavilion was crowded. Among those present were Mr. M. de C.

                    <head type="subtype">PHYSIOLOGICAL SECTION.</head>

                    <p>Colonel D. Brace, in his presidential address at the recent meeting of the
                        British Associa-tion at Johannesburg before the Pysiological Section, took
                        as his snbjeot the advance in knowledge of the causation and methods of
                        prevention of stock diseases in South Africa during the last ten years.
                        South Africa, he said, was particularly rich in animal diseases, every
                        species of domestic animal seemingly having one or more specially adapted
                        for its destruction. The most important were East Coast fever, red water or
                        Texas fever, biliary fever of horses, malignant jaundice of dogs, tsetse-fly
                        disease, trypanosomiasis of cattle, rin- derpest, horse sickness, catarrhal
                        fever in sheep, and heart water of sheep, goats, and cattle. The first known
                        outbreak of East Coast fever in the Transvaal occurred some three and a half
                        years ago in the Barberton district It had already produced an enormous
                        amount of damage among stock, and was probably the most dangerous disease
                        that the people of the Transvaal had to cope with at the present time. The
                        disease only attacked cattle, but in them was an exceedingly fatal malady ;
                        in every hundred cattle attacked only about five recovered from the disease.
                        The duration of the disease after the first symptoms had oc- curred was
                        about ten days. The cause of the disease was a minute blood parasite, which
                        lived in the interior of the red blood corpuscles. This parasite was carried
                        from the sick to the healthy by means of a blood-sucking parasite known as
                        the brown tick. An immense amount of work had been done in combating the
                        disease, thanks to the labours of Professor Koch. In May an intercolonial
                        conference, held at Capetown, resolved that the only effective method of
                        eradicating East Coast fever was to kill off all the cattle in the in-footed
                        areas, and to leave such areas free of cattle for some eighteen months. By
                        this means all the centres of infection would be destroyed, and at the end
                        of eighteen months, as all the infecting ticks would be dead, it was evident
                        that the disease would be completely stamped out. There was no doubt that
                        this drastic method would be the quickest and most complete one of getting
                        rid of this extremely harassing disease. If compensation were given, it
                        could be done at a cost of, say, a quarter of a million. The Government
                        decided, however, that on account of the difficulty of carrying out such a
                        drastic scheme another policy had to be considered. This policy provided for
                        the fencing-in of infected farms, places, lands, or roads on generous terms;
                        the compulsory slaughter of stock, with compensation in the case of isolated
                        outbreaks; the renoval of all oxen from infected or suspected farms ; and,
                        lastly, the stabling of milch cows in infected areas. It was quite evident
                        that under this less drastic policy the final stamp-ing-out of the disease
                        would be a much slower process than if the more drastic scheme of compulsory
                        slaughter of all cattle on infected areas had been carried out. The
                        benefits, however, from the modified scheme were undoubted ; and if carried
                        cut thoroughly and intelligently for a period of several years would
                        probably result in the stamping-out of the disease. Though no method of
                        conferring immunity on healthy cattle had been found out, or any medicinal
                        treatment discovered which would cure the sick animal, yet the knowledge of
                        the life-history of the parasite and of the tick, enabled regulations to be
                        framed which, if patiently carried out, must be crowned with success. </p>
                    <p>Red water or Texas fever only affected cattle and was found in almost every
                        part of the world. It was introduced into South Africa about 1870 and was
                        now endemic throughout the Colonies. For many years the native cattle c had
                        been immune to the disease ; that was to say, on account of being bom and
                        bred in a Texas fever locality they had inherited a degree of resistance to
                        the disease which en-abled them to pass through an attack when they were
                        young, and so they became immune. But there was one peculiarity about Texas
                        lever, and that was that the blood of an, animal which had recovered from
                        Texas fever remained infective—the germs remained latent -—and so the native
                        cattle of South Africa though apparently healthy, were capable of in-fecting
                        imported cattle with this very fatal malady. The disease had become of
                        secondary importance to South Africa. The native cattle had become naturally
                        immune, and the disease was only fatal to susceptible imported cattle. This,
                        of course, discouraged the importation of prize stock ; but with the
                        knowledge possessed it ought to be possible, by good stabling and prevention
                        of contact with tick-infected cattle, to keep the prize stock alive for a
                        reasonable time. The question of the feasibility of im-munising the prize
                        stock while calves in Eng-land might be considered. In regard to methods of
                        conferring immunity on susceptible cattle many had been tried, but none
                        absolutely free from risk. </p>
                    <p>The tsetse fly rendered thousands of square miles of Africa uninhabitable. No
                        horses, cattle, or dogs could venture, even for a day, into the so-called
                        "fly country.” Ten years ago it was thought that the tsetse fly killed
                        animals by injecting poison into them, in the same way a snake killed its
                        prey. Nothing was known as to the nature of this poison in 1894. In 1895, on
                        account of the serious losers among the native cattle in Zululand from this
                        plague, the then Governor of Natal and Zululand, Sir Walter Hely-Hutchinson,
                        started the investigation into this disease. The result of this
                        investigation was the discovery that tsetse fly disease was not caused by a
                        simple poison elaborated by the fly, as formerly, believed bat that the
                        cause of the disease was a minute parasite which gained entrance to the
                        blood of the animals. This parasite was known by the name trypanosome. </p>
                    <p>Experiments where made which showed that the fly could convey the parasite
                        from affected to healthy animals for at least forty-eight hours. It was a
                        curious fact that among all the blood sucking flies the tsetse fly alone had
                        this power, and up to the present the cause of this has not been thoroughly
                        cleared up. Lately, however, evidence had been brought forward to show that
                        enormous multiplication and development of the trypanosomes took place in
                        the fly’s intestine, a few trypanosomes multiplying to masses containing
                        numberless parasites within twenty-four hours. Since 1895 many other
                        trypanosome diseases had been discovered all parts of the world. The latest
                        and most important of these was one which affected human beings, and was
                        known as “sleeping sickness.” This "sleeping sickness” which occurred on the
                        West Coast of Africa, particularly in the basin of the Congo, had within the
                        last few years spread eastward into Uganda, had already swept off some
                        hundreds of thousands of victims, was spreading down the Nile, had spread
                        all round the shore of Lake Victoria, and was still spreading southward
                        round Lakes Albert and Albert Edward. The disease was in all respects
                        similar to the tsetse-fly disease of South Africa, except that it was caused
                        by another species of trypanosome, and carried from the sick to the Healthy
                        by means of another species of tsetse fly. In spite of innumerable
                        experiments directed towards the discovery of some method of vaccination or
                        inoculation against these trypano- some diseases, nothing definite, up to
                        the present time, had been discovered. At present there did not seem to be
                        any likelihood that a serum could be prepared which would render animals
                        immune to the tsetse fly disease. In the same way it had also been found
                        impossi- ble, up to the present, so to modify the virulence of the
                        trypanosome as to give rise to a modified, non-fatal form of the disease.
                        Again, all attempts at discovering a medicine or drug which would have the
                        power of killing off the parasites within the animal organism, without at
                        the same time killing the animal itself, had not as yet been successful,
                        though some drugs, such as arsenic and certain aniline dyes, had a very
                        marked effect in prolonging the life of the animal. Rinderpest, which had
                        overrun and devastated South Africa within the last ten years, belonged to a
                        group of diseases of which the parasites causing them were unknown. In all
                        probability these parasites were ultra- microscopic—too small to be seen
                        with our present instruments. It was to Professor Koch that the honor was
                        undoubtedly due of first publishing a practical method of immunising cattle
                        against rinderpest. He arrived at Kimberley on December 5, 1896, and in the
                        incre-dibly short space of time of two months was able to report two methods
                        of immunising, namely, by the injection of rinderpest bile, and, secondly,
                        by the injection of serum from im-mune animals. The discovery that the
                        injunction of bile taken from an animal dead of rinderpest rendered cattle
                        immune was particularly brilliant After he left South Africa his work was
                        continued by Kolle and Turner, who greatly improved the methods, and
                        rinderpest had now lost its terrors. As soon as it appear- ed it could be
                        immediately attacked and stamped out. </p>
                    <p>Horse sickness only affected equines. It was very fatal disease, carrying off
                        thousands of horses every year. If it could be coped with, the Transvaal
                        might become one of the best horse-reeding countries in the world. At
                        present was dangerous for anyone in Natal and many parts of the Transvaal to
                        possess a valuable horse, for the chances of losing it by horse sickness
                        were so great. This disease was caused by a blood parasite so small as to be
                        absolutely invisible to the highest powers of he microscope. The particular
                        insect which was the carrier of the disease bad not been discovered. A large
                        amount of work has been done within the last ten years in regard to the
                        prevention of this disease by protective inocula-ion. The man who discovered
                        a practical method of dealing with horse sickness would be one of the
                        greatest benefactors of South Africa. </p>

                    <head>NAPOLEON III. AS PLAYWRIGHT.</head>

                    <p>Few people know Napoleon III. in any other capacity than that of the Emperor
                        of the French, but it seems that he had some claim to be considered a
                        playwright The Alhambra Theatre at Brussels is at the present moment
                        rehearsing a drama which at one time had some celebrity in Paris : "La
                        Tireuse de Carte,” the authors of which were M. Victor Séjour—and Napoleon
                        III. “La Tireuse de Cartes” was not the only play in which the Emperor was a
                        collaborator. A writer in the “Gaulois” informs us that His Majesty also
                        assisted in the production of a military drama in five acts, entitled "Les
                        Massacre de Syrie,” a play in which Abd-el-Kader, the friend and the
                        prisoner of France, was put upon the stage for the first time. This work was
                        represented at the Imperial Circus on December 28, 1860, and on the bills it
                        was announced as the production of M. Victor Séjour. But two others had
                        assisted in its conception—Napoleon IH. and his secretary, M. Mocquard. At
                        that time, M. Lemonnier, who is now mounting "La Tireuse de Cartes” at
                        Brussels, was in Paris, and employed at the Théâtre du Cirque. One of his
                        comrades took him apart one evening, and said to him : “You ought to come to
                        rehearsal to-day.” </p>
                    <p>“Why ?” asked M. Lemonnier. "I have no part in “Les Massacres de Syrie.” </p>
                    <p>"Come all the same. You’ll see something worth looking at. I’m the only one
                        in the secret" </p>
                    <p>“Will there be anything extraordinary Y His friend, in a mysterious whisper :
                        “The Emperor will take part in the rehearsal” </p>
                    <p>M. Lemonnier thought he was being hoaxed, bat at rehearsal time he turned up
                        “to see if there was anything in the information he had received </p>
                    <p>As he passed the porter’s lodge at the stage door he was stopped by
                        half-a-dozen men whom he took to be detectives. One of them stopped him and
                        asked, somewhat abruptly : </p>
                    <p>‘ Where are you going ?" “To the theatre, of course,” replied M. Lemonnier. </p>
                    <p>After satisfying themselves by inquiries of the porter if he had any business
                        at the theatre, the actor was allowed to pass in. The rehearsal commenced,
                        with M. Hostein, manager of the theatre, and MM. Victor Séjour and Mocquard
                        on the front of the stage. M. Lemonnier hid himself in the wings where he
                        could see what was passing. About two o’clock a young man with a decoration
                        in his coat arrived on the stage and said something in a low tone to M.
                        Mocquard, who made a sign to the manager and his collaborator. A moment
                        later Napoleon III., dressed like a good bourgeois, walked on. “Vive
                        l'Empereur 1” cried the actors and actresses on the stage. </p>
                    <p>Napoleon smiled and said : “There is no Emperor here, only the collaborator
                        of MM. Séjour and Mocquard, curious to assist at the rehearsal on the one
                        act he has written.” The Emperor then placed himself near the footlights, in
                        an armchair placed there for him, and as naturally as if he had never done
                        anything else in his life, he, with his cane, gave the signal to proceed,
                        and in a good-natured tone said </p>
                    <p>“Mes enfants, now for the fifth aot” </p>
                    <p>The artistes, somewhat nervous in the presence of their Sovereign, hesitated
                        a little, but the Emperor was so good-humoured, so smiling, and so amiable,
                        that he was not long in putting them at their ease. When the well-known
                        actor Dumaine had finished, Napoleon made one or two suggestions, and
                        com-plimented him on his splendid diction. Then the diminutive comic Colbrun
                        came on the scene. Colbrun was the real type of the Paris “gamin,” and be
                        was so gay and spirituel, he had so little idea of reverence that it would
                        not have astonished anyone if he had treated the Emperor as a comrade. So he
                        was warned to be respectful. In the middle of the act Colbrun, who had
                        already caused the Emperor to laugh heartily, stopped and rubbed his eyes. </p>
                    <p>“What is the matter, M. Colbrun ?” asked Napoleon. </p>
                    <p>"Excuse me, sire,” said the comedian. "But you have in your cravat there a
                        little stone which blinds me, and prevents me going on.” </p>
                    <p>Napoleon as a matter of fact was wearing a superb pin in his cravat,
                        ornamented with a magnificent brilliant </p>
                    <p>“Colbrun !” shouted the manager furiously. "You forget .” </p>
                    <p>"Let him alone,” said Napoleon, smiling."He is very funny, he amuses me.” And
                        turning to the comedian: </p>
                    <p>"Mon cher artiste,” he said. "Come nearer to me.” </p>
                    <p>Then, detaching the pin from his cravat, the Emperor pinned it in the cravat
                        of the actor. </p>
                    <p>"Now that it cannot dazzle you any more,” added the Emperor, "you may go on
                        with the rehearsal.” </p>
                    <p>"Ah, Sire ! Majesté !” exclaimed the comedian. “Forgive my emotion! Accept my
                        gratitude !” And not knowing what else to do he shouted in stentorian tones
                        : “Vive l’Empereur !” </p>
                    <p>“Colbrun, we are told, kept the Imperial present till the day of his death,
                        although one day, when he was short of money, someone offered him 10,000
                        francs (£400) for the pin. </p>
                    <p>“What! Part with the present of my friend Louis ! cried the indignant actor.
                        “No, not for a million ! </p>

                    <head>THE RUSSIAN OIL INDUSTRY.</head>

                    <p>Although the gravity of the crisis with which the Russian petroleum industry
                        is confronted is frankly and freely admitted in oil circles in London, it is
                        reassuring to learn that the best-informed quarters regard it as unlikely
                        that the home consumer will suffer by reason of the insurrection of which
                        the Baku oilfield is the centre. </p>
                    <p>'This,” said one of the leading oil importers to a representative of the
                        "Westmininster Gazette,” "will be Russia’s loss entirely, and the
                        opportunity of other oil-fields to step in and fill the gap. It is,of
                        course, a most serious matter for the Russian oil industry, and involves its
                        practical suspension for an indefinite period, but I do not think the
                        English consumer will have to pay anything more for his oil. There is too
                        much oil available. It might have been different a year or two back. In 1903
                        some 2,203,000 barrels of oil were imported from Russia here, and in 1904
                        2,029,000 barrels—roughly speaking, half the consumption. But already this
                        year American oil has displaced Russian to the extent that it has supplied
                        70 per cent of the consumption; and the production of American oil this year
                        is the largest in its history. </p>
                    <p>"This fact would tend to prevent prion rising, and. moreover, there are other
                        fields that would supply European requirements, Galicia, for instance,

                        new source. Then, in the Far East, there are the Dutch East Indies, the
                        Borneo field, and the Burmah oil company, who will all have a chance should
                        the Russian supply fall short. In do not think that any serious rise in the
                        price of oil is, in the circumstances, to be apprehended.” </p>
                    <p>"The English companies working round Baku stand, however, to make enormous
                        losses ?” </p>
                    <p>"No doubt though our advices seem to suggest that the reports as to damage to
                        property are, if anything, exaggerated. The Russians are the people who are
                        going to lose over this business, not only those working the oilfields but
                        the whole commercial and industrial class. What this is equivalent to is a
                        gigantic coal strike extending over several months. The consumption of
                        oil-fuel in Russia for industrial purposes is something like ten million
                        tons per annum, equal to twenty-two million tons of coal, and it would
                        scarcely pay to import the oil from outside.” </p>
                    <p>This opinion was confirmed at the London offices of several of the Russian
                        oil companies. No matter what might happen to the Russian oil field there
                        would be plenty of petroleum to meet English and Continental requirements.
                        The different officials were, however, unwilling to admit that the reports
                        as to the damage were exaggerated in any way. </p>
                    <p>“The position is as serious as it can be; that all we can say for certain,
                        and it would be difficult to exaggerate what it all means to the industry.
                        You may, however, take it for granted that all statements as to £3,000,000
                        of damage being done here, and £2,000 000 of damage there, of £8 000,000
                        worth of English capital being in jeopardy, and of its needing a year at
                        least to set things going again, are mere estimates based on no sure facts.
                        We ourselves do not know what damage has been done to our property beyond,
                        that is very great Our friends do not know what has been done to their
                        properties. No one can get about to measure the extent of the damage, which
                        extends over a very great area. Practically the only people who are certain
                        of their position are those whose properties have escaped altogether, or
                        have been very lightly touched. As to its taking twelve months to reorganise
                        the industry, that is pure guesswork, too. In any case, the big stores of
                        oil at Batoum. are so far safe.” </p>

                    <head>NAPHTHA FIELDS AT TSCHIMION</head>

                    <p>The naphtha fields at Tschimion, which began to attract general attention
                        some two or three years ago, and which are situated in the province of
                        Terzbana, in Russian Central Asia. have in the meantime been investigated,
                        and the experimental borings are considered to promise well. The first
                        reports stated that the borings had resulted in a naphtha fountain of some
                        60 ft. to 70 ft. high, which in a few days yielded 130 tons of naphtha, and
                        the news was naturally received with much satisfaction throughout the
                        district The deposits are situated at a distance of some 85 versts from new
                        Marghelan, the Government town of Terzhana, some 4 to 5 versts from the
                        Tschimion locality, and some 20 versts from the railway station of
                        Wannowskaja, on the Central Asian Railway. Naphtha is apparently to be found
                        along a tine extending 4 versts (2 3/4 miles). The Tschimion naphtha
                        deposits have for many yean been known to exist, and have probably been
                        worked by the Chinese in bygone days. When the Terzhana district passed into
                        Russian possession a somewhat primitive working of the naphtha deposits by
                        meant of holes, some 70 ft deep, was commenced, but by degrees these shallow
                        wells ran dry The building of the Samarkhand-Audidjan Railway, however, gave
                        a fresh impetus to the idea of establishing a rational working A Terzhana
                        naphtha company was formed and proper machine boring commenced. When the
                        boring had been carried to a depth of some 1,000 ft good naphtha-carrying
                        strata were reached, a temporary reservoir, for the reception of the naphtha
                        was built, and the construction of one capable of holding 25,000 tons of
                        naphtha taken in hand. Naphtha tanks and a kerosene factory were built at
                        the nearest station, intended to supply the whole of Turkestan with
                        kerosine, and the nearest railway companies with residue for fuel and a
                        naphtha pipe is being constructed to the railway station. It has been
                        decided to sink a number of new boreholes, and sanguine people have even
                        gone so for as to prophesy that the Tschimion naphtha will prove a dangerous
                        rival </p>
