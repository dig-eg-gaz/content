                    Mr. Najem Houry, Managing Director of Cyprus Hotel Co., Army Contractor,
                    Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia (on Railway) to
                    Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin Cathedral (now a mosque)
                    begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with other ancient ruins and the
                    Venetian fortifications, the finest in the world. Also the tower or palace, the
                    scene of "Othello'' and of Ford's "Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus
                    in the winter months is delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                    <head>Egypt and the Sudan</head>
                    <p>Commenting upon Sir Eldon Gorst's visit to the Sudan the Standard" says : Sir
                        Eldon Gorst, who is returning to Cairo after bis brief tour of inspection in
                        the Sudan, bas bad an opportunity of seeing something of the latest
                        developments of that interesting territory. It is perhaps needless to say
                        that the high political significance attributed to the visit by the
                        anti-English journalists of Cairo exists only in the imagination of those
                        ingenious persons. These astute critics, who bave lately been endeavouring
                        to persuade their readers that the Sudan is a crushing and onprofitable
                        burden upon Egypt, have been suggesting that Sir Eldon will inaugurate an
                        ora of drastic economies for the upper country. Some of them even went so
                        far as to hint that in this enterprise the British Consul-General was to
                        receive the active assistance of the Under Secretary for the Colonies, and
                        that the two statesmen would have an opportunity of conferring on these
                        matters on the Upper Nile. Nothing of course could be more ridiculous.
                        Neither Egypt nor the Sudan comes, in the smallest de ree, within the
                        Under-Secretary's "sphere of influence." At Khartum Mr. Winston Churchill
                        was received with the courtesy which in that pleasant and hospitable capital
                        is often extended even to less distinguished guests; but his visit had no
                        more official oberacter than that of any other traveller who happened to be
                        passing through on his way down from the equatorial regions, and both Mr.
                        Churchill and his hosts took care to do nothing which could lead to
                        misconception on this point. As a fact, the Under Secretary for the Colonies
                        bad goitted Khartum before Sir Eldon Gorst had left Cairo ; and though they
                        passed one another on the journey they could certainly have had no
                        facilities, even if such had been sought, for the discussion of political
                        affairs Apart from this myth, there is no reason to suppose that any
                        immediate change in Sudan policy is contemplated or any serious revolution
                        in the relations, financial and orber, which link the Anglo-Egyptian
                        condominium to the Khedivial Government. The situation, so ably sum. marised
                        in the last of Lord Cromer's great series of Reports, is not for the present
                        likely to be modified in its main lines. But bere, as elsewbere, Sir Eldon
                        Gorst has been anxious to render bimself familiar with all the details of
                        administration, not so much with the idea of correcting the work of his
                        predecessor as of extending and amplifying it, and adapting it where
                        necessary to exigencies which were not contemplated during the years when
                        Lord Cromer was rebuilding the fabric of orderly administration throughout
                        the Nile Valley. In the Sudan, even more than in Egypt, the problem is one
                        of developing by administiative means the resources of the country That the
                        vast territory, in spite of its tracts of arid waste and inbospitable
                        desert, contains the possibililies of immense agricultural wealth is the
                        assured belief of all who know something about it. Irrigation; population,
                        and communication are its three prime requisites. Next, of course, after
                        that repression of rapine and violence which the Anglo-Egyptian arins have
                        secured. The first and second of thee two great needs cannot be supplied,
                        other difficulties apart, until progress has been made with the third. The
                        Sudan, like the Britain of the Roman poet, has been penitus toto divisum ab
                        urbe : too long cut oft from the stream of the world's commerce, and
                        accessible only by the long, narrow thoroughfare that leads from the
                        Mediterranean by the Nile sud over the cataracts and through the desert. By
                        that difficult and devious track, on the decks of sailing boats and river
                        steamers, and on the backs of camels, such heavy articles as machinery and
                        building plant have been conveyed with infinite labour into the heart of
                        tropical Africa. But for modern commeree the route is far too slow and too
                        costly. From the beginning of our occupation of the terrirory it has been
                        seen that the Sudan, if it is to make full use of its agricultural
                        capacities, must be placed in direct communication with the Red Sea. During
                        the last year and a half this aim has been achieved. The railways from the
                        Atbara, near Berber, to Port Sudan, few miles from Snakin, is the worthy
                        complement of the work of Lord Kitcbener and Sir Percy Girvuard when they
                        carried the line across the desert from Wady Halfe, and so placed Khurtum in
                        contact with Europe and the Nile Delta From the mercantile point Tof view,
                        the Port Sudan railway, is even more valuable. Sir Eldon Gorst, whose tour
                        in. cluded a trip over the new line and an ex amination of its outlet, can
                        bardly fail to bave been surprised at wbat be saw. In the sbort space of two
                        years and a half he will have found that the engiveers of the Sudan
                        Government have bridged the old caravan route to the sea by a railway, on
                        which one can travel in all the height of modern luxury ; and at the
                        terwious they have laid something more than the foundation of a first-rate
                        modern port and trading town on what thirty years ago was a stretch of
                        uninbabited foreshore. At Port Sydan tbe Consul General saw the plans of

                        warehouse, steam cranes, coal lifting machinery-all the appliances of brisk
                        and enterprising trade. Port Sudan, with its fine harbour and its open
                        channel, navigable at all hours and in all tides, may become one of the
                        notable commercial entrepots of the world. Sooner or later it seems
                        inevitable that the trade of North Eyoatorial Africa must flow through its
                        gates. Meanwhile, it has brought the Sudan into almost startling coutignity
                        with the main centres of the world's industry and population. A passenger
                        travelling by this route can reach Khartum eight days after leaving London,
                        without suffering the smallest discomfort or inconvenience en route ; a load
                        of cotton, grown on the Sudan plantation, can be raileal to the Red Sea and
                        shipped to the docks at Salford without breaking bulk and in a space of time
                        which will compare very favourably with the transit from most other centres
                        for the supply of the fibre. By an audacious flank attack, the isolation of
                        Central Africa has at length been broken down, and the results of the
                        movement, though they may not be realised so quickly with its leaders
                        anticipate, must oveatually be remarkable. </p>

                        the exclusion of Sheikh Rasi from the Khedive's Coreception at Abdeen Palace
                        does n3t call for any further detailed obeervations. The ovent He was
                        certainly regrettable in that it may CRUSO e certain amount of feeling in

                        On the other hand the authorities were left to ohoice in the matter and it
                        was undoubtedly due to the Sheikh's own want of tact that he should have
                        brought himself into such an unpleasant position. The reforun of Al Azhar,
                        on which this inci dent hinges, is one of the great problems apon which the
                        Moslem world appear to be some what, divided. In all cases where religious
                        questions are involved there will over be two parties, those who are in
                        favour of keeping things they are, and those who desire to move with the
                        spirit of the times. Such diver gencies necessarily lead to a great deal of
                        bad blood for there is no more fruitfulsoil for acrimonious hostilities than

                        merged in that of Al Athar. All Moslem education must under existing
                        conditions bave a religious basis. Therefore it would be a fatal step, in
                        the present backward condition of the Egyptian people, to concentrate all
                        the elements of progress in order to found New University, thus leaving the

                    <head>French Deputy On Egyptian Nationalism.</head>
                    <p>Mr. Maurice Barrès, the Deputy and Academician, who has just returned from
                        Egypt, has made the following statement to a repre sentative of the "Belair"
                        respecting the Nationalist agitation in that country, a summary of which
                        appeared in our special cable of the 17th. "In the existing condition of
                        affaire no Egyptian could seriously desire the disappear ance of European
                        advisers. If England were to retire, and if she were not succeeded by France
                        or some other European nation, the result would be return to anarchy. This
                        would be felt as intolerable by the fellabs, who are bow acoustomed to
                        justice and equity, which are, if you like, of a relative character, but
                        still very appreciable, if only in the coll setion of taxes. There is,
                        however, a very strong Nationalist sentiment in the hearts of the
                        natives--that is to say their religious feel. ing and their attachment to
                        Islam. Toleration is a natural gift of the Egyptian Mahomedians; but if they
                        considered that offence bad been done to their religion, their feeling
                        against the foreigner might become really active and even dangerous. Thus
                        you see how Egyptian Nationalism is at the same time a very genuine feeling
                        and one without any precise political object."</p>

                        to and really does eclipse all. The arrangements were ou an elaborate scale
                        and the comfort of the guests had received the fullest consideration. The
                        approaches were enclosed in Arabic tentage while the balcony was transformed
                        into a sitting out apartment and looked very comfortable decked with bunting
                        and evergreen. The ball room itself was tastefully decorated, indeed better
                        than we have yet seen it with flags and palms, while the chain like array of
                        oriental lanterne lent additional charm to the pro ceedings. Some 200
                        persons accepted the committee's invitation amongst whom we noticed Macauley
                        Bey and Mr. and Mrs Trevithick. The string band of the King's Own Soottish
                        Borderers played an excellent programme of music under the direction of

                        shareholders of the above Company, suggests a question which in these as
                        difficult times, should be of very general ni interest The Company referred
                        to is, I believe, y constituted under Egyptian Law and your be
                        correspondenta state its object is the purchase ter and improvements of land
                        in Egypt for resale; they further state that the Directors have cht invested
                        in Cyprus sum not expected to on. exceed 2160,000. It appean to me that if
                        the Di Company is an Egyptian one its sphere of action for limited
                        responsibility is confined to Egypt alone, unless it is clearly stated in
                        ita decree of incorporation, that its objects are of wider range than that
                        stated in the letter above referred to. If I am right in this supposition no
                        special resolution of general meetings, ordinary or extraordinary, can
                        change this or subject to Egyptian law of limited responsibility, any
                        transactions undertaken outside this country, and any agch business would be
                        done on the personal responsibility of the directors. It is only right that
                        this should be so, for otherwise any shareholder might find that his noney,
                        which he had subscribed with the understanding that it should be invested in
                        this country, more or less under his own supervision, was being spent in the
                        middle of Ho the desert of Sabarah, or in some equally remote place, from
                        which it might not be ensy to recall it. It is quite probable that some of
                        your readers may be able to give some information on this subject. I only
                        ask for it on general grounds, and not especially er with reference to the
                        company above referred to. I remain, yours truly, Observer.</p>

                        arguments of our local financiers, who imagine that a loan of two millions
                        will materially relieve the present situation. The situation is clearing of
                        itself, only this process must take time and it will be far clearer
                        afterwards, if the Government does not try to bolster up a false position.

                    <p>The negotiations, which have been continuing of late between the Egyptian

                        at, which will free the Egyptian Estates from its embarrassing purchase. The
                        final approbation will be given at an extraordinary general meeting of the
                        shareholders of the George Nungovich Hotels Company, which will be convened
                        at once after the agreement bas been arrived at. If it is decided to
                        sanction the arrangement as to the retrocession of the hotel, no new hotel
                        will be bailt by the company to take the I place of the Savoy Hotel as was
                        originally intended after the hotel had been disposed of to the Egyptian

                        London, it is merely an Egyptian joint stock company (société anonyme),
                        which does not fulfil the conditions imposed by Egyptian law to ensure its
                        validity. The Shareholders in I question, who bold some 1,000 shares ask
                        that an official liquidator be appointed, and that the board be dissolved.
                        It will be remembered that the company was formed scarcely a year ago, in

                    <p>Mme Magne's "Carmen" was triumph o personality and interpellation : it proved
                        how a really clever gifted artiste can transform herself at will into the
                        most varied and conflict ing parts. In the first act she was the flaunting,
                        bold, hande me factory girl bogdiling her brigadier for the sheer fun of so
                        doing and by the mere contrast ber dovilry to the purity of the pale ooy
                        Micaela. In the lon she was the gipsy, queen among ber sunggling tavern
                        baunters, just decently grateful to the released prisoner, but far more
                        excited by the bold toreror. Theo two acts were triomph. for ber every
                        glance and movement The third at is I venture to believe, impossible for any
                        bat Spaniards or a very, very fow Italians and Mme Magno is neither : and to
                        me there seemed a touch of convention of adaptation, rather, of the part.
                        But the last act again brought out her full powers. Her adoration for
                        Escamillo, her annoyance with Don José and contempt for bis despair, her
                        fright and rage at the danger, and then her death, those were consummate.
                        Two particular features, the quick desperate quiver of her hands as sho
                        retreated from him searching escape in vain, and her scream for Becamillo,
                        heldur entranced, awe-struck, rather. It was a great performance needless to
                        say, the music was AS child's play to her, not a shade of its cold, cynical
                        subtelty escaped her, and she gave the fullest meaning to every intonation.
                        Unusual especially was ber singing when with the chorus, never drowned by
                        it, yet never overpowering it. It was remarkablo. M. Soubayran, was better
                        than usual as Don José, especially at the end. Some of his higher notes were
                        most telling. M. Gorins was also gond, and deserved bis encore for the
                        Toreador,' thongh be forced bis voice a little, it seemed, to obtain the
                        effect. Mlle Talbert was admirably clear and correct M Micaela. The part
                        suited ber and showed that she has an excellent sympathetic voice. The
                        chorns were most adequate. Their acting, as well as their singing, was
                        convincing and showed to better advantage, had their conductor realised more
                        thoroughly the character of Bizet's music. It is a wonder that Carmen musio,
                        torre fascinating every time one bears it, subtlo, unique, daring,
                        absolutely decisive, the production of a real and unusual personality. M.
                        Baron missed the clear, fire and sparkle of it, the crafty, 'diablerie' (the
                        only word) the whole varied strength that distinguishes Bizet from all
                        others. Yet it "went" all the same. The collective power of the singers
                        achieved the result and Madame Magne crownedit. </p>

                    <p>The only two items in last Sunday's concert which one can mention with
                        equanimity were the Schumann, which was just tolerable, and the ond of the
                        Saint Saens 'deluge' when the violin soloist achieved a brilliant success
                        all too short, slas, was his part, but it was instinct with the dignity and
                        beauty of the music, admirable for tone resonance and absolute certainty.
                        For the rest the orchestra were sheep without a sbepherd, burried headlong
                        through the Bach into the Massenet, and thence into the beginning of the
                        Saint Saëns, without breathing space until the violia solo bawan. Such
                        aliwht continuity and interpretation as appeared was, all through, thanks to
                        the leader of the violins. The conductor evidently was unable to deal with
                        the programme. One would gladly have passed over the whole episode in
                        silence but this attempt of the Society to start organised music in Cairo is
                        so important, that one cannot allow their efforts to be wholly wasted, They
                        have drawn up splendid programmes, and they have procured the services of an
                        admirable orchestra. If the conductor cannot lead the orchestra or interpret
                        the music, he should be left to such pieces and operas as are within bis
                        scope. It w yuld be fatal to encourage throngh mere indul. gence a delusion,
                        the results of which would discourage all music lovers from further
                        attendance or efforts I hear that M. Massio, a famous violinist and
                        musician, is in Cairo, and that he may be induced to conduct at the last
                        four concerts. It is most earnestly to be hoped that he will consent so to
                        do. Since writing this I hear, that M. Massie bas consented to conduct the
                        next concert. It is just possible the date may have to be changed to
                        Wednesday 29th : if that proves necessary, due notice will be given to all
                        subscribers, as well as in the papers, as soon as possible.</p>

                        serving in the "Hastings," stationed in the Mediterranean, wben difficulties
                        arose between the Porte and Mebemet Ali, which resulted in 1840 in the
                        British undertaking operations of the coast of Syria The "Hastings" was
                        ordered to the scene of action, and on September 15 he took part in the
                        capture of Batroon. He was next employed in the distribution of arms to the
                        Maronites, and in October was present in the barge of the "Hastings" at the
                        destruction of mine designed to blow up the eastern fort of Beirut. This
                        brilliant exploit was carried out successfully under the direction of
                        Commander Henry Worth, with the loss of one midshipman of the ship. For bis

                    <p>Nous assistons décidément à une réaction, qu'avaient fait prévoir d'ailleurs
                        la continuelle bausse des prix soľncidant avec la rareté des affaires. Le

                        assez d'amplenr pour amener deja des réalisations. Il s'agit plutôt sans

                        les offres ont déterminé une réaction. C'est done l'invariable jeu de cache

                        l'Obligation ancienne Crédit Foncier rétrograde de 304 à 295 francs. Le

                        du tirage du ler Février. Sur le bruit que le coupon serait inférieur celui
