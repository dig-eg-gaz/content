                    <head>SLATIN PASHA ON NATIVE PEELING IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>Slatin Pasha, in the interview he gave to a
                    Press representative in Vienna recently, made
                    wine observations upon the prospects of the
                    new Egyptian movement and the loyalty of the
                    Egyptian Army which have a special interest
                    as coming from the Inspector-General of the
                    Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. From the detailed
                    reports of the interview now available, it is
                    clear that Slatin Pasha has full confidence in
                    the trustworthiness of the Egyptian forces,
                    both officers and men. The position held by
                    British officers at the head of the Army does
                    not affect its loyalty ;and he points out that <cb n="6"/>
                    it was never managed by Egyptians, but by
                    Turks, and, in the words of the proverb,
                    “Arabian and Turkish blood do not boil in
                    the same pot.” Further, the Egyptian officer
                    and soldier both know that it is to their inte-
                    rest to protect the British officer. Their pay
                    is punctual ; promotion, if slow, is fair and
                    impartial ; and, Mahomedans though they are,
                    they have no desire for a war between England
                    and Turkey. Good discipline and the absence
                    of desertion afford further testimony to the
                    contentment of the soldiery.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the presence of fanaticism
                    amongst the native population, about the time
                    of the Akaba dispute, and the rumours of an
                    upheaval, Slatin Pasha pointed to Sir F.
                    Grey's statement in the House of Commons
                    early in July that this fanaticism is found not
                    only in Egypt, but is common along the whole
                    North African coast ; and remarked that the
                    symptoms of this fanatic nature are evident
                    to every one who takes an interest in the
                    welfare of the Egyptians and knows the pro-
                    paganda which is being energetically spread by
                    the leaders of the New Egyptian party. The
                    results of this agitation are so much the greater
                    because the Nationalists bring into the field
                    not only their national sentiment but their
                    religious tenets as well. The religious ques-
                    tion is of the greatest importance, but it
                    causes much perplexity to many a Mahomedan,
                    who, formerly free from bias, has now to
                    acknowledge that the British Government is a
                    supreme blessing to them, and that the zealous
                    and energetic work of Lord Cromer means a
                    great deal for Egypt. The fellah especially
                    perceives the great advantage of it, as he can
                    cultivate his land quietly and peacefully, and
                    can sell his harvest crop without being cheated
                    by usurers, because he can obtain an advance
                    from the State Bank at a small rate of inte-
                    rest.</p>
                    <p>The Mahomedans of high social position see
                    that the general welfare of the country is
                    steadily increasing, that the value of the land
                    and soil has of late years advanced very much
                    in price by the systematic irrigation of dis-
                    tricts which before lay uncultivated, that
                    many millions in value are thereby gained,
                    and that in spite of a decrease in taxation,
                    the public revenue has yearly increased. Fur-
                    ther, they also know that their religion is in
                    no danger. Then a series of mosques is provided;
                    Mahomedan schoolmasters are at work in the
                    schools, and European masters are required
                    for those provinces only where the natives are
                    unable to teach.</p>
                    <p>While recognising the hatred of England in
                    many high circles, which is natural in any
                    land governed by foreigners, it is here deepen-
                    ed by the question of religious separation, of
                    which the New Egyptian party makes full use.
                    The affair of Akaba offered the leaders of this
                    party, which has political aims, an opportunity
                    to rise against the foreigners, on the pretence
                    that Islam was menaced. That the revolution-
                    ary attitude of the Nationalists under these
                    circumstances has caused a great upheaval the
                    Tantah affair proved. Such an attack upon
                    British officers might easily have occurred in
                    earlier years. The punishment of the offenders
                    may be censured as too severe by many Euro-
                    pean newspapers — but quite wrongfully.
                    Drastic measures alone provide the remedy in
                    such cases, and only by sternness and fear are
                    the hare-brained brought to reason. It would,
                    however, be going too far to say that a serious
                    danger is impending, and that there would
                    soon be an outbreak of war. Nevertheless, to
                    prevent such a danger in the future, it is
                    necessary to show that England has not only
                    the idea of holding Egypt, but also the force
                    to maintain her hold there. The garrisons have
                    been reinforced; and the Egyptians know that
                    behind every Englishman stand hundreds of
                    men ready to step into the breach.</p>
                    <p>Emphasising the fact that England up to
                    now has not only respected the Mahomedan
                    religion, but has honoured the leaders of Islam,
                    Slatin Pasha said England would always respect
                    the traditions and customs of the Egyptian
                    peoples, but would also suppress with a strong
                    arm any attempt to change the existing state
                    of affairs—not for any selfish purpose, but to
                    safeguard the welfare of everybody, be he
                    Christian or Mahomedan. Slatin Pasha added
                    that all who take an interest in Egypt, and
                    who hope to see civilisation in Africa steadily
                    increase, ought to concentrate their energies
                    to maintain quiet and peace in Egypt. Simi-
                    larly every Court circle in Europe, instead of
                    finding fault with Great Britain, should con-
                    sider that an outbreak of religious fanaticism
                    on the part of the Mahomedans would not only
                    endanger British sway in the East, but would
                    injuriously affect every other State which pur-
                    sues political and economical aims in the
                    Orient, for a rising would bring misfortune
                    upon all Europeans who dwell in Egypt, as
                    well as ruin upon the Mahomedans themselves,</p>

                    distribute, and on being questioned, they in-

                    <p>The enquiry conducted by Mr. Kershaw is
                    directed against the native population of
                    Sirsina, end not against the Army of Occupa-
                    tion, the postmortem examination having
                    proved the death of the native to be due to a
                    blow from a nabout</p>

                    <p>Since the assault on a European three weeks
                    ago, a very strict watch is kept on the Avenue
                    des Pyramides, which is patrolled by ghaffirs,
                    shawishes, with bayonets fixed, and mounted
                    police. This is very good, observes a Cairo
                    contemporary, but the authorities would do
                    much better if they threw some light on to the
                    situation by a few gas lamps.</p>
                    <p>Towartit Reel Beacon.</p>
                    <p>A new beacon has been erected on the North
                    end of Towartit Reef (Lat 19° 31’ 40” N,
                    Long : 37° 19’ E) in place of the old one
                    which was washed away. The beacon consists
                    of a stone pyramid 21 feet high, painted
                    white, on a concrete base. It is surmounted by
                    a staff and triangle painted red ; total height
                    of beacon above high water, 30 feet.</p>
                    <p>Remarkable Egyptian Bust.</p>
                    <p>The Louvre has recently acquired a lifesize
                    bust, in chalk, primitively coloured, of the
                    heretic king of the Eighteenth Dynasty,
                    Akhonmalon, or Amenophis IV., one of the
                    strangest figures in the long line of the Phara-
                    ohs. The bust is a remarkably fine specimen
                    of the art of the period, and is well preserved.
                    Besides this,there are four sepulchral urns in
                    blue porcelain from the tomb of Rameses II.
                    Io these urns was found, besides funeral linen,
                    certain organic matter, which is being chemi-

                    <p>Last week was a record one for motor car
                    accidents in Cairo. To start with : On Wed-
                    nesday morning, at 11 o’clock, a Jewish girl of
                    thirteen was ran over by a car mounted by M.
                    Paul Conin Fastour ; the wheels went over her
                    body without doing her any harm. The same
                    evening a native was knocked down near the
                    English Bridge, Ghezireh, but sustained no
                    injuries. What is strange about this accident
                    is that the owner, who is said to belong to
                    the Khedivial family, disappeared while the
                    driver had got down to pick up the native,
                    and although the astonished chauffeur made a
                    thorough search, his master had gone, and so
                    he had to return, empty, to the garage.—From
                    Dinard comoes the news of the spill of M.
                    Achillopoulo, son of the late well known sports-
                    man of Cairo. M. Achillopoulo was driving
                    along at a dizzy speed, when something went
                    wrong sod be and his chauffeur were shot out,
                    the latter being rather seriously injured.</p>
                    <p>Al Fresco Dance.</p>
                    <p>The "Al Fresco” dance hold at Kasr el Nil
                    on Tuesday last was quite the greatest success
                    of its kind ever given in Cairo. As was
                    anticipated, quite a large crowd assembled,
                    and although the accommodation was spacious,
                    the number of officers, members and their
                    friends, amply, though comfortably, filled the
                    court. The splendid band of the Royal In-
                    niskilling Fusiliers was in attendance, and
                    the music left nothing to be desired, dancing
                    being started punctually at 9.30 p.m. and
                    kept up well into the small hours of the
                    morning. The dancing was quite of the best,
                    tho dainty costumes of the ladies interspersed
                    with the smart uniforms of officers and
                    N. C. officers, and the neat, if sombre, evening
                    dress, presented a perfect kaleidoscope of
                    colour, charming to the eye. During the
                    interval, coffee, ices, etc., were handed round
                    and it is only fair to state that the coffee
                    was pronounced to be the drink “par ex-
                    cellence of the evening. All who attended
                    this dance are looking eagerly for the next ;
                    Sergeant Major Lamsden and his staff are to
                    be congratulated on their untiring efforts to
                    bring about such an unqualified success. The
                    "Freezer," an entirely new dance, will, we hear,
                    be introduced at the next function.</p>

                    <p>The Khedive has left for Viena. (Reuter)</p>
                    <p>On the occasion of the Mohamedan Feast of
                    Leitei Raghaib on the 24th ult., H.H. the
                    Khedive sent the Sultan a message of felicita-
                    tion, which his Imperial Majesty graciously
                    acknowledged.</p>
                    <p>The Khedive is very fond of his palace at
                    Tchiboukli on the Bosphorus. Recently his
                    Highness ordered a tower to be added to the
                    Palace, which will command a magnificent
                    view. The construction was stopped before his
                    Highness left Constantinople during his last
                    visit, but the work has now been resumed.</p>

                    <head>THE SIRDAR</head>
                    <p>Major-General Sir Francis Wingate, who on
                    Saturday week opened a bazaar in connection
                    with the Parish Church at Dunbar, apologised
                    for the absence of Mr.Haldaue, who was to have
                    performed the ceremony, but who had been
                    summoned by the King to Marienbad. He
                    himself, he said, was merely a sojourner in
                    Dunbar, a bird of passage who hibernated in
                    the far-off valley of the Nile, and, when pos-
                    sible, made periodic descents on to the health-
                    giving shores of Dunbar there to reap a store
                    of good, fresh air to enable him to do his duty                    to his King and country in a somewhat remote
                    and distinctly warm corner of the globe. As a
                    soldier be w[print error]s rightly debarred from touching on politics, but, in the absence of Mr. Haldane, he thought be might be allowed to quote a
                    few of his words, which though intended for
                    wider issues, nevertheless applied equally to
                    the efforts to organise that bazzar and bring
                    it to a successful issue. Mr. Haldane said :
                    “Science is as essential to victory in the arts
                    of war as in those of peace. Organisation is
                    the key to success. Organisation depends on
                    ideas, ideas give birth to ideals.” Mr. Haldane
                    insisted on what he called the trained mind,
                    and to acquire that he said, “Educate, edu-
                    cate " lu[unsure word] Europe, continued Sir Francis, the truth of those words was as clear as daylight,
                    and the workers in the more distant and less
                    civilised parts of the globe daily realised their
                    increasing truth,and were grateful to the theory
                    of the necessity of science in the art of govern-
                    ment and in the administration of public
                    affairs. Especially were they grateful to Mr.
                    Haldane, who had never failed to propound
                    those principles with no small measure of
                    success.</p>

                   <p>(From our Correspondent).</p>
                   <p>During the business hours of Saturday there
                    was but little evidence to show that the
                    Moslem world of Cairo were celebrating the
                    anniversary of the Accession of Abdul Hamid
                    II. to the Throne of Turkey. The Ministries
                    and public offices remained open and business
                    was carried on uninterruptedly among the
                    natives. The Esbekieh Gardena, however, were
                    occupied most of the day by women and
                    children and there seemed to be more than
                    usual of these in the neighbouring streets,
                    and as one passed the gardens one could
                    bear the doleful, discordant wailings of the
                    zummareh and arghool, accompanied by the
                    tuneless scratchings of the kemengeh and
                    dull thuds from darabukkeh. A considerable
                    number of the larger buildings and shops
                    in the main streets flew the Ottoman and
                    other flags and the Esbekieh Gardens were
                    decorated in the customary style with tall
                    poles wound with red and white bearing the
                    star and crescent at their summits, and nu-
                    merous lamps, while the several tents with
                    their gorgeous satayer lent much pictures
                    queness to the general scene, especially after
                    dark, when every corner was brilliantly illu-
                    minated.</p>
                    <p>In the morning a reception was held at the
                    Gouvernorat by Mohamed Pasha Sidki and
                    was attended by the ulema, Sheikhs, and all
                    the Moslem notabilities of Cairo.</p>
                    <p>Towards five o’clock the main street of
                    the Capital became more crowded, the noises
                    from the Gardens grew loader and more
                    continuous, schoolboys from the various ma-
                    daris marched in state to the Gardens to the
                    accompaniment of bands, and there was every in-
                    dication of a great fantasia. The native popula-
                    tion had realised that a fantasia had been
                    prepared for them. But the question was sug-
                    gested to me, “Had many of these people in
                    the streets know the reason thereof ?“ In a
                    spirit of curiosity I asked one or two of the
                    passers by what was going on and in every
                    instance I received the answer "Fantasia ala-
                    shan el Effendina" but none could say with
                    certainty who was the Effendina referred to—
                    one indeed laid it was for the Khedive—or why
                    this fantasia should be held in his honour, I
                    refer, of course, to the uneducated classes for
                    it is certain that those who have attended
                    schools knew the reasons of the celebration.
                    The fact, however, was impressed upon me
                    that a considerable portion of Egypt's popula-
                    tion is either altogether ignorant of even the
                    existence of a Sultan or has very vague ideas
                    as to who be is and what power he has.</p>
                    <p>After dark the railings round the Esbekieh
                    Gardens were illuminated by lanterns set
                    closely together end inside the gardens all of
                    the many lamps were lighted and the scene
                    was most brilliant From 9 to 11 p.m. the
                    band of the Inniskilling Fusiliers played a
                    selection of music, and there were, besides,
                    several native bands, while the tents were
                    crowded with those who wished to listen to the
                    story-tellers or musicians or witness tight
                    rope walkers, jugglers, end the like.</p>
                    <p>The Tahdrieh School, Saida Zenab, celebrat-

                    Tyne by Messrs. Swan Hunter and Wigham
                    Richardson. The new steamer is an important
                    addition to the growing fleet of this Company,
                    she having been specially constructed to meet
                    the increasing demand for the first class ser-
                    vice between Alexandria, Athens, and Constan-
                    tinople, between which ports she will run and
                    carry the mails. She is 380fr. in length by
                    45ft 3in. in breadth, her gross tonnage being
                    4,040 tons, and her two screw engines, which
                    wore constructed by the Wallsend Engineering
                    and Slipway Company, are tour-cranked
                    triple expansion engines of 6,500 h.p. In
                    addition to accommodating 144 first-class
                    and 76 second-class passengers, she has an
                    Imperial suite of cabins, especially intended
                    for potentates, pashas, and millionaires, and,
                    needless to say, these ere furnished in the
                    most exquisite styles whilst there are spacious
                    dining, drawing, writing, and smoking rooms,
                    and also capacity for carrying 2,000 tons of
                    cargo. The 'tween decks are arranged for the
                    carriage of third-class passengers or troops.</p>
                    <p>The general impression derived from a visit
                    to the ship is that of the extreme comfort
                    of all her passenger arrangements. The pas-
                    sages are very broad and there is an air
                    of spaciousness in her accommodation which
                    is often lacking in far bigger passenger
                    steamers. The greatest credit is due to Mr.
                    Parkinson, the general manager to the Com-
                    pany, who is responsible for the design of
                    the passenger arrangements. Nothing has
                    been overlooked to render the vessel up-to-
                    date in every respect end no finer steamer
                    can be found plying between any Levantine
                    ports. On the voyage out she gave every
                    satisfaction and proved herself most seaworthy.
                    Her trials in the North Sea also proved emi-
                    nently satisfactory. On her speed trials she
                    exceeded her guaranteed speed by half
                    a knot, whilst in her final run from
                    the Tyne to Southampton, her average
                    speed was sixteen knots. On her voyage
                    out she created a record for the all
                    sea journey from England to Alexandria.

                    <p>To the Editor or the "Egtptian Gazette.”
                    Sir,— Although so many people appear to
                    be interested in the “Morality Crusade’’ now
                    being carried on in Alexandria, not one of
                    them appears to have struck the right note to
                    prevent the ladies of the demi-monde from
                    carrying on their profession. The care is a
                    simple as possible. Do not allow them to land
                    in Egypt. Not one of these ladies ere born in
                    Egypt They are all Europeans, Germans,
                    Italians, French, etc., Then why allow them
                    to land here? They all come here for the
                    express purpose of carrying on their profes-
                    sion, and in the "season” they come on pur-
                    pose to live on the “Tourist.”
                    It would not be a difficult matter to pick
                    out these “ladies" on the arrival of every
                    steamer, and when the first lot or two were
                    turned back, the news would soon spread, and
                    no more would come.</p>
                    <p>I think this would be a much better way
                    than allowing them to "land” and then hunt-
                    ing them from “pillar to post," as is being
                    done at present by the so-called “purity"
                    brigade of which Mr. P. Rudolph appears
                    to be one of the leaders, quite forgetting that
                    these poor girls are “human beings” and were
                    once as pure as the "hunters’" own mothers,
                    and should have a little compassion shown
                    them, if, for no other reason, than that they
                    are "women."</p>
                    <p>It is nothing to the credit of Mr. P.
                    Rudolph (who appears to be a caretaker or
                    something, of some “home," kept up by public
                    subscription) that he should go out of his way
                    to hustle these poor girls around as he speaks
                    of having done for a number of years. It would
                    be better if he followed the precepts laid down
                    in the "Christian Bible," “and did unto others
                    as he would be done unto."—Yours, etc.,	</p>

                    <p>( From our Correspondent. )</p>
                    <p>Beyrout, August 22.</p>
                    <p>Our intercourse with Egypt in regard to
                    both Syrian exports of goods and the Egyptian
                    exodus of summer visitors has been exception-
                    ally lively this year. It is estimated that
                    over 14,000 Egyptians are now scattered in
                    different villages of the Lebanon. Oar Passport
                    Department, realizing the profits that are
                    likely to accrue both to the Government and
                    the country at large from the visit and pro-
                    longed sojourn of this more or less wealthy
                    class of Egyptians, has been particularly
                    courteous this year, and the large number of
                    Egyptian visitors this season may be accounted
                    for thereby. This is a matter of congratula-
                    tion, the more so as certain regrettable inci-
                    dents in the past have seriously indisposed the
                    Egyptians against Syria, leading many to
                    shun it persistently.</p>
                    <p>Exports to Egypt.</p>
                   <p>As regards our exports to Egypt, unusual
                    quantities of beans and barley, and, to a certain
                    extent, wheat, have been shipped from the
                    Syrian coast, owing apparently to the failure
                    of these crops in Egypt, or else to the
                    diminished cultivation of these products, or
                    perhaps to both factors. Indeed the demand
                    has been so strong and sustained that it has
                    perturbed very seriously the local trade. Our
                    local market has been to excited by this
                    extraordinary Egyptian demand that spot
                    prices rose to s figure quite incompatible with
                    the European and British markets, which
                    by reason of their absorbing the bulk of these
                    exports have always been the determining
                    factor in the fluctuations of our local markets.
                    At one time it was thought that this demand
                    would soon be satisfied, and a normal condition
                    of things would be resumed. But contrary to
                    the predictions of experienced authorities the
                    demand persisted longer then it had been
                    thought, with the result that the reaction
                    still continues. The big merchants, who export
                    annually thousands of tons of grain to the
                    Continent and the United Kingdom, are having
                    their hands tied, and grain transactions with
                    the above-mentioned countries are being serious-
                    ly hampered. The inefficiency of the railway
                    transport is crowning their evils. To give an
                    idea of the abnormal nature of this Egyptian
                    demand I may mention as an instance, the
                    two facts that 2,500 tons of Gaza barley have
                    arrived and been sold in Egypt in one single
                    week, when this figure almost represented,
                    formerly, the exports of a whole campaign from
                    Gaza to Egypt, and that by one Messageries
                    steamer 500 tons of grain were shipped from
                    Beyrout to Alexandria. A statistical list,
                    showing the total of exports of grain from the
                    Syrian coast to Egypt during this campaign,
                    will no doubt contain most startling figures.
                    Some people think that this unusually strong
                    Egyptian demand has not been solely deter-
                    mined by the law of supply and demand, but
                    rather by the spirit of speculation that[smudge] has
                    permeated so deeply into the soul of Egyptians.</p>

                    ficially on the development of Uganda and
                    British East Africa generally. With a view
                    to carrying out the above project, the Egyptian
                    Government has decided to make a hydrogra-
                    phic survey of the whole of the banks of the
                    Nile right up to Lake Victoria, and also of the
                    countries stretching between that lake and the
                    East Coast of Africa. A mission has been
                    nominated, at the head of which is Captain
                    Lyons, Director General of the Surveys Depart-
                    ment, to oarry out the first portion of these
                    labours. The data collected in districts so
                    little known will be of the first importance to
                    hydrographic questions related to Uganda
                    itself and British East Africa. In particular
                    the debateable questions of the relations of the
                    several great lakes to the Nile will be settled,
                    also some light thrown on the river systems of
                    the British protectorate, which should be of
                    value in connection with such schemes s=as, say,
                    the utilising of the Ripon Falls for the gene-
                    ration of electricity and other similar under-
                    takings.</p>

                    <head>GERMANY AND EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>According to the 'Sohlesische Zeitung"
                    (Berlin, Aug. 16) the German Foreign Office
                    will be very remiss if it does not take the
                    opportunity when Lord Cromer’s proposals for
                    the reform of the judicial system in Egypt
                    come up for discussion to compel the British
                    Government to grant to Germany an Egyptian
                    "open door" in perpetuity in exchange for
                    Germany's consent to the abolition of the Capi-
                    tulations. Lord Cremer’s proposed reforms are
                    regarded in Berlin as a preparatory step to the
                    annexation of Egypt by England, and Germany
                    is urged by the "Schlesischne Zeitung" and a
                    number of other journals to utilise the situa-
                    tion to extract compensation for forgoing all
                    right to interfere with the British designs. The
                    two concessions Germany would like are an
                    uninterrupted and free market in Egypt and a
                    terminus on the Persian Gulf for the Baghdad
                    Railway. If she can manage a "deal" on these
                    lines German diplomacy would be triumphant.
                    While counselling reserve in treating Egyp-
                    tian questions, the "Berliner Neueste Nach-
                    richten" (Aug 16) observes that since Bis-
                    marck's time the relations of Turkey to Egypt
                    have become for Germany a matter of greater
                    importance. Germany's interests are increasing
                    in the Near Best, and it has become one of the
                    leading points of German policy in the
                    Orient that the sovereignly of the Sultan shall
                    not be impugned.</p>
