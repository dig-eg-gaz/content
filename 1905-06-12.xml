                            and Government cuts stating that ho felt the time bad come when in the
                            interests of all mankind he must endeavour to see if it was not
                            impossible to bring the prescut terrible and lamentable conflict to an
                            end. The United States is interested in both Japan, and Russia by ties
                            of friendship and good will, and lie felt that the progress of the world
                            was set back by the war between two great nations. He urged the two
                            Governments, not only for their own sakes, but also in the interest of
                            the whole civilised world, to open direct negotiations for peace.

                            inst alter an assurance from Tokio and St Petersburg that the proposals
                            would bo acceptable. The replies of Japan and Russia ate now eagerly

                            representatives. It is therefore understood that the next step will bo
                            the arrangement of an armistice, (R.)</p>

                    <p>NEW RAILWAY ENGINES. The finest railway engines that have ever been seen in
                        Egypt have arrived, and are to be need for the Cairo-Alexandria line as soon
                        as the Benha and Birket el-Sab bridges have been put into a proper state to
                        bear the weight *The Egyptian Railway * Administration has ordered ten
                        locomotives of this type. Of these, seven have arrived, two are awaiting
                        disembarkation in Alexandria harbour, and one is on its way out They havo
                        boon dosigned and built by the Soctetd Fran raise des Constructions
                        Mtksaniques of Denain and were ordered and completed last year. This company
                        builds the locomotives for the most important railways in Prance, and the
                        engines, which ran on the Parii-Calais line, the expresses on which line
                        bold the reoord of swiftness, are exactly of the same type as the ones which
                        are to be used Egyptian Railway Administration. In Prance these locomotives
                        can average a speed of 120 Idiom, an hour, and as the distanoe from
                        Alexandria to Cairo is only 208 kilom., they oonld-pasily do the journey in
                        two hours. Each, locomotive weighs 120 tons and is fitted with engines of
                        the oompound Atlantic type with foar cylinders oompound. They have been on
                        trial trips between Alexandria and Kafr Dawar and have given every
                        satisfaction, their running being especially remarkable for smoothness. They
                        will bo shortly-pot on between Alexandria and Tantah, but, as we mentioned
                        above, they cannot be used all the way to Cairo until tho Benha and Birket
                        el-Sib bridges have been strengthened. It is unknown when the former bridge
                        will be in a state to admit of the passage of the locomotives. It ii very
                        characteristic of the Egyptian Railway Administration's methods that the
                        orders were given last year for these ten magnificent and oostly locomotives
                        without any attention being given to such a minor matter of detail as to
                        whether tho bridges were strong enough to boar them with safoty. A great sum
                        of money was spent on the purchase, and was believed that they would bo most
                        asefulfor the express servioe between Cairo and Alexandria. Now that the
                        locomotives have arrived they can only be nsed as for Tantah, because when
                        it was too late soi person suggested that the bridges at Benha and
                        Birket-el-Sab were not strong enough, is a matter of congratulation that
                        this foct was not entirely overlooked as a fearful accident wouty have
                        occurred if the Benha bridge had broken down when one of the-e locomotives
                        was taking an express, crowded with passengers, over the river. Bat better
                        late than never, and in the future it is expected that the bridges will be
                        put in a satisfactory</p>

                            des Quarantos and opposite the Djelfol property. No effort had been
                            sjared by the committee to moke the grounds attractive, and they were
                            deoorated with a plentiful supply of bunting, in which of oouree tbe
                            Greek tlag predominated, bnt ooloura of other nations were abundant and
                            at one end was erected an arch, tho supports of which were entwioed with
                            fronds of the palm-tree and bound with the Greek and Ottoman The arrival
                            of M. Gennadis, Greek Diplomatic Agent, and also honorary president of
                            the newly-created dab, was greeted by the playing of the Greek national
                            anthem by a band of tchoolboys. Some five mine toe later his Holiness
                            Mgr. Photios, Greek Patriarch, who had come from Alexandria, arrived and
                            escorted to the raised dais, which had been orocted for his reception,
                            by the competitors who were to take part in the subsequent sports. The
                            religious oeremouy of inauguration was performed by his Holiness, the
                            competitors meanwhile forming op in doable line in front of the dais,
                            aud alter he had given his blessing to the dab and delivered an
                            impressive ser-on, M. Gennadis spoke at some length.</p>
                        <p>After the ooudosion of the oeremouy the competitors paraded ronnd the
                            ground, and this was followed by an open race of 100 metres, which was
                            run iu several heats. The pole jump came next and oaused great
                            competition, nearly all the candidates clearing 2 metres 20, but all
                            save tho winner failed at 2 m. 30, and he then cleared , 2 m. 40, after
                            three unsuccessful attempts. The Swedish exercises as performed by the
                            younger boys showed that great care had been taken in their training,
                            and also that they were themselves possessed of considerable skill and
                            endutanoe. Patting the weight followed this, and the competition was ea
                            keen as in jamping with the pole. Tbe elder n embers of the club* then
                            gave a display of Swedish exerotses and acquitted themselves creditably,
                            and this gave way to a three-footed jump, wbiofi caused considerable
                            amusement. An exoellent exhibition of general athletics was then brought
                            to an end by "throwing the diso." All of the competitors, almost without
                            exception, had given a good account of themselves and showed themselves
                            to be good sportsmen. We wish the clnb every success and hope that it
                            will receive the support it deserves.</p>
