            DELEGATES TO MEET.
            <p>Washington, June 10.</p>
            On the 8th inst President Roosevelt sent a communication to the Japanese and Government cuts stating that ho felt the time bad come when in the interests of all mankind he must endeavour to see if it was not impossible to bring the prescut terrible and lamentable conflict to an end. The United States is interested in both Japan, and Russia by ties of friendship and good will, and lie felt that the progress of the world was set back by the war between two great nations. He urged the two Governments, not only for their own sakes, but also in the
            interest of the whole civilised world, to open direct negotiations for peace.    (Reuter).
            Washington, June 10). President Roosevelt's note farther earnestly asks the belligerents to agree to a meeting of plenipotentiaries without any intermediary Power. Ho will gladly assist in arranging the preliminaries as to time and place, but even these would be bettor arranged direct by Japan and Russia.
            The note was despatched on the afternoon of the 8th inst alter an assurance from Tokio and St Petersburg that the proposals would bo acceptable. The replies of Japan and Russia ate now eagerly awaited. The St Petersburg and Tokio Bourses are most active to-day.
            Later). Both belligerents have accepted  President Roosevelt’s proposaL The plenipotentiaries will probably meet here. Baron do Rosen will represent Russia.
            The announcement of the consent to appoint delegates has been issued both at St Petersburg and Tokio. Russia will bo willing to appoint representatives to boar the Japanese proposals when informed that Japan is also nominating representatives.
            It is therefore understood that the next step will bo the arrangement of an armistice, (R.)
            Paris, June 10.
            Russia and Japan accept President -Roosevelt's proposals, showing the opportuneness of direct negotiations between the two belligerents for the conclusion of peace. The Russian and Japanese plenipotentiaries will probably meet at Washington.	(Havas.)
            Washington, Jane 11.
            The replies irom Russia and Japan accepting President Roosevelt’s proposal reached here yesterday evening. Both express gratification at the offer. It has been known from the outset that France has supported President Roosevelt's efforts and brought powerful influence to bear upon her ally to accept the proposal.	(Reuter.)
            London, June 11.
            Renter's Agency learns officially from St. Petersburg that there is no question of nominating plenipotentiaries at this juncture. Whatever meeting is now arranged will be merely for the purpose of communicating the Japanese terms, which will be referred to St. Petersburg. If the Russian Government finds that they constitute an admissible base of negotiation, then plenipotentiaries will appointed.	(Reuter.)

            MR. CLOWES IN A RAILWAY ACCIDENT.
            (Prom our Correspondent).
            Medinet el Fayonm, Sunday.
            Mr. Clowes, Inspector General of Irrigation, was in an aocident on the Payourn Light Railway yesterday which nearly cost him his life. Ho was on his way to Lahoon, when the engine of the train ran into a canal ditch. Mr. Clowea was in the carriage behind the engine and received a heavy blow on his head.

"Aida," yon are probably right in describing the specimen as the largest of the Red Sea “shovel-nose,” hot other species normally attain to even larger sizas. There is a regular shark fishery-on the West Coast of Ireland (for the sake of tbe oil of the liver principally), the specie* there fonnd attaining frequently to a length of forty feet In spite of this hnge size it is, by intention at least, perfectly innocuous. The New Zealand pclagio ihark attains to equal or greater site, Mr. Logan of this town informing me that for many years the skeleton of olfe measuring over lorty feet lay on Brown’s Island in the Waitemata at Auckland.

            TO CAIRO IN TWO 1I0URS.
            NEW RAILWAY ENGINES.
            The finest railway engines that have ever been seen in Egypt have arrived, and are to be need for the Cairo-Alexandria line as soon as the Benha and Birket el-Sab bridges have been put into a proper state to bear the weight *The Egyptian Railway * Administration has ordered ten locomotives of this type. Of these, seven have arrived, two are awaiting disembarkation in Alexandria harbour, and one is on its way out They havo boon dosigned and built by the Soctetd Fran raise des Constructions Mtksaniques of Denain and were ordered and completed last year. This company builds the locomotives for tbe most important railways in Prance, and the engines, which ran on the Parii-Calais line, the expresses on which line bold the reoord of swiftness, are exactly of the same type as the ones which are to be used Egyptian Railway Administration. In Prance these locomotives can average a speed of 120 Idiom, an hour, and as the distanoe from Alexandria to Cairo is only 208 kilom., they oonld-pasily do the journey in two hours.
            Each, locomotive weighs 120 tons and is fitted with engines of the oompound Atlantic type with foar cylinders oompound. They have been on trial trips between Alexandria and Kafr Dawar and have given every satisfaction, their running being especially remarkable for smoothness.
            They will bo shortly-pot on between Alexandria and Tantah, but, as we mentioned above, they cannot be used all the way to Cairo until tho Benha and Birket el-Sib bridges have been strengthened. It is unknown when the former bridge will be in a state to admit of the passage of the locomotives.
            It ii very characteristic of the Egyptian Railway Administration's methods that the orders were given last year for these ten magnificent and oostly locomotives without any attention being given to such a minor matter of detail as to whether tho bridges were strong enough to boar them with safoty. A great sum of money was spent on the purchase, and was believed that they would bo most asefulfor the express servioe between Cairo and Alexandria. Now that the locomotives have arrived they can only be nsed as for Tantah, because when it was too late soi person suggested that the bridges at Benha and Birket-el-Sab were not strong enough, is a matter of congratulation that this foct was not entirely overlooked as a fearful accident wouty have occurred if the Benha bridge had broken down when one of the-e locomotives was taking an express, crowded with passengers, over the river. Bat better late than never, and in the future it is expected that the bridges will be put in a satisfactory

            HELLENIC ATHLETIC CLUB.
            Yesterday afternoon a forge number of the patriotic Greeks of Cairo assembled to witness the inauguration of the Hellenio Athletic Clnb Iphitos,” the grounds of which are situated in the vicinity of the Club des Quarantos and opposite the Djelfol property. No effort had been sjared by the committee to moke the grounds attractive, and they were deoorated with a plentiful supply of bunting, in which of oouree tbe Greek tlag predominated, bnt ooloura of other nations were abundant and at one end was erected an arch, tho supports of which were entwioed with fronds of the palm-tree and bound with the Greek and Ottoman The arrival of M. Gennadis, Greek Diplomatic Agent, and also honorary president of the newly-created dab, was greeted by the playing of the Greek national anthem by a band of tchoolboys. Some five mine toe later his Holiness Mgr. Photios, Greek Patriarch, who had come from Alexandria, arrived and escorted to the raised dais, which had been orocted for his reception, by the competitors who were to take part in the subsequent sports. The religious oeremouy of inauguration was performed by his Holiness, the competitors meanwhile forming op in doable line in front of the dais, aud alter he had given his blessing to the dab and delivered an impressive ser-on, M. Gennadis spoke at some length.
            After the ooudosion of the oeremouy the competitors paraded ronnd the ground, and this was followed by an open race of 100 metres, which was run iu several heats. The pole jump came next and oaused great competition, nearly all the candidates clearing 2 metres 20, but all save tho winner failed at 2 m. 30, and he then cleared , 2 m. 40, after three unsuccessful attempts. The Swedish exercises as performed by the younger boys showed that great care had been taken in their training, and also that they were themselves possessed of considerable skill and endutanoe. Patting the weight followed this, and the competition was ea keen as in jamping with the pole. Tbe elder n embers of the club* then gave a display of Swedish exerotses and acquitted themselves creditably, and this gave way to a three-footed jump, wbiofi caused considerable amusement. An exoellent exhibition of general athletics was then brought to an end by "throwing the diso." All of the competitors, almost without exception, had given a good account of themselves and showed themselves to be good sportsmen. We wish the clnb every success and hope that it will receive the support it deserves.
