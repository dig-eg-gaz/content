                            and Government cuts stating that ho felt the time bad come when in the
                            interests of all mankind he must endeavour to see if it was not
                            impossible to bring the prescut terrible and lamentable conflict to an
                            end. The United States is interested in both Japan, and Russia by ties
                            of friendship and good will, and lie felt that the progress of the world
                            was set back by the war between two great nations. He urged the two
                            Governments, not only for their own sakes, but also in the interest of
                            the whole civilised world, to open direct negotiations for peace.

                            Japan and Russia. The note was despatched on the afternoon of the 8th
                            inst alter an assurance from Tokio and St Petersburg that the proposals
                            would bo acceptable. The replies of Japan and Russia ate now eagerly

                            representatives. It is therefore understood that the next step will bo
                            the arrangement of an armistice, (R.)</p>

                                proposal reached here yesterday evening. Both express gratification
                                at the offer. It has been known from the outset that France has
                                supported President Roosevelt's efforts and brought powerful
                                influence to bear upon her ally to accept the proposal. (Reuter.)

                        builds the locomotives for tbe most important railways in Prance, and the
                        engines, which ran on the Parii-Calais line, the expresses on which line
                        bold the reoord of swiftness, are exactly of the same type as the ones which
                        are to be used Egyptian Railway Administration. In Prance these locomotives
                        can average a speed of 120 Idiom, an hour, and as the distanoe from
                        Alexandria to Cairo is only 208 kilom., they oonld-pasily do the journey in
                        two hours. Each, locomotive weighs 120 tons and is fitted with engines of
                        the oompound Atlantic type with foar cylinders oompound. They have been on
                        trial trips between Alexandria and Kafr Dawar and have given every
                        satisfaction, their running being especially remarkable for smoothness. They
                        will bo shortly-pot on between Alexandria and Tantah, but, as we mentioned
                        above, they cannot be used all the way to Cairo until tho Benha and Birket
                        el-Sib bridges have been strengthened. It is unknown when the former bridge
                        will be in a state to admit of the passage of the locomotives. It ii very
                        characteristic of the Egyptian Railway Administration's methods that the
                        orders were given last year for these ten magnificent and oostly locomotives
                        without any attention being given to such a minor matter of detail as to
                        whether tho bridges were strong enough to boar them with safoty. A great sum
                        of money was spent on the purchase, and was believed that they would bo most
                        asefulfor the express servioe between Cairo and Alexandria. Now that the
                        locomotives have arrived they can only be nsed as for Tantah, because when
                        it was too late soi person suggested that the bridges at Benha and
                        Birket-el-Sab were not strong enough, is a matter of congratulation that
                        this foct was not entirely overlooked as a fearful accident wouty have
                        occurred if the Benha bridge had broken down when one of the-e locomotives
                        was taking an express, crowded with passengers, over the river. Bat better
                        late than never, and in the future it is expected that the bridges will be
                        put in a satisfactory</p>

                    <p>Yesterday afternoon a forge number of the patriotic Greeks of Cairo assembled
                        to witness the inauguration of the Hellenio Athletic Clnb Iphitos,” the
                        grounds of which are situated in the vicinity of the Club des Quarantos and
                        opposite the Djelfol property. No effort had been sjared by the committee to
                        moke the grounds attractive, and they were deoorated with a plentiful supply
                        of bunting, in which of oouree tbe Greek tlag predominated, bnt ooloura of
                        other nations were abundant and at one end was erected an arch, tho supports
                        of which were entwioed with fronds of the palm-tree and bound with the Greek
                        and Ottoman The arrival of M. Gennadis, Greek Diplomatic Agent, and also
                        honorary president of the newly-created dab, was greeted by the playing of
                        the Greek national anthem by a band of tchoolboys. Some five mine toe later
                        his Holiness Mgr. Photios, Greek Patriarch, who had come from Alexandria,
                        arrived and escorted to the raised dais, which had been orocted for his
                        reception, by the competitors who were to take part in the subsequent
                        sports. The religious oeremouy of inauguration was performed by his
                        Holiness, the competitors meanwhile forming op in doable line in front of
                        the dais, aud alter he had given his blessing to the dab and delivered an
                        impressive ser-on, M. Gennadis spoke at some length.</p>
                    <p>After the ooudosion of the oeremouy the competitors paraded ronnd the ground,
                        and this was followed by an open race of 100 metres, which was run iu
                        several heats. The pole jump came next and oaused great competition, nearly
                        all the candidates clearing 2 metres 20, but all save tho winner failed at 2
                        m. 30, and he then cleared , 2 m. 40, after three unsuccessful attempts. The
                        Swedish exercises as performed by the younger boys showed that great care
                        had been taken in their training, and also that they were themselves
                        possessed of considerable skill and endutanoe. Patting the weight followed
                        this, and the competition was ea keen as in jamping with the pole. Tbe elder
                        n embers of the club* then gave a display of Swedish exerotses and acquitted
                        themselves creditably, and this gave way to a three-footed jump, wbiofi
                        caused considerable amusement. An exoellent exhibition of general athletics
                        was then brought to an end by "throwing the diso." All of the competitors,
                        almost without exception, had given a good account of themselves and showed
                        themselves to be good sportsmen. We wish the clnb every success and hope
                        that it will receive the support it deserves.</p>
