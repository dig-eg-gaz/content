                        Yesterday the Government informed the Appeal Court of the renewal of the
                        executive of the Mixed Court*. The new term of five year* begins tomorrow.
                        The Decree authorising the renewal of the functions of the Courts was signed

                    <head>THE WADY RAYAN AND MR. COPE WHITEHOUSE.</head>
                    <p>A correspondent writes: In regard to the article on Mr. Cope Whitehouse which
                        appeared in Friday's “Gazette,” I may mention that historians of the future
                        should not overlook the fact that there is one man to whom Egypt is much
                        indebted as to anyone for the Assouan dam, and that is Mr. Cope Whitehouse.
                        Ho is a man ot very great mental capacity, equally fitted to fill a
                        professorship of Greek or Natural Science. Twenty ago be foresaw the
                        necessity of storage rsaenoira for Egypt and proposed the Wady Rayan for
                        this purpose. His inveterate persistency caused the Irrigation Department to
                        face the alternative of either adopting his scheme or of bringing forward a
                        better one of their owe. That his scheme bad valuable features wm proved by
                        Colonel Western’s investigation, and Sir William Willeocks now strongly
                        supports it as a necessary complement of the existing Assocan dam. Without
                        the slightest doubt Mr. Cope Whitehouse’s advocacy of a reservoir, even
                        admitting a neglect of the maxim “Snaviter in modo, fortiW in re,’’ led to
                        Egypt having a reservoir at a mnoh earlier date than would otherwise have
                        occurred. Not long ago the representatives of M. De la Motte unsuccessfully
                        sued the Egyptian Government for a share of profit from the Assouan dam. The
                        De la Motte scheme was for a reservoir at Gebel 8ilseleh, but it was based
                        on date not adopted by the International Commission which stadied the whole
                        question of reservoir. Mr. Cope Whitehouse’s scheme in many respects stood
                        the test of searching technical engineer, and it may some day become a “fait
                        accompli." Be that as it may, Egypt is deeply indebted to him for forcing on
                        a solution of the reservoir question, even if his scheme was not the first
                        to be adopted.</p>

                    <head>CAIRO TRAFFIC.</head>
                    <p>At last the work of asphalting Clot Beystreet,Cairo, has been finished and
                        the thorough. Care has been reopened to traffic. The improvement effected is
                        very great. Formerly the street was one of the worst in Cairo, and everybody
                        knows well what that means. A drive through it in an ordinary hackney
                        carriage, thanks to the ruts and boles that abounded, was not unlike having
                        a cruise in a small boat on a rough day, and the wear and tear on vehicles
                        of every kind was as disastrous to them as it was cruel to the unfortunate
                        animals that had to drag them over the broken roadway. So far as one can
                        judge from appearance the asphalting has been thoroughly well done and
                        promises to prove a success. The entire surface has been laid from footpath
                        to footpath, the only break in the asphalt being the lines of the Tramway
                        Company. Whether it would not have been better to have laid the spaces
                        between the tram lines with stone is a question that experience only can
                        decide, but there seems some danger of a rapid deterioration of the asphalt
                        by the breaking of the edges that it presents all along at both sides of
                        each of the tram lines. The resumption of the services of the Tramway
                        Company by this route has been accomplished without a hitch, and the great
                        pressure upon the traffic of the Esbekieh quarter of late has thus been
                        relieved. One result of the temporary service, however, has been to show
                        that there is a real need for a tram service connecting the A tabs el Khadra
                        and the railway station via Boulac-road, as this would enable travelers by
                        the cars to reach the centre of the Esbekieh district from all quarters of
                        the town, whereas by the now-existing routes this can only be done from the
                        Citadel or Boulac. This is a question well worthy the attention of the
                        company.</p>

                        illuminated 1 jour by hundreds of electric lamps. The sitting rooms,

                        covered with tastefully selected small plants. The floor and D’Ambra’s
                        orchestra were excellent and the large dancing room presented a brilliant
                        coup I ceil by 11.30 o’clock, when dancing was in mil awing. This was kept

                    <head>KHEDIVIAL OPERA HOUSE.</head>
                    <p>We cannot say that Rigoletto was anything but a complete failure as given at
                        the Khedivial Opera House. We admit that the chorus was good and the staging
                        fine, but then this theatre can afford such luxuries. Signoi Andreini was
                        never pleasing, and not always in time: and his rendering of "La donna in
                        time" was the climax of exasperation, both inartistic and unmusical. Signora
                        Tromben should never have attempted the part of Gilda; she did all she
                        could, but it was far beyond her voice. We regret greatly that we should
                        have to criticise her, at it was so obvious that the did her. Vary beat in
                        “Caro nome,” and foiled hopelessly. Signor Nani was fairly good, be boa a
                        fine strong voice, and the part, on the whole, suite him ; but hit vibrato
                        is excessive and jarring at limes : a ban tone should, undoubtedly, be
                        something more than merely forcible. Still, his acting and singing were the
                        only redeeming features of the performance, and he deceived his encore in
                        Act IU. We cannot close this perfomance(it it fully borne out by the
                        attitude of the audience) without alluding to the for more excellent
                        performance of Rigvletto by the Verdi Theatre company. Signora Sricher is of
                        entree a phenomenon, and her rendering of “Caro nome” is unique: not only
                        did she exhibit a wonderful delicacy and clarity of tone, but she performed
                        the tour de fort of taking the final note in octavo I and that apparently
                        without effort. But the real reason for mentioning the Verdi Theatre is that
                        the other “principals" were to good. Signor Tomisani’s “La donna a mobile"
                        could not have been bettered for tone and phrasing: it was encored by an
                        audience who, we are certain, were distinctly prejudiced against him.
                        Signori Bad in and Baldelli were aa good and better than their own peers of
                        the Khedivial Theatre, as Rigolatto and the Bravo. And yet these three
                        gentlemen are probably quite unknown. We take this opportunity of informing
                        our reader* that it is quite possible the Verdi Theatre company will revisit
                        Cairo, after their stay in Alexandria, and we announce all who may not be
                        "abound” at the State Opera to go, just once or twice, to hear them. We are
                        certain they will confirm our opinion, and will not regret the expenditure
                        of half the sum exacted by the Khedivial Opera House, for an inferior
                        rendering at that 1 , Tristano e Ieotta was given for the second fame on
                        Thursday night Taking all things into consideration, it was a satisfactory
                        enough performance. Tristan himself and Hurrenaldo being both excellent,
                        though Tristan was hardly sufficiently audible in the 1st act To our
                        thinking Signore Pinto marred her part by excessive vibrato, though happily
                        this was less conspicuous in the 2nd act, which was the best part of the
                        performance. The Liebes Tod can hardly be pronounced a success: in foot,
                        Signora Pinto was scarcely audible, and indeed all through, though the
                        Orchestra was distinctly good, there was a certain neglect of the proper
                        emphasis. The sailor’s chorus left much to be desired. However, we must not
                        apply German standards to an Italian company, to whom a Wagner opera is only
                        an incident in the announcement and so, keeping this foot in view, we can
                        pronounce’ the performance distinctly creditable.</p>
