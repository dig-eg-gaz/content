                        <head>THE RELIGIOUS RENAISSANCE IN FRINGE.</head>
                        <p>All great religious reformations or move- ments or re-movements,—for in
                            that does their essential character find its real expression- spring
                            from great and deep source]: they are born of neoeeity, they oome
                            because they must oome, and it is as foolish and as futile to attempt to
                            retard their maturity and development as it would bs to mak* the same
                            attempt in the oase of mere phy- sioel growth. Bat it is only a few who
                            have either the insight or the courage toreoog nice and embrace the new
                            tendency, when ihe moment of its birth has arrived. There is nothing the
                            average man is more afraid of than novelty, especially in the sphere of
                            religion or ethics, and he is afraid of it because he thinksit is only
                            novelty and, is utterly incapable of seeing that nothing new in whatever
                            department of human life it may be, will come before its time, or
                            establish itself until those who are responsi- ble for its appearances
                            upon the arena of modern thought haye shown that it is batter than the
                            old. Franoe is at pre- sent undergoing a religious metamorphosis, which,
                            while it seems to the oasaal observer to ba merely the outcome of the
                            strong sooial and / snti-olerioal feeling which marks the Franoe of
                            today, in troth has its roots far deeper in the ethioal consciousness of
                            the French nation. Half the bitterness exhibited by the opponents of the
                            Establishment in France, as indeed in England, has more of an ethioal
                            than a political significance. Parties there are of oouree, and will be,
                            with differences so radical as to seem to preclude the possibility of
                            there being one common sentiment at work beneath the storm and stress of
                            party seal. Bat everything points to the fact that this sentiment is
                            there, and there is no greater propheoy of what the fatare will hold
                            than the extraordinary phenomenon presented by Frenoh liberalism of
                            to-day, which is uniting all shades of thought in that oountry,
                            irrespective of religious or sooial bias alike. To speak of leaders, we
                            may say that M. Combe* embodiei the political ideal; the aubj act seen
                            from the secular and mere radioal standpoint. The Abb4 Loisy embodies
                            the religions ideal; he is at the head of ths pioneers of the new
                            thought, M. Com- bes of the new action: but both men are on the same
                            traok : the objective of both parties is identical, even though the
                            oontrast between the silent overwhelming intellectualism of the one, and
                            the fieroe intrepid radicalism of the other, may seem to make such an
                            invisible entente impossible. But all great movements are finally
                            religions, all great movements for the greater freedom of thought and
                            action, and the crisis in the religious evolution in France is no
                            exoeption to the rule. The ohurch in France, at least, in relation to
                            the leaders of French thought and action, has had her day. She has been
                            asked to face a crisis in the mental development of her ohildren and she
                            has refused : she has been brought face to face with the necessity of
                            providing for her sons a spiritual pabulum that will Boorish, not
                            starve: a strong meat that will serve to farther brace the nation for
                            the straggle with the great religions and social problems of modern life
                            whioh faoe it, and which she has herself been powerless to solve : but
                            she still persists in doling out the meagre fare of a dogmatism that is
                            dying if not defanot, of an author- ity that has only the traditions of
                            an ancient bigotry to baok it, and so her knell has rang. The fatare
                            alone oan show what strength she will have to grip the last few
                            fragments of her ancient power and prestige that are left her: whether
                            she will elect to swim with the current or sink into the oblivion that
                            awaits her, if she does not take aotion. Any institution, in any
                            oountry, that can no lunger oommand that country’s intel eot, that
                            refuses to pay oourt to the great sweeping movements that oonvulse at
                            some period of their career the society of all great nations, must

                            to the new, not because the old is old and the new is new, but because
                            there are great laws at work in na- tions, as in nature, whioh refuse to
                            recognise the claims of antiquity or tradition or oustom, when these
                            claims fail to serve the end for whioh all things in ohuroh and state
                            exist, v.t., the welfare and enlightenment of the human raoe. It is not
                            so mu oh that the anti-clericals in Franoe have dug a pit lor the ohurch
                            as that she has dug a pit for herse^and Wien Sri* izi'iiSrr £*!“*“*

                            alone can show what strength she wUl have to grip the last few fragments
                            of her ancient power and prestige that are left her: whether she will
                            elect to swim with the ourrent or sink into the oblivion that awaits
                            her, if she does not take aotion. Any institution, in any oonntry, that
                            can no longer command that country’s intelligent, that refuses to pay
                            court to the great sweeping movements that convulse at some period of
                            their career the society of all great nations, must either go with the
                            tide or be swept away by it The old must give place to the new, not
                            because the old is old and the new is new, bat because there are great
                            laws at work in na- tions, as in nature, whioh refuse to recognise the
                            claims of antiquity or tradition or custom, when these claims fail to
                            serve the end for which all things in church and state exist viz., the
                            welfare and enlightenment of the human race. It is not so muoh that the
                            anti-clericals in Franoe have dug a pit for the church as that she has
                            dug a pit for herselfiand fallen into it. It is not that Franoe has lost
                            her faith: dhe has only jast found it One is veiy much tempted to draw
                            from the condition of Franoe a comparison with oar own. Franoe is the
                            nursery of ideas : the English fnaooeasability to ideas is the strongest
                            characteristic of the nation. In France a great idea is slowly beooming
                            a national ideal, they say that in Franoe the brotherhood of man is now
                            beooming a solid truth, from bo long being little more than a
                            theological shibboleth; are there signs wanting in England that point to
                            a ohange ? Do we not even now see in the liberalism that characterises
                            so muoh religious thought of to-day a tendency in that same direction
                            whioh in Franoe has ended in apparent disaster and yet has brought
                            religious freedom to the nation. The question ot the Disestablishment of
                            the English Church is, we firmly believe, inextricably interwoven with
                            the full realisation of the liberal ideal that so many Englishmen look
                            forward to. Its possibi- lities, the advantages and disadvantages of the
                            separation of Church and State in our country cannot be discassed in
                            brief, but must be looked from all points of view; but ihere can be no
                            doubt that the spirit of compromise that is abroad, that gradual trend
                            in the direc- tion of a national interpretation of a creed whioh must in
                            its very nature have an aonatural or non-rational basis, will not end in
                            the rapprochement whioh is so earnestly desired by the friends of unity
                            and peace. No time is possible between the votaries of orthodoxy and
                            their liberal opponents, or shall we say that no time ought to be
                            possible. Reform for our Church is impossible from within, i.e.,
                            spiritual, not looal reform. It has yet to be recognised in England, as
                            it is just being reoognised in Franoe, that Christianity in its best and
                            truest expression, is a religion of individualism. It may fiud its mere
                            humau julleotive embodiment in a olerioal organ umtion that presents
                            more anomalies possibly rJi*n any other existing institution in the
                            land, and this embodiment may serve for those who in these hard days can
                            with complacency contemplate the existence of an episoopate that enjoys
                            an annnal aggregate income cf £150,000, while many of its lesser olergy
                            starve ; but we rqoioe to see that there are at least a nucleus in our
                            own country moving for that emancipation which has at leet been realieed
                            by thorn high priests of individual and national freedom, the great Fmoh

                    <p>St. Petersburg, November 6. News of continual anti-Semitic and anti- liberal
                        riots continues to arrive from all parts, from Archangel to Tiflis and from
                        Poland to Tomsk. They are generally the result of what are called patriotic
                        or conservative manifesta- tions, which are organized under the auspices of
                        the police, and formed of mobs headed by the Imperial banner or by a
                        portrait of the Tsar. There have been hundreds of killed and wounded at
                        Rostoff-on-Don and at Krement- chug. (Reuter)</p>

                    <p>The Tsar's manifesto restoring all the an- cient liberties of Finland has
                        been published at Helsingfors.The constitutionalists are sa- tisfied, but
                        the revolutionaries demand further concessions. The revolutionists have
                        proved their control over the masses by countermanding yester- day's
                        demonstration, announcing that they would choose their own day, and not
                        accept one of Trepoff's choosing, for the last fight. M. Witte has not made
                        the least progress in the formation of a Cabinet The Conservatives avoid him
                        ; the Liberals show themselves dis- trustful, while the reactionaries detest
                        him. A few weeks' full is expected, during which the revolutionary party
                        will perfect their organisation. A fresh manifesto assures the people that
                        the reforms will be inflexibly carried out despite the efforts of the
                        enemies of reform, but the Government must have the coopera- tion of the

                        religious notables and a follower of the Hanafi rite. He was educated at Al
                        Azhar, where he became ulema after showing considerable theological
                        proficiency, and was for a long period Mufti to the now suppressed
                        Beit-el-Mal Administration. He was later appointed to the Mehkemeh High
                        Court as Cadi and showed such legal and theological acumen that he gained
                        the good opinion of the bulk of Egyptian Moslems. He was acting as Grand
                        Cadi in the place of Sheikh Yehia, who has gone on an important errand to
                        Constantinople, when the death of Sheikh Abdul Kader El Raffei threw open to
                        him the Grand Muftiship of Egypt. One of our Cairo contemporaries states

                        the new Grand Mufti can still perform his functions of Grand Cadi per
                        interim, or whether some one else must be appointed to replace Sheikh Yehia

                    <p>We cull the following from a New York contemponry :— The extraordinary case
                        of Mollie Katain who was married last July to Harry Liederer, No. 170
                        Delancey street taken by him to Egypt sold as a white slave into bondage,
                        and rescued by the efforts of the International Society for the Suppression
                        of the White Slave Trade, has just come to light through a letter sent by
                        the girl to her brothers in New York. Her courtship was a short one, and she
                        was married at her home, No. 132, Attorney street last July. Four weeks
                        later she disappeared and was not heard of until last weak, when the society
                        sent her to her brothers after they had rescued her. Her introduction to
                        Lederer, it was said, was brought about by Mrs. Nathan Weber, who lives at
                        No. 122, Suffolk street She had $300 in bank in her own name and this must
                        have been, withdrawn without her knowledge, for in her letter she asks that
                        her fare home may be paid out of this money. The letter to her brothers is
                        in her own handwriting and is as follows: “My Dear Brothers—I am unable to
                        express the sad position in which I find myself My husband has been
                        treacherous and has fooled me all along. He brought me to Alexandria and has
                        made me a prisoner of other men. I wish you to go to court and get
                        duplicates of the documents which show that I am his wife, as he has stolen
                        the original papers from me. Buy a ticket for me to return, for he has taken
                        all my money from me. Iam very sick and cannot write much more. Molfie.”

                    <head>THE PHARMACY REGULATIONS.</head>
                    <p>We mentioned in our issue of the 16th ultimo two serious infringements of the
                        new pharmacy regulations which oome into ope- ration about a year ago. These
                        prove how necessary it is for the Sanitary Adminis- tration to use the
                        utmost vigilance for safe- guarding the public. In one case a Greek named
                        Pistis, when applying for permission to open a pharmacy, sent in a diploma
                        that was ascertained to have belonged to a man who had been dead since 1896!
                        In the other case three individuals sent in diplomas pur- porting to have
                        been issued by the Faculty of Medicine of Athens bat which, when subjected
                        to expert examination, were found to be forged. The officials of the
                        Department, since the new regulations came into operation, have taken in
                        hand the inspection of pharmacies but it seems they are greatly hampered by
                        the action of the Tribunals, who, when clear cases of irregularities are
                        brought to their notice, inflict such a ridioulously small punish- ment that
                        it cannot possibly act as a de- terrent. Recently, we are informed, at Man-
                        sourah, two individuals, one a Greek and the other an Italian, were summoned
                        for keeping a pharmacy open for three months without a certificated chemist.
                        The Tribunal Mixte de Contravention inflicted for this grave offence the
                        minimum fine of P.T. 5 in one case and P.T. 10 in the other!</p>

                    <head>NEW KHEDIVIAL HOTEL.</head>
                    <p>The New Khedivial Hotel at Alexandria, whioh is at present being entirely
                        renovated, will be quite ready for occupation again by the coming Christmas.
                        It will, when completed, contain altogether 150 bedrooms and twenty suites
                        of special apartments fitted with bath- rooms, closets, and other
                        accommodation. The grill-room will be open on the 1st December, and
                        afternoon teas will be served in the new pavilion on the terrace. A fine
                        Tzigane band has been specially engaged for the hotel and will play three
                        times a day. A special feature of the hotel will be the residential
                        apartments for bachelors and fami- lies, who will be able to live at the
                        hotel at an inclusive and moderate cost for board and lodging.It is expected
                        that this innovation will be taken full advantage of, and owing to the poor
                        restaurants aud high rents at Alex- andria such accommodation will be a
                        great advantage to residents. Another special feature of the hotel will be
                        the cooking.The leading "chef” at the Metro- pole Hotel, Moote Carlo, has
                        been engaged, and arrived on Sunday last with an entire brigade of
                        gastronomic artists selected with the utmost care from among the leading
                        European hotels and restaurants. During the winter the Khedivial Hotel
                        management will give a ball once a fortnight, as is the custom in Cairo.
                        There is to be a grand “Reveillon” at the hotel at Christmas, which will be
                        the formal opening fete of the hotel. Every night when there is a
                        performance at the Zizinia Theatre there will be a special supper menu at a
                        fixed inclusive price, and a band will play from midnight until 2 p.m. A
                        large American bar is to be opened on December 1, which will be equal to the
                        finest bar in Egypt. The hotel is under the manage- ment of Mr. E. Fleury,
                        late manager of the Nonvel Hotel at Vichy and of the Alexandra Hotel at
                        Monte Carlo. </p>

                    <p>One of the wealthiest families at Assiout is the Khaehabah family, writes our
                        Assiout Correspondent. They had four large houses at Assiout. One was burnt
                        down four months ago, another two months ago, and the remain- ing two last
                        week. The fire broke out at 11 p.m. and in aboat two hours, the two houses
                        were a blazing mass. The loss is estimated at £8,000. It is a remarkable
                        coin- cidence that in all three cases the cause of this outbreak was
                        accidental. Our correspondent states that Assiout. is very badly supplied
                        with pumps. In the fire mentioned the house was burning for a whole hour
                        before the pumps arrived, and after they came it took another hour to put
                        them in working order. Thanks are due to Mr. Russell, the Interior
                        inspector, who worked hard all night, as on the previous occasions.</p>

                        Les nouvelles actions sont donc souscrites a moins de 115 francs, car depuis

                        follows: Sir,—May I, in view of the references to this matter in your issue
                        of the 23td inst., again trespass upon your space. Tbe proceedings in
                        question had nothing whatever to do with the trial of the action and the
                        merits of the question were not even gone into. The next-of-kin’s legal
                        adviser in Egypt was of opinion that, in all the circumstances, the Egyptian
                        Courts should be asked to restrain any payment of the surplus in the hands
                        of the Daira Sanieh Limited to the Egyptian Govern- ment; and this is all
                        that was done, and is all that has failed The next-of-kin's main claim is
                        against the Egyptian Government and tho Daira Sanieh of H.H. the Khedive ;
                        it has not been tried, and will not be tried for some time to come. The
                        proceedings that have taken-place are in truth, little more than the
                        equivalent to a stop order in this country, and even so, are being appealed
                        against. I earnestly trust that you will see your way to give the same
                        prominence to this letter that you did to my last, for it is even more impor
                        tant that your statement in your issue of the 23rd inst. be answered than
