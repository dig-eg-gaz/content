                    <head>THE RELIGIOUS RENAISSANCE IN FRINGE.</head>
                    <p>All great religious reformations or move- ments or re-movements,—for in that
                        does their essential character find its real expression- spring from great
                        and deep source]: they are born of neoeeity, they come because they must
                        come, and it is as foolish and as futile to attempt to retard their maturity
                        and development as it would bs to mak* the same attempt in the oase of mere
                        phy- sioel growth. Bat it is only a few who have either the insight or the
                        courage toreoog nice and embrace the new tendency, when ihe moment of its
                        birth has arrived. There is nothing the average man is more afraid of than
                        novelty, especially in the sphere of religion or ethics, and he is afraid of
                        it because he thinksit is only novelty and, is utterly incapable of seeing
                        that nothing new in whatever department of human life it may be, will come
                        before its time, or establish itself until those who are responsi- ble for
                        its appearances upon the arena of modern thought haye shown that it is
                        batter than the old. Franoe is at pre- sent undergoing a religious
                        metamorphosis, which, while it seems to the oasaal observer to ba merely the
                        outcome of the strong sooial and / snti-olerioal feeling which marks the
                        Franoe of today, in troth has its roots far deeper in the ethioal
                        consciousness of the French nation. Half the bitterness exhibited by the
                        opponents of the Establishment in France, as indeed in England, has more of
                        an ethioal than a political significance. Parties there are of oouree, and
                        will be, with differences so radical as to seem to preclude the possibility
                        of there being one common sentiment at work beneath the storm and stress of
                        party seal. Bat everything points to the fact that this sentiment is there,
                        and there is no greater propheoy of what the fatare will hold than the
                        extraordinary phenomenon presented by French liberalism of to-day, which is
                        uniting all shades of thought in that country, irrespective of religious or
                        sooial bias alike. To speak of leaders, we may say that M. Combe* embodiei
                        the political ideal; the aubj act seen from the secular and mere radioal
                        standpoint. The Abb4 Loisy embodies the religions ideal; he is at the head
                        of ths pioneers of the new thought, M. Com- bes of the new action: but both
                        men are on the same traok : the objective of both parties is identical, even
                        though the contrast between the silent overwhelming intellectualism of the
                        one, and the fieroe intrepid radicalism of the other, may seem to make such
                        an invisible entente impossible. But all great movements are finally
                        religions, all great movements for the greater freedom of thought and
                        action, and the crisis in the religious evolution in France is no exception
                        to the rule. The ohurch in France, at least, in relation to the leaders of
                        French thought and action, has had her day. She has been asked to face a
                        crisis in the mental development of her ohildren and she has refused : she
                        has been brought face to face with the necessity of providing for her sons a
                        spiritual pabulum that will Boorish, not starve: a strong meat that will
                        serve to farther brace the nation for the straggle with the great religions
                        and social problems of modern life which faoe it, and which she has herself
                        been powerless to solve : but she still persists in doling out the meagre
                        fare of a dogmatism that is dying if not defanot, of an author- ity that has
                        only the traditions of an ancient bigotry to baok it, and so her knell has
                        rang. The fatare alone oan show what strength she will have to grip the last
                        few fragments of her ancient power and prestige that are left her: whether
                        she will elect to swim with the current or sink into the oblivion that
                        awaits her, if she does not take aotion. Any institution, in any country,
                        that can no lunger command that country's intel eot, that refuses to pay
                        court to the great sweeping movements that convulse at some period of their
                        career the society of all great nations, must either go with the tide or be
                        swept away dy it The old mast give plaoe to the new, not because the old is
                        old and the new is new, but because there are great laws at work in na-
                        tions, as in nature, which refuse to recognise the claims of antiquity or
                        tradition or oustom, when these claims fail to serve the end for which all
                        things in ohuroh and state exist, v.t., the welfare and enlightenment of the
                        human raoe. It is not so mu oh that the anti-clericals in Franoe have dug a
                        pit lor the ohurch as that she has dug a pit for herse^and Wien Sri*

                        solve : but she still persists doling out the meagre fare of a dogmatism
                        that is dying if not defanot, of an author- ity that has only the traditions
                        of an ancient bigotry to baok it, and so her knell has rung. The future
                        alone can show what strength she wUl have to grip the last few fragments of
                        her ancient power and prestige that are left her: whether she will elect to
                        swim with the ourrent or sink into the oblivion that awaits her, if she does
                        not take aotion. Any institution, in any conntry, that can no longer command
                        that country's intelligent, that refuses to pay court to the great sweeping
                        movements that convulse at some period of their career the society of all
                        great nations, must either go with the tide or be swept away by it The old
                        must give place to the new, not because the old is old and the new is new,
                        bat because there are great laws at work in na- tions, as in nature, which
                        refuse to recognise the claims of antiquity or tradition or custom, when
                        these claims fail to serve the end for which all things in church and state
                        exist viz., the welfare and enlightenment of the human race. It is not so
                        muoh that the anti-clericals in Franoe have dug a pit for the church as that
                        she has dug a pit for herselfiand fallen into it. It is not that Franoe has
                        lost her faith: dhe has only jast found it One is veiy much tempted to draw
                        from the condition of Franoe a comparison with oar own. Franoe is the
                        nursery of ideas : the English fnaooeasability to ideas is the strongest
                        characteristic of the nation. In France a great idea is slowly becoming a
                        national ideal, they say that in Franoe the brotherhood of man is now
                        becoming a solid truth, from bo long being little more than a theological
                        shibboleth; are there signs wanting in England that point to a change ? Do
                        we not even now see in the liberalism that characterises so muoh religious
                        thought of to-day a tendency in that same direction which in Franoe has
                        ended in apparent disaster and yet has brought religious freedom to the
                        nation. The question of the Disestablishment of the English Church is, we
                        firmly believe, inextricably interwoven with the full realisation of the
                        liberal ideal that so many Englishmen look forward to. Its possibi- lities,
                        the advantages and disadvantages of the separation of Church and State in
                        our country cannot be discassed in brief, but must be looked from all points
                        of view; but ihere can be no doubt that the spirit of compromise that is
                        abroad, that gradual trend in the direc- tion of a national interpretation
                        of a creed which must in its very nature have an aonatural or non-rational
                        basis, will not end in the rapprochement which is so earnestly desired by
                        the friends of unity and peace. No time is possible between the votaries of
                        orthodoxy and their liberal opponents, or shall we say that no time ought to
                        be possible. Reform for our Church is impossible from within, i.e.,
                        spiritual, not looal reform. It has yet to be recognised in England, as it
                        is just being reoognised in Franoe, that Christianity in its best and truest
                        expression, is a religion of individualism. It may fiud its mere humau
                        julleotive embodiment in a olerioal organ umtion that presents more
                        anomalies possibly rJi*n any other existing institution in the land, and
                        this embodiment may serve for those who in these hard days can with
                        complacency contemplate the existence of an episoopate that enjoys an annnal
                        aggregate income cf £150,000, while many of its lesser olergy starve ; but
                        we rqoioe to see that there are at least a nucleus in our own country moving
                        for that emancipation which has at leet been realieed by thorn high priests
                        of individual and national freedom, the great Fmoh nation. </p>

                                families of Jews, with inconceivable brutality. It is impos- sible

                                Interior, M. Bouliguine, has been accepted. A manifesto of the Tsar
                                convokes the Finnish diet for the 28th December, in view of the
                                revision of electoral representation. It abolishes the Dictatorship.

                                classes should refrain from mutual friction in order to
                                avoid'disturbances, which the Government must repress for the

                    <p>Owing to tho greatly increased pressure of work at the Ministry of Finanoe,
                        it has been decided to appoint anothor Under-Secretary of State, and Lord
                        Edward Cecil Pasha has been selected to fill the new post. Great sa-
                        tisfaction is expressed both in British and native circles at his
                        appointment. During his career in the Sudan servioe Lord Edward Cecil has
                        displayed in a marked degreo the qualities of a good administrator. He is
                        thirty-eight, a brilliant soldier, and a man of business as well as of
                        affairs. The be- sieged in Mafeking owe him a large debt. They hod pretty
                        bad times there long before the siege was over, but had it not been for Lord
                        Edward Cecil they would have starved long before relief came. He took upon
                        himself the responsibility of providing the town with just four times the
                        quantity of food the military authorities found necessary, and when the
                        contractors hesitated to exeoote a seven thousand pound order on the young
                        major's sole responsibility, Lord Edward promptly got Baden-Powell to back
                        the bilL. But Muafeking was only one incident in his career. He has served
                        in Egypt several times, accompanied the famous special mission to King
                        Menelik ot Abyssinis, gained two medals for his services with the Dougoia
                        Expedition, earned more fame at Atbara, and added to it at Omdurman the D.
                        S. O. and two clasps. The mission to Menelik, by the way, nearly put an end
                        to Lord Edward's career. While the party was on its way uue of the camels
                        fell down a deep ravine, and Lord Edward and Captain Swayne clambered down a
                        rope of puggarees with the idea of rescuing the animal. They could not roach
                        the camel, however, and one of the Abyssinians went down. A moment later two
                        shots rang out—one ot them came pretty near to hitting Sir Rennell Rodd—-and

                    <head>THE LATE GRAND MUFTI. SUCCESSOR APPOINTED.</head>
                    <p>The funeral of the late Grand Mufti, Sheikh Mohamed Abd El Kader El Rafei,
                        took place early on Saturday afternoon. The Prime Min- ister, Mustapha Pasha
                        Fehmy, Fakhry Pasha, Fuad Pasha, the chiefs of the ulema, and the principal
                        dignitaries of the University of Al Azhar, Mr. Moberly, acting Commandant of
                        the Cairo Police, and a great number of notables and sheikhs were present.
                        The fu- neral service was bald at the Mosque of the Al Azhar University,
                        after which the foneral cortege moved on to the cemetery at El Me- gaonerin,
                        where the interment took place. The late Grand Mufti appears to have suc-
                        cumbed to heart failure while driving from the house of H. E. Boutros Pasha
                        Ghali to that of H.E. Ahmed Pasha Mazloum to con- clude a series ot official
                        visits which seem to have proved too fatiguing for his years. His friends
                        state that he showed no signs of illness when leaving his house in the late
                        afternoon. A successor to the Grand Mufti has already been found in Sheikh
                        Bakri Ashour, the acting Grand Cadi, who has aocepted the appointment.
                        Sheikh Bakri is reputed to be a learned theo- logian and bears a high
                        personal character.</p>

                    <head>CHRYSANTHEMUM. SHOWS. SUCCESSFUL EXHIBITS AT ALEXANDRIA.</head>
                    <p>The eighth of the Alexandria Horticultural Society's Chrysanthemum Shows was
                        held in the San Stefano Casino on Saturday and Sunday last. It was the
                        largest yet held here, and was remarkable for the number of novel exhibits
                        it contained, this, evidently, being the result of according a certain
                        number of points in tho programme for new varieties not hitherto exhibited
                        in Egypt. Every year brings one or two new exhibitors who show extra-
                        ordinarily good blossoms. Mr. Rolo surprised the public last year by his
                        beautiful cut flowers a in boxes, and this year Madame Salvago and Yehia
                        Bey, who never exhibited before, were able to carry off prizes in every
                        class for which , they (competed. The group of Mme Salvago, though small,
                        was quite charming, and the fine heads of flowers that Yehia Bey produced
                        were as good as any that have been seen at San Stefano. But to those who
                        really under- stand chrysanthemums and their culture, the great feature of
                        the show was undoubtedly the mass of pot plants in the centre of Mr.
                        Zervndachi's gronp, which had been so culti- vated that while the plant
                        remained small, the bloom was as large as if the roots had not been touohed.
                        The ball-room of the Casino was completely filled by four large groups,
                        three of which were for competition, while the fourth was the exhibit of the
                        Municipality, which never com- petes. All showed great taste in arrangement,
                        and the harmony in colour in each was well thought out. The difficulty
                        consequently lay in judging the strength of the plant and in the value of
                        the new importations into Egypt Perhaps among all the exhibitors the
                        greatest stride has been made by the Municipality; the difference in the
                        grouping of their plants was greatly noticeable. The Municipality is now
                        taking great interest in the culture of flowers. The reading-room was also
                        quite full of plants; the blossoms were enormous and although most of the
                        prizes seemed to go to three or four (competitors, yet in every class there
                        was much competition. Cultivation of the chrysanthemum has become so general
                        in Alexandria, that it almost seems as if the committee might venture to
                        take a further step, and offer prizes for special classes suoh as Pompou,
                        Incurves, etc. We must not omit to mention the boxes of well-grown flowers
                        staged by General Bullock, nor the interesting exhibit of Mrs. Crafton,
                        consisting of the leaf, flower, and fruit of the Philodendron pertusum. It
                        is not generally known that the fruit, which tastes like pineapple, takes 18
                        months to ripen. There was a mass of vases arranged by natives, most of them
                        well thought oat, though perhaps the harmony of colour which generally
                        pleases the European eye, was somewhat wanting. Asa trial the committee
                        offered prizes for collections of vegetables, salad, and fruit, without
                        speoifiying too varieties. These exhibits were a success, and showed the
                        pnblic several vegetables which they probably had no idea were at the
                        present time to be obtained in the market. We noticed, for instance, peas,
                        figs, and strawberry grapes. The attendance on the opening day showed a
                        marked increase on former years, while on Sunday the attraction of the
                        Armenian bend helped to swell the large number who were drawn to the show.

                    <head>THE CAIRO EXHIBITION. HIGH STANDARD Of EXHIBITS.</head>
                    <p>Saturday and Sunday's Chrysanthemum Show at Cairo was a thorough saocess from
                        the point of view of the judges, and the weather was delight- fully cool and
                        pleasant, with the result that the attendance was satisfactory and ths
                        visitors to the K. A.S building were content. The exhibits in nearly all
                        cases reached a very high standard, some of the groups being remarkably
                        beautiful, and the cut flowers attracting great attention. Mrs. Foaden, who
                        was by far the most successful exhibitor, secured no less than eleven first
                        prizes, her groups consisting of splendidly healthy blooms, and her other
                        exhibits being extremely tastefully arranged. Lord Cromer visited the Show
                        early on Satnrday afternoon, as did the Prime Minister and Husseith Fakhry
                        Pasha and many other well-known Cairo personalities, and there was a very
                        fair attendance on the second afternoon of the show. We need not say that
                        the arrangements were excellent, and that the excellent tea that was
                        provided and the music, for which we have to thank the C. O. of the 2nd
                        Royal Inniskilling Fosiliers, were heartily appreciated. The following were

                    <head>THE SUCRERIES COMPANY. MEETING OF DEBENTURE HOLDERS.</head>
                    <p>A meeting of the debenture-holders of the Egyptian Sugar Refineries was held
                        recently in Paris, at which, on the initiative of the French Council of
                        Foreign Bondholders, a committee was formod (the Paris correspondent of the
                        "Financial News" states) with the fullest powers to safeguard their
                        interests before the Cairo Tribunal of Commerce. The creditors of the
                        unfortunate concern have again been con- vened for November 17, after having
                        met on October 18 last, to receive the report of the experts.This
                        dcoament,the correspondent says, particularly incriminates the board of di-
                        rectors which up till last year distributed dividends, whilst the company's
                        business never resulted in a single centime profit. On the contrary, for the
                        last five years the Egyptian Sugar Refineries constantly worked at a loss,
                        which did not appear in the obviously "doctored" balance-sheets. As to tbe
                        notorious Cronier bills which the managing directors aocepted, unknown to
                        their colleagues of the board, the experts declare they were duly entered in
                        the company's books; but the items reffering to that account were
                        subsequently omitted from the balance- sheets. Moreover, the bills once paid
                        by the company could not be found until they were discovered at the private
                        residence of a subor- dinate employe, who had staetd that he bad never seen
                        them. The debenture-holders will now await the meeting of November 17,when
                        the experts will read a supplementary report, which will also set forth the
                        exact state of the assets and liabilities of the company.</p>
