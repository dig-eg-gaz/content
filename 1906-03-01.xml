                    <head>THE SCHOOL STRIKE.</head>
                    <p>The pupils of the School of Medicine have not yet carried out their threat of
                        going on strike to express their sympathy with their companions of the Law
                        School. It is to be hoped that prudent counsels will prevail, fora strike
                        is, as Rusian experience shows, a double-edged weapon, and its orgnaisers
                        may find themselves permanently the worse for having employed it. As for the
                        strikers of the Law School, we believe that some of the regulations of whcih
                        they complain are unduly sever. It is, for instance, rather unfair that a
                        boy who fails in his first year's examination should have no second chance.
                        But when the delegates of the strikers claim that every pupil who fails
                        should be allowed to re-enter for teh examination for, we presume, an
                        unlimited number of times,--no limit being specified in the list of demands
                        sent by the delegates to the Ministry of Public Instruction,-- then we shall
                        have middle-aged failures coming up with deplorable regularity for the same
                        examination that proved too mcuh for them in their salad days-Cairene
                        imitations of the woe-begone personages of comparatively advanced age, who
                        appear at stated intervals from the depths of the country at our British
                        universities on precisely the same errand. In our opinion the strikers might
                        have edited their demands. They compalin of afternoon work-but at the School
                        of Medicine work last all the day and the upils of the Polytechnic have
                        thier eight hours. Demands of this nature are simply inadmissable, and if
                        the students have another edition of their Bill of Rights to forward to teh
                        authorities we recommend them, as future lawyers, to draft it carefully. </p>
                    <p>There is another point to which we should like to draw the attention of the
                        strikers. A statement is current, and was reproduced by a Cairo
                        contemporary, to the effect that a European lady whp rashly endeavoured to
                        speak was "conspuee et expulsee." We hope that this story is, at least,
                        exaggerated if not unfounded, otherwise we cannot congratulate the students
                        of the Law School, who have been described to us as capable and intelligent
                        young men of superior class, on their chivalry or good manuers. A polite
                        refusal is always possible in such casesm but if a woman is to be spat upon
                        and driven away for expressing a desire, however eccentric, to harangue a
                        meeting of students, one begins to wonder whether the proverb "Grattez le
                        Russe," with the necessary alterations caused by the comparative proximity
                        to Egypt of the Nyam country, may not be applicable to some of our young
                        Cairenes. For the future let even excited students try to remember that to
                        be on strike against the educational authorities does not absolve them from
                        the usages of common courtesy. </p>
                    <p>As the outcome of experiments made by some of the largest of the English
                        railways it has been found that the temperature of Railway compartments is
                        raised 3 degrees Fahrenheit by the use of oil gas giving a light equal to 13
                        candle power. In these days, when the public are calling for an increase in
                        the amount of light supplied in railway carriages, it would be interesting
                        to ascertain what would be the increase in temperature by lighting a dining
                        car with oil gas giving a candle power equal to that now afforded by
                        electric light on the best British Railways, vix: upwards of 400 c.p. Surely
                        a thermometer under such circumstances would indicate "fever heat."

                        League (Lega dei Barbieri). For some time past the members of this league
                        have been agitating for shorter hours, and a few days ago tehy sent a
                        circular to the proprietor of hairdresser shops demanding a fixed working
                        day of from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. with two hours' rest in the middle of the day.
                        No reply was recieved and yesterdau evening a mass meeting of the barbers'
                        assistants in Alexandria and Ramleh was held at the headquarters of te
                        league in the Haymarket, when it was decided to consider the circular as an
                        ultimatum and to declare a general strike to-day.</p>
                    <p>This morning many Alexandrians had per force to go unshaved and great
                        inconvenience was experienced by those perons who are unable to shave
                        themselves. Them men are resolved to fight to the bitter end for they
                        declare that they are much overworked and never know when they can return
                        home in the evening. </p>
                    <p>The league will distribute strike pay to the men as it is fairly strong

                    <p>The much-talked of fancy ball at Ghezireh Palace is one of the memories of
                        the past, and on of the very pleasantest memories of the seasn according to
                        the unanimous of opinion of all those who attended it. It would be hard to
                        find a more beautiful setting for the variegated costumes than the Casino
                        with its brightly coloured hangings and comfortable lounge and its richly
                        deocrated suite of rooms. As for the dancers and their various attires,
                        words, fail to exress their infinite variety, and brain was equally
                        incompetent to keep pace with all that motley crowd that filled the ballroom
                        an overflowed into the ante rooms. Pierots and pierrettes, soldiers in every
                        period of uniform, national costumes of all sorts, country lads and merry
                        partners, mummers and historical characters, not to mention the host of
                        grotesques, flitted across one's range of vision and mingled again with the
                        kaleidoscope of colour till one's ete was weary and one;s mind a hopeless
                        jumble. A certain number of figures remain distinct amont the otehrs, and
                        chief among these may be reckoned the beautiful Mlles. Zakreveski who wore
                        the gorgeous COurt dress of their country, their satin growing with
                        sparkling bands veiled by the long gauze draperies hanging from the high
                        jewelled diadems, rows and rows of pearls from the head-dress round their
                        faces. young and very beautiful, and wearing the richest costumes in the
                        room, there was no doubt where the honours of the evening were due. It was
                        more difficult to award the palm to the best masculine costume, but perhaps
                        the sparkling suit of silver tissue worn b Lieut. Adams as a Knight Templar
                        with its white cloak and blood-red cross was the most admired. There were
                        many clowns and pierrots and their lady counterparts, some in all white,
                        some in magpie, some in parti-coloured coons, anf a plethora of both Chinese
                        and Indian dresse. There was a corenr in bath toweling too; one officer
                        belonging to the Egyptian Army was in a very well made kill of this useful
                        material a cake of soap serving to fasten his plaid upon the shoulder, and
                        his sporran decorared with three shaving brushes. A second figure was clad
                        in Kimona, girt round the waist with his bath towel and his hea surmounted
                        by a large sponge, and a third was purely grotesque his draperies being of
                        towels weighted with sponges, and a little sponge with antennae of Isofah,
                        parched upon his forehead. A headsman in black hidden behind a mask, and
                        carrying the horrid instrument of his profession, seemed to find some
                        difficulty in finding-partners; not so the buxom school girl with long
                        golden curls and sun bonnet who commenced by dnacing with men, but soon
                        wearied of the novelty and returned to his usual partners. There were some
                        excellent Bedouin Arabs and Turkish dress, who had hidden themselves behind
                        yashmaks of more or less transparency. Mrs. Nolan was one of these latter,
                        and her little pink turban and soft swathing of tulle over her face only
                        serve to enhance its delicate colouring. Miss revs made very commanding and
                        effective Ententes Cordiale, with her scarlet cap of liberty, and the flags
                        of the countries appearing in harmony on her skirt and corsage. Mrs.
                        Nungovich, representnng wither gold-or la fasitaisie, was magnificent in a
                        sparkling rohe of Assiout shawl tissue, an enormous golden aht with
                        upstanding plumes upon her head, and countelss rows of gold pealrs and
                        chains hanging from the hat. Miss Nungovich made a singularly sprightly
                        Columbine in short white skirts and pretty cocked hat. The Misses York were
                        poudree, as were many others, Miss Hervey looking especially handsome in her
                        white wig. Miss Hemming looked her best as "lily of the Valley" in a dress
                        of silver tissue trimmed with flowers a lily coup forming her head dress,
                        Miss Blythe looked charming as Margerite with chaptlet of peals upon her
                        head, and her sister was the second Etent Coridale noticed in the room. Miss
                        Boulter went in French peasant dress and peasant dresses of various sorts
                        were worn by the Misses Hurley as Dutch girls and by Mrs. Morgan as a Swiss
                        girl. MR. hUESTON LOOKED as a red cross sister and MiSS. smART, TOO, LOOKED,
                        VERY TRIM TO THE MANNER FBORN HIN HER NURSE dress. the Misses Coles were
                        attired as Christmas crackers, and Mr. Siballi made a most excelletn
                        Napoleon with but little make-up required to give him this facial
                        resemblence. There were various Japanese ladies, but none more succesffulyly
                        attried than Miss lampson and Miss Crofton, as the "Spirirt of teh Casino,"
                        carried many of the emblens of the roulette table. several gentle men were
                        glad in white evening suits with black accesories; one of them had put his
                        clothes wrong side in front, and his gold watch chain hung across his waist
                        post on the small of his backk. SPace frobids a longer mention of the otehr
                        costumes. Suffice to say it was of the best ball of its kind ever witnessed
                        in Ghezireh, and reflected the greatest credit on the ingenuuity of those
                        who took part in it. Hemming lloked her best as "lily of the Valley" in a
                        dress of silver tissue trimmed with flowers, a lily cup forming her
                        head-dres, Miss Blythe looked charming as Margnerite with chaplet of pearls
                        upon her head, and her sister was the second Entente Cordiale noticed in the
                        room. Miss Boulter want in French peasant dress, and peassant dresses of
                        various sorts were worn by the Misses as a Swiss girl. Mr. Huetson looked as
                        a Red Cross Sister and Miss Smart, too, looked very trim to the manner born
                        in her nurse's dress. The Misses Coles were attired as Christmas crackers
                        and Mr. Sibelli made a most excellent Napolean with but little make-up
                        required to giv him the facial resemblance. There were various Japanese
                        ladies, but none more successfully attired than Miss Lampson, and Miss
                        Crofton, as the the "Spirit of the Casino," carried many of the emblems of
                        the roulette table. Severla gentle men were clad in white evening suit with
                        black accessories; one of them had put his clothes wrong side in front, and
                        his gold watch chain hung across his waist coat on the small of his bacl.
                        SPace forbids a longer mention of the other costumes. Suffice to say it was
                        the best ball of its kind ever witnessed it Ghezireh, and reflected the
                        greatest credit on the ingennity of those who took part-in it.</p>

                        correspondent)</head>
                    <p>All who are interested in ancient Egyptian art owe a debt of gratitude to
                        Professor Petrie for his lecture on the period durng which Thebes reached
                        the height of her power and splendour. The previous lecture had dealt with
                        the long period of artistic degeneration which began during the reign of
                        Ramesse II. and which in spite of the Saite revival lasted till the death of
                        the natioanl art. Naturally, in the exquisite work of the XII. dynasty and
                        the noble monuments of the XVIII. Prod. Petrie had a more pleasing theme and
                        he dealt with it in a manner which made it a priviledge to hear him. Few
                        period in the history of the world are of more engrossing interest than the
                        days of Egypt's glory, an few periods of art are so misunderstood and
                        misinterpretated. This is largely becasue much of the work that is best
                        known to the general public belongs to the later and degenerate productions
                        of the Ramesside kings, and this effect is increased by the reproductions in
                        books which have become familar but which give no true idea of the original.
                        Probably no drawing in so delicate and so hard to reproduce accurately as
                        the Egyptian designs, even in their conventional pictures, and in this
                        connexion Prof. Petrie's collection of photographs made into latern slides
                        was especially valuable. Not only has his vast knowledge of the musuems of
                        all countries enabled him to choose the best illustrations which are
                        available. but his photographic skill ahs enabled him to present his
                        examples in the most favourable manner possible. The first slide showed a
                        relief of the beginning of the XIth dynasty, and was a proof of the depths
                        to which art had sunk since the days of the kings who ruled at Memphis. The
                        rise however of anew and beatutiful style during the the XIth dynasty was
                        rapid. From the Days of Herodotus till the present time so much has been
                        said abiut the continuity of Egyptian style, that it has beem generally
                        assumed that Egyptian art underwent little or no change from the earliest to
                        the latest times. How contrary to fact this theory actually is can be seen
                        at once by comparing the work of the Sakkara tombs with that of the XII.
                        dynasty at Koptos. The head of Usertesen I. is one of the best examples of
                        portraiture in the First Theban Empire which we possess, and shows clearly
                        the chief characteristics of that school. In it we see certain mannerisms of
                        style: the work is not copied from nature so directly as in the time of the
                        IVth dynasty: it shows a delicacy of modelling and a power of indicating
                        what it does not fully express which reminds us of what is now called
                        impressionalist art. This forms a contrast to the stern simplicity which is
                        the pervading note of the great monuments of the early empire. </p>
                    <p>Other reliefs of great beauty were them thrown upon the screen, and in them
                        too the samr traits were conspicuous. Much of their effct is gained from
                        tehir very low relief, much lower than any which had been previously
                        attempted, and which can be appreciated only if seen in an exactly
                        appropriate light. Of a lighter and freer character were some ivory carvings
                        some of which represented "genre" scenes and which testify to the tarte of
                        the Egyptians even in minor objects. Prof. Petrie then discussed the famous
                        Dashur jewellery and showed in succession the three wonderful pectorals
                        which are among the greatest treasures of the musuem. Such a comparison of
                        objects of a similar size and nature is most instructive in watching the
                        rise or decline of art: an examination of these three pectorals belonging to
                        three successive kings is as suggestive as the comparison of the coins or
                        seals of different reign European history. The first, which belongs to the
                        very beginning of the XII dynasty, is by far the best. In design, execution,
                        and adaptation to the end in view it is alike admirable. The frame is
                        exactly suited to the design and is broad enough to give th assurance of
                        stregnth to the composition. The Royal Hawks have a simple dignity and the
                        required space is filled to perfection. The next in date represents two
                        hawks headed sphinxes trampling on Asiatic and Ethiopian enemies. Here the
                        design is still good and the general effect pleasing; there is not, however
                        that perfect in the preceding work. For exmaple, the pants which form the
                        sides of the frame are graceful anf are happily introduced, but they
                        scarcely form a strong enough framework for the pectoral. In the third we
                        see a complete loss of the power of filling a space with corrrect line, the
                        very essence of design. The two figures of the king clubbing his foes are
                        well drawn in themselves but the artist has crowded far too much into the
                        narrow borders of his composition, he has heaped an ornament under the
                        delusion that he was adding beauty. During thr XII Dynasty art gradually but
                        steadily declined still we reach the period of the still mysterious Shepherd
                        or Hyksos Kings. The sphinxes and other works which bear the names of some
                        of these invaders are almost certainly earlier monuments which have been
                        engraved with cartouches during the Dark Ages of Egyptian history. Probably
                        the actaul Hyksos have left us no monuments at all. When these foreign
                        tribes had been at ast expelled, Egyptian art experienced a great revival.
                        During the XVIII. dynasty the influence of the drawing and designing schools
                        is even more apparent than during the XII. The styler of this period depends
                        much rule and tradition; an atist was more concerned with exactly obeying
                        his </p>
                    <cb n="6"/>
                    <p>canon than with producing a work true to life, the result is smooth and easy
                        finish but in all but the best examples an certain los in feeling and
                        vitality. Even at Abydos in spite or the undeniable excellence of the work
                        this defect is manifest. Still the succeeding lantern slides showed to what
                        a very high level the art of the period attained. Very interesting also were
                        some specimens of work from the art schools which had be carved for practice
                        or as a practical illustration of the artist's skill. </p>
                    <p>In the reign of Queen Tyi a great change came over the artistic spirit of the
                        country. Previous to this time Egyptian art had alternately progressed and
                        receded in different ways but with the same general tendency. When however
                        Egypt conquered Syria works of art but also great soon made themselves felt.
                        At the same time aslo Greek vase were being imported into Egypt is lrge
                        quantities and these too helped to modify the ancient and traditional ideas. </p>
                    <p>These influences are nowhere found more clearly than in the potrait of Queen
                        Tyi herself which Prof. Petrie found last winter in the temple at Sarabit in
                        the Sinai peninsula. This beautiful little head shows more of a passing mood
                        as opposed to the permanent and essential character than we have hirthero
                        met in Egyptian portraiture. The delicacy with which the feeling and
                        personality of the queen is expressed entitles this little portrait to a
                        high place in the art not only of Egyot; but the world. </p>
                    <p>The XVIII dynasty was a time of great personal wealth and luxury among the
                        upper midle class of Egyptians. The organisation and government of the
                        empire required a vast number of officials, so rhar we find more wealth in
                        private tombs in this period than any other. Especially beautiful are some
                        wooden spoons of various designs: in these and in wooden statuettes of
                        little girls we see a freedom and grace which was necessary curtailef in the
                        more formal monuments of granite. Perhaps the most remarkable of this series
                        is the little ebony negress photographed by Prof. Petrie, with the light
                        cunningly reflected by mirrors that the surface modelling is clearly shown.
                        Some very pleasing drawings were also exhibited in which the firm soie
                        brushwork with tis bold though delicate curves and lines gave a chracter and
                        decision which our best draughtsmen well might envy. The lecture ended with
                        a fine photograph of the black granite statue at Turin of Rameses II.
                        executed at the beginning of his reign. This is the last example of the
                        great masterpieces of Egyptian art. </p>
                    <p>Great as was the value and interest of this lecture it is with even greater
                        expectation that we await the next of the series, that of the less known but
                        even more wonderful period of the early Empire, concerning which Prof.
                        Petrie's knowledge is unique. All who are interested in history or in art
                        should make an effort to be present. </p>

                    <p>The much-talked of fancy-dress balla t Ghezireh Palacr is one of the memories
                        of the past, an one of the very pleasantest memories of teh season according
                        to the unanimous opinion of all those who attended it. It would be hard to
                        find a more beautiful setting for he variegated costumes than the Casino
                        with its brightly coloured hangings and comfortable lounge and its richly
                        decorated suite of rooms. As for the dancers and their various attires words
                        fail to express their infinte variety,a du barin was equally icompetnet to
                        kepp pace with all the motley crowd tha filled the ballroom and overflowed
                        into the aute rooms. Pierots and pierettes, soldiers in every period of
                        uniform, national costumes of all sort, countru lads and merry partners,
                        mummers and historoical characters, not to mention the host of grosteques
                        flitted across one’s range of vision and mingled, again with the
                        kaleidoscope of colour till one's eye was weay and one's mind a hopeless
                        jumble. A certain number of figures remain distinct smong the others, and
                        chief among these may be reckoned the beautiful Mlles. Zaskreveski, who
                        whore the gorgeous Court drss of their counry, satin gowns draperies hanging

                        was more diffciulty to award the palm to the best masculine costume, but
                        perhaps the sparkiling suit of silver tissue worn by Lieut. dams as a Knight
                        Tempalr with its white cloak and blood-red cross was the most admired. there
                        were many clowns and pierrots anf their lady coutnerparts, some in all
                        white, some in magpie, somen in part-coloured coons, and a plethora of both
                        Chinese and Indian dresses. There was a corner in bath toweeling too; one in

                        his bath towel and his head surmounted by a large sponge, and a thrid was
                        purely grotesque, his drapeires being of towels weighted with sponges, and
                        little sponge with antennae of Hofah parched upon his forehead. A headsman

                        ladies in Arab and Turkish dress, who had hidden themselves behind yashmaks

                    <p>All who are interested in anoient Egyptian art owe a debt of gratitude to
                        Professor Pttrie for bis leotore on the period daring which Thebes reached
                        the height of the power and splendour. The preious lecture had dealt with
                        the long period of dealt with it in a manner which made it a privilege to
                        hear him. Pew periods in the history of the world are of more engrossing
                        interest than the days of Egypt’s glory, and few periods of art are so
                        misunderstood and misinterpreted. This is largely beoanse much of the work
                        that is best known to the general poblio belongs to the later and degenerate
                        productions of the Rameseide kings, and this . ,“°'e4Md/bY «■» reptodootion.

                    <p>In the reign of Queen Tyi a great change cama over the artistic spirit of
                        the conotry. Previous to this time Egyptian art had alternately progressed
                        and^reoeded in different ways but with the same general -tendency. When
                        however Egypt oonquered Syria and brought back not only 8yrian work) of art </p>
                    <p>numbers of8yriansthe influenceof new ideas soon made themselves felt At the
                        same time also Greek vases were being imported into Egypt ia ‘large
                        quantities and these too helped to modify the anoient and traditional ideas </p>
                    <p>These infiuenoes are nowhere found more dearly than in the portrait of Queen
                        Tyi herse'f which Prof. .Petrie found last winter in the temple at Sarabit
                        in the Sinai peninsula. This beautiful little bead shows more of a passing
                        mood as ’ opposed to the permanent and eiaential character than we have
                        hitherto met iu Egyptian portraiture. The delicacy with which the feeling
                        and personality of the qoeen is expressed an titles this little portrait to
                        :a high plaed in the art cot only of Egypt} but the world. </p>
                    <p>The XVIII dynasty .was a time of craat personal wea'th and luxury among tKf

                        and-Freebooters was much the better game, the polo at times being quite
                        good. The Egypt- ian Army were unlucky as Captain Rome was eutiering from a

                        ball down to the 60th goal looked likesuoring.butSeymoor cleared well. Up
                        and down play followed in mid- field till Rome dnbaircepted'the ball and
                        slip, ping the field brought off a good ran. His final shot, however, went
                        wide,—a good ohahee missed. Result ofCh ikker: 60th,4goals,E. A.,nil. From

                        Scrambling play followed till Rome got hold and feeding his forwards
                        well,‘the E.A. took thb ball‘down the gr iund and a goal seemed certain, j
                        but Seymour saved with a fi.ie shot and Palby made a goci run to the E.A.

                    <p>From the throw-in the Freebooters were the first to get on the ball and
                        Rambold hit a aa'o9:diary. Sparkes hit oat to Piokerin/, who made a good run
                        up the ground, his final-shot going wide. Very fast play folo*ed, the ball
                        travelling up and down the ground at a great paoe. Pickering g >fc
                        possession at midfield and with two huge smites nearly scored a goal,
                        Rambold saving well. Dunbar then brought the ball dowu the groand and
                        centered beautifully, bat Pickering again got possession and brought the
                        ball back. Again the ball was carried back to the Tourists’ goal when
                        Protheroe Smith hit a subsidiary from a different augle. Result:
                        Freebooters, 2 subs ; Tourists, nil. A very good fast galloping ohukker with
                        good combination on both sides. </p>
                    <p>2ND CHUKKER. </p>
                    <p>From the hit-ont the tourists raD the ball up, but Rumbold returned and
                        Dunbar feeding bis number 2 well,' Protheroe Smith hit' a goal. First np-and
                        down play followed, Paravioini with a good 'stroke,almost Feared. Rumbold
                        saved wail, but Pickering followed up, hit tie ball through rather a lucky
                        goal off a pony's Teg. From the throw in the Tourists took the ball down to
                        Freebooters \goal, when a lot of sorurn- uiaging took place. Finally the
                        Freebooters cleared, and Sparkes getting bold made a good ran bat hit wide.
                        Shortly afterwards Sparkes again made a good yun and hit a very eood goal
                        from a dilfi jblt angle. Result: Freebooters, 1 goal, 2 subs ; Tourists, 2
                        goals. Not such a good chukker, neither so fast nor sirch good combination
                        Bhown as in the first. </p>

                        Up-and- down play folowel.. Dunbar, and Sparkes pntting in a lot of good
                        work: The game wa- r.ow for tha rno->t part th* Tourists’ eud, and the
                        latter fouling gave the Freebooters a free <cb n="3"/>bit at the goal.
                        Danbar took the hit bat Pickering mat the ball and cleared, but it was only
                        temporary relief as the Freebooters again attaoked and Protheroe Smith hit a
                        subsidiary. Just at the en l of the chukker the Tourists rushed the ball
                        down the ground and scored a goal. Result ; Freebooter^ 1 goal, 3 subs ;
                        Tourists, 3 goals. A good obukkor in wbioh play for the most part was
                        confined to the Tourists’ end of the ground.</p>

                    <p>F.-om the throw-in the Toarisls ran the ball down bi t Rumbold saved well.
                        First up-and- down play followed which ended in Paravioini hitting a good
                        subsidiary. Tha Freebooters then looked like sooring. From a good oentre by
                        Paravioini Pickering took the ball on well and Rumbold again saved very
                        well. Again the Freebooters attacked and Kennedy jast missed scoring. The
                        bell rang with the play in mid- field. Result : Freebooters, 1 goal 3 pets ;
                        Tourists, 3 grials 1 set.x'v </p>
                    <p>This was -a real good game and qaite the best we have seen so far. Tuere wa9
                        little tq qhoose between the teams as the score indicates. For-the winners
                        Sparkes played well and was very safe at back. Both De Freville and
                        Paravioini have oome on a lot and played well, also Pickering made several
                        good runs, bis hitting being very powerful. For the losers Rumbold aud
                        Dunbar played best. We have □aver seen the loriuer play better. The latter
                        perhaps did not play up to his reputation, but his ponies we daresay were
                        responsible for that. YOQ cannot expect ponies to race one day and play polo
                        the next.</p>

                    <p>Port Said played their return match with M.S. Minerva on Saturday afternoon
                        before a large crowd, among .which wero a great | number of ladies, who very
                        kindly provided the lemons for “our side.’ It is very kind of» these ladies

                    <p>Captain H. du B. O’Neill, Beutordshire Regiment, who for some time has been
                        success fully employed under the Colonial Offioe as company officer of the

                        reservistt. When the e two brigades are re-armed 42 battalions on borne
                        service, including the Brigade of Guatda, will be in possession of the short
                        riflt and equipment.</p>
                    <p>The Army Cmncil has decided that on the termination of the period of
                        appointment of an Instructor of Gunnery, 1st or 2nd olass, a report is to be
                        made by his immediate superior rffioer direct to the Command int, Sonool of
                        Gunnery, stating whether th« officer is recommended for re-appointment in a
                        higher capacity, and detailing any special qnalifi- oation which be may have
                        shown for each employment. </p>
                    <p>The Army Connoil has intimated that in the fptqre the initial rate of pay of
                        ex-sol Her olerks. employed in Army Service Corps or Staff offices will be
                        twenty fonr shillings p-r week, rising by triennial increments of thre
                        shillings per week.-Ordinarily two snob inore menta will be given, and the
                        maximum will thus be thirty shillings p«-r week, as in the new JReoord
                        offices. This maximum will, however, be open to re consideration at a later
                        date, if, in special oases, owing to the nature of the work, it may be
                        deemed necessary to give a farther increment of pay. </p>
                    <p>Sincere regret is ex; reused everywhere at the rather sodden death of
                        Vice-Admiral Harry T. Grenfell, the capable seoond in com mand of the
                        Mediterranean Fleet. He was a very smart officer,and had seen service in th
                        Egyptian War, 1882, and the Navy to-day i^ considerably poorer by bis
                        demise.</p>

                    <p>The past week hts brought no change in the monetary position. Stringency is
                        the prevailing tenor, and loans still command 4 % for the usual periods.
                        Theye has bean no addition to the supply of loanable funds, and those who
                        were looking for easier conditions on the 21st inst.—when tho Bank had to
                        repay the money recently borrowed from the market—were doomed to
                        disappointment, the snm in question being held by the other banks in order
                        to meet the usual "end of month” requirements and heavy revenue absorptions
                        by the Government. Dealers had,in faot, to have recourse to the Bank, where
                        renewals were granted and fresh sums lent, at 4$ %, and where bills were
                        discounted at 4 % Under these oondirions, it cannot be wondered at that
                        discount rates remain very stiff, - two months’ bills’being 4 % and three
                        months’ bills 3 7/8 to 15/16. In tact, bill discounting so far this year has
                        not been the most profitable business, the usual "margin” being more marked
                        by its absence than otherwise Even now. although full three months’ bills
                        fall due nearly two months after the usual April diabnrse- ments, it would
                        be unwife to connt on a heavy fall in rat is, there being so many underlying
                        ciroamstauces to be considered, including the amount of Japane e and
                        otherWoreigc money at present in onr market. 3cme satisfaction may be
                        gathered from the Bank retnrns of yesterday, for althongh the "proportion”
                        of reserve is slightly lower, this is doe to an' increase in the deposits,
                        for the reserve itself now staids at 26 } millions, a gain of two millions
                        in the week, whilst "other deposits” show an increase of nearly three
                        millions at 42 £ millions. Since these retorts were issued there have been

                            <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its
                                subscribers the accompanying description of some of the many
                                interesting routes by which they may travel homewards. Great care
                                has been taken to arrange them as accurately and concisely as
                                possible, and it will be found that none of them are fraught with
                                difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several things to
                                be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                                between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in
                                Europe.</p>

                            <cb n="2"/>

                            <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for
                                Cairo in January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and
                                possibly not so warm as Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than
                                Rome, and more uniformly warm than many other places in Europe. Many
                                people leave Egypt far too early in the year, for as a rule the
                                weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to go to on
                                leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>

                            <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be
                                spent at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time
                                occupied on each of the various routes between Egypt and the
                                Continent of Europe.</p>

                            <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth,
                                Southhampton, London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short

                            <p>The steamers, of the P.andamp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and
                                Messageriea Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India,
                                and Bibby Lines are also excellent, and their steamers are largely
                                patronised by travellers to Egypt.</p>

                            <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to
                                Alexandria, without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be
                                made without change in 4 1/2 hours.</p>

                            <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince,
                                and Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The
                                German Levant line has also good steamers from Alexandria to
                                Hamburg.</p>

                            <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by
                                P.andamp;O. Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd
                                Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>

                            <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little
                                luggage is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are
                                several good and responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who
                                undertake at a fixed charge to deliver packages to any address in
                                Europe.</p>

                            <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is
                                undoubtedly by the fast Mail Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to
                                Brindisi. One of these leaves port Said every week, as soon as
                                possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"/>mails from the great
                                liner arrived from Bombay.</p>

                            <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines,
                                and attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry
                                Boats" having been specially built to carry the British mail from
                                Port Said to Brindisi. If you are going straight through to England
                                you will find the train waiting at Brindisi which will take you to
                                Calais without changing. It has complete arrangements for sleeping
                                and eating on board, and you should arrive in London on the fifth
                                day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                                413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was
                                slain—his tomb is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient
                                pagan temple. PALERMO, with about 300,000 inhabitants, is the
                                capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful climate. Much of
                                interest is to be found in this fine city. The Palazzo Reale is of
                                Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S. Giovannia degli
                                Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum,
                                Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                                visit.</p>

                            <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every
                                Wednesday during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3
                                days.</p>

                            <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the
                                Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers, which leave daily. One cannot
                                approach Naples or leave it without wishing to explore some of its
                                islands, besides the lovely places on its bay—Castellamare and
                                Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento [you can
                                drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>

                            <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can
                                will devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and
                                interesting portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties
                                are too well-known to need comment here.</p>

                            <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five
                                hours brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent
                                admiring the City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In
                                Florence itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing
                                interest, whilst the local promenades and excursions should not be
                                omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and fashionable
                                promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the finest
                                walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                                hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion
                                outside Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300
                                feet above the sea level. This is made first by ordinary train from
                                Florence to St. Ellero, thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The
                                ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most striking
                                panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>

                            <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is
                                a fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night
                                should if possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the
                                Campanile at sunset.</p>

                            <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera
                                near Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very
                                convenient half-way house between Egypt and England, and where
                                living is reasonable and the air and surroundings exceptionally
                                good.</p>

                            <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in
                                Italy, with the record of having one of the lowest death averages of
                                European cities and a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in
                                winter and deliciously cool breezes from the surrounding mountains
                                and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>

                            <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                                gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and
                                paintings, are a constant delight to thousands of travellers who
                                annually sojourn in Genoa. Then there are the superbly decorated
                                medieval churches containing exquisite marble columns and historical
                                paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo filled with its
                                wonderful tombs.</p>

                            <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>

                            <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of
                                the Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its
                                beautiful windows illustrating the History of the Bible. The public
                                gardens and the monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>

                            <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                                SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal
                                springs, change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you
                                are at Salsomaggiore.</p>

                            <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                                delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence
                                of vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart,
                                carriage or bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of
                                life at every turn. The approach to Venice from the Adriatic is
                                unlike that of any other sea port. The town seems to be gradually,
                                like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills behind, no stretches of
                                rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above the horizon,
                                then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage out
                                of the calm lagoon.</p>

                            <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful
                                Italian lakes.</p>

                            <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in
                                one-and-a-quarter hours by train by way of Monza :</p>

                            <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is
                                very beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is
                                most enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo,
                                Cadenabbia, and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of
                                Bellaggio opposite. The walk from Tremezzo along the shore of the
                                lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio
                                to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then
                                steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>
