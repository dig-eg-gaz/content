                    <p>The Plenipotentiaries yesterday were await- ing instructions from their home
                        Governments. Pending to-day’a resumption of work, their attitude is
                        pessimistic but not hopeless. The Conference has been postponed until
                        to-morrow. The non-completion of the proto- cols is the assigned reason. It
                        is believed that the real reason of the postponement of the Conference is
                        that M. Witte is waiting for final instructions from St. Petersburg. A
                        representative from Mr. Roosevelt con- ferred with M. Witte and Baron de

                        today, has been published. It shows that both sides adhere to their

                    <p>The "Morning Post" learns from Portsmouth (N.H.) that a treaty of peace will
                        be signed shortly. It provides for Russia paying to Japan a sum, which is
                        not large, for the keep of pri- soners and wounded, and stipulates for the
                        ceding of the southern half of Saghalien. Japan abandons her claim on the
                        interned warships and the question of the limitation of Russia's naval power
                        in the Far Bast.- (Reuter)</p>

                        ble part in the war of 1870-71, as lieutenant of a crack batallion of
                        chasseure-a-pied and won the military medal. Returning to Egypt in 1872 he
                        filled several administrative posts with distinction, and was appointed
                        Honorary Pre- sident of the Mixed Court of Appeal in 1895. He was admired
                        and respected by his European and native colleagues, and his funeral, which
                        took place at 10 a.m. this morning was largely attended by the European and

                        trade of Damascus and of Beyrout and the Syrian Coast in 1904, are very
                        interesting reading, and it ia highly satisfactory to note that British
                        trade and shipping are holding their own. The return of the year’s shipping
                        putting in at Beyront shows a total tonnage of 1,940,259 tons, British
                        vessels being foremost with 316,458 tons, as against 268,848 tons in the
                        previous year. The totals fur the shipping of other European natious shows
                        an increase in 1904 except in the oase of Franoe, where the pro- longed
                        strike at Marseillee serioasly affeoted intercourse with the Levant British
                        imports are now reckoned at abont two-thirds of the whole Syrian trade. They
                        oonsist principally of Manchester ootton goods, and patent fuel, copper,
                        galvanised sheets, lin- seed oil, oaustio soda, and various kinds of
                        provisions, and though Austria and Germany are endeavouring to oompete in
                        prints and woollen staffs, Italy and America in T-oloths, and the
                        Netherlands in their endeavours have so far met with little suooees. Belgian
                        patent foel, being unencumbered by an oxpert duty has lately found a market
                        in Syria, but British ooal imports still form over 80% of the total.
                        Egyptian imports to the Syrian ooast oonsist almost entirely of flour, with
                        small quantities of high quality rioe, dates and sugar. The exoprta to Egypt
                        oonsist mainly of dried fruits, sesame, and silk stuffs, the excel- lent
                        Syrian silk thread going to Franoe alone. The United Kingdom takes the
                        greater part of the barley and wheat exported, the best qual- ities of wool,
                        and a good deal of tobacco, and while the bailey export fell off in 1904
                        owing to a very poor harvest we may say that, from onr own observation, the
                        present year’s crop premirod vary well, exoept in the higher parts of the
                        Lebanon, in May and Jane, and nothing has been heard in Egypt of any failure
                        of the harvest owing to disease or drought. Taking the ooast ports one by
                        one, we note that Beyront’s commerce has suffered and continues to suffer
                        from the heavy quay dues levied by the company and the insuffi- cient supply
                        of porters for the removal of goods from the lighters to the custom house.
                        The spvo in the warehouses of the latter is also very limited and goods
                        remain ex- posed in lighten in all weathers, though in winter and spring it
                        can rain as heavily at Beyrout as anywhere, until their tarn oomee to bo
                        taken to the warehouses of the Douane. The Homs-Hama broad gauge line from
                        Rsyak has unquestionably increased Beyrout's ex- port trade, while Trablous
                        (Tripoli in Syria) has lest ground. The reason for this is ob- vious enough,
                        So long as the fertile region of the B'kaa and the important towns of Homs
                        and Hama were unconnected by railway with the ooast, it was obviously better
                        polioy to send goods on mule-baok straight over the hills to Tripoli than to
                        oonvey them twice the distance to Reyak or Zahleh sta- tions, and send them
                        on by train to the ooast Now that Hama is within fifteen hoars of Beyront by
                        rail it is natural that the ex- port trade of the northern port should de-
                        cline very considerably. The shipping of Haifa increased conside- rably in
                        1904 owing to the frequent calls of steamers carrying railway material for
                        the Haifa-Dera’a branch of the Hedjsz line, and the fact that quarantine
                        against Egypt was less oontinnonB than in former yean. Neither Mr. Drummond
                        Hay nor Mr. Riohards make any oommenta on the strange frequency with whioh
                        quarantine restrictions are imposed on arrivals from Egypt in the summer
                        months of each year but we have a suspicion that the Ottoman authorities are
                        influenced by other than sanitary considerations. (To be continued.)</p>

                        <p>The past few months have been somewhat remarkable for the very large
                            number of om ot what is variously known as Malta fever, Mediterranean
                            fever, or dengue. The disease has been of an almost epidemic character,
                            and bearing in mind its very weakening, not to my dangerous, effects,
                            should be oarefally consider- ed by onr sanitary authorities. There
                            have' been several oaaee of late, many of whioh have not recovered, even
                            after two and three months treatment The town itself is really in a very
                            filthy condition, and though I am aware of the difficulties whioh the
                            sanitary authorities have to oontond with, I am of the opinion that much
                            might be done to improve the present system of transport of sewage and
                            the like. I may add that these are also the opinions of an eminent
                            surgeon here, who, in oonvenation, reoently remarked upon the larger

                    <head>M. JALUZOT’S RECENT LOSSES.</head>
                    <p>The recent sensational crash in the French o mmercial world brought about by
                        the oolos- sal losses of M. Jaluiot, the managing director of the well-known
                        Magasina du Prin temps of Paris, by speculations in sugar, has been causing
                        some anxiety and much talk both in Cairo and Alexandria. A large basineas is
                        done by the two branches established in Egypt, amounting to several millions
                        annually, the profits from whioh are said to be no less than £I0,0~0 a year.
                        The Cairo branch only quite recently moved into larger premises situated in
                        the Sharia Kasr-el-Nil, whioh have been taken on lease for 12 years. We
                        learn on reliable authority that the failure of M. Jalnsot' is not likely to
                        affeot in any way the business e ther in this ooontry or in Franoe, as his
                        private property is more than sufficient to meet his loss of £600,000,
                        caused by attempt-1 ing to oorner the sogar market, whioh, oontrary t> all
                        expectations, has been lately a falling instead of a rising one, despite the
                        shortage in the beet crop on the Continent last season.</p>

                    <head>BATHING FATALITIES.</head>
                    <p>To The Editor or the Egyptian Gazette. Sir,—It is distressing to know that
                        anothe death by drowning took plaoe yesterday after noon at Ramleh. The
                        victim in this oase was a young nativi who had gone to bathe at the
                        Ibrahimis! baths. He had gone for a swim and ventured farther oat than he
                        should have done, when the strong undercurrent prevented him from getting
                        book, and he was drowned. Notwithstanding his struggle* and arise fin help,
                        no one, I am informed, attempted to ran him although there were many persons
                        in the baths and on the beach at the time. No doubt had the proprietor of
                        the baths i boat, life buoy, or fine in stook (whioh in mj opinion should bo
                        made compulsory for them to have, when they reoeive their license) the poor
                        fellow might have probably been raved. May I ask whether it oouldnot beporai
                        ble for a policeman to patrol the beaoh, and prevent people bathing in
                        dangerous pkras. Con Id not a life baoy and line be placed in charge ol the

                    <head>DISCOVERIES AT EPHESUS.</head>
                    <p>It was announoed rather less than a year ago that the trustees of the British
                        Museum had obtained a firman for the resumption tf excavations in the great
                        Temple at Artemis at Ephesus, and had ontrnsted the direct'on of the work to
                        Mr. D. G. Hogarth. The site had not been touched sinoe 1874, when the ex-
                        ploration conducted by the original discoverer, the late Mr. J. T. Wood, was
                        brought to an end, and his great pit, oo extensive with the platform of the
                        temple, had beoome an over- grown morass. It hah always been felt that his
                        five seasons’ work did not lead to final results. In his publication ho
                        treated at length of the Helleniatio ‘‘Wonder of the World," and he sent to
                        England some magnifioent remains of it in the shape of architectural
                        sculpture; but he hardly dealt at all with the earlier temple which he
                        discovered at a lower level, and identified with that to which King Crccsus
                        contributed. The late Dr. A. 8. Murray, Mr. Ferguson, and others endeavoured
                        to supply the omission by study of the various fragments of architecture and
                        sculpture found by Wood; and quite reoently the architect of the Austrian
                        Ephesian expedition, Dr. Wilberg, made a small scale plan and notes of the
                        parts of the early temple surviving in situ, so far as they could be
                        disoerned amid the denso overgrowth. But more information was obviously
                        required, and to obtain this there must be a fresh clearance. It was
                        suspected, moreover, that Wood’s lowest stratum of ruins was not the
                        earliest existent on the site; and it was hoped that not only
                        wouldarchiteotural remains be found below, but that various small objects
                        might be recovered belonging to all the successive temples, which would
                        suppldmont the exceedingly meagre haul made by Wood, and throw further light
                        on the most important local cult of the great Asian goddess. The suspicion
                        has been amply justified. There are the remains of two more temples . below
                        Wood's lowest, the earliest resting on the virgin sand of the original
                        marsh. Tho date of its foundation, judged by the numerous offerings
                        dedicated in it and now brought to light, is about the year 700 n.c. The
                        hope that small cult-offerings would be found has also been realised in a
                        very remarkable and unlooked- for way. While the scanty remains of the Hel-
                        lenists temple, which served as a quarry for centuries, were found to have
                        been pretty thoroughly explored by Wood, and those of the "Cronus Temple,"
                        which he exposed, yielded little beyond new architectural evi- dence and
                        architectural sculpture, the strata below proved extraordinarily rich in
                        fine pro- ducts of (trchaic Ionian art, inspired in many cases by Egyptian
                        models, but thoroughly Greek in character and workmanship. The earliest
                        antiquities found on the site are essen- tially Hellenic. If, as has often
                        been believed, there was a pre-Greek, perhaps Lydian or “flittite," cult of
                        ihe Great Gpddess at Ephesus, her primitive shrine must be looked for
                        elsewhere, probably among the hills south of tho plain, where lay tne
                        ancient holy place, \ Ortygia. The new excavation was begun in the first ,
                        week of last October, and, with an interrup- 1 tion of three months from
                        December to March, | during which some 20in. of rain flooded the j site, was
                        continued into the present Bummer and , brought to a conclusion in the third
                        week of . June. After the tangled jungle and the heaps , of stones, with
                        which Wood had left the pit encumbered, had been cleared away in the ( early
                        autumn, little difficulty was experienced | in exposing the platform of the
                        great sixth century temple, and making a detailed plan of i all that
                        survives of it. But, in clearing ont 1 the rectangular structure which
                        stands exactly 8 in theoentre, and was probably the base of • the only
                        image, Mr. Hogarth peroeived that t there was at least one temple below, and
                        that j the lower stratum would prove even bettei c worth investigation.
                        There was just time ' before the heaviest rains to search a small c part of
                        the oentral area, and extraot a quantity J of objeots of unique character
                        and value ; but „ the exploration of the rest of the stratum had |, to be
                        postponed. On resuming, the digger o found themselves flooded out. The wboli
                        c temple area was a vast pond from which on! Hi the highest stone3 of the
                        Hellenistic stratum f emerged. No natural outfall could be made ° as the pit
                        is far below the general level of the © neighbourhood, and the only resource
                        was to u pump. A powerful engine was hired from o the shops of the Aidin
                        Railway, together with T a twelve-inch pump, and this was installed in d,
                        April, and kept at work till the end of the “ campaign. While the deep
                        oentral area with pj its numerous springs was fenced in and kept 0| more or
                        less dry with smaller pumps and to hand labour, the engine lifted the mass
                        of the g water and sent it down a channel into the Cayster marshland thus
                        with infinite difficulty "4 and under ‘-Wy unhealthy conditions thi ij!
                        objective of the exploration was completely K( attained.</p>
                    <p>for oolnmn, and almost stone for stone, bnt its western facade was approached
                        by a more dignified arrangement of steps. The remains of its architectural
                        members, now reoovered, will enable-a siftisftfeiety onto 'Be U>de of its
                        whole order of ool urn ns. Some part has been found of every detail, except
                        in the case of the architraves, not an atom of which remains on the site,
                        probably beosuse their great reotan- gular blocks were too valuable to later
                        builders Tho net result is to confirm the impression, al- ready
                        arrivedatbystudentsof ancient architect- ure,that in style and workmanship
                        the 1‘Croesus Temple” was singularly superior to its snocea- sor. One oan
                        only wonder why the latter, ’ with its coarse mouldings, its exaggerated
                        flutings, and its heavy aculptureexcitedsuch enthusiasm in antiquity.What
                        Philo oalled the “only house of the gods on earth" must have been dopend-
                        ent on the general effect it produced on the spectator at a certain
                        distance, and probably owed mnoh to oolouring now lost, and to the height at
                        whioh it was raised on its podium. There are already in the British Museum
                        numerous fragments of archaic soulpture,- sup- posed to belong to a storied
                        parapet whioh ran round the top of the sixth oentury temple. Some 30 new
                        fragments oan now be added and perhaps thesubjectof the whole oan be
                        Satisfac- torily reconstituted. It seems to represent an Amaron comW—a scene
                        from the legendary history of the shrine itself. No new evidence has been
                        gained in regard to the coiumtuu caelatm with which this temple, like its
                        succes- sor, is supposed to have been enriohed. The fragments already in the
                        Briti«h Museum will remain the only relics of these.So far Wood's
                        information has been revised and supplemented. Now we enter on disooveries
                        undreamed of by. him. Not being supplied with pumping apparatus, he
                        satisfied himself too easily that, having reaohedthe foundation day on which
                        the sixth oentury structure was based, ho had come to the bottom of all
                        things. Im- mediately under that layer of yellow clay (whioh shows no trace
                        whatever of being, as ho said, composed of the fleeoes and charcoal reported
                        by ancient authority) thsre lies, in faot, the complete ground-plan of a
                        much smaller temple of yellow limestone, paved with highly-polished voined
                        marble. It is entirely contained within the area of the oella of its
                        successor, was divided inti -three halls -or</p>
                    <p>About 600 of these objects were found at the end of the first season, the
                        second season brought over 1,700 more, making a total of well over 3,000.
                        The first hoard was discovered inside the oentral base. A few eleoteum coins
                        of very early types, and some paste scarabs served to date the other objeots
                        (ohiefly of precious metals) to a period anterior to Crams. The discoveries
                        of the past spring were made mainly to the west of the base; but the bare
                        itself was searched farther, and yielded oonsi -ierable additions to the
                        hoard first found, in the shape of brooches of various kinds, tho commonest
                        type being a hawk “displayed,” of pendants and beads from broken up
                        necklaces, of fibulae, hairpins, and charms of one sort and another. The
                        outer region to west yielded less precious metal, but vastly more objocts in
                        other materials s.g., in bronze, ivory, rock- orystal, glass, terracotta,
                        amber, faience, paste, enamelled terracotta, wood,and iron. Among these the
                        ivories stand out in respect of style and exquisite workmsnihip. Statuettes
                        ' of the goddess, figures of animals, rampant or I couohant, plaques and so
                        forth are the gems of a collection whioh inoludei a great number of objeots
                        and fragments of less preteosiou. They represent an art of whioh we have no
                        ' other examples. Of the many broute objeots the most notable is an
                        extremely arohaio statuette of the goddess in the style of the Hera of
                        Samos; in poroeUin there is a group of a kneeling Blave with water jar; of
                        the terracottas a number of statuettes of tho goddess of primitive type, and
                        certain hawks brilliantly enamelled. 'Tne orystals are many, and mostly in
                        the form of a large stud-like objects which may have been pieces of a game.
                        The amber trinkets include a statuette of tho goddess. The pastes are, in
                        many cases, purely Egyptian. Over 60 eleotrum coins, ranging from
                        half-statere down to almost infinitesimal fraotions, were reoovered in the
                        sieves—they belong to Miletus, Samos, Erytbrae and other leigbbounug cities,
                        and only in a ve-y few instances to Ephesus itself, and are the out- come of
                        the earliest experiments in miDtiug. I A silver plate, eDgraved on both
                        sides in arohaio Ionian characters, seems to record treasures of Ihe temple.
                        Two facts in oonnex -on with these early objeots are obvious and noteworthy:
                        the art whioh produoed them is nsentially Greek, and the goddess to whom
                        they were dedicated was not oonoeived under the gross, many-breasted
                        semblance of later times.</p>
