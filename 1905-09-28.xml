                    <p>Made in 70 Colors</p>
                    <p>An artistic wall covering.</p>
                    <p>This celebrated water paint is made in two qualities for Inside and Outside
                        work</p>
                    <p>HALL’S SANITARY WASHABLE DISTEMPER is rapidly superseding wall papers in all
                        tastefully furnished homes. It is made in 70 artistic tints, and only
                        requires the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is quickly and
                        easily applied with a whitewash brush, with half the labour and at one third
                        the cost of paint. HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures cleanliness, and is pleasing to
                        the eye. It appeals alike to artistic and practical house decoration.</p>
                    <p>HALL’S DISTEMPER is of special value in hot climates. Owing to its cool,
                        pleasing colours, great weather-resisting and germ-destroying properties, it
                        lends itself to every kind of wall, wood, brick or stone coating, possessing
                        all the advantages of paint, colour- wash, and disinfectant at one third the
                        cost of oil paint. It never blisters in the hottest sun, and the fact that
                        it can be washed adds greatly to its sanitary advantages.</p>

                        <head>Thursday September 28, 1905. The Anglo-Japanese Treaty</head>
                        <p>The terms of the new treaty of friendship and alliance between England
                            and Japan have already been foreshadowed by the "Times" but several
                            points contained in the various articles of the treaty demand a certain
                            amount of explanation. The treaty is in its essence defensive,
                            guaranteeing the status quo in Eastern Asia and and important addition
                            in India, and, while recognising the special interests of Japan in Korea
                            is framed in a manner that should reasure those advocates of the open
                            door who have expressed a fear that Japan, after establishing herself in
                            the Korean Peninsula, would shut the door in the faces of her neighbors.
                            By none has this fear been more loudly expressed than by the Americans
                            who are themselves about to close the Philip pine Islands to foreign
                            trade by a heavy pro tective tariff and have already closed Porto
                            <cb/>Rico and the Sandwich Islands, and who obviously fear the adoption
                            of similar measures by the Japanese in Korea. That Japan will close
                            Korean ports to foreign trade in defiance of her promises is as
                            unthinkable as it is certain that most of the trade of Korea will fall
                            to her share and that the ex ploitation of the great natural resources
                            of the country will be mainly carried on by Japanese hands and Japanese
                            capital. That Japan has very special advantages over her American and
                            European trade rivals in the Far East is obvious to any one who has
                            studied the Mongol Civilisation. Japanese literature and art had its
                            origin in Corea and China. Buddhism possesses millions of votaries among
                            the three great Mongol na tions and the linguistic difficulty is largely
                            solved by the ideographic characters employed by all the three alike.
                            Just as the Arabic figure 3 conveys the same idea to every educated
                            European though the word is pro nounced "drei" in Germany, and "trois"
                            in France so the Chinese ideographs represent the same idea to a reader
                            from Tokio or Canton though they are pronounced absolutely differently.
                            A Chinaman calls a sea "hai", a Japanese "nada" but the character which
                            represents the idea has the same meaning to each. The Japanese trader
                            may not be able to speak a word of Chinese but he can read the streange
                            idogrpahs which are the despair of the Europeans. The door to trade in
                            Korea and China may be open, but the Japanese will be the first
                            though</p>
                        <p>The clause dealing with the eventuality of another Russo-Japanese war is
                            obviously framed in view of the possibility of Japan attacking Russia.
                            In that case England keeps the ring clear but should Russia attack Japan
                            or force Japan to open hostilites by agressive action England will join
                            her allies in the field this case clearly coming under article II of the
                            treaty, which provides against the con tingency of any agression against
                            the terri torial interests of either power. Then comes the Indian
                            question. There the wording of the treaty as given by Reuter may cause a
                            little anxiety, as the clause dealing with the question seems to forsee
                            the possi bility of a renewal of the forward policy on the north-west
                            frontier. That circumstances may arise which will make British interven
                            tion in Afghanistan necessary is unfortunately possible enough, but
                            there is alwaus a certain risk inseperable from a treaty of this sort
                            that the Indian Government, feeling itself guaran teed by the alliances,
                            may with the aid of sufficent expert advice enlist the support of the
                            home Government on behalf of that for ward policy of which was once
                            remarked that it was extremely forward but hardly politic. Otherwise the
                            aliiance seems to us an excellent stroke on the part of a Government
                            which, whatever its internal success, has done much for the national
                            prestige abroad.</p>

                        ENGLAND’S RIGHT TO SAFEGUARD INDIA. THE EVENT OF ANOTHER RUSSO-JAPANESE
                        WAR</head>
                    <p>London, September 26. The text of the Anglo-Japanese agreement has been
                        published here and at Tokio. It con- twins a preamble uni eight articles.
                        The preamble states that the object of the agree meant is the consolidation
                        and the maintenance of general peace in Eastern Asia and India and the
                        preservation of the common interests of all the powers in China, by insuring
                        the independence and integrity of that country on the principal of the open
                        door, and the main- tenence of the territorial rights of Great Britain and
                        Japan in Eastern Asia and India, and the defence of their special interests
                        therein.</p>
                    <p>Article 1 stipulates that whenever the rights and interests of either party
                        are jeopar- dised the governments shall communicate with each other fairly,
                        and frankly consider jointly the measures to be taken to safeguard them.</p>
                    <p>Article II. provides that if by reason of an unprovoked attack or aggressive
                        action, wher- ever arising, on the part of any power or powers either party
                        be involved in war in defence of its territorial rights and interests, the
                        other party will at once come to the assist- ance of its ally, and will
                        conduct the war in common and make peace in mutual agreement.</p>
                    <p>Article III states that as Japan possesses paramount political, military, and
                        economic rights in Korea, Great Britain recognises her right to take such
                        measures for the guidance, control, and protection of Korea as she may deem
                        to be a proper and necessary safeguard to advance those interests, provided
                        that such measures do not contrary to the principle of equal commercial
                        opportunities for all.</p>
                    <p>Article IV. states that Japan recognises the rights of Great Britain to take
                        such measures in the proximity of the Indian frontier as may be necessary to
                        safeguard her Indian posses- sions.</p>
                    <p>Article V. provides tint both parties agree that neither will, without
                        consulting the other, enter into separate arrangements with another to the
                        prejudice of the objects specified in the preamble.</p>
                    <p>Article VI. refers to the event of a Russo- Japanese war, and in such case
                        Great Britain undertakes to maintain a strict neutrality, and to come to the
                        assistance of Japan in the event of attack by another power.</p>
                    <p>Article VII. stipulates that the conditions under which armed assistance will
                        be rendered shall be arranged by the Naval and Military authorities of the
                        parties, who shall consult one another freely from time to time.</p>
                    <p>Article VIII. states that the term of the present agreement is 10 years, but
                        it may be terminated by either party by a year’s notice to that effect.

                    <p>Anglo-Egyptian Bank—We are informed that the Anglo-Egyptian Bank Ltd., will
                        open an Agency at Mansourah on October 2. The officers of the new agency are
                        situated in the main street quite close to the rail- way station. BP's will
                        be discounted and foreign exchange given, in fact banking business of all
                        sorts will be carried on by the branch, the establishment of which is
                        welcomed by the inhabitants of Mansourah and the neighbourhood. Mr. C. E.
                        Green will manage the now agency.</p>
                    <p>New Military Buildings in Cairo. — A confrere stated recently that the War
                        Office proposed to dispose of the military school and the barracks behind it
                        at Abbassiah and the adjoining land and with the proceeds of the sale to
                        erect now new buildings beyond tho Polygon. Tho true facts of the case are
                        that the military authorities have decided upon building a new school and
                        barracks for the infantry battalions stationed at Abbassieh, as they
                        consider the present old buildings not worth repairing, but they are
                        awaiting the necessary grant from the Ministry of Finance who will then
                        dispose of the present buildings as it deems best.</p>
                    <p>British Chamber of Commerce.—We would draw the attention of manufacturers and
                        mer- chants to the work of the British Chamber of Commerce of Egypt, which
                        was formed in 1896 with the sole object of assisting British trade in this
                        country. The services of the Chamber are always at the disposal of any
                        member desiring information on trade matters generally, including the
                        question of appoint- ing suitable agents. As no fee is charged for such
                        advice, it is obviously in the interests of all British traders here to
                        become members, especially when it is remembered that the annual
                        subscription is merely the nominal one of £1. The latter payment also
                        includes a copy of the monthly Journal issued by the Chamber. Home enquirers
                        can obtain farther particulars from our London office, 36, New Broad-street,
                        which acts as agents to the Chamber.</p>

                    <p>(By Telegraph). Port Said, Thursday 8.48 a.m. Mr. Harris and his assistants
                        commenced fixing the firing charger in the holds of the Chatham at six
                        o'clock this morning and it a expect that all will be ready for the
                        explosion by nine o’clock. The "all ready’ signal, how- ever, has not yet
                        been given though it is ex- pected at any moment and excited crowds are
                        watching the offices of the Suer Canal Com- pany. The state telegraph lines
                        have not been out as it is hoped that they may escape damage. A large number
                        of special correspon- dents, representing both the Egyptian and foreign

                    <p>Thursday, 10.23 a.m. The explosion of the Chatham took place at 9.58 a.m. I
                        took up my position on the roof of the Eastern Exchange Hotel as being the
                        most suitable site, from which to view the explosion and that I might be
                        able to wire you the result without delay. I am, therefore, unable to go
                        into details but will wire you fully at the earliest possible moment.</p>
                    <p>The great event has passed successfully but I cannot say to what extent the
                        mari- time and fresh water canals have been dam- aged. The lines of the
                        State Telegraphs have been broken and messages are being sent via the cable
                        of theEastern Telegraph Company.</p>
                    <p>As for the explosion, from my position it appeared as if a vast colnmn of
                        grey smoke, shaped like a gigantic tree, was rushing up- wards with great
                        rapidity. No earth tremor was perceptible and the surface of the water in
                        the harbour and in the canal all along the stretch visible from here was not
                        disturbed in the slightest degree.</p>
                    <p>Had we not been waiting in feverish excite- ment and expecting one knew not
                        what, the explosion would have in all probability passed unnoticed. The
                        tradesmen, of the town, who had closed their shops in many instances, were
                        greatly surprised, as were indeed all those who had remained in Port Said,
                        and perhaps a little disappointed that some damage was not done to a few
                        windows.</p>

                    <p>Port Said 1.36 p.m. The explosion has been a great success. The fore part of
                        the ship has been blown away as far as the fore engine room. There are now
                        twenty-two metres of water underneath the explosive magazine. The canal is
                        now only five metres deep in the middle, the average depth of water having
                        been nice metres before explosion. The charge was fired from kilometre 12 by
                        Mr. Harris. Seven observers were watching from this point, the remainder
                        waiting at kilometer 8. Fearful damage was done to the Asiatic shore, a ritt
                        50 feet long being blown in the east bunk. No damage was done to the African
                        back. The rails have not been disturbed. The Canal telegraph wires have been
                        destroy- ed. The State wires will be repaired by 3 p.m. The fresh water
                        canal is uninjured. Showers of debris fa11 in the circle of 600 yards
                        radius, Beams, rails, fragments of the engines, and plates were hurled
                        everywhere. Thousands of fish were killed. Repair gangs are on the spot It
                        is hoped that the dual will be dear in seven days.</p>

                    <p>To-day’s operations at kilometre 19 were, from all I hear, decidedly
                        interesting. Mr. Harris in company with his assistants and the chief
                        electrician of the Canal Company were to be been at the railway station at
                        an early hour making enquiries fur special materials which had been rent
                        from Alexandria. The party, after having procured some special instruments
                        for testing electric currents from the electric light station, proceeded to
                        the Canal office where Mr. Tillier held a short consulta- tion with Mr.
                        Harris, after which, he and his party proceeded in the Albatross down the
                        canal and took with them cables, wires, and a quantity of other material for
                        the tests which it was proposed to carry through to-day. The party arrived
                        at Ras el Esh where a gang was awaiting the arrival of the explosives train
                        which had attached to it a powder waggon holding twenty oases of high
                        explosives, all of exactly the same type ad is to be found in the bold of
                        the unfortunate Chatham, viz red dynamite and blasting gelatine. In the
                        waggon were also rolls of new submarine cable and a considerable quantity of
                        other necessary mater- ial for the monster explosion.</p>
                    <p>The experts then proceeded to test the wires and batteries, of which there
                        were severed, the principal being a twist exploder of the very latest type
                        with which quite a number marine detonators were fired.Test followed test;
                        long and short cables in fact every imaginable trial was made, many of a
                        most severe character, the idea being that there should not be the slightest
                        chance of any hitch occurring on Thursday. I understand that after some
                        hours of these trials of every possible combination, Mr. Harris declared
                        himself satisfied in everv way. and he is un- <cb/>doubtedly of the opinion
                        that things will go smoothly at the proper time. The power of this twist
                        exploder is stupendous, registering a number of empires such as is not
                        indicated on the newest and beat devised of voltameter- which Mr. Harris
                        used in his trials. The voltage also is large but, from what I know of the
                        matter, I believe that it is not voltage - which is of such paramount
                        importance but volume, which quality is only indicated by the number of
                        amperes a battery registers when actually delivering its electric force. The
                        detonators to be used in the explosion are of the most recent manufacture
                        and are construct- ed purely and simply for submarine work. The detonating
                        charge is enclosed within a brass tube, which in its turn is covered with
                        thick layers of guttapercha and tape. The firing shock is delivered along
                        two copper wires which terminate in the interior of the fuse in a small
                        platino-iridium bridge. The action of these fuses is simple ; the current of
                        sui- able volume being delivered along the wires from the battery heats the
                        bridge in a moment, the bridge at once glows, and, in so doing, fires the
                        charge of fulminate of mercury contained in the brass tube. This shook being
                        commun- icated to the mine in which the fuse is placed, causes the material
                        of the mine to explode. After firing quite a number of detonators the party
                        returned to the Ras el Esh station and eventually arrived at Port Said at a
                        late hour.</p>
                    <p>The explosives which arrived at kilometre 14 at about 2 p.m. were carefully
                        transported across the canal to the Asiatio bank and there covered up and
                        left properly guarded. They will remain there until to morrow, when Mr.
                        Harris proposes to prepare the mines for the great event.</p>

                    <p>The Canal Company’s steam launch was early at work again to-day taking M.
                        Tillier, the Chef da Transit, and Mr. Harris’ party down the canal, so that
                        they might make all final arrangements, and prepare the firing charges
                        before dark, for to-morrow morning. During the day the telegraph staff were-
                        busy clearing all the wires which are to be used to-morrow and n umbers of
                        men were putting the final touches to the other prepara- tions, notably
                        those connected with the fresh water canal and railway.</p>
                    <p>A considerable number of rails have been accumulated at kilometres 14 and 24
                        in readiness to proceed at once with the repairs which may be necessary
                        after the explosion, and gangs of railway men were being instruct- ed in
                        their duties so that there might be as little delay as possible when the
                        time comes for action.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Harris and his staff prooceeded to the wreak early in the morning and
                        passed a final inspection, making several slight modi- fications in the
                        arrangements with a view to having things straight and clear before the
                        fixing of the mines took place.</p>
                    <p>Ten cases of explosives were handled, their contents being emptied into
                        canvas bags which were made on the spot and were afterwards sown up. There
                        are two mines; the larger one of 3001bs. of blasting gelatine and dynamite
                        is intended for the magazine of the vessel, and the smaller charge, mode np
                        in exactly the same way of 200 lbs. of similar material, is to go into No. 3
                        hold.</p>
                    <p>The wires being made and the detonator having been connected to their
                        respective charges, tea wires which are to traverse the canal from the
                        telephone cables on the west bank, were attached and the joints most care-
                        fully made. After this a length of cable equal to the distance between the
                        two holds was connected to the charges and all was declared ready.</p>
                    <p>The wires were stowed away and locked up on board a dahabesh ; the batteries
                        were ins- pected ; and the party returned to Port Said after a most tiring
                        day.</p>

                    <p>The wind was very light from N.W. leering round to the N. during the latter
                        past of the afternoon and almost died away altogether.</p>
                    <p>The Akraba on the port tank was unfortuna- tely caught by the Calypso on the
                        starboard tack, close to the finishing line and the Calypso pushing her
                        advantage, the Akraba had to give way. Again when the Akraba had manag- ed
                        to get away back on the port take the Masr came along on the starboard tank
                        and forced here to give way again ; this was all pretty manoeuvring riewed
                        by the spectators but was greatly to the disadvantage of the Akraba which
                        however came in third.</p>

                        of the Nile, so large in fact that it might fairly be assumed that the
                        subject had been exhausted. </p>
                    <p>I myself must plead guilty to having contri- buted no inconsiderable share to
                        the existing mass of writing, and I feel much hesita- tion about still
                        further adding to it. I am, moreover, only too well aware that anyone who
                        may read the present article— under the supposition that it contains some-
                        thing new—will speedily dieoover that aooh is not the case. It has, however,
                        been pointed out to me that all my previous notes upon the Nile have
                        appeared in the shape of Bluebooks, or other official documents, and have
                        conse- quently not come in the way of the general reader. Also that, having
                        been purely technical reports, they have necessarily been unattract- ive to
                        many people.</p>
                    <p>The last fact is doubtless true, but I confess to finding some difficulty in
                        presenting the subject in any but a technical form, or in other than
                        technical language. I shall probably fail to make my meaning dear, bat I
                        will ne- vertheless make the attempt, in the hope that a short account of
                        the schemes proposed for controlling the river may be of some interest to
                        those who take a pride in following the progress of England’s work in Egypt
                        and the Sudan.</p>
                    <p>It is, I fear, inevitable that I should commerce with a subject now worn
                        well-sigh threadbare : namely, a brief description of the great stream to
                        which Egypt owes its being. I will, however, make this portion of my article
                        as short as possible, and will devote the greater part of space allotted to
                        explaining what are the projects by which it is proposed to obtain a control
                        over the waters of the Nile, from its sources to the sea.</p>
                    <p>To most people, the bewildering nomencla- ture of this river, throughout its
                        course, must form a serious obstacle to their comprehension of any general
                        description. Who, for instance- is to understand that the Victoria Nile, the
                        Bahr-el Gebel, the Bahr-al Zaraf, and the White Nile, are all one and the
                        same river ? It would be infinitely simpler were the whole stream, from its
                        outlet at Lake Victoria to its junction with the Blue Nile at Khaitoum, to
                        be called by its best known name—the White Nile. Such a change would
                        certainly be to the advantage of the general reader as well as of the geo-
                        grapher and the map maker.</p>
                    <p>It is, of course, unnecessary to do more than mention the fact that the Nile,
                        north of Khartoum, is formed by the j auction of two important waterways—the
                        Blue Nile, flawing from the south-east, and the White Nile, coming from the
                        west, or rather from the. far south. Both there rivers have their origin in
                        lakes of large sire, situated upon plateaux of considerable altitude above
                        the sea. Most people are aware that the source of the Blue Nile is in Lake
                        Tsana, in the northern table- land of Abyssinia, and that of the White Nile
                        in the Victoria Nyanza—that vast fresh-water sea which lies under the
                        equator, in the uplands of Uganda. The volume of the White Nile is further
                        augmented by the waters of two lakes, in the same region —namely, the Albert
                        Edward and the Albeit Nyanzas. From the north end of the last-named lake it
                        issues as the river which conveys to Egypt the united waters of the three
                        equatorial reservoirs. The two great streams which together form the Nile at
                        Khartoum differ in their character to an extreme degree, but both play
                        important parts in producing the remarkable regularity of its annual rise
                        and fall. There can, however, be no question that the White Nile is the
                        parent river, and that its constancy of supply alone renders existence
                        possible in the countries which border its northern valley. The Abyssi- nian
                        stream, although providing the rich muddy floods which bring fertility to
                        the lands of Egypt, has but a fitful existence, and its waters fail
                        altogether at the moment when most required, and when, for want of their
                        .refresh- ing assistance, the thirsty laud lies parched and baked under the
                        scorching rays of the African summer son.</p>
                    <p>A few words mast suffice to describe the essential differences between these
                        two rivers. The Blue Nile dashes down from the Abys- sinian highlands,
                        traversing a wild and beauti- ful country, for the most part a land of
                        forest- clad mountains and of torrential streams. Its valley runs in a deep
                        cleft or gash, several thousand feet below the general surface level, and no
                        explorer has as yet succeeded in follow- ing it throughout its length.
                        Through this canyon the Blue Nile rashes, from time to time dropping over a
                        succession of falls, with a very heavy slope and a rocky bed. It is not
                        until some half of its course has been run that it issues into comparatively
                        open country. Even here its stream is rapid, its banks are high and densely
                        wooded, and tbs difference between its maximum and minimum water- levels is
                        excessive. The volume of this river is supplemented by that of numerous tri-
                        butaries, most of them turbulent torrents like itself, and all of thorn
                        draining the western face of the Abyssinian plateau.</p>
                    <p>The waters of the Blue Nile, when this river is low, are of crystalline
                        clearness and lim pidity. At such periods they are remarkable for the
                        brilliant blue colour by which they reflect the sky. With the advent of the
                        floor they become heavily charged with sediment the scourings of the
                        volcanic rocks and the leaf-mould of the forest land through which the Blue
                        Nile passes. At this season, their colour resembles that of coffee lees. It
                        is to the deposit which they <cb/>contain that Egypt owes the productiveness
                        for which its lands have been renowned from the earliest times. The
                        difference between the volume) of the Blue Nile when in flood, and when its
                        waters have shrunk to their lowest limits, is very great—the former being
                        from sixty to seventy time as great as the latter.</p>
                    <p>The White Nile is, in all respects, a striking contrast to its great eastern
                        sitter.</p>
                    <p>In the upper portions of its coarse, it too travers a country remarkable for
                        the romantic beauty and the varied character of its lands capes. The sources
                        of the chief southern feeder of Lake Victoria—the Kagera river—lie in a
                        sterile and lava-covered regions, out of which rise the jagged peaks of a
                        chain of volcanoes, some of which are still active, This land is at most
                        seasons shrouded in a smoky huts, and the entire area is honeycombed by the
                        inverted cones of long extinct craters. Dreary and in- hospitable as is this
                        portion of the Nile scenery, in the neighbourhood of the lakes more pleasing
                        conditions prevail The Victoria Nyanza is studded by numerous islands of
                        picturesque shape, their outline softened by j masses of indescribably
                        beautiful vegetation. These green elevations are mirrored in the calm water,
                        and contrast exquisitely with the everchanging lights and the opalescent
                        tints of its surface. The scene of the Albert Edward and Albert lakes
                        differs com pletely from that of Like Victoria. Around these lonely sheets
                        of water the landscape is desolate and gloomy, as the mountains hem in their
                        shores on every side. Even here, how- ever, the scene presents a series of
                        pictures, characterised by a wild and savage grandeur. Above the plateau
                        which separates the two lake systems towers the noble mass of Reunzori —the
                        legendary Mountains of the Moon—its loftier summits clothed with a mantle of
                        perpetual snow, and apparently piercing the clouds which cap them.</p>
                    <p>The intervening tableland consists of rolling expanses of woodland,
                        alternating with open but undulating country. The low rounded hills are
                        carpeted with a verdure of extraordinary luxuriance— numerous wild flowers,
                        of large size and brilliant colours, giving it the aspect of a giant’s
                        garden. The hollows are some- times filled by groves of magnificent trees,
                        and sometimes by swamps, clothed by the sombre- looking papyrus The river
                        channel connecting the different lakes occasionally traverses open and
                        grassy plains—the home of numerous antelopes—but more often passes through
                        rock gorger and deep valleys, which lie swelter- ing, throughout the year,
                        in a damp tropical heat, and which are shrouded by an im- penetrable growth
                        of large trees, tang'ed snake-like creepers and dense underwood. The
                        recesses of these primeval forests have, as yet, been hardly penetrated by
                        any living thing, except by the strange animals, and the still stranger
                        types of human beings, which find a sanctuary within their leafy
                        shelter.</p>
                    <p>After issuing from the Albert lake, the Nile tears over a series of
                        picturesquely beautiful falls and rapids, or glides with a swift current
                        between bush clad hills, which again are bounded by lofty mountain ranges,
                        demarcating its valley like a wall. Down the ravines, numerous torrents
                        leap, in s succession of cascades, into the main stream.</p>
                    <p>Such natural beauties, however, are only to be met with in a comparatively
                        small portion of the valley of the White Nile. After about one quarter of
                        its total length has been accomplished, this rivers enters the Und of the
                        great marshes, and from this point its character abruptly and entirely
                        changes The rocky bed, the heavy slope, and the tumbling, sparkling water
                        disappear, and are replaced by a muddy bottom, a low velocity, and a stream
                        flowing in a wide and shallow channel, between low reed-covered banks, and
                        intersected by numerous swampy islands. For many hundred miles it pursues a
                        tortuous course through wide marshes, losing much of its slope, by by reason
                        of the endless loops and bends which succeed one another with maddening
                        regularity. The colour of its water too changes completely, and assumes a
                        brownish green hue. In this region the Nile passes through those swamps in
                        which occur the sudd blocks, those remarkable weed barriers which have, in
                        the past, completely barred its flow, and which have only, writhing the last
                        few years, been removed by the efforts of a small band of Eng- lish
                        officers. This melancholy-looking expanse stretches like a ready ocean in
                        all directions, and covers an area of several thousand square miles—for the
                        most part, a horrible marsh, filled 'by tall reeds and papyrus, and well
                        described by the late Sir Samuel Baker as “a heaven for mosquitoes and a
                        damp hell for men.” The dead flat horizon is rarely broken by any elevation,
                        and the sight of even an occa- sional bush, or stunted tree, is welcome as
                        relieving, in some small degree, the prevailing monotony of the hideous
                        landscape. These swamps are interspersed by shallow lagoons— some of
                        considerable size—which are filled by water spilling into them from the
                        river channel It is to the evaporation on there lagoons, end to the
                        absorption of the water plants, this tire- great waste of water on the White
                        Nile is chiefly due. So great, indeed, is the regulating affect of three
                        marshes that, at the point where the Bahr-el-Gebel finally issues from the
                        sudd country, it has lost from 50 to 85 per cent of the volume which it
                        brought down from the hills, and the quantity which it discharge* into -he
                        White Nile varies bat little throughout the year. This appalling loss of
                        water,is one of the most remarkable features characterising the White Nils,
                        or, as it is called in its course through the swamps, the Bahr-el-GebeL. No
                        matter how high may be the water-level of Lake Albert, or bow large the
                        added yolume brought in by the tributary streams which enter the river, the
                        discharge of the Nils at the point where it issues from the sudd area is
                        practically constant at all seasons and under all conditions.</p>
                    <p>The prevention of this loss of water is the <cb/>chief problem connected with
                        the Nile which requires solution.</p>
                    <p>Apart from the numerous torrents which feed the Bahr-el-Gebel in its
                        tempestuous course through the hills, this river, or rather that portion of
                        it known it the White Nile, recedes the waters of two main affluents—one
                        coming from the west and one from the east These are both perennial streams,
                        but differ largely from each other in their effect upon the flow of the main
                        river. The western tri- butary is known as the Bahr-el-Ghazal, or Gaulle
                        river. It drains the north eastern pla- teau of the watershed between the
                        Nile and the Congo. It is fed by numerous streams, but, in the last two
                        hundred mile* of its course, it traverses a series of immense marshes, in
                        watch it loses its entire slope, and in which its waters are sucked up as by
                        a sponge. So much is this the case that the Bahr-el-Ghazal, where it enters
                        the Nile, is little more than a deep and reedy ditch, of almost stagnant
                        water, playing no part whatever in the system of supply, beyond perhaps that
                        of a reservoir, from which the water, not evaporated in the swamps, filters
                        down into the White Nile, when the levels of this last are low enough to
                        permit of its doing so.</p>
                    <p>The eastern tributary of the White Nile— the Subat—plays a very different
                        role from the Bahr-el-Ghazal, and, indeed, it is upon the dit- charge of
                        this river that, for some months of the year. Egypt depends for the greater
                        portion of its water supply. The Sobat is a true moun tain stream rising in
                        the southern Abyssinian plateau. At certain periods its waters shrink to a
                        very insignificant amount, and its bed is almost dry. For nearly half the
                        year it comes down in a heavy flood, and, when fall, the volume which it
                        adds to the White Nile is nearly three times as great as that brought down
                        from the equatorial lakes by the medium of the Bahr-el-Gebel. It is to the
                        cloudy milk- white colour imparted by the Sobat water that the White Nile
                        owes its name.</p>
                    <p>Before I discuss the different projects for controlling the Upper Nile, I
                        must say a few words regarding the parts respectively played by the lake
                        reservoirs and by the several rivers which combine to form the great system
                        of which the Nile is composed.</p>
                    <p>Such remarks must of necessity be very brief, as anything like a detailed
                        description of this intricate question would far exceed the limits of an
                        article like the present Moreover, the information available is still sadly
                        limited, and only covers a very short period of time. Each succeeding year,
                        however, adds to our know- ledge, and enables us to understand better how
                        complex -but how perfect—is the system which creates this great river. As
                        regards the lakes which form its sources, all recent infor- mation tends to
                        prove that the potentiality of these natural reservoirs, as regards water
                        storage, is less than had formerly been imagined, and that the annual rise
                        and fall of their levels is chiefly determined by the rainfall, and by the
                        evaporation on their sur- faces, rather than by the water added by the
                        rivers of their catchment areas, or withdrawn by the Nile itself. </p>
                    <p>Thus, Lake Teana—the source of the Blue Nile—does not appear to affect
                        materially the discharge of that river, or to be seriously affected itself,
                        as regards its level, by the amount of water drawn off it by the Nile at any
                        season of the year. The volume which passes the outlet appears to be
                        altogether insignificant, and, even when the lake is full, would seem to be
                        as nothing compared with that added by the drainage of the Blue Nile valley,
                        or by its great tributaries, the Dabus, the Dudeesa, the Rahad, and the
                        Dinder.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the White Nile although it is beyond question that its true source
                        is the Victoria Nyanza, it now seems almost certain that—owing to the effect
                        of the man has of the Choga lake, through which the river passes after
                        leaving tire Ripon fells—the volume of water issuing from Lake Victoria is
                        so regulat- ed and reduced that the quantity which event- ually reaches the
                        Albert Nyanza is practically constant throughout the year, however high or
                        low the levels of the latter lake may be. Consequently, the part which the
                        Victoria Nyanza plays, with regard to the Nile dis- charge, is limited to
                        passing a constant (apply into the Albert lake. I do not mean to assert that
                        the volume which reaches Lake Albert by means of the connecting river—the
                        Victoria Nile - is a constant one, but oily that portion of it which is due
                        to the Victoria lake. North of Lake Choga, the rainfall in the Nile valley
                        is very heavy, and at times largely increases the volume which enters the
                        Albert Nyanza.</p>
                    <p>With this last named lake the case is vary different, and upon the levels of
                        its waters the supply of the White Nile largely depends. If Lake Victoria is
                        the tree source. Lake Albert is the true reservoir of the Nila, and, to soma
                        extant, the regulator which determines the volume which passes down the
                        river. Allusion has already been mad* to the fact that the Albert Nyanza
                        receives the waters of both lake systems—namely, that of the Victo- ria
                        Nile, and that of the Albert Edward, by the medium of the Semliki river.
                        This last stream is supplied not alone by Lake Albert Edward, but also by
                        the melting snows, and the glaciers of the Ruenzori mountains.</p>
                    <p>The Uganda plateau has two periods of annual rainfall, the one from March to
                        June, and the other from October to January. The periods of maximum and
                        minimum supply in the lakes differ considerably, as Lake Victoria is at its
                        highest by the end of May, and at its lowest in September. The Albert lake'
                        rises steadily throughout the summer, but does not reach its maximum until
                        November or December, and, as a rule, its minimum by the end of March. It is
                        the sustained rise, throughout the rammer months, which renders this lake so
                        suitable as a possible storage reservoir.</p>
                    <p>The rainfall in the Upper Nile valley itself is heavy in the late autumn, and
                        again in <cb/>July and August. This fills the tributary torrents which enter
                        the Upper Nile below its outlet from the lake. As Lake Albert fells, and
                        thus torrents dry ip, the Nile fells too, and reaches its minimum in March
                        or April. The lake than begins to rise again, and the heavy rainfall of July
                        and August again bring* Urge flashes into the Nile, by means of its
                        tributaries, and the river attains its maximum in September. The affect of
                        three tributaries, however, is much less im- portant that that of lake
                        Albert, and all the latest information collected goes to show that the level
                        of this reservoir is the decid- ing factor of the river discharge, the
                        torrents playing only a secondary part If, then, the lake levels, at the end
                        of the year, are high, the supply in the Bahr-el-Gebel in the following
                        summer will almost certainly be a good one, and the flood most probably a
                        high one. If, on the contrary, the lake levels in December are low, thee, no
                        matter how much water is brought in by the tributary rivers, the summer
                        supply in the following year will be below the average, and the flood most
                        probably a poor one. I wish to lay special stress upon this point, as it is
                        in connection with lake Albert that the solution of the problem of securing
                        a permanent summer supply for the Nile is to be found. It is, of course,
                        understood that when I talk about the flood in the Nile being a good one, or
                        the reverse, I only allude to the amount of water reaching the great swamps.
                        If my description of the Upper Nile has been in any way intelligible, it
                        will have been understood that, from the time it reaches the marshes, this
                        river become, to all intents and purposes, a lost one.</p>
                    <p>With the foregoing information before us, it is possible to comprehend the
                        part played by the different rivers, which together form tire Nile,
                        throughout a year of average supply, During the months of April and May all
                        these are at their lowest, and, practically, the only water passing Khartoum
                        is that which comes through the White Nile marshes,supple- mented by a very
                        small volume brought down by the Blue Nile, la Jane the Abyssinian rainfall
                        causes the eastern river to rise more or less steadily. The flood increases
                        rapidly in July and attains its maximum in August, falling quickly in
                        September. The Atbara— another important tributary of the Nile— begins to
                        rise in June and is in fall flood in August, but generally a little in
                        advance of the Blue Nile. It, too, fells rapidly in Sept- ember, and is dry
                        during the winter months. Meanwhile, on the White Nile, as has been already
                        demonstrated, a constant but small discharge, derived from the equatorial
                        lakes, issues from the great marches by means of Bahr-el-Gebel and its loop,
                        the Bahr-el-Zaraf. The flood rise in the White Nile is conse- quently
                        entirely dependent upon the the volume of the Sobat. This river, in an
                        average year, begins to bring in water to the main stream in the month of
                        June, and after this date its discharge increases rapidly, attaining its
                        maximum in September or Octo- ber, after which it falls rapidly. As the vol-
                        ume added to the Nile by the Sobat in- creases, the water in the former
                        river—above the junction - is held back, and ponded up. The marshes are that
                        flooded for a consi- derable distance up stream, and form a re- servoir
                        which cannot discharge itself until the Sobat flood has passed away.
                        Meanwhile the Sobat water passes to the north, down the White Nile channel,
                        taking the place of the lake water, and from July until Octo- ber
                        practically forms the entire supply which reaches Khartoum by the medium of
                        the White Nile.</p>
