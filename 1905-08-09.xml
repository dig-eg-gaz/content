                    <p>Coles Pasha's Report is an interesting as ever, as well arranged, and
                        happily,as outspo- ken, and as suggestive. The author's optimism never
                        blinds him to the defects that are still to be found in the prision system,
                        but while he is thoruoghly determined to point out its weak- nesses, and
                        shows a courageous readiness to confess that he has at times made too
                        roseate forecasts pf the results of legal reforms, he is no pessimist, and
                        his annual reports have a special attraction to all who prefer 'human
                        documents,' which reveal the personality of their author, to mere catalogues
                        of statistics sandwiched between the dry crusts of unillu- minating comment,
                        with whichthe Egyptian public is sometime regaled. After pointting out that
                        the large increase in the prision population for 1904 is due to the workinf
                        of the revised code, under which there is practically no delay when once
                        sentence is passed, Coles Pasha notes that, in spite of legal obanges and
                        the estab- lishment of Markaz magistrates, there are still too many
                        prisioners awaiting trial. In his opinion the procedure followed by the
                        police in sending on arrested persons to the Parquet without the necessary
                        witnesses, is largely responsible for this excesssive ratio of unsentenced
                        prisoners. the petty theif taken flagrante delicto, instead of going before
                        the police magistrate and gettinghid sentence as in England, is first sent
                        before the Parquet, which has to consult the Casiere Judiciarie, summon the
                        witnesses, and name a day for the trial. The 'dossier' system may be sure
                        and safegaurd persons who are innocent of the crime imput- <cb n="4"/> ed to
                        them, but it is an open question as to whether its slowness does not nullify
                        the effect of its sureness. The certainty of acquittal is said by some to
                        make prison life comparitively blithe and cheerful, but we should imagine
                        that it must be most exasperating to be dismissed withuout a stian on your
                        character after awaiting tril in the most palatial gaol for six weeks or so.
                        On the other hand, the number of prisoners appealing showed a decided
                        diminution thanks to the recent establishment of Assize Courts, which was
                        due to the recognition of the fact that the power of appeal had been grossly
                        abused in the past. As regaurds the periods of imprisionment and the
                        classification of offences, it is interesting to not that while the number
                        of prisoners whi wer confined for contraven- tions was reduced by over 50%
                        there was a large increase of persons imprisoned for delits (misdemeanours).
                        The increase of the prision population in 1904 is due to the increase of
                        persons sentence to terms of from one week to three months, imprisonment,
                        and not, as was imagined, to any increase in the number of persons sentenced
                        to longer periods. Indeed, the number of those sentenced to periods od 6
                        months or a year's imprisionment, adn over bears exactly the same proportion
                        to the prision population as in 1903,and is only 1% lower than in 1902.</p>
                    <p>The passaged in the report which deal with juvenile offenders are of such
                        importance that they mustbe dealt with separately and we pass on to the
                        conduct of the prisoners. A marked increase of minor prison offencews is
                        noted for 1904, but major offences can hardly be said to have increased, and
                        the acts of violence and murderous assults on police officials at Tourah,
                        which at one time threatened to become unpleasently numerous, shows a most
                        gratifying diminution which is ascribed by Coled Pasha tot he establsihment
                        of the discipline gang, and to the fact that the convicts are now well aware
                        that certain selected officials carry revolvers and are ready to use them if
                        necessary. Of the 67 prisoners who escaped, 19 are still at latrege. The
                        prison punishments lists shows a most satisfactory and continued decrease in
                        te sentences of corpiral punishment which have fallen from 273 in 1902 to 70
                        during the past year. The passgaed of this report and the report of Dr.
                        Kirton, Principal Medical Officer to the Prisons Administration, which deal
                        with the health of the prisoneres, demand separate notice in our columns. We
                        are glad to note that Coles Pasha pays a well-deserved tribute to the
                        clerical staff of the administration for the care and thoroughness with
                        which the tables accompanying the report have been prepared, and to read
                        that the information furnished in the Egyptian Prisons Report does not now
                        fall far short of the statistics published annually by European and Indian
                        prison administrations.</p>

                    <head>ESPIONAGE ON THE FRENCH FRONTIER</head>
                    <p>Inhabitants in the country part of France have remarked the presence of large
                        numbers of vendors of images and itinernt merchants generally. These persons
                        visit the villages in detail and show marked predilection for local gossip,
                        Such a phenomenon was observed on the eve of the war of 1870-71, and its
                        reappearance at this moment is su=ignificant of he resumed activities of
                        Germant. THe pedlars are no doubt spies in the pay of the German
                        Intelligence Department. THeir business is to find out the local resources
                        of the country and to take note of the state of feeling of the in-
                        habitants. During the great struggle of thirty years ago the spy, primed
                        with local knowledge played a large part in the militaryh operations. A
                        belame of the village would often be saluted by name by a soldier wearing
                        the Prussian uniform who has perhaps occupie some posi- tion in the counrty
                        before the outbreak of the war, and utilised his opportunites of seeing and
                        hearing tot the advantage of the conquerors. In view of this factm it is,
                        perhaps, not sur- prising that the peasants should be convinced that Germany
                        contemplated some new mischief.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, the French are also pre- paring for the day of an heroic
                        struggle whose proximity rests on the knees of the gods, It appears to be
                        established that the Military Imtelligence Department is, however, a very
                        ineffective arm of the French Etat-major. It received its death-blow at the
                        Dreyfus trial- that singular and disquieting symptom of official rottenness.
                        The country, disgusted at the revelations of the uses made of the secret
                        side of the service, practically acquiesced in its abolition. Its power and
                        duties were generally transferred to the police, who naturally are more
                        occupied with ordinary affairs of cri- minality than with matters of
                        politicla and military espionage. Moreover, the repression of spying and
                        informing when carried out under organised system of Germany, is a difficult
                        and almost impossible operation. A pedlar upon whose person is found a note-
                        book containing general particulars about the country-side can hardly be
                        held in prison as a spy dangerous to the national intrests.</p>

                        <p>Flotillas of excursion steamers packed with passengers gave the Frenchmen
                            an unofficial popular welcome even more significant than the official
                            one. The whole scene was unsurpassable for animation, beauty, and

                    <p>(AL MOAYAD.)</p>
                    <p>Marshal Faizi Pasha, commander of the Ottoman troops in 8. Arabia, has
                        advanced into the Azir. Province bound to Sana and bas defeated, the rebels.
                        We gather from the latest telegrams dispatched from Turkish official
                        sources, that he has completely vanquished the Arabs, who are fleeing before
                        him. Notwithstanding the great heat which now prevails he is nearing Sand,
                        and within a month he will have completely subdued the revolt.</p>
                    <p>The rebels have only injured themselves by revolation against their
                        Government. They should have remained peaceful and left interference in the
                        affairs of the administra tion and rebellion to others. We greet with great
                        joy the victory of the troops of the exalted Government, as it is a conquest
                        ever tribes devoid of all mind and senre. On the other hand we regret the
                        loss of life among Moslems caused by the victory,but the Turkish Government
                        cannot be blamed for suppressing a rebellion, and every good Moslem hopes
                        that this movement will be the last, and that the rule of the Turkish
                        Government over the Arabs and the other subjects of the Empire, will be
                        prosperous and enduring.</p>

                            theatregoers, by providing a high-class entertainment. At the present

                            they are supported by a good chorus. One of the most important points in

                    <head>OUR WATER SUPPLY.</head>
                    <p>USE OF POISONOUS WELLS.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Gottschlich has recently informed us that we drink water equal to the
                        beat in the world, as far as purity is concerned. This should console those
                        who grumble at the price they pay for these blessings, but we are afraid
                        that many of the European and native residents of Alexandria-and these not,
                        the poorest-are incapable of appreciating the fact that, even if you cannot
                        get good water without paying for it, that does not justify you in supplying
                        your neighbours with water that must necessarily be dangerous. Alexandria,
                        before the construction of the Mahmoudieh canal, depended for its water on
                        wells sunk in various parts of the town, nearly all of which were poisoned
                        by sewage infiltration, and yielded a contaminated supply, which was
                        responsible for a variety of diseases."</p>
                    <p>The Water Company has for many years past supplied the city with pure water,
                        but none the less, many of these wells are still open, and we should imagine
                        that their supply is more poisonous than ever. We can understand that in the
                        case of the very poor it is rather difficult for the authorities to force
                        them to pay for good water, by filling up these wells on which they depend,
                        but what are we to say of the Greek or Arab bakers, who use water obtained
                        from wells sunk under their houses, or under the street, and drawn with hand
                        pump to mix with flour? Medical men can tell us whether the heat of a
                        European or Arab baker's oven is capable of destroying the microbes that
                        such water must contain in millions, polluted as it must be by infiltration
                        from sewers and cesspools.</p>
                    <p>The Labbane quarter contains several ot these walls, which supply adjacent
                        bakeries. Yesterday we visited one which had been sunk, not in a court or
                        cellar, but in the middle of a street. It was sunk opposite a large and
                        thriving Arab bakery, which used its water, and was covered when not in use.
                        Other wise the road was usually more or less obstructed by the drawers of
                        water from what was nothing but a pit, sunk ten or eleven feet below the
                        surface.</p>
                    <p>On approaching the pit we noticed several men at work with picks and spades,
                        and assumed that the Municipality had given orders to close and fill the
                        well. But we were unable to verify our assumption, for, on approaching its
                        mouth, we were greeted by such a horrible and pestilent odour, that we
                        incontinently fled. A neighbouring sewer had broken into the well! That was
                        all! Such was the sentce from which a large bakery had drawn to water for
                        months past. Is not this a case where our sanitary authorities can inter

                        quarters, which bad been temporarily ceded by it to the Government, and to
                        certain individuals in Ismail Pasha's time. The hodjets of these properties
                        being lost, the Wakfs Administration's recent claim to the ownership of this
                        lands was at first disputed, and it was said that a lawanit between the
                        'Wakfs' on one side and the Government on the other was pending, when the
                        hodjets, which appear to have made good the claim of the Administration,
                        were dis covered. It is believed that in consideration of this, the
                        Government will pay a considerable sum by way of compensation to the Wakfs
                        and remain in possession.</p>

                    <p>We mentioned a short time back that the Council of Ministers had authorised
                        the Cairo Tramway Company to extend its present system by the construction
                        of new lines and. the extension of others. In addition to the present urban
                        lines, consisting of those to Choubrah, Abbassieb, Nasrieh, Saida Zenab,
                        Rod-El-Farag, Canal Ismaïlieh, Khalig, Boulac, Ghizeb, Daher, Old Cairo and
                        the Citadel, the following new lines are projected by the company to

                    <p>Last Monday evening at 9.30 there was an interesting ceremony held at the
                        Alexandria Conservatoire. A short programme of music by pupils was first
                        gone through-two or chestral pieces, two choruses, and a solo by a Dalmatian
                        pupil of Signor Galletti's with a surprisingly fine baritone voice: When the
                        masia was over the orchestral stands were. o'eared off the stage and the
                        prizes were given away. The secretary, Mr. Canivet, made a short energetic
                        speech, pointing out how much was owing to the Directeur Artistique, who was
                        devoting his ta'ent, time, and leisure for the benefit of the free training
                        of young people of all nationalities, without receiving a piastre in return
                        for his devoted work. In return, M. Canivet begged the pupils to show their
                        gratitude to him by their punctuality and assiduity in their different
                        studies.. To encourage them in their efforts, he was pleased to be able to
                        announce to them that two anonymous benefactors had promised an annual prize
                        of 100 francs, one for the best girl and other the best boy pupil. Out of
                        ten points five would be given for regularity of attendance. We noticed on
                        the platform amongst other committee members, Lady Blomfield and Mr. Victor
                        Sinano. The former offered an annual prize for the best reader at sight,
                        whilst Mr. V. Sinano said he could not but follow her good example, and
                        would present an annual prize for some other subject to be selected by the
                        committee afterwards. It is also probable that an amateur violinist will pre
                        ent, annually, a first class bow to the bast of Sig. Lama's pupils. Mr.
                        Victor Sinano has selected one of the best violin pupils to play in the
                        Zizinis orchestra next winter. The list of pupils who received prizes will

                    <p>96,229 males and 9,990 females were committed to the several prisons compared
                        with 97,450 males and 12,815 females committed during 1903.</p>
                    <p>The large increase (17,826) in the number of prisoners admitted, on
                        conviction is explained by the working of the revised code. It is, however,
                        very satisfactory to find that the number of prisoners confined in default
                        has dropped to 18,065, and that the Irrigation and Omdebs' Courts have
                        imprisoned many less than during either of the previous years.</p>
                    <p>Prison population.</p>
                    <p>Under the old law it often took months to execute a judgment, whereas with
                        the revised code there is practically no delay when once sentence is passed.
                        It is not surprising therefore that a large increase in the prison popula
                        tion followed immediately on the promulgation of the new law (15th April).
                        It was hoped that, when once all the arrears had been worked cff, this
                        increase would disappear, more espe cially as the number of prisoners who
                        undergo imprisonment in default is now comparatively small, It is
                        disappointing, therefore, to find the year closing with a prison population
                        of 12,399, campared with 10,627 at the close of 1903 and 9,005 at the close
                        of 1902. The maximum number confined was 13,080 on the last day of October,
                        and the average was 11,928 compared with 10,234 in 1903.</p>
                    <p>If we analyse this population we find 8,856 awaiting final disposal (2,897 in
                        1903) and 9,043 undergoing sentence (7,736 in 1903). Of the prisoners
                        awaiting trial, 797 were reported as "at the disposal of the Parqget" (684
                        in 1903) and 975; "at the disposal of the Courts" (705 in 1903), 1,575 had
                        appealed (1,499 in 1903). Bat it is satisfactory to find that of the
                        prisoners undergoing sentence 230 only were "in default" (761 in 1903).</p>
                    <p>Commitments before trial.</p>
                    <p>Of the 22,618 prisoners (persons temporarily confined in police locks-ups are
                        not included in this return) shown as committed before trial 8,893 or 39%
                        were acquitted by the courts or released by the Parquet without trial;
                        12,312 or 54% were convicted in 1st Instance and 1,448 or 7% were awaiting
                        disposal at the close of the year.</p>
                    <p>If we farther analyse the figures in this return we find that 4,464 of these
                        prisoners were only disposed of after imprisonment for one month and more,
                        and of this number (4,464) 9,188 were either acquitted or released. 214
                        prisoners were still undisposed of, at the close of the year,
                        notwithstanding that they had been in confinement for upwards of 8 months.
                        These figures (which I have included in my. report for the first time this
                        year) are of special interest, as I am of opinion that they throw light on
                        one of the faults in the administration of justice in Egypt, a fault which,
                        I fear, still calls for a remedy notwithstanding the changes in the law and
                        the establishment of markez magistrates.</p>
                    <p>The markez magistrate does not affect the question much, as in the majority
                        of the cases dealt with by these magistrates, there is no arrest before
                        trial. The fault lies, in my opinion, in the procedure followed by the
                        police in rending forward arrested persons to the Parquet without, at the
                        same time, the witnesses. A petty thief caught in flagrant délit and
                        sentenced within twenty four hours by a police magistrate is practically
                        unknown in Egypt. After police action, it rests with the Parquet to consult
                        the Casier Judiciaire, sommon witnesses, etc., and appoint a day for trial
                        All this takes time. The dossier system may be sure; it is certainly slow,
                        and innocent persons undoubtedly occasionally suffer in consequence.</p>
                    <p>Prisoners appealing.</p>
                    <p>It will be seen that 15,474 prisoners appealed, and of this number 8,858 or
                        23% were acqaitted and released. The appeals of 10,569 or 70% were rejected
                        (i.e., prisoners were not released) and 1,547 were pending at the close of
                        the year. It will be seen also that 8,784 or 59% of the appeals took upwards
                        of one month to dispose of, and of this number 1,816 were successful, the
                        prisoners being released.</p>
                    <p>Assize Courts have been now established and the abuse of the power of appeal
                        in Egypt has been so generally recognised that further com ment is
                        unnecessary. The information contained in this table, dealing alone with
                        prisoners, may. however, be of interest and serve a useful purpose. It will
                        be of interest too, in future years, to show the working of the Assize-
                        Courts.</p>
