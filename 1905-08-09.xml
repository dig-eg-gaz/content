                        <head>COLE PASHA'S REPORT FOR 1904</head>
                        <p>Coles Pasha's Report is an interesting as
                        ever, as well arranged, and happily,as outspo-
                        ken, and as suggestive. The author's optimism
                        never blinds him to the defects that are still to 
                        be found in the prision system, but while he is
                        thoruoghly determined to point out its weak-
                        nesses, and shows a courageous readiness to 
                        confess that he has at times made too roseate
                        forecasts pf the results of legal reforms, he is 
                        no pessimist, and his annual reports have a 
                        special attraction to all who prefer 'human 
                        documents,' which reveal the personality of
                        their author, to mere catalogues of statistics
                        sandwiched between the dry crusts of unillu-
                        minating comment, with whichthe Egyptian
                        public is sometime regaled. After pointting out 
                        that the large increase in the prision population
                        for 1904 is due to the workinf of the revised
                        code, under which there is practically no delay
                        when once sentence is passed, Coles Pasha
                        notes that, in spite of legal obanges and the estab-
                        lishment of Markaz magistrates, there are still 
                        too many prisioners awaiting trial. In his
                        opinion the procedure followed by the
                        police in sending on arrested persons to the
                        Parquet without the necessary witnesses, is
                        largely responsible for this excesssive ratio of
                        unsentenced prisoners. the petty theif taken 
                        flagrante delicto, instead of going before the
                        police magistrate and gettinghid sentence as in 
                        England, is first sent before the Parquet, which
                        has to consult the Casiere Judiciarie, summon 
                        the witnesses, and name a day for the trial. The
                        'dossier' system may be sure and safegaurd
                        persons who are innocent of the crime imput-
                        <cb n="4"/>
                        ed to them, but it is an open question 
                        as to whether its slowness does not nullify
                        the effect of its sureness. The certainty of
                        acquittal is said by some to make prison
                        life comparitively blithe and cheerful, but
                        we should imagine that it must be most
                        exasperating to be dismissed withuout a stian
                        on your character after awaiting tril in 
                        the most palatial gaol for six weeks or so.
                        On the other hand, the number of prisoners 
                        appealing showed a decided diminution thanks
                        to the recent establishment of Assize Courts,
                        which was due to the recognition of the fact
                        that the power of appeal had been grossly
                        abused in the past. As regaurds the periods of 
                        imprisionment and the classification of offences,
                        it is interesting to not that while the number 
                        of prisoners whi wer confined for contraven-
                        tions was reduced by over 50% there was a 
                        large increase of persons imprisoned for delits
                        (misdemeanours). The increase of the prision
                        population in 1904 is due to the increase of 
                        persons sentence to terms of from one week
                        to three months, imprisonment, and not, as
                        was imagined, to any increase in the number
                        of persons sentenced to longer periods. Indeed,
                        the number of those sentenced to periods od
                        6 months or a year's imprisionment, adn over
                        bears exactly the same proportion to the
                        prision population as in 1903,and is only
                        1% lower than in 1902.</p>
                        <p>The passaged in the report which deal with 
                        juvenile offenders are of such importance that 
                        they mustbe dealt with separately and we
                        pass on to the conduct of the prisoners. A 
                        marked increase of minor prison offencews is 
                        noted for 1904, but major offences can hardly
                        be said to have increased, and the acts of 
                        violence and murderous assults on police
                        officials at Tourah, which at one time threaten-
                        ed to become unpleasently numerous, shows a
                        most gratifying diminution which is ascribed
                        by Coled Pasha tot he establsihment of the
                        discipline gang, and to the fact that the 
                        convicts are now well aware that certain
                        selected officials carry revolvers and are 
                        ready to use them if necessary. Of the 67
                        prisoners who escaped, 19 are still at latrege.
                        The prison punishments lists shows a most
                        satisfactory and continued decrease in te 
                        sentences of corpiral punishment which have
                        fallen from 273 in 1902 to 70 during the past
                        year. The passgaed of this report and the 
                        report of Dr. Kirton, Principal Medical Officer
                        to the Prisons Administration, which deal with 
                        the health of the prisoneres, demand separate
                        notice in our columns. We are glad to note
                        that Coles Pasha pays a well-deserved tribute
                        to the clerical staff of the administration for 
                        the care and thoroughness with which the
                        tables accompanying the report have been 
                        prepared, and to read that the information
                        furnished in the Egyptian Prisons Report does
                        not now fall far short of the statistics published 
                        annually by European and Indian prison
                        administrations.</p>

                        <head>ESPIONAGE ON THE FRENCH FRONTIER</head>
                        <p>Inhabitants in the country part of France 
                        have remarked the presence of large numbers
                        of vendors of images and itinernt merchants
                        generally. These persons visit the villages in 
                        detail and show marked predilection for local
                        gossip, Such a phenomenon was observed on the 
                        eve of the war of 1870-71, and its re-
                        appearance at this moment is su=ignificant of he
                        resumed activities of Germant. THe pedlars
                        are no doubt spies in the pay of the German 
                        Intelligence Department. THeir business is to 
                        find out the local resources of the country and 
                        to take note of the state of feeling of the in-
                        habitants. During the great struggle of thirty 
                        years ago the spy, primed with local knowledge
                        played a large part in the militaryh operations.
                        A belame of the village would often be saluted 
                        by name by a soldier wearing the Prussian 
                        uniform who has perhaps occupie some posi-
                        tion in the counrty before the outbreak of the
                        war, and utilised his opportunites of seeing 
                        and hearing tot the advantage of the conquerors. 
                        In view of this factm it is, perhaps, not sur-
                        prising that the peasants should be convinced 
                        that Germany contemplated some new mischief.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the French are also pre-
                        paring for the day of an heroic struggle whose 
                        proximity rests on the knees of the gods, It 
                        appears to be established that the Military 
                        Imtelligence Department is, however, a very
                        ineffective arm of the French Etat-major. It 
                        received its death-blow at the Dreyfus trial-
                        that singular and disquieting symptom of
                        official rottenness. The country, disgusted at
                        the revelations of the uses made of the secret 
                        side of the service, practically acquiesced in its
                        abolition. Its power and duties were generally 
                        transferred to the police, who naturally are
                        more occupied with ordinary affairs of cri-
                        minality than with matters of politicla and 
                        military espionage. Moreover, the repression 
                        of spying and informing when carried out
                        under organised system of Germany, is a
                        difficult and almost impossible operation. A 
                        pedlar upon whose person is found a note-
                        book containing general particulars about the
                        country-side can hardly be held in prison as a 
                        spy dangerous to the national intrests.</p>
