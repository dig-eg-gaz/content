                    <p>THE KAISER AND ISLAM</p>
                    <p>Our <placeName>London</placeName> Correspondent's special tele- gram of
                        yesterday will be no surprise to those who have observed the attempts made
                        by the German Government to obtain the support of thw Moslem veracular Press
                        for its policy in Morocco. Two Moslem newspapers are reported to have
                        received subventions from that Go- vernment to this end, and such as long as
                        their exceelent editors confine themselves to beland- ing the efforts of the
                        European supporters of the ruler of Morocco- and at the same time
                        complacently noting the number and perfec- rions of the danseuses, singers,
                        musicians, and claqueurs recently imported from Egypt by his Sherifan
                        Majesty- all is for the best, and the Maison Britanniqe can continue its
                        business in peace. But should Mustapha Pasha Kamel's article in reality
                        represent the feelings of a large section of the Moslem world, the owners of
                        that admirable establishment and its nu- merous branches would be justified
                        in leophol- ing their shutters and putting on an extra guard of day and
                        night watchmen, and its staff would not incur the reproach of timi- dity if
                        they manifested a certain eagerness to take every possible precaution
                        against burglary or fire. But the case is, we believe, quite other- wise.
                        What does Berlin really stand for in the Moslem world, and what section of
                        that world does Mustapha Pasha Kamel represent.</p>
                    <p>The German Emperor has a certain personal popularity in parts of the Turkish
                        Empire. The Sherif of Morocco counts gleefully upon his future assistance,
                        and those Arabs of the East African Coast, who have not passed before firing
                        parties, own him as their ruler, but what interest have the Persians, the 70
                        mil- lions of Indian Moslems, the Kabyles and Arabs of Algeria, and the
                        nomads of Arabia, in furthering the aims ascribed to the Emperor William.
                        Again, what Moslem party does Mustapha Pasha Kamel represent? He may have
                        some influence in Turkey, though we are assured that almost all comment on
                        the "Nationalist," leader in Syria is adverse. Are the Pahjabi Moslem, the
                        Pathan, and the Shiah Persian to be reckoned among his followers. The sons
                        of the hill-men who fol- lowed John Nicholson through the Kashmir gate at
                        Delhi, and who followed their British leaders to victory in the north, are
                        hardly likely to follow "Al Lews," and who are the Pasha's followers in
                        Egypt? A group of young men, who consider them- selves capable of managing
                        Egypt, the Sudan, and the Moslem world; a tiny handful of honest
                        nationalists; and those jackals of every party that opposes progress who
                        were once plea- santly described by an Anglo-Egyptian as "Lew(a)d fellows of
                        the baser sort." Large crowds listen to the Pasha's orations. We admit his
                        eloquence and wit, though we deplore the perversity of his ideas and his
                        entire absence of humour,-but eloquence attracts an Arab crowd before all
                        others. Who of the thousands who crowd to hear and applaud him, will follow
                        Mustapha Kamal.</p>
                    <p>The Pasha is, in our opinion, acting unconscious- ly as Germany's drummer.
                        THe roll of his eloquen- ce suggests conquest and world-rule, the Kaiser and
                        Sultan Mustapha allied. Emporers of the East and West, but its real onjects
                        is a con- cession for a quay in Morocco or for a railway in Mesopotamia
                        granted to the enterprising Teuton, and perhaps- an order for the
                        Nationalist leader, if the German Goverment is really in as prickly a mood
                        as our corres- pondent believes. ASs for the representatives of Germany in
                        Egypt, official and civil, we need not say that theit excellent public and
                        private relations with the British element in Egypt and the representatives
                        of the Occupa- tion are in our opinion a proof that the German nation,
                        whatever the attitude of a vocal Chauvinist section, which is unfortunately
                        too strongly represented if high quarters at Berlin, is ready to accept the
                        British Occupation and the peculiar position held by our country in Egypt as
                        a guarantee of that country's peace and progress. For one supporter,
                        European or native, of Mustapha Pasha Kamel, Lord Cromer and the Egyptian
                        Government reckon thousands. </p>

                    <p>The butchers’ strike here resulted in fierce rioting. The mob attempted to

                        killed and 80 wounded. The garrison was absent at manoeuvres, and the
                        citizens were called out to maintain order. Rioting and looting still
                        continue here. Over five hundred were killed and wounded on Sunday and
                        Monday, including numbers of police. The rioters stopped the trains from
                        starting to fetch the troop's. The agitation has spread to
                            <placeName>Valparaiso</placeName>. The trouble is due to the heavy tax

                        <head>Bride Disappears</head>
                        <p>A marriage was recent ly arranged between a Moslem boy of eleven and a
                            girl of twelve years of age. The wed- ding day was fixed, and at the
                            ceremony the little bridegroom was taken from his home by the “best men"
                            and his friends to a cafe some distance from the house, according to the
                            old custom entitled "El Huroub" (i.e. flight) in which the bridegroom
                            flees from the house which the bride enters in his absence. This action
                            on the part of the bridegroom is supposed to signify that he leaves his
                            boost open to his bride, who must enter first. Tired out by the
                            excitement of the day the bride- groom slept till his friends in the
                            cafe found it time to return and bade him awake The poor child, fatigued
                            and dazed, collapsed and had to be driven, fast asleep again, to the
                            house, where his friends found that mourning and lamentation had
                            replaced the usual cries of joy and musical orgies which accompany a
                            Moslem wedding. The bride, finding the crowd and noise very tiresome,
                            and being extremely bored by the old women who chattwred to her, thought
                            that she might as well leave a cere- mony which she did not understand
                            or appre- ciate, and disappeared. And the strangest part of the story is
                            that nothing has been seen of her since her disappearance.</p>

                    <p>The new system of American Jewell filters which have been installed at the
                        Alexandria Waterworks, and which have been supplying the town with purer
                        water for some time now, were formally inaugurated by H.H. the Khe- dive
                        yesterday, in the presence of a purely official gathering. Invitations,
                        which had been sent out by the Alexandria Municipality and the Water Company
                        conjointly, were re- stricted to members, past and present, of the
                        Municipality, the magistracy, the Army, the heads of religious
                        denominations, and the chiefs of the various Government and munici- pal
                        departments.</p>
                    <p>The ceremony was timed to take place at 4.30 p m., and his Highness arrived
                        with his usual well-known punctuality. He drove up to Rond Point,
                        accompanied by H.E. the Go- vernor, and escorted by his Body Guard. On
                        reaching the grounds of the Water Company, his Highness was received, at the
                        foot of the carpeted staircase leading to the “settling” basins, by the
                        members of tho company’s board and the Municipal Councillors. After shaking
                        bands with a number of those present, his Highness conducted by
                            <persName>Mr. J.E. Cornish</persName>, jun, manager of the Water Company
                        pro tem, to the settling basins, it being the intention of the company to
                        show the Khedive the whole process of filtration from start to finish, in
                        other words, from the moment that the muddy polluted water enters the
                        filters from the <placeName>Mahmoudieh Canal</placeName>, until it is
                        discharged as pure as crystal into the distributing mains of the city.</p>
                    <p>The water from the canal is pumped first of all by one set of engines into a
                        distributing reservoir, from which it is led off to each of the three
                        settling basins, on its way being mixed with a solution of sulphate of alum
                        which acts as a precipitant, causing a large quantity of mud to deposit
                        before the water reaches the filters. These settling basins are divided by a
                        (mid-wall so arranged that the surface water from the first half of the
                        basin flows to the bottom of the second half of the basin and again from the
                        surface of the second half to the filter tanks. There was a very marked
                        difference noticeable in the clearness of the water between the first and
                        second half of the basins, and still more so between that and the dirty
                        water first let into the basins.</p>
                    <p>After his Highness had gone over the whole of the basins, listening
                        attentively to the explanations of <persName>Mr. Cornish</persName>, and,
                        followed by the invited guests, he was conducted to the filter house,
                        passing on the way through a small auxiliary engines house, fitted with two
                        high- speed engines arranged to drive a pair of high- lift centrifugal pumps
                        for the washing process of the filters. These engines which are by Bellis
                        and Morcom, Ltd., Binrmihgham, also drive the electric dynamo supplying the
                        electric light for the whole, of the waterworks and the shafting used for
                        working the agitators of the filters. Above this engine-house are situa- ted
                        the bacteriological laboratory and the installation tor mixing and supplying
                        the alum solution to the muddy water.</p>
                    <p>The filter-house proper is constructed on the top of tho filter, water
                        reservoir, in such away that the water from those filters falls directly
                        into this reservoir, whenever it is pumped by a second and more powerful set
                        of electric into the mains of the town.This filter-house is divided into two
                        stages, and a start was made at the upper stage, which is what may be
                        called, the operating platform, where the whole of I the manipulation of the
                        water is carried out. One filter, which had been working for some time, had
                        been emptied for the occasion and a section through the sand made which
                        showed the thick deposit of mud in the top layers of the sand gradually
                        decreasing throughout the depth of the sand until at a depth of 10 inches
                        the sand was quite free from mud. His Highness was then taken to another
                        filter and shown the whole process of filtration, in which he evinced the
                        greatest interest. During the process samples of the water were taken in
                        test tubes each half I minute, showing how the water gradually became
                        clearer and clearer.</p>
                    <p>His Highness was afterwards conducted to the lower s'age of the filter-house,
                        where tho intricate system of pipes, valves, and regula- tors connected with
                        each filter-bed was seen in working order, and then proceeded to the main
                        engine house, where he was shown the electric recording instruments
                        connected with the settling basins, the filtered water reservoirs, the town
                        reservoir, and the main pumping engines supplying the water to the town. His
                        Highness was greatly struck by the very con- venient manner in which all the
                        gauges and the starting and regulating mechanism of the engines were
                        arranged, a single man being able 'o control the whole of these without
                        moving from one spot. The boiler-house was then visited and afterwards the
                        workshops of the company.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the inspection the Khedive expressed himself to
                            <persName>Mr. Cornish</persName> as being exceedingly pleased with and
                        interested in the plant. Although his Highness was himself conversant with
                        the system (having had fitted up at his palace at
                            <placeName>Montazah</placeName> the original plant on which the
                        company's experiments were carried out) he was the more interested in seeing
                        the way in which the system had been so expanded as to deal with an
                        immensely larger volume of water.</p>
                    <p>An adjournment was then made to a well- supplied buffet, which had been
                        erected in a beautifully arranged alcove in the garden, where his Highness
                        thanked the directors for their courtesy and gave expression to tho pleasure

                        <persName>M. Jaures</persName>, the Socialist leader, in an article on the
                        tendencies of <placeName>German</placeName> Foreign policy, remarks that it
                        is impossible for Republican France to associate herself therewith. He adds
                        that the French Socialist party to which he belongs will never cease
                        combating <placeName>Germany's</placeName> attempt to secure privileged
                        treatment in <placeName>Turkey</placeName>. </p>
                    <p>
                        <placeName>Germany</placeName>, he says, has made it her policy to flatter
                        and support the present Sultan, and this policy is to a great extent
                        responsible for the horrors of the Ameenian massacres and the sanguinary
                        anarchy now prevailing in <placeName>Mace- donia.</placeName></p>
                    <p>It was the special assistance of <placeName>Germany </placeName> that secured
                        the absolute immunity of the Sultan and encouraged the continuance of his
                        repressive measures, while he might otherwise have yielded to the mandate of

                    <p>London, Tuesday Oct 24.</p>
                    <p>The "Berliner Tageblatt" gives great pro- minence to an article written by
                        Mustapha Pasha Kamel, Editor of "Al Lewa,” stating that three hundred
                        million Moslems, inspired by the same feelings and beliefs, will prove a
                        most powerful factor in international politics. Napoleon dreamed of becoming
                        the Emperor of the world of Islam ; A German Kaiser has the same ideas, and
                        his visits to to chief Moslem capitals prove his sympathy with the Moslem
                        faith and peoples.</p>
                    <p>From <placeName>Tangier</placeName> to Peking Mohamedans watch his career,
                        wondering if it can be really pos- ble that a Christian Emperor could become
                        the friend and patron of <placeName>Islam</placeName>. They feel grateful
                        for his attitude during the Armenian crisis; and his assurances of
                        friendship to Mo- hamedans daring his visit to Syria and
                            <placeName>Palestine</placeName> have created a genuine sympathy for
                            <placeName>Germany</placeName> among <placeName>Moslems</placeName>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Mustapha Pasha Kamel</persName> argues that it is grave mistake on
                        the part of <placeName>Germany</placeName> to watch the growth of British
                        influence in <placeName>Egypt</placeName> with indifference, and promises
                        the friendship of Islam to any European Power energetically opposing England
                        in Egypt. i Great surprise is manifested that the “Berliner Tageblatt” has
                        thought to publish this article, and the fact is regarded as a further
                        symptom of Germany's pin-pricking policy which may eventually reocil upon
                        her.</p>

                        said of the other hotels which are open. Several pensions have opened their
                        doors to tourists who are going to make lengthy stay. A very large number of
                        people arrived by the Norddentscher Lloyd Schleswig on Monday, and it was
                        found neces- ary to run a special train from Alexandria to
                            <placeName>Cairo</placeName> to accommodate them. Yesterday after- noon

                    <p>H.M.’s cruiser Terrible arrived here this afternoon at 2.40, flying the
                        pennant of <persName>Captain H.H. Campbell</persName>, who was second in
                        command to the <persName>Prince of Wales</persName> when his Royal Highness
                        commissioned the cruiser Crescent, and saw his last active service afloat
                        The Terrible looked very handsome as she steamed slowly, down the harbour to
                        buoy No. 7, where she was moored.</p>
                    <p>The Admiral despatch boat, H.M.S. Sur- prise, has also arrived and is moored
                        in the Dutch basin</p>
                    <p>H.M.S Powerful is expected in to-night with <persName>Lord Chas.
                            Beresford</persName> on board. It is expected that the Prince and
                        Princess of Wales will visit Navy House and the English Hospital on their
                        arrival here. The streets are filled with visitors and passengers from the
                        steamers.</p>

                    <p><persName>DR. LEIGH</persName> CANARY’S SCHEME</p>
                    <p><persName>Dr. Gallwey</persName> writes to the “Time.” from
                            <placeName>Simla</placeName> as follow. Sir,—In The Times of August 22,
                        1905, there is a leading article dealing with the important Subject of
                        “Armies and Enteric Fever,” and calling attention to the part <persName>Dr.
                            Leigh Canney</persName> has taken to endeavouring to remove this great
                        cause of Army ineffificiency both in peace and war, at the same time throw-
                        ing the blame on the military or other anthori- ties for not carrying out
                        the complete aid proposes to prevent enteric fever in any British Force,
                        because a method of protection, advocated by one man based on his advisory
                        administration and experience gained, in con- nexion with camps formed for
                        the construction of the <placeName>Nile Dam</placeName> at
                            <placeName>Assousn</placeName>, is not forthwith adopted. </p>
                    <p>It is stated that the most obvious applica- tions of science are treated
                        with, absolute neglect by the War Office. As a medical officer of the Army I
                        have always taken a deep interest to the prevention of the disease, and
                        especially now that I occupy the important paring of Principal Medical
                        Officer of His Majesty’s Forces to Indie, and before going on with the
                        principal object of this letter it would perhaps be well to explain shortly
                        the sanitary organisation of the Army in this country. At Army headquarters,
                        and the headquarters of commands divisions, and brigades, there are sanitary
                        officers with laboratories. In each station there are two sanitary officers,
                        one for the cantonment generally, and one for the civil population living to
                        and about the bazaars; a cantonment committee assembles , monthly, and
                        oftener if necessary, to discuss sanitary and other matters, both sanitary
                        officers being members of the committee. In every unit has a medical officer
                        specially detailed to look after its sauitation. It will be seen from this
                        that the sanitary personnel and equipment is on a sound footing, and since
                        the establishment of this schema now in existence about four years, it is
                        claimed that the health efficiency of the Army has been much increased. One
                        of the most recent ap- pointments created is an “Inspector of Heath
                        Efficiency," whose duty it is to teach men personal hygiene, and to bring up
                        to a healthy level those who through ignorance or laziness lower the
                        activity of the Army to this respect</p>
                    <p>With this scientific machinery at our, dis- pposal we have been successful in
                        reducing the admissions to hospital, the time spent-in hospital, and the
                        death rate, Until today we have the healthiest army in India since 1882. But
                        while this progress has been going On in the prevention of disease, the
                        great stumbling-block in our way has been and is enteric fever.</p>
                    <p>It is needless to remark that with such success already gained in the field
                        of pre- ventive measures this disease has not been lost sight of.</p>
                    <p>We have tried numerous plans and system-, and the boiling of water advocated
                        by <persName>Dr. Canney</persName> to the oldest of one methods of pre-
                        vention, and is universally carried out wher- ever the water is under the
                        least suspicion, and always during an epidemic. </p>
                    <p>But during our close and continuous scien- tific investigation of this
                        disease in recent years it has been forcibly brought home to us all that
                        enteric is seldom waterborne in <placeName>India</placeName> (principally, I
                        think, owing to the flat nature of the country and the absence of sewers),
                        and therefore all our schemes for sterilisation of water by boiling or
                        otherwise have had no effect in controlling its inci- dence or stamping out
                        outbreaks.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Dr. Canney</persName> tries, In my opinion, to harmo- nise facts
                        with an ingenious theory To commence with, all bis scheme is based on the
                        success he himself claims to, have obtained by advising the boiling and
                        protec tion of drinking water for the forge popula- tion camped at
                            <placeName>Assouan</placeName> during the construc- tion of the dam. He
                        has forgotten to tell us where his statistics are to be found, and, what is
                        of much more importance for the advancement of sanitary science, he has
                        omit- ted to inform us what other measures he advised should be taken to
                        order to these long-standing camps free from disease. Apparently these
                        wonderful camps were the healthiest that ever existed all due to cooked
                        water.</p>
                    <p><persName>Dr. Canney</persName> has brought his extraordinary success to
                        notice only after the completion of the dam and the breaking up of the
                        camps. Surely such ideal sanitary administration should have been the school
                        of instruction for experts all the world over, and a visit there would hare
                        well repaid any trouble, but l am not aware that any such fool not even by
                        the sanitary experts of <placeName>Lower Egypt</placeName>.</p>
                    <p>But <persName>Dr. Canney</persName>, while proclaiming to the world his
                        phenomenal advisory powers, has committed the grave error from a public
                        point of view of concealing important consideration which I will now bring
                        to notice, and which I think will show that his scheme is not laid on very
                        secure foundations. I have served many years in
                        <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, and it is well known that the natives of the
                        country, also of <placeName>India</placeName> and the tropics generally,
                        suffer very little in adult life from enterie. It is notorious also that the
                        Southern races of <placeName>Europe</placeName>,
                            <placeName>Italians</placeName>, <placeName>Greek</placeName> &amp; more
                        especially those who have resided some time in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>,
                        are also practically immune in adult life, owing to the fact that they live
                        in insanitary surroundings during infancy and childhood, and probably suffer
                        from the disease during this period and so acquire immunity As all events,
                        their infantile death-rates are appalling, which would lead one to suppose
                        the survivors are proof against filth disease.</p>
                    <p>These were the people, I assume, who formed the bulk of the population
                        inhabiting the Assouan camps, and it is not surprising under the
                        circumstances that they were free from enteric fever. It would have been
                        difficult to give it to them. Another consideration worthy of notice is
                        that, if there, is one axiom more generally accepted in sanitation than
                        others, it is that long occupation of camps tend to make them unhealthy, at
                        all events for the British soldier, even if the strictest precautions are
                        taken.</p>
                    <p>I should have liked to pay a surprise inspec- tion when <persName>Dr.
                            Canney</persName>’s camps were in full swing. Of course I will be told
                        that no camps ever were like them in cleanliness, order, and discipline; but
                        I am afraid, now that they have been swept away, I cannot take this for
                        granted, looking to the population that had to be dealt with, and knowing
                        the extreme diffi- culty of maintaining health in peace time, to say nothing
                        of war, among disciplined troops in camp.</p>
                    <p>I assume, therefore, these Assouan camps ware not quite as perfect as they
                        might be, and if an immune population had not inhabited them, enteric fever
                        would have been with difficulty excluded from them.</p>
                    <p>Another point is, these camps were adjacent to the desert on one side and a
                        river on the other, the fiie air therefrom helping to a great extant to keep
                        up their reputed high level of health. Finally, the camps must have been-
                        almost totally evacuated daring the working hours of the day, thus assisting
                        their aeration and cleanliness.</p>
                    <p>This is all I have to say about <persName>Dr. Canney</persName> and
                            <placeName>Assouan</placeName>. In his pamphlet “Typhoid, the Destroyer
                        of Armies, and its Abolition,’' he appeals to ancient and modern history.. I
                        am unable to follow him in the former, but in the latter he instances the
                        Abyssinian, Suakin, and Ashanti campaigns as favoring his water theory,
                        because special measures had to be taken to provide water his Abyssinia and
                        Suakin, and in Ashanti the water was thought to be highly polluted,
                        therefore special pre- cautious were advised to be taken, with the result
                        (according to <persName>Dr. Canney</persName>) that there was a marked
                        absence of preventable disease These were short, sharp, decisive campaigns
                        on virgin soil and with almost continuous movement of all troops. In the
                        early stage- of war troops are comparatively free from zymotic affections;
                        then comes the middle stage of disease ; and finally the veteran im- munity
                        stage. These wars quoted by<persName> Dr. Canney</persName> were all
                        completed in their active stages well under six months In Ashanti- filters
                        were used, bat I doubt very mach if any extensive boiling operations
                        went.on, for there was no Royal Water Corps. Filters have been abolished in
                            <placeName>India</placeName>, because they were found to cultivate and
                        preserve the bacilli of disease.</p>
                    <p>Then, in his historical review we come to <placeName>South
                        Africa</placeName>, where 51,000 casualties, includ- ing over 7,000 deaths,
                        are attributed to con- taminated water. This statement of cause and effect
                        should make the British public sit up and force the authorities to adopt the
                        “water cure.”</p>
                    <p>From my experience in <placeName>South Africa</placeName>, and this opinion
                        has been strongly 'confirmed since, my arrival in
                            <placeName>India</placeName>, polluted water was not the main cause, it
                        was probably only a minor cause of the prevalence of enteric during the war.
                        I think we, are all agreed that you cannot get this disease unless the
                        bacillus is intro duced into the System by some means or other. Why, may I
                        ask, is water seized on as the chief vehicle this disease? It is because it
                        is a necessity of life, taken freely, and omnipresent. At
                            <placeName>Paardeberg</placeName> the Army na- turally camped near the
                        rim, and many imagine that this river water has the fons et origo of the
                        Bloemfontein epidemic. No matter how filthy the river was, no matter hew
                        contaminated with animal and human dead from Cronje’s laager, if it did not
                        contain the bacilli it could not give enteric. It is well known to
                        scientists that the enteric bacillus is very rarely found in water even
                        after pro- longed investigation, and that in polluted water its life is very
                        short, as tested by ex- periment. Why, therefore, pronounce water the
                        principle vehicle of the bacillus It is not its habitat, and it rapidly dies
                        in it. During the long hard fighting and bivoweck ing on the Tugela heights
                        away from the river, to drank filth/ water to my knowledge, in fact anything
                        they could get, for the water question was a very serious difficulty, there
                        was no enteric.</p>
                    <p>It pas only when, long after, they went into overcrowded camps and tents
                        after the relief of Ladysmith that the disease broke out in an epidemic
                        form.</p>
                    <p>Roberta's army at Bloemfontein and Buller’s army in Natal are parallel cases
                        in connexion with epidemic disease.</p>
                    <p>Enteric was not necessarily caused by the rivers at Paardeberg and Ladysmith,
                        but in my opinion by. the grime, dust, dirt of war, which harbour the
                        bacilli on the human being on his clothes, on his bedding, on his food,
                        &amp;, while the overcrowding of tents and ground — a necessity of war —
                        spreads the disease by contact and by lowering vitality. <persName>Dr.
                            Canney</persName> says bacilli have no geographical limits, but he does
                        not point out that in the densely populated tropics they are more numerous,
                        and, therefore; can gain access to the body by many more avenues than in
                        well organised sanitary town's in temperate climates, the immune spread
                        them, the exotic fresh arrivals are attacked. He harps on the Laissez boire
                        which results in typhoid, dysentery, diarrhea, and cholera, doubling sick
                        lists, swelling invaliding, blocking hospitals, em- barrassing the March and
                        reducing the fighting strength but he neglects to state that chloera, has
                        been pratically abolished and dysentery reduced, by improvements in
                        sanitation and the introduction of pure water supplies into stations in
                            <placeName>India</placeName>, while these measures, have had no effect
                        on the incidence of enteric fever,</p>
                    <p>The three years subsequent to the introduction of the universal system of
                        boiling of water are remarkable for an exceptional increase in the
                        prevalence of enteric fever, viz:- Admissions -1896, 1,795; 1897, 2,010;
                        1898, 2,375. All the sanitary authorities in <placeName>India</placeName>
                        are wrong if <persName>Dr. Canney</persName> is right.</p>
                    <p>We are the scientific workers, he is the armchair theorist. According to the
                        annual report for British troops in India for the year 1904, the only
                        stations where outbreaks are attributed to water are—(1) Mhow, where the
                        patients say they got it from swallowing water when bathing in the plunge
                        bath; (2) Kamptee, one case from drinking water from a nullah on a field
                        day; (3) Bereilly, one case from drinking dirty-water from a pitcher; and
                        (4) Wellington, where an outbreak of 17 cases was said to have been due to
                        contaminated er, wat but the bacillus was not found. These are all the
                        cases, out of a total of 1,384 occurring in- <placeName>India</placeName>
                        during 1904, which the medical officers of the Army put down as caused by
                        water. On the other hand, the following carriers of the bacilli and avenues
                        of attack have been strongly insisted on: the human host by personal contact
                        and ambulatory cases, latrines, dust, flies, milk, fruit, raw vegetables,
                        bazar supplies generally, hat specially sweet-meats and aerated waters ; in
                        abort almost everything but water. These are put down in order of
                        importance, and in endeavouring to reduce the incidence of the disease we
                        are noting in this sequence, by seeing to rigid isolation (of too sick,
                        suspicious canod pouts lessen taj: by disinfection (a proposal has recently
                        been made to allow the wood sanctioned for boiling, drinking water in
                        stations to be used for the sterilisation of excreta by boiling).; by
                        evacua- tion of barracks; and by the partial segrega- tion of regiments and
                        drafts freshly;) arrived in the country, in order to prevent dissemina- tion
                        of the disease from this this source, which has been found to be a fruitful
                        cause of its spread in stations.</p>
                    <p>In your leading article on <persName>Dr. Canney</persName>’s letter it is
                        stated that “germs, when received into water containing organic matter of
                        other kinds, are placed in circumstances highly conducive to their
                        indefinite increase and to toe conservation of their virulence." This is not
                        so. Typhoid bacilli live longer in sterile than unsterilised water, and
                        longer in steri- lised tap water than in sterilised sewage. In
                            <persName>Frankland</persName>’s experiments they fired 33 days in deep
                        well water, 19 days in Loch Katrine and three days in Thames water.</p>
                    <p>It is also stated as a matter of fact that polluted drinking water appears to
                        be the only cause of enteric which need seriously be dreaded or solicitously
                        guarded against.” I have already shown that our Indian ex- perience is dead
                        against tom, and in my opinion it has also been absoultely disproved by the
                        American can Commission who report on an outbreak, during the
                        Spanish-American war, in regiments using municipal water supplies, which
                        were decimated, while the municipalities themselves remained absolute- ly
                        free from the disease.</p>
                    <p>Finally your leading article dealt with the Japanese, stating that they have
                        applied <persName>Dr. Canney</persName>’s suggestions with complete suc-
                        cess. We have, I think, yet to learn the incidence of disease among the
                        troops of the Mikado, but their reputed relative freedom from preventible
                        disease can, I think, hardly be attributed to the so-called complete and
                        comprehensive scheme advocated by <persName>Dr. Canney</persName>. The
                        Japanese fought in a country somewhat similar and near to their own ; they
                        are pro- bably relatively immune, like all other Eastern races ; they are
                        fish and rice eaten, and as regards the physiological processes going on in
                        their digestion tracts they probably differ much from the meat eating,
                        gross-feeding, and alcohol drinking European; it is their custom to cook all
                        their food and water and baton in hot water ; they were successful, and
                        could choose their own ground (in my experience the healthiest sites are
                        tactically the best) > and finally they are an exceptionally clean race, and
                        do all they can to keep themselves fit, so great is their patriotism. Beyond
                        these natural conditions, customs, and attributes, I am informed on the very
                        best authority that the Japanese sanitary organic nation, about which we
                        have heard so much from <persName>Seaman Nurse McCaul</persName>,
                            <persName>Sir Frederick Treves</persName>, and others, is not in any way
                        in advance of that in the British Army. It appears that state- ments as
                        regards' high efficiency of foreign armies made by such authorities are
                        fully accepted, while nithing is restored from Army authorities without
                        great doubt and suspicion. I trust,' however, it will be gathered from this
                        letter that the cure of the health of armies is not such an easy thing it
                        leeks on paper, but one of the most difficult and complex of problems. The
                        men who have been in harness all their lives, striving strenuosly at all
                        times and in all places—many of the latter none too pleasant -to improve the
                        health to efficiency of the Army, are publicly denounced and held up to
                        ridicule at the bid of armchair theorists and trippers abroad.</p>
                    <p>I yield to no one in my anxiety to effect progress of the adoption of schemes
                        which will fit in With the whole organisation and administration of the
                        Forces, no matter from whom they emanate, but I cannot advocate a lopsided
                        arrangement like the Reyel Water Gone, which only proposes to stop a small
                        by- path on the many roads to enteric</p>
                    <p>Under existing circumstances the Army machine is becoming daily more complex
                        and expensive, and I do not think the present time favorable for the
                        organisation of a spe- cial sanitary corps with full disciplinary and
                        executive powers, and until the opportune moment arrives we must rest
                        content with the advisory sanitary system which I have sketched in this
                        letter (and which to a great extent will follow the Army into the field) and
                        the educa- tion of the Army in general sanitation and per- sonal hygiene. Do
                        what we can,. I am afraid We can never abolish enteric; which <persName>Dr.
                            Canney</persName> claims can be dond with his Royal Water Corps. I will
                        conclude by quoting a remark made to me in Egypt by a very shrewd foreigner,
                        who said “You English all die of enteric because you take too much violent
                        exercise.” Possibly there is something in this, and it may explain the
                        remarkable freedom from enteric of soldiers’ families to
                            <placeName>India</placeName>, who are presumably water-drinkers and are
                        exposed to precisely the same conditions as the men themselves, except that
                        they take life easy.</p>
                    <p>I may add to that I am not in favor of limit- ing exercise, as it is the
                        foundation of the British character, and interference with the development
                        of this cannot be seriously con- templated.</p>

                    <p>“TIMES.”</p>
                    <p>The American Government has already notified the release of the Russian ships
                        in- terned in its porta That action may serve to reassure oar own shippers
                        and insurers as to the operation of the newly ratified treaty. Though there
                        is as yet no official announce- ment on the subject, the prompt recognition
                        of a new order of things both by Japan and by the United States carries the
                        logiocal im- plication that the disabilities which existed on Saturday
                        disappeared yesterday. Oar fleet in Japanese waters contiunes to enjoy
                        unbounded popularity and to receive lavish hospitality. The fraternisation
                        of the men seems to be as complete as that of their officers, and the result
                        can only be beneficial alike to ourselves and our allies.</p>

                    <p>Japan is free from alarm, and the most reckless of adventurers would hesitate
                        to attack a country which, having proved itself so doughty a defender of its
                        rights, can now claim for them the additional protection of the greatest
                        naval Power in the world. These are the two considerations which have canned
                        all civilised countries to welcome the Anglo- Japanese Treaty as
                        pacificatory in aim, object, and essence. And Japan’s appreciation of this-
                        __the supreme merit of her agreement with England—:is being shown by the
                        splendid reception accorded to Admiral Noel’s squadron in Japanese waters.
                        In all the functions and speeches which are recorded there is an entire
                        absence of any note of arrogance or defiance ; the Japanese are proud of
                        their military and naval achievements, as they have every right to be, bat
                        they do not "crow" over their successes, as Powers with older claim! to
                        civili- sation have been known to do. The fleets of the allied Powers now
                        riding the waters of the Pacific in unquestioned superiority will never be
                        called upon to engage in a struggle for conquet and annexation.</p>

                    <p>It is right that Irving should lie beside those who have made the Empire, for
                        two reasons. First, as. an actor, as a public en- tertainer, he took a

                        character he represented. No man or woman could visit the Lyceum when he was

                    <p>I suppose nobody has now any doubt that Germany was trying by every means in

                        extended hand she must suffer the consquences. German emissaries acted upon
                        all classes of society in France. They acted upon the Stock Exchange by
                        hammering down French rentes. They acted also upon politicians. Tho editor

                        regiment at Nancy. Furthermore, a large order for ammunition was given to a

                    <p>THE RUSSO-JAPANESE TREATY RATIFIED.</p>
                    <p>The publication of the full text of the Russo- Japanese treaty definitely
                        clears up several points of interest which have hitherto been the subject of
                        divergent statements, and brings to light several points as to which there
                        has been up to the present little knowledge. Among such points may be
                        mentioned the concluding paragraph of Article II. regarding military
                        measures on the Russo-Korean frontier. Previous summaries of the treaty have
                        con- tained in Articles III. and VI. clauses pro- viding that the rights
                        acquired by private person or private enterprises (a term covering important
                        Russian concessions in Manchuria) should be respected. In the fall text
                        these clauses do not appear, possibly for the reason that their retention
                        would imply the exercise of sovereign rights in Manchuria on the part of
                            <placeName>Japan</placeName>.</p>
                    <p>In Article III. the deleted clause is super- seded by a declaration on the
                        part of Russia that none of the Russian concessions in Man- churia confer
                        any territorial advantage, impair Chinese sovereignty, or are inconsistent
                        with the principle of equal opportunity. On the Other hand, in Article V.,
                        which deals with the session to <placeName>Japan</placeName> of Russia’s
                        lease of the Port Arthur territory, a clause similar to those deleted in
                        Articles III. and VI., safeguarding "the proprietary rights’’ of R Brian
                        subjects, still stands.</p>
                    <p>In several of the articles recognition is made of the obligation of the two
                        contracting Powers to obtain China's, consent to the proposed
                        arrangements.</p>
                    <p>In Article VI., a clause included in two of previous versions to the effect
                        that both parties Are-at liberty to take any measures they please in the
                        expropriated (railway) territory does not appear, and Article VII. shows
                        that the restriction of the use of the railways in Manchuria to commeroial
                        and industrial pur- poses does not apply to the Japanese portion of the
                        Liao-Hing leased territory.</p>
                    <p>The concluding clause of Article IX., relating to the La Perouse and Tartary
                        Straits, is one of the points regarding which the most con- flicting
                        statements have at different times been published.</p>

                    <p>When in a secret not a secret t queries the Parisian. When it is a State
                        secret? We know this bat too well. Yet the term, State secret, should fill
                        the ordinary mortal with awe, com- mand respect of the journalist, and the
                        silence of those entrusted with the State secret. But nothing of tho kind ;
                        the present â€™ century Frenchmen will have no secret, he calls for above
                        board attitude and policy. Secrets are, however, of absolute necessity, a
                        useful gar- ment at all events, for a; on certain secrets being faithfully
                        kept depends the security of a country. Somehow or other, this cannot be
                        understood by some Frenchmen, who argue that there is in reality no such
                        thing as a State secret, for all secrets must come to light sooner or later.
                        The mere existence of a secret calls for its being revealed. Nature has
                        itsâ€™ secret; mankind, wishing to imitate Nature, creates secrets, but
                        these are always let out A strange argument, for sure, but which is deeply
                        rooted in the Gallic mind. What is the reason that the Latin race cannot
                        keep a secret t History shows us over and over again that such is the case.
                        Has Lombroso ever studied this point 1 if not, he should afford os
                        interesting reu arks thereon. Meantime, State secrets are being let loose
                        with alarming rapidity, much to the disgust of friendly Powers, and of all
                        honest, staunch Frenchmen. I shall add that those responsible for the
                        violating of State secrets are not ladies, nor are they military men, nor
                        journalists, but Government officials, Deputies, and Senators, each seeking
                        the friendship of the Powers, in view of the next Presidential election. A
                        deplorable custom in vogue with Latin statesman is that as soon as a
                        Minister or politician is ousted from his seat of office he at once applies
                        to a newspaper for a situation as "redacteur.â€ In this capacity he
                        furnishes as the paper with manuscript cotes carefully collected or
                        purloined during his term of office. It is evidently interesting reading,
                        sends op the circulation of the paper, but in many cases causes grave
                        trouble to the Government, which dare nut call on the ex-official to
                        restrain his ardour to open the eyes of the public, fearing that he will
                        â€œgo one better.â€ Few Latin politicians, from a Prime Minister to a
                        Prefect of Police, would consider their careers at a dose had they not
                        published their memoirs or cotes or souvenirs, or a reproduction of every
                        document which had been pat before them. 1 shall afford one instanceâ€” a
                        French Minister of Foreign Affairs, at present holding a high position on
                        one of the best known Parisian dailies. He is not afraid to sign his name to
                        leaders, if not to other dubious paragraphs. This same Minister has
                        sufficient ' materielâ€ up his sleeve to keep Europe lively for several
                        years, in particular those financial magnates interested in Russia and
                        Russian loans. The descendants of Naundorff invited their friends on Monday
                        to celebrate the anni- versary of Marie Antoinetteâ€™s death. The mass,
                        which was said ih- La Chapelle, Saint Denis, was red, â€œthe liturgioal
                        colour reserved fora martyr/â€™ as the invitation cards said. The chief
                        figure in tho celebration was Prince Jean de Boubrbon, who is called by bis
                        friends "Jean IU. of France.â€ With a large moustache, blue eyes, and a
                        good figure be looked like a cavalry officer. The characteristics of his
                        alleged Bourbon ancestors' certainly needed come looking for. On his right
                        hand was a charming little boy about six years old. The Naandorffists spoke
                        of him whisperingly as â€œthe Dauphin.â€ The mother of the Dauphin is the
                        daughter of a wine merchant in Lunel. Prince Jean, in claiming Bourbon
                        descent, through Naundorff, keeps alive the belief that Naundorff was the
                        son of Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette. The Prince was left penni- less and
                        almost starving by bis parents. He and his brother were adopted by a rich
                        Naon- dorffist, M. Cuillie, a wine merchant Jean learned the business of his
                        adopted father, and in doe time married Mile. Cuillie. Such was tho family
                        which played the chief part in the Red Mass yesterday. The priest prayed for
                        the speedy accession of Jean III. to the throne of France, and at the end of
                        it all Paris was moved in the same degree that Lon- don is moved when the
                        Jacobite League is good enough to decorate the statue of
                            <persName>Charles</persName> I. for the delectation of Londoners. The
                        Gil Biasâ publishes a telegram from Madrid, stating that a French detective
                        officer, who with two officers of the Madrid police force has been told off
                        to watch travellers and merchandise arriving in the Spanish ca- pital from
                        Catalonia, has discovered a cle- verly-laid plot against King Alfonse and
                        President Lourbet, which, it is' believed, was to have been carried oat ,
                        daring the Presi- dintial visit. Last Friday, the telegram continues, the
                        officers keeping observation remarked that an unusual number of boxes of
                        cut, Flowers had arrived from Barcelona. Their surpicicions were aroused,
                        and on examination they found that each box contained from five to seven
                        packets of dynamite concealed among the flowers. A man to whom two of the
                        boxes were addressed was arrested. All the Boxes were addressed either to
                        trades- men, in different populous quarters, or to persons in poor
                        circumstances, to whom Flowers would be a luxury,â€ Long ago M. Brieux
                        said: "If Irving came to the Comedie Francaise he would be accaim- ed as a
                        god.â€ Most Parisians only knew Sir Henry by his reputation, but, with that
                        in- stinctive sympathy that belongs to all artistio ' people, they sorrow
                        for him at this hour as if he belonged to France. Irving, like Sarah
                        Bernhardt, seems to be part of our common civilisation and to belong to no
                        country. <persName>Jules Claretie</persName>, the cultivated director of the
                        â€œCo- mldie,â€ knew him personally. He has written of him in the
                        â€œTemps"â€”an article charming, and touching, even, to those who knew the
                        intimate Irving. He speaks of him as a perfect gentleman, a "lettr,â€ and a
                        great actor. Every one of his Preach friends seems to have felt the
                        magnetism of Irvingâ€”that peculiarly radiant welcome that he gave to men of
                        his beloved art from whichever side of the Channel they came. The great
                        tragedian came frequently to Paris, but always incognito, if an expression
                        belonging to Royalty may be given to the kings of art Quietly he would sit
                        in a â€œfan- touil. dâ€™orchestreâ€ in one of the half-dozen houses that
                        pioneer French drama, noting with that subtle intellectuality of his the
                        play of the actor and, at the same time, the "trucsâ€ of the stage. Had he
                        been induced to cross the Channel with his company to give Parisians his
                        incomparable Hamlet or his impersonation in â€œThe Bells," he would have
                        found the keenest and most critical audience in the world, enthusiastic, as
                        Brieux says above, to the point of hero-worship. But he is dead, and Paris
                        will never hear him. Nevertheless, his memory is cherished by at least one
                        great Parisian artist, also a veteran in his art. It is Victories Sardon,
                        who, hale and hearty, still maintains a golden activity. Sardon wrote
                        Robespierre" and â€œDanteâ€ for Irving. He never saw him on tho stage, but
                        the letters that came from the Lyceum, signed by the actor knight, were
                        models of courtesy and keen artistic appreciation. There is no Frenchman who
                        would not have rejoiced in the appreciation. There is no Frenchman who would
                        not have rejoiced in the great actorâs incarnation df Napoleon in Madame
                        Sans- Gene..</p>
                    <p>The tragic death of your great actor has created a profound-feeling of regret
                        throughout the French artistic world, where he was looked upon as the
                        English Talma. With all due respect to the British theatrical community, it
                        may be said that Irving was a much greater actor than Englishmen gave him
                        credit for. Much of his extraordinary genius passed unob- served by his
                        countrymen, but was fully recognised by the Frenchman. He was looked upon by
                        the societaires of the â€œFrancaisâ€ as the greatest living actor, as the
                        worthy suc- cessor of the immortal Talma. When Irving was created a knight
                        it surprised many Englishmen, but not the French. His mag- nificent career,
                        his glorious death, will hold a prominent place in the annals of stage
                        history, says his greatest admirer, M. Mou- net-Sully, who speaks of Irving
                        as the great tragedian, the incomparable comedian.â€ Admirers of Whistler,
                        and they are legion, will not fail to pay a prolonged visit to the Salon
                        d'Automne. Nine hundred pictures are exhibited out of 4,000 submitted to the
                        jury. Retrospective art is admirably represented by Ingres and Mane*, while
                        the Impressionist show a strong front with Renoer, Cezanne, Raffaeli, and
                        Carriere. Exhibits by the younger generation present inequalities naturally,
                        ne- vertheless, the â€œtoilesâ€ signed Charles Guerin, Soi, Maurice
                        Gurfroult, Vuillard, Desvalliire, Bonnard, and Sternberg-Davids may be
                        regard- ed as chefs dâ€™ceuvre, affording striking evi- dence of their
                        paintersâ€™ efforts to seek careful composition and fine harmony. The work
                        of Mr. Lavery, an Englishman, comes in for a deal of deserved attention. The
                        French medical world is bitterly com- plaining that trade was never so bad
                        and com- petition so keen, with the result that many medical gentlemen, to
                        avoid starvation, have had to don a white top hat a yellow took out a whip,
                        and drove a cab. Others see their few patients leaving them, disappearing as
                        if by magic. Matters have reached each a point that a congress has been
                        summoned for April, 1906, to discuss what measures should be taken for the
                        suppression of the medical world microbe, alias, the quack doctor. This
                        party within the last few years has grown in- solent in the extreme. He
                        defies doctor and justice, and rules the patient The impudence of some of
                        these quack doctors is such that they style themselves Professor at the
                        Faculty of Medicine, or Physician to the French Re- public I Some change
                        their names to Brouardel or Dieulafoy, or Noux ! But the ordinary quack
                        doctor is satisfied with filling three columns with his advertisement
                        recommending his infallible cure. Matters have reached a climax
                        necessitating protection of the weak of body and mind against these
                        impostors. -Will your medical board be represented at this Congress? America
                        surely will not, as natives from that continent reach Europe either as
                        colonel, or professor, or doctor, or â€œtout ensemble.â€ âm dead," remarked
                        an elderly lady to an official in Paris to whom she had gone for advice
                        regarding her identity, and she polled forth from her pocket documents to
                        prove that, so for as the law was concerned, she has joined the silent
                        majority, and had no more concern with the material things of the world. The
                        official, fancying from the extraordinary nature of her explanation that the
                        lady most be a lunatic, and possibly a dangerous one, was about to ring the
                        tell for assistance when he realized that what she said was the truth. Sort
                        enough, there was a paper setting forth that a woman bearing the very name
                        that she had given had died in the month of January. After this document had
                        been duly perused by the official, another, which conveyed fall proof of the
                        identity of the lady, was produced, and it was followed by others, which
                        left no possible doubt as to hie truth of her statement "So you see that I
                        am legally dead,â€ she remarked, â€œthough I am talking to you here, and in
                        the best of health. Then she went on to relate, that her husband, who was a
                        retired officer, had deserted her about five years ago. He died in August,
                        and when she went to the Prefecture of the Seine to apply for the boon of
                        the man- agement of a newspaper kiosque as the widow of a retired officer,
                        she was informed, to her otter amazement, that she was potting in a false
                        claim, as she had predeceased her husband in January. Inquiry led to the
                        discovery that her flighty husband had taken np with another lady, who had
                        herself died at the beginning of this year. The retired officer had passed
                        this person off ai his lawful spouse, and when she died had given the name
                        of his real wife to the authori- ties. The mat er is considerably
                        complicated by the fact that the latter knows absolutely nothing about the
                        woman who took her place. But she is bound to persevere, as until she
                        succeeds she will remain dead in the eyes of the law. Saturday night
                        "specialsâ€ announced in bold type that â€œNoovelle Zelaude bat North-
                        umberland par 31 points a rienâ€â€”news which created little surprise in
                        the French football community, who are seriously thinking of inviting the
                        team to Paris â€œto get a licking.â€ The football craze has rapidly spread
                        over France, and so keen is the interest displayed in that game that every
                        paper of any standing is bound to give latest results of important matches
                        in Great Britain. It is, indeed, inte- resting to hear the young Parisians,
                        in lycee uniform, or in blouse, gravely discussing the strong points of the

                        witness spirited contests ; now and again honored by the presence of a

                        supplied by Dr. Williamsâ€™ Pink Pills for Pale People. We quote the word of
                        Mr. H. D. Lloyd, of Foel- bach farm, near Corwen, North Wales:. "Many months
                        ago I became very weak and ill, after feeling â€œrun downâ€ For a long time
                        I had to' give np work. I had terrible pains in the stomach and some- times
                        vomited blood. Doctors said I was suffer- ing from gastric catarrh but
                        though I consulted three, my state of health was most serious. I touched
                        scarcely food, for my stomach was too weak to digest it, and attempts to eat
                        were followed by intense pains. My face became haggard and I lost weight,
                        while my weak- ness increased. Not until August last did I find a real and
                        permanent cure. Then I read of a case like mine being oared by Dr. Wil-
                        liamsâ€™ Pink Pills, and I gave them a trial. After two boxes of the pills I
                        felt better in every way. I continued them, and my strength re turned. I
                        could digest food and enjoy it More than that I was able to resume work. I
                        should add that my sister was oared of rheumatism by Dr. Williamsâ€™ Pink
                        Pills.â€ For men whose vitality is low, and women languishing from anaemia,
                        Dr. Williamsâ€™ Pink Pills are unrivalled. They make rich red blood and
                        fortify the nerves. They have cured also indigestion, Bile, Kidney Disease,
                        Rheuma- tism, Paralysis, Locomotor Ataxy, and ladiesâ€™ ailments. Of all

                    <p>BEYOND THE VEIL. ARCHDEACON AND THE WORLD OF SPIRITS. Archdeacon Colley,
                        rector of Stockton, bear Rugby, will have made a sensation at the Church
                        Congress, at Weymouth by moving the appointment of a committee
                        representative of the Established Church to inquire into pey- chical
                        phenomena. Archdescon Colley has embodied his spirit- ualistic experiences
                        of thirty-three year in an address, which is to be published in three in an
                        guages, and which is based upon a diary in which he has recorded carefully
                        various super- natural visitations. â€œMy object,â€ said Archdeacon Colley
                        in an interview with an â€œExpressâ€™â€™ representative recently, â€œis to
                        explain what I hold strongly â€”that there is scientific proof of life
                        beyond the grave. â€œReligionists say that we want no proof, but I wish to
                        show that it is a truth that does not depend upon belief, article or creed,
                        bat on proof positive-ocular, auditory, and tangible â€”that these spirit
                        people of whom I speak have been seen, heard, and touched by me. â€œI give
                        dates for all the ciroumstances, and chapter and verse.â€ </p>
                </div>
                <div type="item">
                    <p>FACTS IN SUPPORT.</p>
                    <p>In one instance the archdeacon avers that he and four friends were sitting
                        with a medium when the form of a little child was discerned on the medium's
                        left. The child was seen in the fall gaslight, ported her month to receive
                        kisses, spoke, and, on the instructions of the medium, fetched articles from
                        different parts of the room. Eventually an ornament on the mantlepiece was
                        indicated. As the little girl went forward the fire bis zed np with worthing
                        heat, and the drew back in alarm. Involuntarily the archdeacon asked :
                        â€œDid it burn you, my dear ?â€ and the reply came back through the medium.
                        â€œYes, I felt itâ€ Another spirit form called into realisation through a
                        medium was that of an Egyptian. He was tall, walked about the room, and fi-
                        nally sat by the side of the archdeacon, who examined h:m through a Stanhope
                        lent closely, observing the frontal ornament of the turban. As be passed his
                        fingers over it it seemed to melt away. Altogether the Egyptian remained
                        visible for an hour, and was induced under the in- fluence of the medium to
                        write on the back of Archdeacon Colleyâ€™s card. For this a pencil was
                        placed near him. </p>
                </div>
                <div type="item">
                    <p>COPTIC WRITING.</p>
                    <p>Subsequently the card was forwarded to the authorities of the British Museum,
                        and the writing was identified as Coptic Facsimiles have been prepared,
                        which the archdeacon was to produce at the congress. </p>
                    <p>The archdeacon assigns the wedding, which took place last July between his
                        son, Lieute- nant Colley, and an Irish girl, to a recent visitation. While
                        paying a chance call in London Lien- tenant Colley was told that a lady
                        wished to i see him. He was confronted with a medium, a total stranger, who
                        told him that the spirit of his dead mother wished to communicate with him.
                        A message in a faint voice was dictated by the spirit through the medium,
                        the meaning of which was beyond the lieutenantâ€™s com- prehension.
                        Presently another and strange spirit spoke and delivered a message, which
                        proved after- wards to concern a lady in Ireland. Again the first spirit
                        spoke and intimated that the stranger was the mother of the lieute- nantâ€™s
                        future wife, and that his marriage had been arranged. Quite sceptically the
                        officer informed his father of his amazing experience, and the archdeacon
                        understood the first message as a reference to an incident of bis early
                        married life. </p>

                <div type="item">
                    <p>MET HIS BRIDE</p>
                    <p>Eventually while delivering tho message to the Irish lady, though still
                        incredulous, the lieutenant became acquainted with the girl, who became his
                        bride a little over two months ago. During a pastoral visitation Archdeacon
                        Colley came an row an instance only a short time ago, in which a widow who
                        was on her death- bed talked aloud for some time with, her hus- band, whose
                        spirit, she declared, was in the room. â€œI do not believe in pressing these
                        things before unbelievers," said the archdeacon â€œbecause life is too short
                        for controversy, and, as someone has said controversy equalises wise men and
                        fools. â€œWhat I have learnt I have learnt by ex- perience and patient
                        experiment, and by con- stant fasting. I have not been afraid to imperil
                        assertions in favor of spiritualistic beliefs. It has been borne in upon me
                        that I ought to speak, and I shall not cease to claim that these
                        manifestations should be received as being just as credible as Bible
                        incidents, in which an go's appeared to men. There are many things which
                        mast be left to the scientists rather than the Church. I am ready to be
                        cross examined, and I want inquiry to be made.â€ </p>
                    <p>Archdeacon Colley graduated at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1869. He has been

                    <p>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</p>
                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
                        vitality—vigour--</p>
                    <p>VITAL STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY</p>
                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night
                        succeeds the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the
                        celebrated life-reviving tonic</p>
                    <p>THERAPION No.3</p>
                    <p>than by any other known combination. So surely as it is taken in accordance
                        with the printed directions accompanying it, will the shattered health be
                        restored,</p>
                    <p>THE EXPIRING LAMP OF LIFE LIGHTED UP AFRESH,</p>
                    <p>and a new existence imparted in place of what had so lately seemed worn-out,
                        "used up,” and valueless. This wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and
                        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative
                        essence, which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had
