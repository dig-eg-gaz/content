                    <head>PORT ARTHUR.</head>
                    <p>The fall of Port Arthur brings to a close the first greet phase of the war in
                        the Par East, a phase that has been prolonged beyond all calculations by
                        Stoessel's obstinate and heroic resistance. The temptation to moralise is
                        almost irresistible. The ignomi- nious end of the great squadron of the
                        Pacific, the gradual crumbling of tho almost im- pregnable fortifications
                        are in themselves both a sermon on the vanity of human wishes, and an
                        illustration of what foresight and organisation can achieve when united to
                        discipline, to oourage, and to patriotism. But the practical and strategical
                        lemons to be learnednom this long siege ere of even greater interest to us
                        as a maritime Power, and they deserve to be studied the more caretully be-
                        cause of th' erroneous deductions to which the catastrophe of Port Arthur
                        may give rise. Because the valour of the Kussian soldiers sad sailors has
                        been in vain, and because the Russian Empire has suffered a humiliation to
                        which the capture of Sebastopol was as nothing,<cb n="6"/> it has been
                        suggested by some authorities, end especially by the military correspondent
                        of the Times, that fortifications are themselves a delusion and a snare,
                        that the harbour of Port Arthur has been like a fatal magnet to the ships of
                        the squadron, and that Kuropstkin should have begun his campaign by
                        withdraw- ing every man and every movable gun from the Liao-tang Peninsula.
                        In other words, Port Arthur is claimed to have been what Metz actually was,
                        and what Ladysmith nearly became—a fatal entanglement, engulfing its own
                        garrison, and finally compromising the forces outside of it by robbing them
                        of the power of initiative. Had Stdessel got the gar- rison away while the
                        railway was unout, had Stark or Makaroff sailed off with the remnants of
                        their fleet, the abandonment of Port Arthur itself; the enormous lost ot
                        material, and the blow to Russian prestige, would have been more than
                        compensated for by the freedom which it would have given to Kuropatkin from
                        his first arrival on the scene.</p>
                    <p>Such an inference and such a teaching are, in our judgment, not only wrong,
                        but highly dangerous, as tending to discredit the value of naval bases end
                        garrisons to a maritime Power alike in peace and in war. They ignore the
                        faot that the misfortunes of the Russian Fleet have been due solely and
                        entirely to its own in- efficiency and to the incapacity of those who
                        directed its movements. The ruin dates from the first night of the war, when
                        the Japanese torpedo-boats were allowed to work their will, end it was
                        completed by the reluotanoe and inability of the blockaded squadron to give
                        battle to the adversary in open water. If the Russian Fleet had been bandied
                        as the fleet of a first-class Power ought to be, and as every country has a
                        right to expect from its naval officers, Port Arthur would have been an
                        absolutely invaluable asset to Russia during the war, and the march of the
                        Japanese armies on Manchuria would have been definitely delayed. A glance at
                        the map shows that Port Arthur is an ideal "point d'appui" for any nation at
                        war with Japan; and its importance can best be realised by the pro- digious
                        sacrifices which the latter Power has undergone during the process of
                        reducing it. Nor does it seem to be realised how much the prolongation of
                        the siege has actually affected the course of the campaign ; to say nothing
                        of the fearful loss of men, which will be felt more and more as the war
                        drags, it deprived the Japanese of the superiority in numbers which would
                        have turned the battle of Liao-yang into another Leipaic. And it has so
                        absolutely absorbed the energies of Admiral Togo that he has been unable-to
                        spare a single ship from his fleet of observation, even when the cruisers of
                        Skrydloff were ravaging in the home waters of Japan. Had the Baltic Fleet
                        been able to sail in the early summer, as Captain Mahan anticipated, the
                        Japanese com- mander would have found himself in the presence of a dilemma
                        which might well have proved fatal.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, the supreme importance of a well- fortified and well-garrisoned naval
                        base has never been so dearly indicated, unless we go beck to the siege of
                        Gibraltar in 1779-83. And the conclusion to ourselves ought to be
                        irresistible. Our own naval bases, to say nothing of minor ooaling stations,
                        are scattered over every see, and their retention at all ooists is the prioe
                        of our existence as a naval Power. Gibraltar, Malta, Siqaimanlt, Halifax,
                        Ber- muda, Singapore, Houg Kong, not to mention others, have each their own
                        port to play in any scheme of Imperial defence. They do not all require the
                        same sort of protection. Ber- muda, for instanoe, surrounded by its shoal
                        water, and guarded by its mine-fields, needs a garrison rather then big
                        guns. Halifax, with its rampart of the Atlantic surges, is practioally
                        immune from a torpedo flotilla. But they all have to be defended, if we are
                        to retain the power of sending our fleets securely from one part of the
                        globe to another, and it is essential that, one and all, they must be able
                        to guard themselves and their priceless stores of coal and material without
                        dependence on the Fleet.</p>

                                <p>The concensus of opinion in diplomatic circles is that the fall
                                    of Port Arthur will only be a fresh incentive to renew the
                                    struggle more ' vigorously. Russia will not spare any efforts to
                                    recapture it, or compel its submission in- directly. The only
                                    reservation in this opinion is the internal condition of Russia,
                                    which is the dominant factor of the situation. (R.)</p>

                        <p>The performance in Cairo of "The Pirates of Penzance" has been postponed,
                            owing to the temporary absence of Lieut. Franklin, the musical director,
                            in Khartoum-. It will now probably take place about the third week in
                            February. The respite is appreciated by the members of the troupe, as it
                            was felt that the time allotted to the rehearsals in the first instance
                            was somewhat short. The delay will afford Major Delavoye more scope for
                            the development of stage effects, and the performance will thus be as
                            finished from a dramatic as from a musical point of view—a requirement

                    <p>The event of the Fall semester closing exercises of Assiout Training College
                        was the contest between the Forum and Kiddonian Literary Societies. The
                        representatives of the two societies, elected some months ago, contest- ed
                        for honors in declamation, oration, and debate. The Kiddonian society won
                        the oration and the debate, giving them five points out of six. The subjects
                        of the two orations were "The Power of Oratory" and "Woman's Power and
                        Influence." 'The question for debate was "Resolved, that a final victory for
                        Japan would be more beneficial to the world than a final victory for
                        Russia."</p>
                    <p>A feature of the occasion was the music, vocal and instrumental, furnished by
                        local talent, assisted by Miss Dysart of Cairo. The singing of the college
                        glee club was thoroughly enjoyed by all, and showed a great advance over
                        anything the club has given in public heretofore. </p>
                    <p>A large number of the English-speaking community of Assiout were present,as
                        the exercises were all in English. Every one was ready to congratulate the
                        two societies and the college upon the great improvement in composition and
                        style and delivery which was shown by the contest, since the orations and
                        debate were entirely original productions by the students, with practically
                        no changes made by the teachers. The two societies meet regularly each week,
                        the results of careful drill and experience were quite manifest.</p>
                    <p>The college has enjoyed a very prosperous session, with an attendance of 550
                        students. A large new dining- room is being erected for the better
                        accommodation of the boarding department. The staff of instructors now
                        numbers twenty-three regular teachers, even of whom are Americans. A
                        valuable addition to the corps was made this Fall, in the college savings
                        secured Miss Strutters, recently of Boston, for instruction in art and
                        penmanship, and Miss Moore, of Pennsylvania, as matron. </p>

                    <p>The imports during the month kept up their usual rate of increase, which has
                        been such a noticeable featereof this year's customs returns. During
                        November there was an increase of L.K. 794,898 over the figures for the cor-
                        responding month lest year. Last November the imports amounted to L.E.
                        2,447,129, as against LE 1,653,231 in November, 1903. If December's imports
                        showed a similar power of expansion the total imports for the year will show
                        an increase of close upon L.R 4,000,000 over last year. Up to the end of
                        November the imports amounted to L.R 18,140,838, as against L.R 15,038,399,
                        an increase of LE. 8,107,439. The total exports during these eleven months
                        amount to L.E. 18,201,952, an increase of L.R 1,705,341 over and above the
                        figures for the corresponding period in 1903. The exports for November
                        amounted to L.E. 8,666,967, a decrease of Li 884,857 on November lest year.
                        This falling off is mainly to cotton exports, which decreased to value to
                        the extent of LE 284,589, and cotton seed exports, which decreased by LE
                        76,482 com- pared with the figures for the previous November.</p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN GOLD DEMAND.</head>
                    <p>The Statist understands that the Egyptian demand for gold is practically
                        satisfied, which is entirely contrary to the general anticipa- tion. For
                        some years past Egypt has been taking larger and larger amounts, and has
                        been sending back less and less. It was gene- rally supposed that she would
                        do the same this past year. As a matter of fact, she has taken exceptionally
                        little.</p>
                    <p>The general explanation given is that Egyptian capitalists have been buying
                        Egyp- tian bonds and Egyptian securities of all sorts in the London market
                        upon a very large scale—upon so large a scale, in fact, that to all intents
                        and purposes their purchases have counterbalanced the amount due to Egypt on
                        account of her exports.</p>
                    <p>If the explanation be correct, it is interest- ing from two points of view:
                        firstly, from the evidence it affords of the growth of wealth in Egypt. In
                        all countries which have debts held in large amounts abroad, the natives
                        begin to buy back those debts as soon as they advance in prosperity. Egypt,
                        apparently, is doing this now. In the second place, it relieves the London
                        market from one drain for gold. True, gold shipments after the turn of the
                        year will not cause as much inconvenience as they would have caused during
                        the past two or three months. Still it is well that the demand for the metal
                        for abroad should decline.</p>

                    <head>THE TAWIL FAILURE</head>
                    <p>It has been decided to have a liquidation "a l'amiable" to the case of the
                        failure of Mr. Selim TawiL Messrs. Gorrs, Sofio, and Deb- bane have been
                        appointed liquidators.</p>
                    <p>It is estimated that the assets of Mr. Selim Tawil amount to LE 750,000 and
                        the liabi- lities to LE 700,000. Even if this estimate is not correct it is
                        thought that the liabilities will be sufficiently covered or even at the
                        lowest estimate a dividend of 90 per cent, will be declared.</p>

                    <head>ZIZINIA THEATRE. "ADRIANA LECOUVREUR."</head>
                    <p>There was a large house at the Zizinia on Saturday and again last night to
                        witness the performance of Maestro Cilea's new opera, which met with a huge
                        success. Signs. Angelica Pandolfini's interpretation of the title role was
                        one deserving of the highest commendation. Her singing and acting were
                        imbued with a great degree of originality and intelligence, and her
                        rendering of the death scene was admirable. Signa. A. Pandolfinl was ably
                        supported by Sig. Bravi, who mde an excellent Count de Saxe. Tho baritone
                        Nani, in the role of Michonnet, also scored a distinct success. Sig.
                        Galetti-Gianoli, as Prince de Bouillon, Signi. Sals, Foglia, and Rossini
                        were also at their best. The "mise en scene" was as good as ever and the
                        orchestra to fine form.</p>

                    <head>"STRIKE" AT THE VERDI. DEPARTURE OF THE ARTISTES.</head>
                    <p>The strike of the artistes of the Verdi Theatre, Cairo, has terminated to a
                        most un- satisfactory manner the majority of the com- pany having announced
                        their determination to return to Italy as soon as possible and having
                        refused to accept the modified terms offered by the management. In our
                        opinion, they have had every reason to feel aggrieved at their treatment
                        both by the direction and the Cairo public. The company was a vary strong
                        one, containing artistes of really superior quality to any we have recently
                        heard at the Khedivial Opera House, but none the less they failed almost
                        entirely to attract the steady attendance of the music loving public.
                        Certain performances drew large audiences, but in the main the results were
                        disappointing to the extreme.</p>
                    <p>We attribute this to part to the want of sufficient advertisement, and to the
                        methods of the ticket-office, which were not always as courteous as might be
                        wished, but the blame lies mainly on the public, who were very ready to
                        applaud a performance given last night for the benefit of the artistes who
                        are leaving Egypt, bot never gave them that continued support which would
                        have made their departure unnecessary. Last night's per- formance was very
                        successful. It consisted of the 3rd act of Aida, which was excellently
                        perform- ed, acts from Traviata and Trovatore, the Danza delle Ore from
                        Gioconda, and the fourth act of Otello. The artistes were all at their best
                        and we must again express our regret at the debacle so excellent a
                        company.</p>

                    <head>KHEDIVIAL AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY</head>
                    <p>The following correspondence passed between the Minister of Finance and the
                        President of the Khedivial Agricultural Society with regard to the new
                        constitution of the latter;-</p>
                    <p>Sir,—Since the formation, to 1898, of the Khedivial Agricultural Society, in
                        which the Government took an active part, the interest shown by all classes
                        of the community to the agricultural development of the country has largely
                        increased. The various measures adopt- ed by the society—such as the
                        organization of shows, the distribution of seed and manure, and the
                        publicity given to kindred subjects through the medium of the Society's
                        journal- have given a stimulus to all matters relating to the cultivation of
                        the soil. Egypt being essentially an agricultural country, the general
                        welfare of the cultivator most always be an object of the utmost solicitude
                        to the Govern- ment, which during recent years has continued to aid the
                        Society both financially and otherwise.</p>
                    <p>From time to time, the desirability of creat- ing a Ministry of Agriculture
                        has been urged, but the Government is of opinion that, for the present at
                        all events, greater benefits will result from an extension of the work of
                        the Society on certain lines. The principal defect in the past has lain to
                        the fact that the central administration of the Society and the culti-
                        vators were not in touch. In considering any new scheme of development, this
                        point is one which should receive serious attention.</p>
                    <p>After a careful study of the existing Sta- tutes of the Society, the
                        Government has drafted, for the consideration of members, s series of
                        revised Statutes of which I have the honor to enclose a copy. This document
                        will be found to indicate generally the changes which, in the opinion of the
                        Government, it is advisable to introduce into the organization of the
                        Society.</p>
                    <p>It is suggested that, to accordance with Article 21 of the present Statutes,
                        a gene- ral meeting of members of the Society should be convoked, and that
                        the proposed changes should be submitted to them for approval. Should the
                        Statutes be adopted either to their entirety or with such modifications as
                        the So- ciety may consider desirable and as the Go- vernment may approve,
                        the Government is prepared to still further increase the annual subvention
                        now granted to the Society, to order that they may be put into force.</p>
                    <p>It is proposed that the Moudirieh Delega- tions to which reference is made to
                        Articles 13, 14 and 15 of the amended Statutes, should be substituted for
                        those now existing in the Moudirieh towns of Gharbieh, Sharkia and Minia.
                        Competent Secretaries for other Moudiriehs are not at present available, but
                        as opportunities occur a gradual extension will be made to this direction,
                        and the Govern- ment will, if necessary, consider the advisability of
                        proportionately increasing the subvention. In the meantime, the society may
                        engage students who have obtained their diplomas from the School of
                        Agriculture: and these gentlemen, being placed on the Society's experi-
                        mental farms, and allowed to participate in the general work, will, in the
                        course of a year or so, become competent to act as Secretaries to additional
                        Moudirieh Delegations.</p>
                    <p>The extension thus given to the work of ths society will necessitate the
                        appointment of an assistant to the present Secretary, as well as that of a
                        paid Accountant in the office. To meet this increase of expenditure, as well
                        as to provide for the three Moudirieh Delegations to which allusion is made
                        above, the Govern- ment is prepared to grant a sum of LE 3,000 annually to
                        addition to the subvention now accorded.</p>
                    <p>The question of the establishment of a Statistical bureau, for the collection
                        of infor- motion relating to crop areas and general agricultural returns, to
                        which the Society is greatly interested, is at present occupying the
                        attention of the Government</p>
                    <p>The Government will be glad to learn in due course the result of tho
                        deliberations or mem- bers, in order that the proposed changes, if adopted,
                        may be put into force from January 1st, 1905.</p>
                    <p>I am to add that the Government would view with pleasure the election of Your
                        High- ness as President of the Society and also of the Executive and General
                        Committees ; of HH. Prince Ibrahim Pasha Hilmy and of H.E. Riaz Pasha as

                        the Executive Com- mittee. The Government would suggest the nomination of
                        Mr. G. P. Fosden, the present Secretary of the society, as Secretary
                        General</p>

                    <p>Excellency,</p>
                    <p>I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 841, dated 23rd
                        November, 1904, containing the changes which the Go- vernment deems
                        advisable to introduce into the Administration of the Society. This letter,
                        together with the proposed new Statutes of the Society which accompanied it,
                        formed the subject of deliberation at a meeting of our General Committee
                        held under my presidency on December 3rd last The changes proposed were
                        received with great satisfaction by the Society, and the Statutes, with the
                        exception of one or two minor changes which the society thinks will render
                        them more perfect, and which, under cover and separate letter I have
                        communicated to your Excellency for considera- tion by the Government, were
                        unanimously adopted.</p>
                    <p>In accordance with the request contained to your Excellency's letter, and in
                        conformity with Art 21 of the existing Statutes of the Society, a general
                        meeting of members was held on December 6th last at which the members
                        cordially approved of the changes proposed<cb n="6"/> and confirmed the
                        decisions taken by the Com- mittee of the Society at its meeting of the 3rd
                        inst. The society feels assured that the steps taken by the government to
                        increase its sphere of usefulness will result in a much greater interest
                        being taken in its work by agricultur- its generally. Through the medium of
                        the proposed Moudirieh Delegations, the steps taken by the society to aid
                        cultivators in a practical manner will receive greater publicity and the
                        society feels assured that greater ad- vantage will be taken of them. </p>
                    <p>The members of the society view with great pleasure the continued interest
                        which the Government takes in its work, and it is a great pleasure for me,
                        as president of the society, to be the interpreter of the cordial votes and
                        thanks which were passed at the meetings over which I had the honor to
                        preside.</p>

                    <byline>(From a Correspondent.)</byline>
                    <p>A branch of the S. P. C. A. waa started in <placeName>Mansourah</placeName>
                        about three months ago. Over 70 horses having benefited from it during that
                        period, it waa thought better that the society should build stables of their
                        own. A bazaar was insdtnted by the Moudir of Dakfthlinh and Mr. Murdoch to
                        provide the necessary funds. By the Unrinn** ol the Russian Consul and Mrs.
                        Orris, this bazaar waa held on December 30 in the beautilul Maison Orris.
                        The grnuuda wopj also thrown open and looked lovely with Bowers and orange
                        trees in full fruit; the drive was magnifiuently decorated with Turkish
                        flags, Venetian masts draped in red and white, and garlands of iruit and
                        ever- greens. A native band was in attendance to herald tho approach of
                        visitors.</p>
                    <p>In tho drawing-room there were threo large stalls very prettily decorated
                        with the Turkish colours. At No. 1 <persName>Mrs. Murdoch</persName> and
                            <persName>Mme Diab</persName> presided, assisted by <persName>Miss.
                            Warner</persName>. Mu. 2 was in charge ot Mrs. Carr, Mme. Bouchanti, and
                        Mine. Kyutlywkos, assisted by Miss Smith. Miss bald superintended the large
                        bran pie. Mrs. Smith gave an excellent tea tu the delightful colonnade in
                        trout of the house, and she was assisted by <persName>Miss
                        Spring</persName></p>
                    <p>Lotteries formed one of the special features of the bazaar. Tue prizes, mauy
                        of which were solid silver, were all on view on the 3rd stall. Amongst other
                        things on the stalls we noticed some handsome bronzes, cushions, hand-
                        painted glass vases, ducks, tea- cloths, and a large assortment of dulls
                        dressed in various costumes.</p>
                    <p><persName>Mrs. Carr</persName> gave a very good gnunaphone entertainment in
                        the dining-room to the harem ladies in the morning, and <persName>Mr.
                            Carr</persName> took her place in the alternuou. We noticed amongst the
                        native ladies who visited the bazaar in the morning <persName>Sitt Bamba
                            Goriah</persName>, <persName> Sitt Hafiz</persName> and <persName>Sitt

                    <p>Shortly after two o'dock the Moudir an- nounced the bazaar open in a
                        felicitous speech, and told those present he hoped their purses would be so
                        light when they left that they would not have sufficient money left to hire
                        a carriage to go home. Amongst those present were <persName>Mr. and Mrs.
                            Murdoch</persName>, the latter in a charming pink gown trimmed with
                        black lace and a black and white toque; <persName>Mrs. and Miss

                        others.</p>
                    <p>The sales commenced in earnest and soon the stalU began to look less crowded.
                        In the evening an auction of all the articles that were left was most ably

                    <head>WHO IS RESPONSIBLE ?</head>
                    <p>Some mouths ago an important arehmological discovery was made at
                            <placeName>Aboukir</placeName>, on' the site of what is popularly
                        supposed to be that of tho ancient <placeName>Canopus</placeName>, when tho
                        temple of Aniooi Aphrodite, which Ptolemy Phiedelphus erected at tho
                        Zephirion fore- lard, was discovered. It has been a subject of discussion as
                        to whother tho temple was erected in honor of Senpia or of Aphrodite, but at
                        any rate it it a discovery of great interest and importance, and the remains
                        of the temple that were found in the spring were considerable, while the
                        mosaic pavements were most artistic and elaborate. We announced in May that
                        negotiation* had begun betwoen the Alexandria Arcboological Society and
                        Prinoo Omar Pasha Touasouu, on whose lauds the ruins are situated, and that
                        it was expected that systematic researches would he taken b baud shortly.
                        The Alexandria Museum autho- rities at tho same time issued a note on the
                        temple wherein it waa stated that</p>
                    <p>"Le mfodnatisine du prince, son amour pour U science et pour U dignitd

                    <p>But, as is usually the case in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, the official
                        authorities did absolutely nothing. The Museum authorities and the members
                        ol that moribund institution, the Alexandria Archeological Society, wore
                        evidently at that time far more concerned in making plans as to their summer
                        holidays in Europe, than in taking any thought as to the wonderful disoovery
                        of the long-hidden temple. When we visited the temple last May, the exposed
                        por- tions of the newly-feond sanctuary ot Aphro- dite were most
                        interesting. The mosaic pave- ments were in an excellent state of preserva-
                        tion and tho charming designs were as fresh then, alter two thousand yean,
                        as they were wheu Canopus was still the most renowned watering place b the
                        Eastern Mediterranean, seooud only to Bain b all the ancient world.</p>
                    <p>Among the mauy other newly-discovered sites was a catacomb, which was very
                        like the catacomb in the <placeName>Antoniadis Garden</placeName> at Alex-
                        andria. Access to it was by a flight of steps and it was b a very fair state
                        ot preservation. The whole neighbourhood ot tho temple afforded a uuique
                        held lor excavations, oud by the judi- cious ciuploymeut of a small sum ot
                        money it ouuld have been tuaue one of tho "show places'' ot Alexandria. But
                        since it was discovered nothing has been done, and instead of endea- vouring
                        to preserve these relics of the past, somebody has been guilty ot permitting
                        acts ot tho grossest vandalism. We visited the site ol the temple of Anehud
                        Aphrodite, or the sanc- tuary of Senpia, on Saturday lost, and the contrast
                        between the state of the remains thenand b last May was appalling, for the
                        tew months that had elapsed since our lorrner visit had sufficed to work
                        irreparable ruin. Tho rains had brought down a consi- derable amount of
                        sedimentary deposit upon the moeaio pavements, mauy ot which are utterly
                        obliterated, while their coffipuneui ports have been loosened or destroyed
                        by exposure to the damp and winter weather. Two spots b the immediate
                        neighbourhood of the temple, where in May last there were some interesting
                        remains, had evidently been utilised as quarries, and stacks of stone showed
                        that these relics of antiquity hod been used for obtaining buildbg material.
                        We searched lor any signs of the beaulifqj catacombs, but on tho site we
                        found that all traces had been destroyed, and a gang ot workmen were busily
                        employed in rumiug every evi- dence of antiquity which was a likely object
                        for using for buildbg.</p>
                    <p>Does the site belong to <persName>Prince Omar </persName>Pasha Tousaoun, and
                        are these workmen, who were so employed, under his Highness's orders and b
                        his payt What, then, do the authorities of the Alexandria Museum mean by
                        referring to "le Mecenatisme du Prince," when <persName>Prince
                            Dinar</persName> can permit such vandalism on hi* estate. It ■ is absurd
                        to appeal to the Alexandria Archeological 8odety, for it lacks energy and
                        initiative, and although some of its members are amiable dilletaute, it is
                        destitute of any "go." What can be thought of an archioological society that
                        has never movod a finger to excavate or protect the unique remains at tho
                        ancient Tapcsiris, which are only a few miles from Alexandria f Is it more
                        likely that it will exert itself to protect the vestiges of Canopus from
                        destruction t The present condition of the rubs on the old Zephirion
                        foreland as compared with their state last May is sufficient proof of the
                        inutility of the society.</p>
                    <p>About a fortnight ago the society decided "to do something" b reference to
                        the discoveries at Canopus with a view to transporting the relice of the
                        temple to Alexandria. On the instigation of Poilay Bey, the Wekil of Prince
                        Omar Pasha Tousaoun, the matter was brought to the notice of the society,
                        and it was do cided by them that an estimate should be made as to the
                        expenses. But irreparable damage has been done, and while the society is
                        framing estimates the remains are being destroyed as fast as possible.</p>

                    <head>REPLY BY <persName>SIR THEODORE ANGIER</persName>.</head>
                    <head>( From The Standard. )</head>
                    <p>Keen interest continues to be taken b the suggestion that a competing
                        waterway should be cut through tho Isthmus ot Suez. 'There is no doubt that
                        the agitation for lower rate*, especially for cargo steamers, has a
                        considerable becking. The whole matter is one which is boing very froely
                        discussed both at Uoyd'a and tho Baltic, the centre of the shipping
                        business. The interview which our Paris Dor respondent had with <persName>M.
                            Bonnet</persName> was read yes- terday with interest.</p>
                    <p>Referring to a statement by one of the English directors of the Suez Canal,
                            <persName>Sir Theodore Angier</persName> said to a Press representa-
                        tive—"He is quite oorrect b what he says, except iu stating that shipowners
                        sought to evade regulations. Shipowners built ships with increased
                        superstructures because it im- proved the type ot ship b safety and the
                        comfort of tho crews. In these superstructure* cargo is sometimes carriedJ
                        and when this is the cose owners are and always have been agreed that dues
                        are fairly and properly charged. But tho Board suddenly made a change b
                        their custom hitherto, and now insist on charging dues on the tonnage of
                        these spaces wheu no cargo is carried b tkem. This is the uulaitness
                        complained of as far as tonnage is oouoerned, besides the breach of the 1883
                        agreement, and the lax servioe of the British shipowners on the Board."</p>
                    <p>Speaking of the former agitation. Sir Theo- dore said .—"It is quite true
                        that no conces- sion was actually made, but an under*tandbg existed ; and,
                        with regard to the monopolist character of the Suez Canal Concession, the
                        best lawyers of the day gave their opinion that it did not exist.
                            <persName>Mr. Gladstone's</persName> view of the subject was entirely
                        contradicted. The director you quote is quite oorrect, so far as ho goes ;
                        but no atientiuu is paid to the fact that the present policy i* a reversal
                        of the previous ono. Because cargo has once been carried, we are uow to pay
                        for it always. It is most unfair that shipowners should be mulcted b this
                        way simply because they have improved their vessels.</p>
                    <p>"I go further," went on Sir Theodore," and declare that the original bases on
                        which the dues are charged were must unfair. 'These terms were never blended
                        to nerve lor all time, lor oUauges were bouud to supervene owing to
                        variatiuus ui trade, customs, and other matters. VV by should they want a
                        special agreement ou the Canal wheu b no otoer institution of a similar kind
                        is it required 1 There are thousands and thousands of ducks, riven, quay*
                        and too like, which gob their revenue by taxing the tonnage of ships, and
                        nearly the whole of these enterprises have agreed to take a fair registry,
                        that of Lloyd's. In the laoe of that moss ol due leviere, the Suez Canal
                        people aay, 'We are monopolists ; we will do what we like.' They liave
                        aggravated the position after we agreed to this unlair arrangement, and let
                        it go on lor years, by, now that deok spaces have oume into vogue, chargbg
                        for them when ouce used for cargo. It is must unsatisfactory that the
                        British directors should have agreed to the change without communicating
                        with us.</p>
                    <p>"M. Bonnet talks about the agreement, but it was one duly accepted. 1 made no
                        sugges- tion that I was going to do anything, but I •want to make dear the
                        dissatisfaction of the British shipowner, and 1 think the points 1 brought
                        out are reasonable—namely, the way we are treated with regard to tonnage
                        dues, the way we are treated by the British repre- sentatives on tho Board,
                        and the breach of the London agreement of 1883 by the Company paying over 35
                        per cent, dividend with a rate at 8.50 francs per ton. 'The response we got
                        to our representations to tho Directors waa far from courteous, and
                        practically amounted to *Tako what you have got or leave it' But we are not
                        tho helpless creatures the Canal people think we are, and 1 believe that,
                        even by their own action, they are bringing about their own defeat Tho
                        result will bo that oxen if no other canal is out shipowners will alter
                        their style of vessel, and will build those which, while they oould not pay
                        going through the Canal, will do so if sent round the Cape, 1 coonotconceive
                        that any Government would object to a seooud canal, for, by increasing the
                        fecilities for traffic, it would be all in the in- terests of trade."</p>

                    <p>The London Earning Standard says that the directors of the Hamburg-American
                        Com- pany have issued a statement explaining their views b regard to the
                        question of a seoond Suez Canal.</p>
                    <p>In this statement, <persName>Herr Baffin</persName> and hia ool- leagues
                        reiterate and emphasise the accusations of mismanagement already brought
                        against the Sues Canal Company. They mention in parti- cular the refusal of
                        the oompany to devote the surplus of dividends exceeding 25 per oent, to a
                        reduction of the Canal dues, as required by the London programme of 1883,
                        and the enforcement of oertab antiquated regula- tion* adopted at the
                        Constantinople Con- ference of 1878, relating to the dues for spaces on deck
                        available for cargo.</p>
                    <p>The statement of the Hamburg-American Company, which may be regarded as the
                        manifesto of the opposition to the Suez Canal Company, concludes-</p>
                    <p>" The management of the Suez Canal is sneb that it exasperates the whole
                        shipping world. If the present agitation b favor of a seoond canal result* b
                        the redaction of the toll* ol the existing canal, the shipping trade with
                        the Par East will be greatly Oeilitated. After .the ooooluloa of the war
                        between Russia and Japan there will be gnat opportunities for developing the
                        trade with Par Eastern coun- tries.</p>
                    <p>If; however, the Suez Canal oontbuea to be managed as at present, both
                        Russia, with the TranaBiborian Railway (the efficiency of which has been
                        greatly increased by the war), and America, with her direct sea route, will
                        be far more fevonbly situated than tho European countries whose way lice

                    <p>California Syrup of Figs is the one remedy which doctors fully recognise as
