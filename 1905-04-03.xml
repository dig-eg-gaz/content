                        her interests in Morocco not on the basis of a disregard for the interests
                        of others, but rather that her interests and those of the other Powers
                        should he in harmony. The Mediterranean Powers have recognised that France,
                        owing to her position in Algeria, must occupy a special position in Morocco.
                        It might be legitimately hoped that France, without infringing any rights or
                        interests, would succeed in- assuring her influence in the western

                        every year more fashionable. It was believed that this hotel was a “drag” on

                        <p>BY SIR WILLIAM WILLCOCKS.</p>
                        <p>“And it • came, to pass as they journeyed East, that they found a plain
                            in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.” This is the description of
                            one of the earliest settlements hi Mesopotamia, the country irri- gated
                            by the Euphrates and the Tigris, and constituting the true delta of the
                            two rivers. If it were necessary we could go back to the garden of Eden
                            of which the traditional site is occupied to-day by the palm groves of
                            Guma, the point of junction of the Euphrates and the Tigris, and from
                            where I have obtained a specimen of the soil and had it analysed. . No
                            irrigation engineer who has travelled through the ^country can have
                            tailed to have been struck by the great/difference between the delta of
                            the Nile on the one hand and the joint delta of the Euphrates and thh
                            Tigris on the other. The Nile is in Hood from August to October, the
                            turbid flood waters can be retain--, ed on the land in the historical
                            basins of Egypt, and discharged back into the falling river in November.
                            This, permits of the winter cultivation of the rich fields of wheat,
                            barley, beans, and clover. Such a system of irrigation is impossible in
                            Mesopotamia. The. rivers are in flood in March, April and May, while the
                            floods are followed by the burning and rainless months of June, July and
                            August, in which irrigation must' be practised if any crop is to be
                            brought to maturity. So that while Egypt was the home of basip
                            irrigation for thousands of years, Mesopotamia was the home of perennial
                            irrigation. This latter class of irrigation needs far ra'ore skill and
                            knowledge of hydraulics than basiii irrigation, and consequently one is
                            great'v struck by the remains of the ancient regulators arid irrigation
                            works whose ruins are to be,met with in the Euphrates valley, while
                            there are no remains of any such works in Egypt. ■The' basin system of
                            irrigation introduced by the ancient Egyptians was entirely in keep- ing
                            with the ancient structures of the type of the pyramids. It could defy
                            time and even defy neglect. It was on this account that it survived
                            every revolution and every trouble of many thousands of years ; while
                            its rival, the perennial irrigation \of the Euphrates valley, • fell
                            utterly into rain and decay. Of the Euphrates valley it was prophesied,
                            as could never have been prophesied of ancient Egypt, “And Babylon, the
                            glory of kingdoms, the beauty of ' the Chaldees’ excel- lency, shall not
                            be dwelt in from generation to generation.” Perennial irrigation is no
                            hardy plant like basin irrigation, it needs perpetual and constant
                            attention ; it is typical of the structures of Our days, the dams and
                            weirs on the Nile, which have accompanied the intro- duction of
                            perennial irrigation in Egypt, and which need observation and attention
                            to pre- serve' them iijrtact. Modern Egypt is not satis- fied with that
                            basin irrigation which has come down from the'- remotest antiquity, but
                            is conferring on the length and breadth of the Nile valley that
                            perennial irrigation which the Euphrates valley enjoyed dor thousands ot
                            years and which struck the imagination of every traveller who saw
                            Babylonia in the days of her glory. ,v Armed with experience of
                            perennial irriga- tion and sub-tfopicil agriculture, which lias been
                            gained in Iudii\and Egypt through thirty years of uninterrupted work as
                            an irrigator and agriculturist, I propose with • assurance the re
                            introduction of perennia irrigation into the historical' regions which
                            In around Babylon and Bagdad, Selucia and C.tesiphoii, arid Opis where
                            lay the head works of the greatest irrigation canals of antiquity. The
                            irrigation and high cultivation of ancient Babylonia Was a problem which
                            was mastered in its entirety by the Chaldean sages of old, hydraulic
                            engineers of no mean order ; the problem before us is no harder, and
                            modern science is sufficiently in advance of ancient science, to justify
                            the hope that the land will again become the garden of the East, and
                            thai we shall again see “men’travelling to the East and finding a'
                            resting place in the plains of Shinar.”</p>

                        <p>"As I lay thinking"</p>
                        <p>In the concluding portion of my remarks last week I spoke of the reasons
                            that so many people urge for restricting the study and practise of
                            occult gifts. Many good people who never think of denying their
                            existence attri- bute them to Satanic agency, and warn their friends
                            that it is all “the work of the devil.” Substitute “the spirit of evil”
                            for “the devil” (I need hardly say that I have no belief in a
                            personal-devil) and lam disposed to agree with much that is said as to
                            the undesirability of increasing facilities for the practice of such
                            gifts as clairvoyance, palmistry, hypnotism and the like. The knowledge
                            of. the existence of such is one thing, the exercise of them i§ another,
                            and it is not a -thing to be lightly attempted by tho°e who have only
                            acquired a superficial acquaintance with the subject. In saying this I
                            simply, give the result n many years! close" study of the matter from
                            every point of view from which it can be regatded, and knowing full Well
                            (as a correspon- dent reminded me in a letter to the editor the other
                            day) that “a little knowledge is a dangerous thing,” I certainly
                            recommend those who cannot give a lot of time and thought to
                            investigation of snch matters, to leave them alone as much as possible,
                            simply noting and thinking about such experiences out of the common as
                            may fall to their lot. By no means should these be ignored, and the why
                            and the wherefore should certainly be sought. And never should the
                            existence of such forces as I have spoken of, and many others ori which
                            I could dilate, be doubted. Some good people are giveu to assume that
                            things that are narrated in the Bible belong to ages long past, and
                            neVer occur now. And yet here in Egypt we see in the present day, at
                            every turn we take, manners, customs, and scenes faithfully reproducing
                            those described in the earlier books of the Bible, thousands of years
                            old. And when we read of Saul seeking to learn from the clairvoyance of
                            Samuel what had become of his father’s asses, what is there to
                            distinguish the incident from the practice so common now-a-days of
                            consulting a person gifted with “second- sight” (in like manner to
                            Samuel) and obtaining information equally correct on matters of
                            importance ? And why should the - modern magician be less able to call
                            up the shades of the departed than the Witch of Endor ? Bring common
                            sense to bear upon these questions and they will be found extremely
                            difficult to answer. Long before I gave such things serious attention,'
                            I read of a very gifted lady palmist in London, and as at the time I was
                            in a state of great perplexity Idetermined to haveaconsulta- tion, which
                            with some difficulty I obtained. My hand’showed that, at an age I was
                            fast, approaching, a crisis in my life-would take place. In what way.
                            this crisis would end was a question impossible to answer,, two entirely
                            opposite solutions being shown in the “life line ” The palmist confessed
                            herself unable to make any prediction on the point. In due time the
                            crisis arrived, but it was surmounted, and*, the more favorable reading
                            turned out to be the correct one, although I feel sure that the other
                            was . expected when my hand was read. Why was this ? Simply, I think,
                            because I exeroised my own free will, wd "the possession of this right
                            rendered a precise forecast a matter of impossibility. Probabilities,
                            yes 1 certainties, no 1. is the way I would sum up all attempts at
                            prediction, marvellously correct as many turn out to be. A few years
                            later I' again consulted a palmist. (I should say that on both occasions
                            fees were absolutely refused). I was then told hat a certain event would
                            happen in three years’ time, to be followed by results that were
                            foreshadowed with equal precision.^The event predicted took place two
                            years andteti months from the date of .the interview, and the results
                            followed in due course. But I firmly believe that in this matter also I
                            could have exerted my will in an opposite direction, and that only a
                            probable event was indicated after all. The possession of free will by
                            man may be a moot point; the facts I have stated are part of my own
                            experience, and prove to me .conclusively the possession of powers by
                            some that are far removed from charlatanry. And the fact that these
                            powers are frequently put to wrong purposes and assumed by im- posters
                            cannot blind the thinking mind to the fact of their existence. Now to
                            Carry my argument a step further. Is it to be assunied that these gifts
                            belong to the material body only and eease at the termination of
                            physical life 1 Few would an swer in the affirmative. Then if they
                            pereis- after the demise, of the mortal body what is to hinder their
                            beiDg exercised from the unseen, and the phenomena, of spiritualism be
                            he result ? And exercised they are, too, and with the increased power
                            that freedom from the limitations imposed by the earth life involves.
                            But may not earth life itself be divided . pto two portions, one of.
                            which is lived in- the physical body and the second after the .irave has
                            closed over the mortal remains? I am led to ask the question not from
                            any wish to broach a new theory evolved in my own mind from- an attempt
                            to reason the matter out, and devise a way out of some of the many
                            difficulties that con- tinually force themselves upon my mind, but from
                            practical experience, gained at what I know to have been considerable
                            risk to myself, but through which I have come scatheless, and with a
                            wealth of knowledge that I could not otherwise have possessed. Some day
                            I may perhaps publish these ex- periences, at present I will content
                            myself with stating the conclusions to which they have led me, and if I
                            have whetted my readers’ appetite for more, I will return to the subject
                            anon. The necessity tor com- pressing what I haye to say into a limited
                            space must be my apology .'for brevity. These conclusions may best be
                            stated by a, series of short propositions, some of them old as the hills
                            and widely accepted, others of such a character that until they are w$ll
                            thought over they look like the wanderings of a morbid and diseased
                            fancy, which I am free to admit is the guise in which they would have
                            present- ed themselves to me a few years back. They are however the
                            outcome of long, serious, and prayerful study, as well as of much
                            experience and observation of the various phases of human life, coupled
                            with earnest effort never relaxed to arrive at truth. Leaving entirely
                            out of consideration any question concerning what we are pleased to term
                            the lower world, and starting with man at his present stage of evolution
                            I would say in the first place,—That the conditions of this life are
                            such that while if mankind were in a perfect state of development the
                            earth life would be amply sufficient for its purpose to. be fully
                            achieved by alL As life is now lived this is impossible.—That myriads
                            pass into the unseen without ever having had a chance of learning its
                            lessons and gaining its experience. Ergo,—That the spark of Divine life
                            we all possess has had no chance of development in these cases—young
                            children, for instance, and these whose earthly career is out short in
                            an- untimely manner. That at what we term “death” a condition of life
                            commences which is practically a conti- nuation of earth life, and in
                            which opportuni- ties are afforded for the completion of the stage that
                            should have been reached on the earth, but which from various causes
                            became impos- sible there.</p>
                        <p>That from this stage many who have pre- pared themselves in earth life
                            for translation to higher spheres, quickly pass, while others, equally
                            advanced in mauy respects, are held back by their inability to sever the
                            ties of human affection and other earthly attractions; and are
                            consequently unable td progress so quickly; these latter being the
                            higher entities which communicate throngh mediums. That all, from the
                            very lowest and most degraded and ignorant of God’s ohildren remain in
                            this stage until they have found salvation, have received the new birth
                            and conquered the old lusts of the flesh. And finally and most important
                            of all,—That we on earth can largely contribute to the advancement of
                            these darkened - men and women by giving them our sympathies and
                            prayers.</p>
                        <p>A long course of stances held with this sole object in view has convinced
                            me of the practicability of this,—as well as the advisa- bility of
                            abstaining from entering upon such work without special qualifications
                            and train- ing.</p>
                        <p>But prayers for the departed) are daily becoming more and more common,
                            and would be even more general if the good they do could only be more
                            fully recognised. It is in this direction that mankind generally can do
                            immeasurable good to help those , who have gone on before, to the
                            progression awaiting' all sooner or later.</p>
                        <p>Rapid as is this survey of an interesting— nay engrossing— subjeot that I
                            could enlarge upon with the enthusiasm of one who thinks he has made a
                            great discovery, I have left much unsaid that ought to be Btated to make
                            my position perfectly\slear, and have left mysell little room to deal
                            with a matter that appears to me to be urgent and on .which I should
                            like to say a few words at once.</p>
                        <p>I allude to the disclosures of the Cor- respondent of the “Gazette” at
                            Assiout which appeared on Friday under the heading “Crime at Assiout.”
                            Anything more disgraceful than these disclosures I can hardly imagine,
                            nor caflf I believe that any one department of the internal affairs of
                            the country wants a greater overhauling than the administration of
                            justice in the rural districts.</p>
                        <p>That is of course presuming that the allega- tions are true. But perhaps
                            a very exceptional .tate of affaire prevails at Assiout, and in that ase
                            snch a state of things can be quiokly put an end to, in all
                            probability.</p>
                        <p>I think he might have taken his beating with a better grace than to
                            acouse me of want of politeness. A person who labels a scholarly work as
                            “A Queer Grammar” without just cause, should be the last to raise the
                            plea of politeness. In my letter, I was not exchanging courtesies with
                            hith, but dealing justice. The matter is not a personal, but a public
                            one. I am not surprised to hear that the reviewer is not foreign to the
                            Arabic tongue,” as the English of his letter shows only too clearly that
                            he is loreign to England and is probably better acquainted with bad
                            Arabio than with good English.</p>
                        <p>In thd circumstances, I am sorry if I have used any expression that may
                            have wounded his feelings, and the best compliment I' ««.n pay to him is
                            that the English of his original article was so passable that I was
                            deceived into thinking it was written by an English- man ; and 1
                            naturally resented the idea of. a countryman of my own commiting what 1
                            thought to be an injustice.</p>
                        <p>Now knowing the truth —as disclosed by the English of his letter — I can
                            only humbly apologise tor quite unintentionally trouncing the wrong man
                            ; but, at the same time, I must remind him, that there is a great
                            difference between knowing his native tongue (Alex andrian or Syrian
                            Arabic, I presume) an-.’ knowing the polite and cultured version of toe
                            same tongue.— Yours, Grammar i vn.</p>
                        <p>P.S.—I must thank “Abu Shad-iof' (whose letter I have just seen) for his
                            moral support, and congratulate him on the humour of his profound
                            researches in the Khedivial Library on Bacon’s "Antony and C eopatra,”
                            and the “congested” grammar of John Selden of 200 years ago. But when he
                            pours the cold water of his shadoof on all grammars as a class, and
                            suggests that they should all be sunk in the Assouan dam,—I humbly
                            suggest that his plan is not drastic enough. While we have languages, we
                            must have grammars ; and if the latter are a criminal offence, why then
                            should we not end the Babel which causes them, and sink all languages (
                            except English ) in the Mediterranean 1 It would be interesting to hear
                            native opinion upon this point.—G. Cairo, March 31, 1905.</p>
