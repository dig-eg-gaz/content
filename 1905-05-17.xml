                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased

                                <p>GERMANY IN THE FAR EAST. The very sensational news telegraphed
                                    from Tokio last evening by Reuter, to the effeot that a German
                                    force had occupied Hai-chu, situated on an extensive bay to the
                                    northward of the old channel of the Hong-Ho, is, we are glad to
                                    see, officially denied from Berlin to-day. Had the very
                                    improbable occurrence actually taken place, it would have been
                                    difficult to foresee the results to which it would have led.
                                    Where there is smoke, however, there is fire, and in the
                                    immediate future we can foresee, not only that German policy
                                    will be directed might and main to placing obstacles in the way
                                    of Japanese success, but alas that when the settlement oomea, it
                                    will strive at all hazard to prevent what the Emperor considers
                                    dangerous aggrandisement of the destined foe of Christ- endom.
                                    That William II. recognises so warmly tho admirable qualities of
                                    those whom he regards as a “soourge of God” adds to the perils
                                    of the international situation. The revival of the spirit in
                                    whioh the Crusaders faced the Paynims will be a new and
                                    troubling element in the comfortable world of to-day. The
                                    remarkable speech delivered by the Bmperor William to the
                                    reornits sworn in at Wilhelmshaven on March 9th, and only now
                                    reported, however, gives some food for reflec tion on the under
                                    currents which really direct i he situation. The treatment
                                    received by the Japaneee at the hands of the neutral Powers of
                                    the Continent has been so exceptional that it has always
                                    appeared as though the military freemasonry which controls the
                                    oonnoils of those Powers was unable to oonceive that a branch of
                                    the Yellow Raoe could be inoluded within the pale of
                                    civilisation; that,despite the perfec- tion of their naval and
                                    military organisation, the Japanese were, after all, only
                                    regarded as Dervishes with a scientific education.</p>

                                    great need which many think exists for the establishment of

                                    readers that this ques- tion was mooted in our columns a few
                                    months ago, at the time that attention was direoted to it by the
                                    lamented death ot a promising young Englishman from small-pox,
                                    contracted while convalescent from fever at one of onr
                                    hospitals, Nothing, however, has resalted from the
                                    oorrespondenoe that took place, and no steps have, as far as we
                                    are aware, been taken, even in the direction of the
                                    establishment of an international isolation hospital for the
                                    treatment of contagions diseases, a matter which seemed to be at
                                    the time, and impresses ns still, as being one of urgenoy. It
                                    stands, how- ever, quite apart from the question of tho

                            accompanying the notices of the meeting, and to put before the public in
                            the issue of the 6th inst of the "Egyptian Gazette," that his task vraa
                            greatly simplified, and it was rendered unnecessary for him to offer
                            more than a few observations. The clearance of the Sphinx from its en-
                            cumbrance of sand, said Mr. Covington, could not fail to commend itself
                            to those who take an interest in the ancient monuments of Egypt, but
                            should also gain the approval and support of the thousands of tourists
                            who yearly visit this land, and who make at least one visit to the
                            Spliux. It would, he hoped, not only be a work of excavation but also of
                            exploration, and one from which important results from an Egyptological
                            point of view might reasonably be expected.</p>
                        <p>After making a few remarks on the project laid before the meeting Mr.
                            Covington drew attention to the plans and estimates which had been
                            prepared under the advice and direction of Mr. T. Favarger, an architect
                            who was well known in Egypt. According to these, the work, as originally
                            contemplated, revolved the excavation of 186,000 cubic metres of sand at
                            an estimated cost of some £4,000. A substantial saving, however, might
                            be effected by the modification of the original design in the manner
                            proposed in the project before the meeting. Mr. Covington then indicated
                            by references to the plans the nature of the sug- gested modifications.
                            He added that he had received assurances of financial support not only
                            in Egypt, but in the United States, where the project was regarded with
                            great interest. Judge Royle reminded the meeting that the present effort
                            would not be by any means the first attempt to rescue the Sphinx from
                            the encroaching sand. There had been at least three previous attempts,
                            the earliest dating back to the days of Thotmes IV., the second being
                            that made by Captain Caviglia in 1818, and the latest being the attempt
                            carried out about 20 j ears ago through the liberality, ho believed, of
                            a member of the Rothschild family. The present deplorable state of the
                            Sphinx showed that none of these efforts had been of lasting benefit It
                            was therefore satisfactory to find that the work now proposed was to be
                            as far as possible of a lasting character. With regard to the financing
                            of the enter- prise, he considered that there was no pro- bability of
                            the money required being raised in Egypt alone. A certain proportion
                            would no doubt be subscribed by the residents and visitors, but for the
                            bulk of the money it would be necessary to rely on the substantial aid
                            which Mr. Covington expected from the United States. Should this be
                            forthcoming be thought the project might be considered a feasible one.
                            After dwelling on different features of the scheme and the steps to be
                            taken to give it a practical form, Judge Royle concluded by say- ing
                            that to Lis knowledge Mr. Covington had devoted much time and labour to
                            the enter- prise and well deserved encouragement. Mr. Covington, in
                            reply to a question from the chairman as to the financial aspect of the
                            undertaking, mentioned the names of three institutions in the United
                            States from which assurances of support had been received. He estimated
                            the amount which would be forth- coming from these sources at from 8,000
                            to 10,000 dollars. He thought, however, that in return for this the
                            contributors would expect a share in the possible finds.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Covington's observations were followed by a discussion on the merits
                            of the project generally and the earns to be adopted to raise the
                            necessary funds. Yaoonb Pasha Artin sug- gested that the most practical
                            course would be for the meeting to appoint a committee of three persons
                            to whom should be left the deci- sion oi the various question* and the
                            necessary measures to be taken to carry out the object in view.</p>
                        <p>After a discussion as to the number of mem- bers to be on the committee,
                            Artin Pasha’s proposal was adopted, and Mr. Courtouay Clifton, Mr. Allan
                            Joseph, and Judge Royle were elected, and power was given to them to add
                            two others to their number if they deemed it advisable.</p>
                        <p>A vote of thanks was then accorded to Abbate Pasha for presiding at the
                            meeting and the proceedings terminated.</p>

                            satisfactory feelings, for it has been a record season, and during the
                            year that has just passed the company has had unprecedented suc- cess.
                            The company intend greatly improving their hotels in the coming year.
                            The acquisition of the 8abet Pasha estate will lead to many improvements
                            in regard to the Savoy Hotel. The restaurant at that hotel is to be
                            consider- ably enlarged and several fine suites of rooms will be built

                            and a separate entrance. This estate will also afford room for a large
                            garden for the hotel, which will be three thousand metres in extent The
                            company also intend to build on the land opposite the Savoy Hotel, now

                            will be very convenient for residents, as the locality is so central,
                            and they are to be constructed with all the latest improvements in modem

                            la Cour recommit avec la Societe de la Bourse que des tiers n’ont pas

                            -.— La societe de la Bourse tient ses droits de Goussio et d’lbrahim ;
                            elle est proprietaire de son immenb'e et la seule condition qui Ini ait
                            ete imposee dans le contrat de veuto est d'y installer une Bourse de
                            commerce, en atten- dant qne le Gouvernement ait pu fonder une Bourse
                            Offiriolle. Or, cette condition a ete fi le. lement remplie. Le public a
                            l’accfis et la jouis- sance necessaire k la libre circulation.Auoune
                            autre stipulation n’ayant ete formuiee quant k l’amenagement et aox
                            details d’installation,la Societe de la Bourse a parfaitement le droit
                            de oederun emplacement special kdes particuliers. Cette concession
                            n’implique auoune entrave k la liberte publique et n’empeche nullement
                            la concession d’autres emplacements k d’autres interasses. On le voit,
                            les clauses du contrat sont tontes sauvegardees et il ne results de la
                            concession vises auoun dommage pour le public.</p>
                        <p>En ce qui ooncerne l’Association des Cour- tiers, la demande, fftt-elle
                            recevable, est figale- rnent mal fondfie. Les reglements de 1’Associa-
                            tion laissent le courtage tout-k-fait libre, mais on ne pent refuser aux
                            courtiers associes le droit de se grouper sur nn point queloonque, libre
                            k d’antres groupes analogues et rivaux de se former. SaDs doute la
                            oorbeille existante fitant consaorfie par l’usage et par les habitudes
                            des boursiers sera une cause d’insuccks pour nne nouvelle cjrbeille.
                            Mais si ce fait entralne une diminution de profits pour les nouveanx
                            venus, il ne viole aucun de lours droits. Ce n‘est done pas k leors
                            concurrents que MM. Bostros doivent s’en prendre en cette occasion, mais
                            k l’absenoe d’une Bourse Officielle, dfl- ment rfiglementfie oh do
                            pareils d^savantages ne pourraient plus se produire.</p>

                    <p>AMERICAN TRADE IN EGYPT. VICE-CONSUL MORGAN’S REPORT. (Continued from
                        Saturday.) In compliance with the Department circular, I sent out a series
                        of questions to those dealing in American goods, and interviewed many, and I
                        give herewith a summary ot reports received and results of inquiries made
                        verbally on the commercial relations between the United States and Egypt:
                        (t) Are American manufacturers amenable to suggestions made from Egypt 1 The
                        general experience is that they are not, and that they rather resent
                        suggestions. This applies especially to the machinery trade.Uulike British
                        manufacturers, the Americans refuse to guarantee their goods, contenting
                        themselves by saying “the machines do the work we claim for them in this
                        country (the United States),” and then proceed to put idiomatic expressions
                        into their letters which are, in many cases, beyond the linguistic
                        attainments of the in- tending agent or purchaser. One manufacturer lost a
                        market for his "cultivators” owing to the springs carrying the body of the
                        machine not being strong enough to properly support the machine when
                        crossing the irrigation channels, with which all fields in Egypt are
                        intersected. In reply to the suggestion made to strengthen the springs, he
                        said that the machines were not made to “jump ditches.” 'These ditches are
                        rillets of but 3 or 3 inches deep. Suggestions as to "finish” of certain
                        wearing parts are as regularly scouted as they are made, as are also
                        suggestions about modi- fications to make the machines more adaptable to the
                        peculiar agricultural conditions of the country, the nature of the soil,
                        etc. British manufacturers have long had the reputation ot acting in
                        precisely a similar manner as that now attributed to Americans, but I have
                        it from a gentleman returned from the United States, which he visited for
                        the sole purpose of inducing manufacturers to introduce certain
                        modifications in their agricultural machinery which were essential to their
                        efficient working in Egypt, that he simply lost his time and money, and
                        returning east he offered his sug- gestions to a British manufacturer, who
                        at once took up the business. The purchaser is paying 30 per cent, more for
                        his machines, but he gets what he requires,and also the guarantee for
                        working efficiency, which the American manufacturers refuse. The coming
                        market in Egypt is that for machinery, and it is needless to point out that
                        all descriptions of machinery are referred to.</p>
                    <p>(2) Are orders sent direct to the manu- facturers or through European agents
                        1 It is seldom that any one repeats the ex- periment of sending a direct
                        order to the ; United States. The invariable rule is "cash 1 with order,"and
                        the general impression here is, that once he has the cash, the American
                        manu- facturer troubles himself little as to when or ' in what condition the
                        goods reach their destin- ation. Even where credit is given the bills ]
                        mature long before the arrival of the goods and the purchaser has
                        practically no remedy for loss owing to delays, broaching of cargo in ‘
                        transhipment, deterioration on voyage, and loss ' of a market demand, which,
                        meanwhile, has ‘ been satisfied from elsewhere. Fifty-two days 1 would, as a
                        rule, appear to be the quickest ( time in which a direct order from the
                        United 1 States might be completed by the arrival of \ the goods here. In
                        the case of perishable goods ' it would be safe to say that a second direct
                        1 order is never sent—as the buyer must risk 1 total loss—for it has
                        happened that consign- ments of an alimentary nature have arrived ' from the
                        United States in such condition that ' they have had to be destroyed by the
                        health authorities, and although the instances may be ' few, their effect is
                        very widespread.</p>
                    <p>In some instances orders sent direct to ' manufacturers in the United States
                        are sent by 1 the manufacturers to agents in Europe for execution as a
                        consequence of some arrange- ment for exclusive agencies being granted for
                        particular zones. The system gives rise to dissatisfaction here, but the
                        consequences to American trade are far more serious than would at first
                        appear. It is with no little trepidation that I transmit for the information
                        of American manufacturers the following, as, from my personal knowledge, I
                        cannot vouch for what is related to me as fact, but it is for those directly
                        interested to make the necessary i inquiries into the subject and see about
                        setting | their houses in order:</p>
                    <p>“'The system of filling orders through Con- tinental agencies is a gratuitous
                        indication as i to where a new market is springing up, and no j sooner has
                        an American article made its way | and created a demand than a cheap
                        imitation i produced elsewhere is thrown on the market, the cards and
                        packing being so gotten up that i the inexpert buyer sees no difference.”
                        The person from whom I obtained this in- i formation made no complaint about
                        the system. He really seemed to be amused at the idea that the Yankees,
                        considering themselves to "cute,” should not have detected what was going
                        on. It was a matter of indifference to him where the goods were produoed; he
                        supplied a demand and made his profits in doing so, and it was not his
                        afiair to suggest any change in the existing order of things.</p>

                        Assiout, May 13. The council of discipline for advocates gave judgment this
                        week striking the name of Mikhail Eff. Hanna Sarabanah off the roll of
                        advocates practising in the Native Tribunals. He was accused of having spent
                        £2 (which had been given to him by one of his clients for Court fees) for
                        his own purposes. He denied that be had received the money, but the fact was
                        proved by his own handwriting. He has appealed against the judgment</p>

                    <p>LETTERS to the editor. INFANT MORTALITY IN EGYPT. To ins Editor of the
                        Egyptian Gazette. Sir,—The recent correspondence in your columns must have
                        led many persons to believe that Egypt was the only country in which infants
                        were sacrificed to maternal ignorance or negligence, and that if Egyptian
                        mothers could be trained or coerced to bring up their off- spring in the
                        enlightened methods prevalent in other countries a vast wastage of infant
                        lives would be saved. As an Egyptian I had my doubts whether things were
                        really much worse in this respect in Egypt than in other countries, but as
                        our mentors were so positive in their statements, I hesitated to intervene
                        in the discussion. From the “Graphic” of April 15th I, however, cull the
                        following paragraph, which will I think show that there is room for
                        missionary work among mothers even in Eng- land. Perhaps it would be
                        advisable to print the paragraph in very small type, as I should be sorry to
                        shook any susceptibilities :— "Would that the mothers of the lower classes
                        could learn a little about the moral and physical natures of their
                        unfortunate little ones ! With all the boasted spread of educa- tion, the
                        mothers still feed their poor children on the most unsuitable food, still
                        forget that milk,and milk only, is the natural nourishment for babies, and
                        ic consequence, infant mortal- ity continues to increase in frightful
                        propor- tions. At an inquest held last week it was proved that a woman had
                        fed her baby on •boiley,' or ground biscuits, a food which the doctor
                        declared could not be digested by any child under twelve months old. Think
                        of the waste of life, the suffering, the expense entail- ed by this crass
                        ignorance of the most common maternal duty, and let us not brag or pride
                        ourselves on our system of education until the mothers of England have
                        ceased to murder their children by slow and deliberate starva- tion.” Yours,
                        etc., An Egyptian. Cairo, May 14.</p>
                    <p>PUMPS IN EGYPT. To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette. Sir,—Any discussion as
                        to the relative merits of pumps is perfectly useless when based on mere
                        assertions. The sole test is ooal consump- tion and water lifted.
                        Unfortunately, reliable figures do not exist, and to obtain them quite a
                        staff of trained men is needed to measure coal and water used by boilers,
                        read gauges, and take discharges and lift for water pumped ; all of Which
                        must be done simul- taneously and for a period of six hours on end. The
                        Government returns for Mex pumping station give the general results for the
                        year, but there are no figures which would be accepted by technical men as
                        conclusively establishing the relative efficiency of Farcot and Gwynne. Till
                        these figures can be pro- duced the pumps, in golfer’s phrase, are "Like as
                        they lie” and their respective advocates may lie as they like.—I am, eto.,

                    <p>SPORT AND PLAY. FOOTBALL. M. M. P. v. Inniskilling Corporals. For the fourth
                        time this season the above teams met at Abbassieh in a friendly enoounter on
                        Friday last. The match drew a large crowd of spectators. The police set the
                        ball in motion. For a time the exchanges were very eveD, each side attacking
                        in turn. Russell took a corner, the first of the match, but sent behind. A
                        second followed, but like the previous one, it went behind. This half was
                        greatly in favor of the boys, and they time after t:we pressed the police
                        custodian, but all to no avail as Broadhurst was in good form. A neat centre
                        by Russell looked well and Rafferty just missed the goal by inches. Oh the
                        kick-off the police attacked and good play by Carter ended in Hopkins
                        drawing first blood. Rafferty resumed operations and David- son had a run
                        all to himself and centred well. Rafferty had a pot at goal, the custodian
                        conceding a corner. In saving this was well taken, the goal being cleared
                        for a moment, but Rafferty found the ball at his feet a few yards out and
                        with an unsavable grounder made the scores equal Play after this became
                        even. The police now took play in hand and the outside left getting a timely
                        pass added number two. Excitement was at a great height just now. Rafieuy,
                        getting on a single-handed run, ran through all opposition and passed to
                        Davidson, who equalised the game onoe more. Aiken amused the spectators by
                        some fancy work. Edgar was now playing a good game and checked the left wing
                        time after time, play being somewhat exciting until Russell broke away, but
                        Wingate returned in grand style. From this until half-time play was of a
                        very even nature. Shortly after half- time was announced with the soore:
                        Corporals Inniskillings Abbassieh oontingent 2 goals.</p>
                    <p>Military Mounted Police 2 goals. After the usual interval both teams re-
                        sumed. The police at once assumed the aggressive. For sometime play was
                        within goal's range but Carter shot wide. On the cick-off Ciee got
                        possession and dodged a couple of opponents and gave to Russell, who sent a
                        smart grasshopper in to the cus- todian, who fell on the ball, but Wingate
                        managed to dear. Hopkins now showed to advantage and after dribbling the
                        ball well up he gave to Field, who was ruled off- side. Tho representatives
                        of Ireland now forced several corners, all to no purpose. The polioe
                        attacked the right wing. They however wore scut back by Behan, who was in
                        good form. The service oompauies now asserted themselves and Rafferty came
                        through all by himself, but he shot against the custodian and immediatdy
                        afterwards the ball hit the upright The police attacked in strong foroe but
                        Murray was not called upon. The Ab- bassieh contingent pulled themselves
                        together and forced two comers in quick succession, and although pressing
                        strongly they were unable to penetrate the M. M. P.’s defense. Broadwood was
                        asked after this to save from Davidson, which he did well Ireland now had a
                        spell of attacking, Rafferty putting in several nice cross-shots, each of
                        which the custodian saved in good style. The Inniskillings played the better
                        football, but there was little to chose between them in points of attack.
                        Cree and Russell were continually aggressive and forced another comer, which
                        came to nothing. The Inniskillings still pressed and another comer fell to
                        them, but to no purpose. The police now had an innings but did not stop
                        loDg, as Behan and Supple were playing a cool and steady game and returned,
                        lafferty who was playing a splendid game, got possession and led his
                        forwards away. Cree raced up the field and gave to Russell, who with a rapid
                        shot put his side ahead. Nothing further of any importance occurred up to
                        full time, the score being: Corporals Inniskillings Abbassieh Contin- gent 2
                        goals. Military Mounted Polioe 2 goals. M. A. Lyons officiated as
