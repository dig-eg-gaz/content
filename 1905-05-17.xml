                    <p>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</p>
                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased

                        <p>GERMANY IN THE FAR EAST. The very sensational news telegraphed from Tokio
                            last evening by Reuter, to the effeot that a German force had occupied
                            Hai-chu, situated on an extensive bay to the northward of the old
                            channel of the Hong-Ho, is, we are glad to see, officially denied from
                            Berlin to-day. Had the very improbable occurrence actually taken place,
                            it would have been difficult to foresee the results to which it would
                            have led. Where there is smoke, however, there is fire, and in the
                            immediate future we can foresee, not only that German policy will be
                            directed might and main to placing obstacles in the way of Japanese
                            success, but alas that when the settlement oomea, it will strive at all
                            hazard to prevent what the Emperor considers dangerous aggrandisement of
                            the destined foe of Christ- endom. That William II. recognises so warmly
                            tho admirable qualities of those whom he regards as a “soourge of God”
                            adds to the perils of the international situation. The revival of the
                            spirit in whioh the Crusaders faced the Paynims will be a new and
                            troubling element in the comfortable world of to-day. The remarkable
                            speech delivered by the Bmperor William to the reornits sworn in at
                            Wilhelmshaven on March 9th, and only now reported, however, gives some
                            food for reflec tion on the under currents which really direct i he
                            situation. The treatment received by the Japaneee at the hands of the
                            neutral Powers of the Continent has been so exceptional that it has
                            always appeared as though the military freemasonry which controls the
                            oonnoils of those Powers was unable to oonceive that a branch of the
                            Yellow Raoe could be inoluded within the pale of civilisation;
                            that,despite the perfec- tion of their naval and military organisation,
                            the Japanese were, after all, only regarded as Dervishes with a
                            scientific education.</p>

                        <p>THE NEED OF A BRITISH HOSPITAL. A correspondent writes to us suggesting
                            that we should invite expressions of opinion as o the great need which
                            many think exists for the establishment of either a British Cottage
                            Hospital or Naming Home in Alexandria, and the possibility and
                            advisability of taking steps in order to supply the want It will be
                            within the recollection of our readers that this ques- tion was mooted
                            in our columns a few months ago, at the time that attention was direoted
                            to it by the lamented death ot a promising young Englishman from
                            small-pox, contracted while convalescent from fever at one of onr
                            hospitals, Nothing, however, has resalted from the oorrespondenoe that
                            took place, and no steps have, as far as we are aware, been taken, even
                            in the direction of the establishment of an international isolation
                            hospital for the treatment of contagions diseases, a matter which seemed
                            to be at the time, and impresses ns still, as being one of urgenoy. It
                            stands, how- ever, quite apart from the question of tho establishment of
                            a purely British hospital, and that is the subject upon which we should
                            be glad to have the views of our readers. Every- body knows how
                            condnoive it is to recovery for a patient to be surrounded with
                            favorable conditions, and the feelings of contentment induced even in
                            the ooume of a painful illness by the knowledge that dootora, names, and
                            attendants are of one’s own nationality, are not considerations to be
                            dismissed as of trifling aooonnt We all like our suffering ones to have
                            every possible amelioration of their condition, and where such a
                            question as that of the establishment of a Cottage Hospital is concerned
                            perhaps funds would more readily flow for its erection, than for many
                            other purely national objects,—a club or library for instanoe. We leave
                            the matter for our readers’ consideration, and will will- ingly publish
                            any communications on the subject with which we may be favored.</p>

                        German Benedictines nre doing in the Holy Land. The speech follows the
                        article of the ,-Koelnisohe Zeitung” suggesting that the Vatican should make
                        approaches to Germany with a view to her assuming the place of France as

                        Dow Covington.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Abbate Pasha was unanimously voted to the Chair and after explaining in a
                        short speech the object of the meeting and the questions which would come
                        under discussion, called upon Mr. Dow Covington to address the meeting.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Covington, on rising, said that the project which meeting was called
                        together to consider was so fully set forth in the statements accompanying
                        the notices of the meeting, and to put before the public in the issue of the
                        6th inst of the "Egyptian Gazette," that his task vraa greatly simplified,
                        and it was rendered unnecessary for him to offer more than a few
                        observations. The clearance of the Sphinx from its en- cumbrance of sand,
                        said Mr. Covington, could not fail to commend itself to those who take an
                        interest in the ancient monuments of Egypt, but should also gain the
                        approval and support of the thousands of tourists who yearly visit this
                        land, and who make at least one visit to the Spliux. It would, he hoped, not
                        only be a work of excavation but also of exploration, and one from which
                        important results from an Egyptological point of view might reasonably be
                        expected.</p>
                    <p>After making a few remarks on the project laid before the meeting Mr.
                        Covington drew attention to the plans and estimates which had been prepared
                        under the advice and direction of Mr. T. Favarger, an architect who was well
                        known in Egypt. According to these, the work, as originally contemplated,
                        revolved the excavation of 186,000 cubic metres of sand at an estimated cost
                        of some £4,000. A substantial saving, however, might be effected by the
                        modification of the original design in the manner proposed in the project
                        before the meeting. Mr. Covington then indicated by references to the plans
                        the nature of the sug- gested modifications. He added that he had received
                        assurances of financial support not only in Egypt, but in the United States,
                        where the project was regarded with great interest. Judge Royle reminded the
                        meeting that the present effort would not be by any means the first attempt
                        to rescue the Sphinx from the encroaching sand. There had been at least
                        three previous attempts, the earliest dating back to the days of Thotmes
                        IV., the second being that made by Captain Caviglia in 1818, and the latest
                        being the attempt carried out about 20 j ears ago through the liberality, ho
                        believed, of a member of the Rothschild family. The present deplorable state
                        of the Sphinx showed that none of these efforts had been of lasting benefit
                        It was therefore satisfactory to find that the work now proposed was to be
                        as far as possible of a lasting character. With regard to the financing of
                        the enter- prise, he considered that there was no pro- bability of the money
                        required being raised in Egypt alone. A certain proportion would no doubt be
                        subscribed by the residents and visitors, but for the bulk of the money it
                        would be necessary to rely on the substantial aid which Mr. Covington
                        expected from the United States. Should this be forthcoming be thought the
                        project might be considered a feasible one. After dwelling on different
                        features of the scheme and the steps to be taken to give it a practical
                        form, Judge Royle concluded by say- ing that to Lis knowledge Mr. Covington
                        had devoted much time and labour to the enter- prise and well deserved
                        encouragement. Mr. Covington, in reply to a question from the chairman as to
                        the financial aspect of the undertaking, mentioned the names of three
                        institutions in the United States from which assurances of support had been
                        received. He estimated the amount which would be forth- coming from these
                        sources at from 8,000 to 10,000 dollars. He thought, however, that in return
                        for this the contributors would expect a share in the possible finds.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Covington's observations were followed by a discussion on the merits of
                        the project generally and the earns to be adopted to raise the necessary
                        funds. Yaoonb Pasha Artin sug- gested that the most practical course would
                        be for the meeting to appoint a committee of three persons to whom should be
                        left the deci- sion of the various question* and the necessary measures to
                        be taken to carry out the object in view.</p>
                    <p>After a discussion as to the number of mem- bers to be on the committee,
                        Artin Pasha’s proposal was adopted, and Mr. Courtouay Clifton, Mr. Allan
                        Joseph, and Judge Royle were elected, and power was given to them to add two
                        others to their number if they deemed it advisable.</p>

                        looking forward to the approaching declaration of dividend with satisfactory
                        feelings, for it has been a record season, and during the year that has just
                        passed the company has had unprecedented suc- cess. The company intend
                        greatly improving their hotels in the coming year. The acquisition of the
                        8abet Pasha estate will lead to many improvements in regard to the Savoy
                        Hotel. The restaurant at that hotel is to be consider- ably enlarged and
                        several fine suites of rooms will be built over this addition to the
                        restaurant These suites will be fitted with all the latest conveniences and
                        will each be furnished with bathrooms and a separate entrance. This estate
                        will also afford room for a large garden for the hotel, which will be three
                        thousand metres in extent The company also intend to build on the land
                        opposite the Savoy Hotel, now used as a tennis court. Here a big building is
                        to be erected, which is to be let off for chambers with business offices
                        beneath. These chambers will be very convenient for residents, as the
                        locality is so central, and they are to be constructed with all the latest
                        improvements in modem buildings. A new lift is to be constructed at the
                        Grand Continental Hotel and a number of bathrooms are also to be added.</p>

                    <p>( From Our CoftKxspoKBxjrr .) Port Said, Monday. I paid a visit yesterday to
                        the Menzaleh Canal works. The canal is now well under way. Two dredgers are
                        actually at work, one at which, the larger, has been put tip here by British
                        engineers who were sent out for the purpose. At this end there will be two
                        bran- ches, one in direct communication with the harbour, the opening to be
                        in the basin which three years hence is to be devoted exclusively to
                        coastwise traffic ; and the other to be out so that craft can land their
                        goods in close proximity to the bazaar.</p>

                    <p>A "HOSPITAL SHIP.” Fortune yesterday took me onboard one of the Turkish
                        hospital ships returning from the Rod Sea, and I am not likely soon to
                        forget the horrors on board of her. Decks filthy in the extreme and holes in
                        many of the planks, no hatches on, ropes and wires festooned and hanging
                        loose everywhere, grime, dost, and filth in every corner. Of sanitary
                        arrangements I saw none, while flies1 and vermin abounded. Amid the filth
                        and general neglect, in odd corners lay, on the road with their poor
                        blankets and poorer clothing, 370 wounded men, dirty, still blood-stained,
                        half-starved, and miserably clothed. On one-side of the deck lays dead man,
                        neglected and waiting the ship's departure to be buried at sea. The vessel
                        left with her cargo of misery and filth at sunset, going away to the wist, a
                        floating horror.</p>

                        Cour recommit avec la Societe de la Bourse que des tiers n’ont pas qualite
                        pour discuter un contrat oh ils ne sont point partie. L’acte du 19 join
                        1883, qui sort de base k ^argumentation des appelants, u'est On rfia- lite
                        qu’un contrat de vente prive entre le gou- vernement, k titre de
                        proprifitaire, et la Societe de la Boursed'Alexandria. Senll’Etat.par

                        prfitauduo violation de ce contrat. En admettant memo que l'acte en question
                        oomporte un intfirfit public, il ne pent en tons cm fitre assimile k un acte
                        adminwtratif ayant force de loi et snsceptib’e d'etre invoqne par des
                        particuliers. Hktons-nous d’ajouter qne persomo jusqu’ici n'a juge
                        nficsssairo de pro- tester i c i sujetj hormis M.M. Bustro3. L’ac- tion,
                        d’ailleurs, fht-elle recevable, est mal fun- dee -.— La societe de la Bourse
                        tient ses droits de Goussio et d’lbrahim ; elle est proprietaire de son
                        immenb'e et la seule condition qui Ini ait ete imposee dans le contrat de
                        veuto est d'y installer une Bourse de commerce, en atten- dant qne le
                        Gouvernement ait pu fonder une Bourse Offiriolle. Or, cette condition a ete
                        fi le. lement remplie. Le public a l’accfis et la jouis- sance necessaire k
                        la libre circulation.Auoune autre stipulation n’ayant ete formuiee quant k
                        l’amenagement et aox details d’installation,la Societe de la Bourse a
                        parfaitement le droit de oederun emplacement special kdes particuliers.
                        Cette concession n’implique auoune entrave k la liberte publique et
                        n’empeche nullement la concession d’autres emplacements k d’autres
                        interasses. On le voit, les clauses du contrat sont tontes sauvegardees et
                        il ne results de la concession vises auoun dommage pour le public.</p>
                    <p>En ce qui ooncerne l’Association des Cour- tiers, la demande, fftt-elle
                        recevable, est figale- rnent mal fondfie. Les reglements de 1’Associa- tion
                        laissent le courtage tout-k-fait libre, mais on ne pent refuser aux
                        courtiers associes le droit de se grouper sur nn point queloonque, libre k
                        d’antres groupes analogues et rivaux de se former. SaDs doute la oorbeille
                        existante fitant consaorfie par l’usage et par les habitudes des boursiers
                        sera une cause d’insuccks pour nne nouvelle cjrbeille. Mais si ce fait
                        entralne une diminution de profits pour les nouveanx venus, il ne viole
                        aucun de lours droits. Ce n‘est done pas k leors concurrents que MM. Bostros
                        doivent s’en prendre en cette occasion, mais k l’absenoe d’une Bourse
                        Officielle, dfl- ment rfiglementfie oh do pareils d^savantages ne pourraient
                        plus se produire.</p>

                    <p>AMERICAN TRADE IN EGYPT. VICE-CONSUL MORGAN’S REPORT. (Continued from
                        Saturday.) In compliance with the Department circular, I sent out a series
                        of questions to those dealing in American goods, and interviewed many, and I
                        give herewith a summary ot reports received and results of inquiries made
                        verbally on the commercial relations between the United States and Egypt:
                        (t) Are American manufacturers amenable to suggestions made from Egypt 1 The
                        general experience is that they are not, and that they rather resent
                        suggestions. This applies especially to the machinery trade.Uulike British
                        manufacturers, the Americans refuse to guarantee their goods, contenting
                        themselves by saying “the machines do the work we claim for them in this
                        country (the United States),” and then proceed to put idiomatic expressions
                        into their letters which are, in many cases, beyond the linguistic
                        attainments of the in- tending agent or purchaser. One manufacturer lost a
                        market for his "cultivators” owing to the springs carrying the body of the
                        machine not being strong enough to properly support the machine when
                        crossing the irrigation channels, with which all fields in Egypt are
                        intersected. In reply to the suggestion made to strengthen the springs, he
                        said that the machines were not made to “jump ditches.” 'These ditches are
                        rillets of but 3 or 3 inches deep. Suggestions as to "finish” of certain
                        wearing parts are as regularly scouted as they are made, as are also
                        suggestions about modi- fications to make the machines more adaptable to the
                        peculiar agricultural conditions of the country, the nature of the soil,
                        etc. British manufacturers have long had the reputation ot acting in
                        precisely a similar manner as that now attributed to Americans, but I have
                        it from a gentleman returned from the United States, which he visited for
                        the sole purpose of inducing manufacturers to introduce certain
                        modifications in their agricultural machinery which were essential to their
                        efficient working in Egypt, that he simply lost his time and money, and
                        returning east he offered his sug- gestions to a British manufacturer, who
                        at once took up the business. The purchaser is paying 30 per cent, more for
                        his machines, but he gets what he requires,and also the guarantee for
                        working efficiency, which the American manufacturers refuse. The coming
                        market in Egypt is that for machinery, and it is needless to point out that
                        all descriptions of machinery are referred to.</p>
                    <p>(2) Are orders sent direct to the manu- facturers or through European agents
                        1 It is seldom that any one repeats the ex- periment of sending a direct
                        order to the ; United States. The invariable rule is "cash 1 with order,"and
                        the general impression here is, that once he has the cash, the American
                        manu- facturer troubles himself little as to when or ' in what condition the
                        goods reach their destin- ation. Even where credit is given the bills ]
                        mature long before the arrival of the goods and the purchaser has
                        practically no remedy for loss owing to delays, broaching of cargo in ‘
                        transhipment, deterioration on voyage, and loss ' of a market demand, which,
                        meanwhile, has ‘ been satisfied from elsewhere. Fifty-two days 1 would, as a
                        rule, appear to be the quickest ( time in which a direct order from the
                        United 1 States might be completed by the arrival of \ the goods here. In
                        the case of perishable goods ' it would be safe to say that a second direct
                        1 order is never sent—as the buyer must risk 1 total loss—for it has
                        happened that consign- ments of an alimentary nature have arrived ' from the
                        United States in such condition that ' they have had to be destroyed by the
                        health authorities, and although the instances may be ' few, their effect is
                        very widespread.</p>
                    <p>In some instances orders sent direct to ' manufacturers in the United States
                        are sent by 1 the manufacturers to agents in Europe for execution as a
                        consequence of some arrange- ment for exclusive agencies being granted for
                        particular zones. The system gives rise to dissatisfaction here, but the
                        consequences to American trade are far more serious than would at first
                        appear. It is with no little trepidation that I transmit for the information
                        of American manufacturers the following, as, from my personal knowledge, I
                        cannot vouch for what is related to me as fact, but it is for those directly
                        interested to make the necessary i inquiries into the subject and see about
                        setting | their houses in order:</p>
                    <p>“'The system of filling orders through Con- tinental agencies is a gratuitous
                        indication as i to where a new market is springing up, and no j sooner has
                        an American article made its way | and created a demand than a cheap
                        imitation i produced elsewhere is thrown on the market, the cards and
                        packing being so gotten up that i the inexpert buyer sees no difference.”
                        The person from whom I obtained this in- i formation made no complaint about
                        the system. He really seemed to be amused at the idea that the Yankees,
                        considering themselves to "cute,” should not have detected what was going
                        on. It was a matter of indifference to him where the goods were produoed; he
                        supplied a demand and made his profits in doing so, and it was not his
                        afiair to suggest any change in the existing order of things.</p>

                        given to him by one of his clients for Court fees) for his own purposes. He
                        denied that be had received the money, but the fact was proved by his own
                        handwriting. He has appealed against the judgment</p>

                        <head>INFANT MORTALITY IN EGYPT.</head>
                        <p>To ins Editor of the Egyptian Gazette. Sir,—The recent correspondence in
                            your columns must have led many persons to believe that Egypt was the
                            only country in which infants were sacrificed to maternal ignorance or
                            negligence, and that if Egyptian mothers could be trained or coerced to
                            bring up their off- spring in the enlightened methods prevalent in other
                            countries a vast wastage of infant lives would be saved. As an Egyptian
                            I had my doubts whether things were really much worse in this respect in
                            Egypt than in other countries, but as our mentors were so positive in
                            their statements, I hesitated to intervene in the discussion. From the
                            “Graphic” of April 15th I, however, cull the following paragraph, which
                            will I think show that there is room for missionary work among mothers
                            even in Eng- land. Perhaps it would be advisable to print the paragraph
                            in very small type, as I should be sorry to shook any susceptibilities
                            :— "Would that the mothers of the lower classes could learn a little
                            about the moral and physical natures of their unfortunate little ones !
                            With all the boasted spread of educa- tion, the mothers still feed their
                            poor children on the most unsuitable food, still forget that milk,and
                            milk only, is the natural nourishment for babies, and ic consequence,
                            infant mortal- ity continues to increase in frightful propor- tions. At
                            an inquest held last week it was proved that a woman had fed her baby on
                            •boiley,' or ground biscuits, a food which the doctor declared could not
                            be digested by any child under twelve months old. Think of the waste of
                            life, the suffering, the expense entail- ed by this crass ignorance of
                            the most common maternal duty, and let us not brag or pride ourselves on
                            our system of education until the mothers of England have ceased to
                            murder their children by slow and deliberate starva- tion.” Yours, etc.,

                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette. Sir,—Any discussion as to the
                            relative merits of pumps is perfectly useless when based on mere
                            assertions. The sole test is ooal consump- tion and water lifted.
                            Unfortunately, reliable figures do not exist, and to obtain them quite a
                            staff of trained men is needed to measure coal and water used by
                            boilers, read gauges, and take discharges and lift for water pumped ;
                            all of Which must be done simul- taneously and for a period of six hours
                            on end. The Government returns for Mex pumping station give the general
                            results for the year, but there are no figures which would be accepted
                            by technical men as conclusively establishing the relative efficiency of
                            Farcot and Gwynne. Till these figures can be pro- duced the pumps, in
                            golfer’s phrase, are "Like as they lie” and their respective advocates
                            may lie as they like.—I am, eto., An Apprentice. Alexandria, May 14.</p>

                        <p>For the fourth time this season the above teams met at Abbassieh in a
                            friendly enoounter on Friday last. The match drew a large crowd of
                            spectators. The police set the ball in motion. For a time the exchanges
                            were very eveD, each side attacking in turn. Russell took a corner, the
                            first of the match, but sent behind. A second followed, but like the
                            previous one, it went behind. This half was greatly in favor of the
                            boys, and they time after t:we pressed the police custodian, but all to
                            no avail as Broadhurst was in good form. A neat centre by Russell looked
                            well and Rafferty just missed the goal by inches. Oh the kick-off the
                            police attacked and good play by Carter ended in Hopkins drawing first
                            blood. Rafferty resumed operations and David- son had a run all to
                            himself and centred well. Rafferty had a pot at goal, the custodian
                            conceding a corner. In saving this was well taken, the goal being
                            cleared for a moment, but Rafferty found the ball at his feet a few
                            yards out and with an unsavable grounder made the scores equal Play
                            after this became even. The police now took play in hand and the outside
                            left getting a timely pass added number two. Excitement was at a great
                            height just now. Rafieuy, getting on a single-handed run, ran through
                            all opposition and passed to Davidson, who equalised the game onoe more.
                            Aiken amused the spectators by some fancy work. Edgar was now playing a
                            good game and checked the left wing time after time, play being somewhat
                            exciting until Russell broke away, but Wingate returned in grand style.
                            From this until half-time play was of a very even nature. Shortly after
                            half- time was announced with the soore: Corporals Inniskillings
                            Abbassieh oontingent 2 goals.</p>
                        <p>Military Mounted Police 2 goals. After the usual interval both teams re-
                            sumed. The police at once assumed the aggressive. For sometime play was
                            within goal's range but Carter shot wide. On the cick-off Ciee got
                            possession and dodged a couple of opponents and gave to Russell, who
                            sent a smart grasshopper in to the cus- todian, who fell on the ball,
                            but Wingate managed to dear. Hopkins now showed to advantage and after
                            dribbling the ball well up he gave to Field, who was ruled off- side.
                            Tho representatives of Ireland now forced several corners, all to no
                            purpose. The polioe attacked the right wing. They however wore scut back
                            by Behan, who was in good form. The service oompauies now asserted
                            themselves and Rafferty came through all by himself, but he shot against
                            the custodian and immediatdy afterwards the ball hit the upright The
                            police attacked in strong foroe but Murray was not called upon. The Ab-
                            bassieh contingent pulled themselves together and forced two comers in
                            quick succession, and although pressing strongly they were unable to
                            penetrate the M. M. P.’s defense. Broadwood was asked after this to save
                            from Davidson, which he did well Ireland now had a spell of attacking,
                            Rafferty putting in several nice cross-shots, each of which the
                            custodian saved in good style. The Inniskillings played the better
                            football, but there was little to chose between them in points of
                            attack. Cree and Russell were continually aggressive and forced another

                            gave to Russell, who with a rapid shot put his side ahead. Nothing
                            further of any importance occurred up to full time, the score being:

                    <p>HALL’S SANITARY WASHABLE DISTEMPER is rapidly superseding wall papers in all
                        tastefully furnished homes. It is made in 70 artistic tints, and only
                        requires the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is quickly and
                        easily applied with a whitewash brush, with half the labour and at one third
                        the cost of paint. HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures cleanliness, and is pleasing to
                        the eye. It appeals alike to artistic and practical house decoration.</p>
                    <p>HALL’S DISTEMPER is of special value in hot climates. Owing to its cool,
                        pleasing colours, great weather-resisting and germ-destroying properties, it
                        lends itself to every kind of wall, wood, brick or stone coating, possessing
                        all the advantages of paint, colour- wash, and disinfectant at one third the

                        next Colonel and Chief Paymaster T. 8. Coppinger, A. P. D., Distriot
                        Paymaster in Egypt, will go on retired pay under the age rules. Colonel
                        Coppinger, who is one of the few purchase officers now serving, joined the
                        army nearly 40 years ago, and was transferred to the A. P. D. in 1876.
                        Whilst paymaster of the 24th Regiment he saw servioe m the Zulu War of 1879
                        (medal with clasp). His impending retirement will be learned with regret by
                        his many friends in the land of the Pharaohs.</p>
                    <p>Captain C. Pierce, Royal Berkshire Regiment, on promotion, has been
                        re-appointed to the 1st Battalion at Dublin. Lieutenant Charles Howard, 1st
                        Battalion RoyaUBerkahire Regiment, who was returned for trial to Dublin City
                        Sessions for an alleged assatm on the polioe, failed to turn up at the
                        Sessions last Saturday. His bail bonds were ordered to be estreated and a
                        warrant was issued for his arrest It was stated in court that Mr. Howard,
                        who had sent in his papers some time ago, had gone abroad, to Canada it
                        Intelligence from Eequimalt, B.C., states that at the recent sale of
                        Admiralty stores, consequent on the reduction of the Pacific Squadron, very
                        low prices were realised. For instance, 102 torpedo nets, which ooet £40
                        each, were sold for £2 ; 1,500 ooaling baskets only realised £1 4s., 176
                        zino-lined oordite boxes went for £5, and other stores realised comparative
                        trifles. The Admiralty set a reserve price on the large store of anchors and
                        chains, to purchase which a Yankee ring came all the way from San
                        Francisco.</p>
