<head>MEETING AT EGYPTIAN INSTITUTE..</head>
A meeting of those interested in the project
for the excavation of the Sphinx was held at
the Egyptian Institute in Cairo on Friday,
12th inst. Amongst those present we noticed
Abbate Pasha, President of the Khedivial
Geographical Sooiety, Yaconb Pasha Artin,
Secretary of State and President of the
Egyptian Institute, Johnson Pasha, President
of the Board of Model Workshops, Boulac,
Prof Dr. Ibrahim Hassan Pasha, Honorary
President of the School of Medicine, His
Holiness Omba Kyrillos, Coptio Patriarch of
Egypt and Abyssinia, Mr. 0. Von Mohl, Com-
missioner of the Cairn de la Dette, Dr.
Walter li nes Boy, Curator of the Museum of
Natural History, Judge Boyle, of the Native
Court of Appeal, Mr. Courtenay Clifton, Chief
Inspeotor of the Tanzim Service, Mr. R.
Tourtan, Mr. Allan Joseph, Mr. George Royle,
Dr. D. Tanquot, M. Emile Chassinat, Director
of the French InstituteofOrientalArohreology,
and Mr. Dow Covington.
Dr. Abbate Pasha was unanimously voted
to the Chair and after explaining in a short
speech the objeot of the meeting and the
questions whioh would oome under discussion,
called upon Mr. Dow Covington to address the
meeting.
Mr. Covington, on rising, said that the
project which ilie meeting was called together
to consider was so fully set forth in the
statements accompanying the notioes of the
meeting, and bo oonoiaely put before the
publio in the issue of the 6th inst of the
"Egyptian Gazette," that his task vraa greatly
simplified, and it was rendered unnecessary for
him to offer more than a few observations.
The clearance of the Sphinx from its en-
cumbrance of sand, said Mr. Covington, could
not fail to commend itself to those who take
an interest in the ancient monuments of Egypt,
but should also gain the approval and support
of the thousands of tourists who yearly visit
this land, and who make at least one visit to
the SpLiux. It would, he hoped, not only be a
work ot excavation but also of exploration, and
one from which important results from an
Egyptological point of view might reasonably
be expected.
After making a few remarks on the project
laid before the meeting Mr. Covington drew
attention to the plans and estimates which
had been prepared under the advice and
direction of Mr. T. Favarger, an architect who
was well known in Egypt. According to these,
the work, as originally contemplated, revolved
the excavation of 186,000 cubic metres of
sand at an estimated cost of some £4,000. A
substantial saving, however, might be effected
by the modification of the original design in
the manner proposed in the project before the
meeting. Mr. Covington then indicated by
references to the plans the nature of the sug-
gested modifications. He added that he had
received assurances of financial support not
only in Egypt, but in the United States, where
the project was regarded with great interest.
Judge Royle reminded the meeting that the
present effort would not be by any means the
first attempt to rescue the Sphinx from the
encroaching sand. There had been at least
three previous attempts, the earliest dating
back to the days of Thotmes IV., the second
being that made by Captain Caviglia in 1818,
and the latest being the attempt carried out
about 20 j ears ago through the liberality, ho
believed, of a member of the Rothschild family.
The present deplorable state of the Sphinx
showed that none of these efforts had been of
lasting benefit It was therefore satisfactory
to find that the work now proposed was to be
as far as possible of a lasting character.
With regard to the financing of the enter-
prise, he considered that there was no pro-
bability of the money required being raised
in Egypt alone. A certain proportion would
no doubt be subscribed by the residents and
visitors, but for the bulk of the money it would
be necessary to rely on the substantial aid
which Mr. Covington expected from the United
States. Should this be forthcoming be thought
the project might be considered a feasible one.
After dwelling on different features of the
scheme and the steps to be taken to give it a
practical form, Judge Royle concluded by say-
ing that to Lis knowledge Mr. Covington had
devoted much time and labour to the enter-
prise and well deserved encouragement.
Mr. Covington, in reply to a question from
the chairman as to the financial aspect of the
undertaking, mentioned the names of three
institutions in the United States from which
assurances of support had been received. He
estimated the amount which would be forth-
coming from these sources at from 8,000 to
10,000 dollars. He thought, however, that in
return for this the contributors would expect
a share in the possible finds.
Mr. Covington's observations were followed
by a discussion on the merits of the project
generally and the earns to be adopted to raise
the necessary funds. Yaoonb Pasha Artin sug-
gested that the most practical course would be
for the meeting to appoint a committee of
three persons to whom should be left the deci-
sion oi the various question* and the necessary
measures to be taken to carry out the object in
view.
After a discussion as to the number of mem-
bers to be on the committee, Artin Pasha’s
proposal was adopted, and Mr. Courtouay
Clifton, Mr. Allan Joseph, and Judge Royle
were elected, and power was given to them to
add two others to their number if they deemed
it advisable.
A vote of thanks was then accorded to
Abbate Pasha for presiding at the meeting and
the proceedings terminated.
<head>DEPARTURE FOR ENGLAND</head>
Colonel Harrison’s pigmies left Oiiro last
Evening by the 6.15 p.m. trsiin for Fort Said,
where they stayed for the night and wifi embark
to-day on board the Holt lane steamer “Orestes.’’
They will proceed direct to London under the
charge of Colonel Harrison’s Arab servant, who
is able to speak their language. Their departure,
as previously announced, was fixed for the 18th
of this month, but the "Orestes’’ will arrive at
Port Said to-day, two days earlier than anti-
cipated.
The Holt Line of steamers is one of the
few cargo lines who carry a doctor, so these
little orcatures will get every attention should
they fall ill on their way to England. No notion
of their departure was taken by the public,** it
was entirely unexpected on this date. *
<head>A POSSIBLE COMPETITOR.</head>
It is by no means impossible that Egypt will
soon have a serious competitor in her onion
trade, for Bermuda is determined to try to
capture the English market, and has. lately
tent a large supply of onions for free distribu-
tion among the people of London, the idea
befog, of course, that onion shall spell anion,
and that when Londoners have none tasted
the Bermuda variety they will appreciate more
fully the necessity for joining hands with the
Empire garden.

Burrost, Mayl9.
About 4,000 Redifs (Resertiito) wftte re-
cently called to theookwrsfor sendee in the’
Yemen from Haifa and the surrounding district,
to the great dismay 'of the folfaWtanto. The
population of the area from wMeh these men
were drawn does not exceed 40,000, and the
departure of 1,000 men, many bf whom were
married and had families, promised to oauSc
considerable economie disturbance, besides
throwing three or four hundred women and
children oe the public charity. Petitions were
sent in to the Governor by scores and the news
that the great majority of the men summoned
to the colours would not be required to embark
for the Yemen was received with great joy,
and furnished an excuse for several days’
junketing among those who had been directly
6r indirectly threatened by the summons.
The active troops of the Damascus Army
Corps, as for a, is known here, have provided
very few contangents for the arduous campaign
now being waged in a torrid climate against a
large and well armed fores of rebels.
<head>THE KHEDIVE.</head>
H.H. tiie Khedive arrived at Cairo byspe-
dial tram last night in order to attend the
Ceremony of the Monied en Nebi at Abbassieh.
The morning his Highness went to IsmaQfa
to inspect his estates there. He is expected to
teturo to MCntazah in the evening1 leaking
Cairo at 3 p.m.
The shareholders of the George N ongovioh
Hotels Company, Limited, are looking forward
to the approaching declaration of dividend
with satisfactory feelings, for it has been a
record season, and during the year that has just
passed the company has had unprecedented suc-
cess. The company intend greatly improving their
hotels in the coming year. The acquisition of
the 8abet Pasha estate will lead to many
improvements in regard to the Savoy Hotel.
The restaurant at that hotel is to be consider-
ably enlarged and several fine suites of rooms
will be built over this addition to the
restaurant These suites will be fitted with all
the latest conveniences and will each be
furnished with bathrooms and a separate
entrance. This estate will also afford room
for a large garden for the hotel, which will
be three thousand metres in extent
The company also intend to build on the
land opposite the Savoy Hotel, now used as a
tennis court. Here a big building is to be
erected, which is to be let off for chambers
with business offices beneath. These chambers
will be very convenient for residents, as the
locality is so central, and they are to be
constructed with all the latest improvements
in modem buildings. A new lift is to be
constructed at the Grand Continental Hotel
and a number of bathrooms are also to be
added.
About 75 persons are at present staying at
the Continental Hotel, which is a record
number for this season of the year.
Referring to the recent appointment of the
Rev. Llewellyn Gwynne as Archdeacon of the
Budan, we are informed that he has officially
resigned his position as representative of the
Church Missionary Society in the Sudan,
which, according to a recent arrangement, has
now been included for ecclesiastical purposes
in the Diocese of Jerusalem. Archdeacon
Qwynne will, however, continue to supervise
the schools of the society in Khartoum, and
will generally advise that body on matters
connected with their prospective missions in
the southern districts.
<head>NORTH EGYPT LAND COMPANY.</head>
We publish to-day the prospects of the
North Egypt Land Company, as announced in
our issue of yesterday. We are informed that
the lists will probably close on the day of
issue as the rush for shares is likely to be very
great
<head>NATIONAL BANK OF EGYPT.</head>
A London financial contemporary, in com-
menting on the fact that the requisite number
of share* in the National-Bank of-Egypt were-
not represented at the extraordinary general
meeting, which was to have been hold re-
cently, remarks: "The explanation is, of
course, that the shareholders, satisfied with
their dividends and with the management
generally, have not worried even to send
in their proxies to the board. It is a neat
compliment to the directors, but the apathy
is not readily excusable all the same.”
<head>SAN STEFANO SEASON.</head>
The first ball of the season at the San Ste-
fano Casino on Saturday next promisee to be a
great success, as in former years. The manage-
ment of the hotel are preparing an excellent
dinner, and we understand that over 160 per-
sons have already ordered tables in the restau-
rant. The following is the menu

NOTES FROM PORT SAID.
MENZALEH CANAL WORKS.
( From Our CoftKxspoKBxjrr .)
Port Said, Monday.
I paid a visit yesterday to tiie Menzaleh
Canal works. The canal is now well under
way. Two dredgers are actually at work, one
at which, the larger, has been pnt tip here by
British engineers who were sent ont for the
purpose. At this end there will be two bran-
ches, one in direct communication with the
harbour, the opening to be in the basin which
three years hence is to be devoted exclusively
to coastwise traffic ; and the other to be out
so that craft can land their goods in close
proximity to the bazaar.
<head>A "HOSPITAL SHIP.”</head>
Fortune yesterday took me onboard one of
the Turkish hospital ships returning from the
Rod Sea, and I am not likely soon to forget
the horrors on board of her. Decks filthy in
the extreme and holes in many of the planks,
no hatches on, ropes and wires festooned and
hanging loose everywhere, grime, dost, and
filth in every corner. Of sanitary arrangements
I saw none, while flies1 and vermin abounded.
Amid the filth and general neglect, in odd
corners lay, oo rerod with their poor blankets
and poorer clothing, 370 wounded men, dirty,
still blood-stained, half-starved, and miserably
clothed. On one-side of the deck lays dead
man, neglected and nnoovewl, waiting the
ship's departure to be buried at sea. The
vessel left with her cargo of misery and filth
at sunset, going away to the wist, a floating
horror.
