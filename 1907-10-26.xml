                    <head>A Light Nourishment for General Use.</head>
                    <head>Allenburys' DIET</head>
                    <p>The "Allenburys" DIET is a complete milk and farinaceous Food, easy of
                        assimilation, most agreeable to take, simply and quickly made. It is
                        recommended in place of ordinary milk foods, gruel, etc., and whilst
                        acceptable to all as a light nourishment, it is particularly helpful to
                        Dyspeptics, Invalids and the Aged. In the sick-room it will be found
                        invaluable and it is easily and quickly made, the addition of boiling water
                        only being necessary. </p>
                    <p>The "Allenburys" DIET is readily digested by tose who are unable to take
                        cow's milk and is particularly serviceable in convalescence. When taken as a
                        light supper diet it will be found to promote tranquil and refreshing sleep.
                        Although this DIET is a good for ADULTS and is entirely distinct fom the
                        "Allenburys" Foods for Infants, yet it is also of great value as a
                        restorative food for young children, especially during convalescence. </p>
                    <p>For Invalids, Dyspeptics &amp; The aged.</p>

                    <head>A Fight for the Nation's Box Seat</head>
                    <p>The "Times" sums up the policy of the Labour Party by admitting it is a fight
                        "for the box seat"</p>
                    <p>Mr. Walter Sichel, writing in the "Times" says that the real issue is "the
                        extinction of the middle class and the gradual inducement of conditions
                        under which the plutocrat and the pauper can alone survive". "This is",
                        thinks the "Times", "putting it too picturesquely, yet it is true that the
                        middle class has now to endure an assault upon its political predominance
                        such as it delivered nearly a century ago upon the political supremacy of
                        the upper class. It won a great victory with the first Reform Bill, and for
                        a long time went on consolidating its power. But it cannot be said to have
                        used its power much better than its precessors, and now it is being called
                        to account</p>
                    <p>"It evolved and acted upon an inhuman and unsocial system of political
                        economy, under which it called into being an immense industrial population,
                        which it exploited in the name of supply and demand, and allowed to live
                        without education, without physical comfort, without any right but that of
                        selling its labour for what it could get. That population found the
                        leadership which the captains of industry denied it, created an organization
                        for itself obtained from the dissensions of its masters a continually
                        increasing share of political power and very substational ameliorations of
                        its lot Now it is trying a fall with its masters exactly as they did with
                        the landed and aristocratic intrest. It is no longer trying for more comfort
                        at the back of the coach, but is seeking possession of the box-seat; and the
                        class it is trying to oust regards its efforts with distraction, with alarm,
                        with acute apprehension, but without any very intelligent conception of the
                        real state of affairs of the way to make the best of it.</p>
                    <p>"That way is not to be found in despairing efforts to cling to the old order
                        of things. Poeple complain of the apathy of the middle classes, but that
                        apathy is mere perplexity, arising from lack of reasoned views about the
                        consitution of a properly constructed and managed society. Though it is late
                        in the day, it would be well to begin by frank recognition of the change
                        that is upon us, and to go on with intelliegnt and disinterested efforts to
                        lightenly of ignorantly, they will fight their battle for the supremacy
                        which they wanr ro enjoy in the direction of the State, and the object to
                        all men of good will ought to be to minimize as much as possible the
                        mistakes that are sure to be made during the conflict"</p>
                    <p>"The Socialist bugbear is not the key of the situtation. The poeple of this
                        country are far too intensely individualistic to be permanently deceived by
                        Socialist theories. But in a fight all allies are welcome, and up to a
                        certain point Socialism will doubtless be used to promote the general aim.
                        In sheer ignorance the working men may be induced to destroy as belonging to
                        others things that, if they knew better, they would gladly keep for
                        themselves. The best hope for the future lies, not in trying to put life
                        into outwordn political dogmas and traditions, but in endeavoring to show
                        the new owners of political power how much there is in the institutions of
                        their country which it is their intrest to conserve for the benefit of
                        themselves and their children. If this people perish, it will be for the
                        lack of knowlegde, not for want of native recitude and common sense"</p>

                            acknowledgment on the part of Moslems that their religion has proved
                            inferior to others in the meotal and moral equipment of its followers,
                            is the first step towards the reform of Islam. It is no longer denied
                            that for knowledge, for comfort, and for personal satety Moslems go to
                            cduntries of which the governing power is Christian, and emigrate from
                            such as are under Moslem domination, and the question why this shonld be

                        <p>TRIAL OF NEW CAR</p>
                        <p>Yesterday afternoon by invitation of the Alexandria and Ramleh Tramway
                            Company, Limited, we made, in company with several others, the trial
                            trip to the Palais on the first new mixed tramcar to be placed on the
                            Alex- andria-Ramleh line’ The ran was an eutire success and we are
                            convinced that the pablic will experience the same satisfaction with the
                            new cars as was expressed hy those who made the journey yesterday</p>
                        <p>The cars in question are adapted for use with absolute comfort both in
                            summer and winter. In winter they are closed in, and in summer they will
                            be opened by the removal ot the windows and panels on either side of the
                            car. In winter entrance to the car is made at either end and there is a
                            central passage between the transversely placed seats, whereas in summer
                            this passage will afford further seating accommodation and entrance to
                            the ear will he made from either side. Each car is divided equally for
                            the accommodation of first and second class passengers, the only
                            difference between the two being the provision of the comfortable
                            “Kattan” seating for the former class. The cars, indeed, are constructed
                            with every view to comtort and the decorative part of the work is
                            thoroughly artistic, while both shaking and jerking have been reduced to
                            a minimuin, no matter what the speed</p>
                        <p>The accommodation of a single-decked car of this type, such as we
                            travelled in yesterday, is 46 when closed for the winter and 60 when
                            opened for the suromer, the over-all length being 12.80 métres. Phe
                            length of the car ased upto the present is 8 1/2 metres with an
                            accommodation (single deck) of 20 in those with longitedinally placed
                            seats and 40 in those with transversely placed seate. The doable decked
                            car now in use is seated for 56 persons, whereas those of the new type
                            can seat 92 when closed in and 116 when open.</p>
                        <p>A considerable advance has also been macie in speed. The cars at present
                            on the line were able on trial to run at the rate of 45 kilometres an
                            hour, while the car which we travelled on yesterday has ron at the rate
                            of 60 kilometres per hour. Indeed, throughout our trip yesterday our car
                            was anable to do justice to its constructors as regards speed as it was
                            held in check by the car which left the station before it. The points
                            and carves were negotiated without noticeable jerking or swerving, aod,
                            as we have already mentioned, the shaking was remarkably slight at every
                            spec, except ‘laring the passage over the short length of grooved lines.
                            Another point of advantage, which must not be overlooked, is the control
                            which the experienced wattman bas over his car. these cars going at
                            their maximam speed can be brought to a stop in a length of about 50
                            metres, thoagh such a short pall-up would, as may well be imagined, be
                            by no means agreeable to the nnanticipating passenger</p>
                        <p>In conclusion let us wish the Alexandria and Ramleh Railway Company,
                            Limited, “mabrouk” in their effort to satisfy the in creasing demands of
                            the public</p>

                            have succeeded. This year we have prodaced from three-qoarters of a bale

                        <p>The moderate section of the Egyptian Ne tionalist Party are very
                            indignant at the tone of Mostapha Pasha Kamel's speech, whieh has been
                            the object of a great deal of hostile critics” in the columns of the
                            Moslem verns- tentative, the authorities might be inclined to make in
                            the way of Egyptian self-government. It is thought that the tone of the
                            speech will even have a deplorable effect on the handfull of Radicals in
                            the House of Commona, whe have been of late inclined to consider the
                            claims of the Nationalists. Such leading organs of Natioualist opinion
                            as “Al Moayad,” “Al Minbar,” and “Al Guerida,” take the Pasha severely
                            to task. The latter journal remarks “If the Pasha knows how to remain
                            within bounds, the ignorant classes do not, and he ought to ex- plain
                            such expressions as ‘the poliey of hatred,’ “especially as the
                            Occupation is able to tarn the slightest movement to the prejudice of
                            our patriotic rights.” The insulta, whieh the Pasha heaped on the
                            Nationalista, who refuse to bow down to him as the one and only orthodox
                            ex- ponent of Nationalism, are deeply resented by “Al Minbar,” which
                            considers that Kamel's claims to the monopoly of patriotism are atter-
                            ly inadmissible.</p>

                        <p>Visitors to Calabria are nowadays so tew and far between that the news of
                            the terrible havoc, which has just been wronght by the earthquake, will
                            na,appeal to many. And yet Gerace, where the telegrams say that the
                            cathedral has been utterly destroyed is in one of the loveliest, thoagh
                            most neglected corners of Burope, and the beauty of the scenery of the

                            Casalnooro leaves an indelible impression on every tra- veller's memory.
                            Gerace is the see of a bishop and is on the upper slopes of the lofty
                            moan- tains which extend from the great backbone of the Apennines into
                            the sea. It was a place ot great strength in the middle ages, bat
                            frequent earthquakes, particularly that of 1783, have re duced its
                            citadel to ruins The cathedral, which has been ruined a few days ago,
                            was originally a Gothic building and was overwhelmed in the catastrophe
                            of 1783. lts buildings are pictaree- queand contain many marks of
                            Saracenic influence. Gerace sprang trom the ruins of Locri Epizephyrii
                            whose citizens are so cordial- ly praised in the 11th Olympic of Pindar.
                            There is a beautiful aketeh of Gerace, by Mr. Lear The acthor of
                            “Pyramids and Progress,” Mr. Ward, in bie werk on Greek coins, ssys “The

                            breadth, is stil) in full evidence, and the sites of the modern towns
                            are remarkably pictaresque. The blue sky and sunshine, the bealthy,

                            ancient costumes (unfortanately anly seen on Sundays and fete-days)—make
                            it one of the richest grounds for the artist. If only some of our modern
                            watercolour painters would spend their spring or avtumn holidays there,
                            they might then show that Mr. Lear, the landscape painter of fifty years

                        <p>To the Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette"</p>
                        <p>Sir,—We have been much struck over here by the portentous accounts of the
                            homecoming of Mastapha Pasha Kamel People are not slow to recognise thet
                            the historical agitator has no more force than a spent balloon.
                            Moreover, the method of sensational self- advertisement as though some
                            crisis were near has become a weariness. His "two-words" might have been
                            two thoosand forall the convic tion they carried with them. Two thousand
                            would indeed have been far more in accord with a prolix and pretentious
                            past. Excitable references to imaginary happening, much feverish
                            declamation and high falutin rhetoric and flourishes are not called for.
                            They are dangerous too in a measure, for the so-callled "campaign" has
                            had a slight effect- fortunately only slight- in confusing people's
                            minds. Luckily it is recognised here that the theatrical proceedings of
                            a certain speechifier have really nothing to fo with the cause of Egypt
                            and its welfare; these are in the hands of more sober- minded workers
                            whose propaganda was of value during the summer that has just gone. The
                            reprehensible attempt then to cloud the issue in the intrests of sundry
                            personal ambitions, and the grinding of certain axes- and to create
                            among the casual spectators an undeniable mistiness as to who really are
                            the representatives of a quielty moving forward party- has failed as it
                            deserved. At the same time it is as clear to the observer in London as
                            to the on-looker in the East that the question of the advancement of
                            Egypt should be entrusted finally to those who worked so zealously for
                            the cause in London during the past year. The moderate programme of
                            reforms which was put forward is one which can well recieve the
                            whole-hearted support of the nation, and the more it is realised in
                            Egypt that even the temporary recognition as spokesmen of this one or
                            the pther, qui que ce soit, is nugatory, the better really for all
                            concerned. Discredited agitators are still capable of mischief by
                            bringing about the party splits. Having once tasted the pleasures
                            accuring to the position they have been found significantly unfit - they
                            are loth to relinquish one iota of the privileges thus improperly
                            retained. But the steady advance towards a great ideal must not be
                            hampered by such veniality. The heathen should be given no opportunity
                            to blaspheme. The observer or the biased critic should not have any
                            reason for their comment, "Oh, there are so many parties, so many
                            leaders, they do not know what the wish". Nothing could be more unjust
                            than such a rfemark. Unfortunately where there is an unfair comment to
                            be made, only too often it finds egress. We must bear in mind this
                            evidence of human weakness. It behoves thinking Egyptians to be as
                            staunch to the atual leaders of theparty of reform and the national
                            cohesion as to teh idea itslef. Let, there be no mistake as to this.
                            Events are watched narrowly in London. Though there is a real readiness
                            to salute the desire of prominent Egyptians to emphasise the integrity
                            of their country- since who but the Egyptians themselves can prosper in
                            such a task- there is also existing in certain quaters a disposition to
                            cavil and to ump to the conclusion that because certian loud-talking
                            demagogues have made their names familiar through the columns of the
                            French press both in Paris and the East, that the country is divided,
                            and that there is no great heart of Egypt, no unity of prupose, but only
                            a number of futile cabals whose actions end in trifling and smoke. Now,
                            this is not so. I make no excuse for devoting this letter to this one
                            subject, for we here have had it dinned into our ears ad nasuseam that
                            teh return of a certain airy political trifler was something in its way
                            epoch-making. Poeple who knowvery little of a subject are porverbially
                            easy to convince, but one may confidently assert that only a small
                            section of the public both here and in Cairo has been influenced by the
                            rapid outpouring of a self-stylef patriot. Still it is regrettable that
                            even an infinitesimal section should be misled by a few shouts and a
                            cheer or two from a chance crowd. In all centres of population a crowd
                            will cheer at the slightest provocation, and generally with no clear
                            idea as to the reason for the applause. One man rasies a shout, and the
                            first passer-by stops and imiatates him. This is the Simian strain in
                            the race. It must be recognised that the leaders of the movement, who
                            spent a month here in the summer, have earned the support of theri
                            fellow countrymen. It is not a pleasant little game, with personal
                            notoriety as the first prize and as proxime accessit the right to be
                            escorted to your carriage by a few score idlers. Consequently it is a
                            real duty to give no countenance to every upstart who can issue a
                            proclamation or utter a few platitudes in the public ear. Let it be
                            remembered that all that is necessary for the movement has been said,
                            that the seed is sown, and that the work is on the way, being carried on
                            under the suspices of men who are not self-seeking, but who have been
                            prodigal of time brains and money, in order to advance. In this
                            connection it is not a question of the Irish party, not the Labour
                            perty, nor any little clique, supporting the movement, which is
                            independent of them all, though there is good service from many quaters.
                            Englishmen who are strong for the Empire are also strong in apporval. I
                            should like to conclude by pointing out that those who give
                            whole-hearted support to these leaders of the movement, who have put in
                            years of unacknowledged self-sacrificing duty will not <cb n="5"/>

                        <p>London, <date>October 17th</date></p>
                        <p>Dear SIr- Thinking that your readers would be glad to have a more
                            extended notice of the late Rev. Chauncey Murch D.D., whose sudden death
                            took place recently on a dahabia at Assuah, I give you the following
                            particualrs. Dr Murch was born in the State of Penn- sylvania USA. om
                            January 1st 1856, and was graduated at Muskingham College, Ohio, i 1876.
                            He came to Egypt a» « missionary in 1883 in connection with the American
                            Mis sion, and was stationed for a time at each of the follwoing places,
                            Benha, Tanta, and Luxor; his first and last appointments being Luxor,
                            where he spent the longest part of his missionary life, and from which
                            as a centre he made many visits on the Mission Nile boat to the towns
                            and villages situated between Tahta and Assuan, which compromised the
                            district of which he has superintendence. While stationed in Luxor he
                            used some of his spare time in reading books on Egyptology and took a
                            great intrest in antiquities, and learned to read hieroglyphics, and was
                            an expert on deciding what was new and old among relics offered for
                            sale. He was held in high esteem by men of all creeds, nationalities,
                            and was noted for his readiness to render assistancee to anyone in need.
                            Indeed I never met any man so ready to give of his time, of his talents,
                            and of his strength for the benefit and even the enjoyment of others. He
                            will be greatly missed, espically in the Thebaid where he was much
                            beloved by by many. He leaves a wife and only one son to mourn his loss.
                            Hundreds of telegrams or letters to, or personal calls upon, his
                            bereaved wife testify to the esteem in which he was held.</p>

                        <p>To the Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette"</p>
                        <p>Sir- The word seems to be going round that the whilom prejudice to
                            Helouan would have long time worn away, were the place acessible to the
                            Caireue in any other manner than by the railway, which tends almost to
                            make the place as remote as Alexandria is from Cairo, for the disparity
                            of distance in the latter journey, is made up for by the discomfort in
                            the former</p>
                        <p>The isolation of Helouan however may after all hold some advantages, for
                            are not rents and freeholds cheaper there to-day than at any other place
                            in Egypt? In fact if one looks round and nders these things, it is the
                            one place left where prices so far have not been fabulously overdone.
                            This is all the more remarkable too, when on reflects the advantages and
                            attractions that Helouan has to offer, such as its mineral baths,
                            sumptous hotels, and many pensions, its desert rides, golf links, race
                            course, not to mentionits observatory from which many and wonderful
                            things foretold, even to the extent of earthquakes at no less a distance
                            than 8000 miles away, and all these vivid attarctions are denied to the
                            general body of Cairenes, for the reason that the journey in getting
                            there and back is so irksome and tedious</p>
                        <p>I have pointed out inyour columns that the land for a road is available.
                            This one presumes to mean the Nile bank, and thta labour is there, free
                            to the Government, through the medium of the 1,000 able-bodied male
                            convicts denied erstwhile at Tourah prison. Then why not connect up this
                            suburb, as other suburbs have been or are being connected up, by a well
                            metalled road, which would last at least half a century if the same
                            class of stone is still to be found in the Mukattams as was employed by
                            the ancients in constructing the Pyramids -Yours etc</p>

                    <p>RETIREMENT OF REV. N. ODEH</p>
                    <p>By the retirement of the Revd. N. Odeh, lastelt Rector of St. Mary's Mission,
                        Kasr El Donbars, a long career of uninterupted Mission work in the East
                        comes to a close a career full of intrest, anecdote, and success, but none
                        the less traversed by many a hard trial and struggle which would have
                        discouraged men not gifted with the knowledge, experience, and
                        administrative spirt that were so helpful to the departing Rector. For we
                        may safely say that few Anglicans- clerical or lay- are better aquainted
                        with affairs of Church and State in the Orient, or more qualified to
                        prounounce an opinion thereon, or could act with greater prudence in an
                        emergency, than the Revd. Mr. Odeh.</p>
                    <p>Taking Holy Orders in 1879, he was sent to take charge of the Mission at
                        Ramlah, (Lydda) in the Plain of Sharon, where he remained one year. Ordained
                        a Preist by the late BishopBarely in Jerusalem, the Revd. Mr. Odeh,
                        ministered for five years each at Christ Church, Nazareth and St. Paul's
                        Jerusalem. From the Holy City he was transferred, seventeen years ago, by
                        the present Anglican Bishop, to Cairo, to found a Chruch Mission. He opened
                        Mission Schools first at Hamzawi, then in the Jewish quater, the Mousky,
                        Abdin, Kasr-el-Nil, and, finally, twelve years ago, the present compound one
                        acre in size, was aquirred near the residence of General Bullock, and a
                        boys' and girls' school and mission house built by a mortgage was redeemed
                        two years ago, when by the advice of the Revd. Mr. Odeh, the name of the
                        Bishop in Jerusalem, and would therefore revert to the State on the Bishop's
                        demise was converted into Wakf, or religious entail, the trustees being the
                        Anglican Bishop in Jerusalem, wh has jurisdiction in Egypt, and the
                        Secretary General of the S.P.G., and their successors for ever, according
                        the Moslem law. St. Mary's Church, now in course of construction, is the
                        last addition to the Mission buildings, and crowns the work which the Revd.
                        Mr. Odeh has done. It is in the Byzantine style, of brick and stone
                        throughout, and, without the gallery, will accommodate a congregation of
                        five hundred, as against the hundred souls now seated in the chapel. When
                        roofed, the Church, fronting Kasr El Ain Avenue, will be a great improvement
                        to the surroundings from an architectual point of view, and its situation
                        should ensure it a fashionable congregation. The money forthis Church, by
                        the bye, was collected by Revd. Mr. Odeh by voluntary subscription and
                        without any grant from the Bishops Fund in England. Considerable economies
                        were effected in the work of construction, and the right of preemption,
                        used, to prevent the sale of a strip of land on one side of the Church. The
                        Mission property was valued last season, at from L.E 100 to 120,000, and
                        having freed itself of debt, it is on a satisfactory financial basis. But
                        this is not all that Revd. Mr. Odeh has done, in Cairo. As regards education
                        religious and secular- in point of moral upfilt and progress, we have every
                        cause to be pleased with the life work of Mr. Odeh not only in Syria, but in
                        this Land of Nile as well. To-day, upwards of 150 boys and girls of all
                        nationalities and creeds attent the primary and secondary classes of the
                        Mission Schools, and many an Egyptian, in offical or civil employ, has
                        pleasing reminiscennces to tell of the Christian principles which were
                        expounded so sympathetically to him in the shade of the euclyptus of that
                        oasis of calm and good will</p>
                    <p>The faculty as at present consituted, consists of four English masters, two
                        assistants an Arabic and in French Professor, and two English lady
                        teachers.</p>
                    <p>The Rev. Mr. Odeh was Principal of the Schools, and the Chaplain of the
                        Mission, but these duties have developed respectively on the Rev. T. a.
                        Braithwaite, D.D. Oxon, L.L.D Dublin, and Mr. F.J. Ney lately Headmaster of
                        the English School, Niscosis, Cypress</p>
                    <p>More than this, Mr. Odeh has prepared a fir residence and propert for the
                        Anglican Bishop of Egypt, whose nomination is immient. Towards the fund of
                        L.E. 30,000 required for this purpose, the Jerusalem and East Mission Fund
                        have collected L.E. 16,000, and the S.P.G and Colonial Bishoprie may each
                        contribute L.E. 5,000 if the remaining L.E 10,000 is forthcoming</p>
                    <p>Mr. Odeh had many true friends during his sojourn in Cairo, and among them
                        was Lord Cromer, who always sympathised with the work that the Mission was
                        doing, and used hif good offices with the Egyptian Government to sell the
                        land at Kasr-el-Doubara at half price. His leadership invariably attended
                        the annual school-treats and expressed in very kind words, his appreciation
                        of the effort of Mr. Odeh and his colleagues</p>
                    <p>Bishop Blyth, on his yearly circuit always stayed at St. Mary's Mission
                        House, and ever showed the deepest sympathy with the Rev. Odeh in the labour
                        of loce which he has now handed over to posterity</p>
                    <p>The Rev. Mr. Odeh, who had returned here from England to transfer his charge
                        of the Mission, leaves at the end of the month for home. He has been given
                        the living of a parish near Oxford.</p>

                    <head>"Failure of Mohamedanism</head>
                    <p>AN interesting article from the pen of Professor Margoliouth, D. Litt,
                        appears in the October numberof "The East and the West" under the heading of
                        "Mohamedan Explanations of the failure of Mogamedanism. A conference at
                        Meccah":-</p>
                    <p>"To those who are interested in the reform of the Islamic peoples - by
                        whatever means they hope such reform may be effected- there is no more
                        encouraging sign says the writer, than any acknowlegdement on the part of
                        Moslems that their religion has proved inferior to some other in the mental
                        or moral equipment of its followers. The dreary annals of Mohammedan
                        sovereigns- many of them well-mentioned and capable men- rarely furnish
                        evidence of any such suspicion. Sultan after Sultan builds mosques, schools
                        of law, hospices for Sulfis, the world's ills, they suppose, are to be cured
                        by larger and even larger quantities of the same drug, the possibility that
                        the drug is itself inefficient or that other drugs may be more efficent is
                        not even considered</p>
                    <p>"SO long as Islam was politically formidable this belief might remain
                        undisrupted. The course of events which has placed by far the great majority
                        of Moslems under Christian governments has compelled some of them to
                        question it. A system that both in theory and in practice kept aloof from
                        politics might not be affected by the political decadence of its adherents;
                        but one which started as a political system, conquering and subduing, is
                        seriously affected by circumstances which compel it to resign its imperial
                        claims. When it can no longer be denied that for knowledge, for comfort and
                        even for personal safety, Moslems go to countries of which the governing
                        power is Christian, and emigrate from such as are under Moslem domination,
                        the question why this should be suggests itself to many minds. And it is a
                        sign of the awakening of the Moslem mind that such a question should be
                        raised, and solutions, however inadequate, be given to it</p>
                    <p>"The title of this paper is derived from a pamphlet called Ummal Kura ("the
                        Mother of the Villages" a name for Meccah), published at Port Said in 1316
                        ah (1899 ad) and purporting to contain the minutes of a debate held in
                        Meccah on successive days from the 15th to the 29th of Dhu'l Ki'dah (March
                        27th to April 10) in that year. The debaters were a party of twenty three
                        persons, assembled to discuss the reasons for the decay of Islam, and the
                        means by which it could be resuscitated</p>
                    <p>"The chairman, having to deliver an inauguaral address, "knit his brows" but
                        presently relaxed them, and spoke at considerable length. He regarded the
                        question of the decadence of Islams as an old one - more than a thousand
                        years in age, he held that there was no lack of treartises on the subject by
                        capable writers, only that these had shrunk from going into detail; and he
                        wound up by dividing the subject to be discussed by the society into ten
                        heads, as follows: The seat of the disease; the accidents attending the
                        disease; the means of applying the remedy; the essence of Islam; the way in
                        which belief in that religion should be exhibited; the essence of secret
                        polytheism; how innovations are to be opposed; the drawing up of rules for
                        the foundation of a society for propaganda</p>
                    <p>"The second day a debate began with an important assertion on the part of the
                        chairman. It was that wherever there were two neighbouring countries,
                        districts, villages, or houses, the one Moslem and the other non Moslem, the
                        Moslems are less energetic, worse organised in all matters, personal and
                        social, and less skillfull in all arts and trades than the non-Moslems,
                        though superior to the othhers in virtues, such as trustworthiness, courgae,
                        and liberality. This sweeping assertion he was afterwards induced to
                        restrict, when the Indian gentleman pointed out that the condition of the
                        Moslems was superior, or not inferior, to that of Pagans and Buddhists.
                        Someone else wished to add that of Atheists and Freethinkers but another
                        speaker denied that such persons really existed. Evidently, then, the
                        assertion of the chairman so far as it referred to Christian (and perhaps
                        Parsees and Jews) was unchallenged, and now a whole series of causes began
                        to be alleged.</p>
                    <p>When these came to be summed up at the seventh meeting, from the secretary's
                        minutes, it was found that no fewer than fifty-six had been suggested, which
                        could be classified as religious, political, and moral. Thus, on an average,
                        each speaker suggested three causes some of which the secretary marks as
                        roots, others as branches. Perhaps the whole list does not deserve
                        translation, but there are undoubtedly some cases in which the Moslem
                        diagnosis coincides with that given by non-Moslem physicians</p>
                    <p>The first cause suggested was thae doctrine of fatalism, which is supposed to
                        numb effort and paralyse energy. The second was ascetic doctrine, which
                        depreciates the value of what the world can give. From these we jump to the
                        fifteenth, the widespread belief in an opposition between Islam and science,
                        physical or metaphysical; and thence to the twenty-first obstinate rejection
                        of religious liberty, through ignorance of its advantages.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand the political causes seem to be better calculated to
                        explain the difficulty, in the few countries in which Islam is a political
                        power. They are sixteen in number. The first is the system of government -
                        absolute and irresponsible despotism; among the other noticable items are
                        the prohibition of free speech, the want of equality of rights between the
                        different classes, the want of proper encourgaement to learning the
                        restriction of the attention of the government to the collection of taxes
                        and the maintenance of the army. Of the presence of these evils in Islamic
                        states with far reaching effects there is no question</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The contribution made to the discussion by the Secreatry himself, who spoke
                        after the suggestions of the others had all been registered, was much the
                        greatest. To the fifty-six causes assigned he himself added no fewer than
                        twenty. Of these, eleven belonged to the sphere of Ottoman administration,
                        which the Secretary criticized somewhat in the style of Mr. Brailsford's
                        "Macedonia" the matter contained in this section accounts for the secrecy
                        observed, and the fact that the book could not be issued in Turkey. To the
                        catalogue of administrative abuses which accounted for the decadence of
                        Islam he added a list of nine miscellaneous causes, of which the first seems
                        still to belong exculsively to the Ottoman Empire, but remainder hold good
                        of Mohammedan countries generally. Cause 83, "Neglect of female education"
                        constitues so real an explanation of some of the phenomena that it may be
                        worth while translating the paragraph devoted to it in the Secretary's
                        speech; "The weakness of our characters is to be accounted for by yet
                        another important cuase, connected with women - I mean their being left
                        ignorantm unlike what the case with our sncestors, when women were to be
                        found like A'ishah, Mother of the Believers, with whom God be pleased, from
                        whom we have recieved half our theological knowlegde. So, too, there were
                        hundreds of women in the time of the Companions of the Prophet and the
                        Epigoni, who recited tradtions, and were authorities on points of law, not
                        to mention thousands who possessed knowlegde and composed verses. The
                        existence of these women at the commencement of Islam is a convincing
                        arguement, sufficient to refute those who hold that ignorance is the best
                        safegaurd for a women's chastity - not to mention the fact that no proof can
                        be adduced for the supposition that knowledge leads to looseness of morals,
                        and ignorance to strictness. For if knowlegde render a woman more capable of
                        sinning, ignorance will giver her greater boldness. The mischief produced by
                        female ignorance and its evil effects on the character of the children, both
                        male and female, are mattersthat are obvious and require no exposition. Only
                        its evil effect on the charcter of the husband is not quite so conspicuous,
                        and may need some elneidation</p>
                    <p>Men have a anrtual affection for their wives a tendency to be influenced by
                        their moral qualities; the contrary of this is only imagined by such a man
                        as has been cajoled by his wifre into the belief that she is a poor weak
                        thing, completely subject to his will, whereas the fact, she holds the
                        reins, and can guide him whither she chooses; or to put it otherwise, into
                        the belief that he is the leader and she the follower, whereas the truth
                        percieved by all around, though unperceived by the husband himslef, is that
                        she follows him in the capacity of driver, not of driven. The astuteness of
                        women has been most adequately gauged by the Islamic codes, which prescribed
                        the veil and the seculsion of the harem in order to restrict their power,
                        and to confine it to the management of the hosue the veil, to the ectent of
                        not displaying their ornaments to strange men, and not meeting them in
                        private or unnecessarily; and confinement to the house, except for pressing
                        needs - there being no doubt that what is outside these limits opens the
                        door to licentiousness. And these restrictions are enjoined out of
                        consideration for the husbands, and with a view to the proper allocation of
                        the duties of life. The Chinese, whose civilization is the oldest,
                        instututed the forcible compression of girls' feet as to render it difficult
                        for them to move about, and endanger their hounor - which with the Orientals
                        is the primary consideration, whereas Westerns are only concerned with
                        material comforts"</p>
                    <p>The discussions of teh debaters, however interesting, appear to have rendered
                        of little practical value by their failures to define accurately the essence
                        of progress, and to study the history of Islam by the light so obtained. Has
                        Islam any Golden Age to look back on, except in the sense that at one time
                        Mohamedan Sultans were a terror to their neighbours, whereas now their
                        neighbours are safe from their raids! There is no real abuse current in
                        Mohamedan States from which they have been free, except by accident for a
                        limited time, on the other hand, reforms, whether forced upon the people
                        from outside or not, have been introduced - it is sufficient to point to the
                        abolition of slavery, at least over the greater area of Islam. The days of
                        the Pious Caliphs, could they have been reproduced, would mean no progress
                        even in the most backward of Islamic countries. The strengthening of Islam,
                        if it is not to be a calamity to the whole world, is not to be effected by
                        the reproduction of a barbarous past, but by an attempt to utilise the vast
                        force which Islam represents, as a factor in real progress, the civilising
                        and ennobling of the race. And whether this can be done or the whole of this
                        huge capital must be "written of" is the question which reformers have to
                        solve"</p>

                        mais en cliturant tout de méme &amp; un niveau inférieur 4 celai de la

                        visible dans la cote dont les fluctuations .n’ont pas eu d’en vergure, mais
                        fort sensible dans le mouvement des transactions. Alors que les vendeurs
