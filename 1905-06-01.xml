                        be that the Emperor has at last decided to listen to the voice of reason and
                        humanity, and not to the suggestions of a vulgar vanity and mistaken
                        dictates of dynastic security. Those who are best acquainted with Russia are
                        convinced that if, by a stroke of his pen, Tsar Nicholas brought –– as he
                        could bring –– this ghastly tale of bloodshed, anguish, and devastation to
                        an end, he would be blessed by his subjects from one of end of his vast
                        dominions to the other, and he would never hear from one of them, outside
                        the coterie of corrupt oligarchs which fences him in, a taunt or a reproach.
                        This war, even when arrogant and ignorant generals were assuring an
                        indifferent people that it would be a mere military promenade, has never
                        been popular with the overwhelming mass of the Emperor's subjects. In so far
                        as they knew anything about the mysterious causes which brought it about,
                        they realised that it was due to a high-handed attempt to annex territory to
                        which Russia had no claim, not in the interest of the people at large, but
                        in order to enable a few greedy concessionaires and Court toadies to put
                        more money into their insatiable politics. When Russia embarked on what was,
                        or what seemed to the "Little Father's" children to be, a holy way,</p>
                    <cb n="6"/>
                    <p>there was no limit to the heroic sacrifices they were ready to make. Rarely,
                        if ever, has the world witnessed so colossal an act of self-abnegation as
                        that which left to Napoleon the Great only the ashes of a capital, reached
                        after an advanced, contested foot by foot, through a country converted into
                        a desert by the inhabitants. In that case an appeal was made, an honest and
                        a noble appeal –– to Russian patriotism to let the invader reach his
                        worthless goal, past their burned houses and devastated fields, over their
                        dead bodies. Even in the eve of that mischievous and unnecessary blunder,
                        the Crimean War, the great masses of the people saw but a spirited defense
                        of the Cross against the Crescent, wherein from the Russian point of view
                        the Infidel was being supported by renegade Christians. And it was an
                        appeal, to the religious emotions –– an insincere appeal as history has
                        discovered –– of the Russian peasants that lent to the last Russo-Turkish
                        war a factitious popularity. But to-day the moujik only knows, if he knows
                        so much, that he is asked to shed his blood and bear increased and
                        intolerable taxation that certain hangers-on of the Court may exploit a
                        country which does not belong to them, and in which they have no moral or
                        material interest.</p>
                    <p>War at the best is a terrible misfortune, but war carried on when victory is
                        practically out of the question, at a prodigious cost of blood and of human
                        suffering, to say nothing of treasure, is the gravest crime that monarchs
                        can commit. All the gladiatorial shows of all the Roman Emperors ––given as
                        much to gratify the populace as from Imperial love of cruelty ––cost
                        infinitely less bloodshed and misery than are included in the "butcher's
                        bill" of Manchuria. To the Tsar this horrible has been but an affair of
                        outposts of Empire, to the Japanese it has been from the first a struggle
                        for independence openly and cynically threatened. If Russia accepted the
                        most stringent terms proffered by Japan, no appreciable loss would be felt
                        by the Empire at large, if Japan had been vanquished, and the terms of peace
                        had been dictated –– as was arrogantly boasted should be the case –– in
                        Tokio, the risen nationality of the Far East would have been trampled out of
                        existence, unless Great Britain and the United States had come, as they must
                        have come, to the rescue. To accept unpalatable terms of peace is, no doubt,
                        to lose prestige. But prestige –– like credit –– like credit is a good thing
                        or a bad thing in accordance with the use to which it is applied. Nobody
                        pretends that loos of prestige by Russia would be followed by a revolt of
                        the nationalities she has subjugated in Central Asia, or that it would be an
                        excuse by Great Britain for extanding the boundaries of her Indian Empire at
                        the expense of the Tsar. The maintenance of British prestige in the East is
                        a defensive necessity, not a stimulus to aggression. Our borders are as wide
                        as we care to make them, an invasion or an attempted invasion of our Indian
                        dominion would be as wanton and as predatory as any of the great raids which
                        have swept over the "brooding East" since the days of Alexander the Great.
                        The truth is that Russia as a whole is so invulnerable as to stand in no
                        need of prestige. Napoleon I. discovered that fact, and so did the allied
                        armies in 1853-6. But as much cannot be said of the autocracy. So long as
                        the Emperor represents the sentiments, religious and patriotic, of all of
                        his subjects his position remains, in the hour of defeat, as in the hour of
                        victory, supreme and impregnable. But when he is out of touch with the
                        feelings of his people, when he demands unlimited sacrifices for unworthy
                        objects, when he scorns respectful protests from all that is most
                        intelligent and representative within his Empire, then none holds the
                        semblance of power on more precarious terms. There is no blinking the truth
                        that from the Black Sea to the Baltic Russia is seething with unconcealed
                        discontent, which neither coercion nor cajolery can repress. Of an organized
                        revolution there is no likelihood, there are Cossacks enough to maintain
                        order in Moscow, in St. Petersburg, and in Warsaw. But against the vis
                        inertiae of an Empire of a hundred and forty millions no Tsar, however
                        powerful, no Cossacks, however truculent, can make headway. It is in no
                        spirit of hostility to Russia that we point out these simple,
                        incontrovertible, almost platitudinous facts. No greater disaster could
                        befall Europe or the world than that the huge Empire which at present
                        acknowledges allegiance to the Tsar should fall a victim to irreparable
                        disorganisation, helpless demoralisation, and hopeless bankruptcy. Anarchy,
                        however, small a scale, is dangerous and infectious, but anarchy afflicting
                        so vast an empire as that of Russia is a terror to civilization such as the
                        world has never yet known. And to anarchy Russia is, under its present
                        obstinate and shortsighted governance, very rapidly drifting.</p>

                    <head>THE COTTON WORM</head>
                    <p>We call attention to an article in our issue to-day on that most important
                        subject of the cotton worm. Mr. Richmond, sub-manager of the Aboukir Co.,
                        Ltd, has made experiments simple and cheap, and as regards the cut worm
                        apparently effective. An ordinary tin of petroleum pricked with a pin drops
                        its contents into a small field irrigation channel. The petroleum spreads
                        over the surface of the water, which, sinking through the soil, leaves a
                        very thin film of petroleum, enough to deter moths from laying their eggs on
                        such protected soil, innocuous to vegetation, but hurtful to eggs or newly
                        hatched worms. It seems extraordinary that the Khedivial Agricultural
                        Society should not have taken up more actively a system deemed worthy of
                        trial by their own entomologist. Petroleum is rapidly being recognised in
                        America as a wonderful insecticide. Any small proprietor might well try for
                        himself an experiment which requires no apparatus and for material only
                        easily obtained and cheap petroleum, instead of costly and dangerous
                        poisons. It may be found that this method of applying petroleum is equally
                        good in combating the true cotton worm, and the small green berseem
                        caterpillar and other insect plagues.</p>

                        to rejoin the squadron, proceeded to Vladivostok. The details of subsequent

                        entrusted with the carrying out of an attempt against the life of King
                        Alfonso during his stay in Paris. The men were lodged in prison. Five of
                        them refused to give any account of themselves, but the other two asserted
                        that they bad arrived with the intention of assassinating the King of
                        Spain.</p>

                    <head>THE COTTON CUT WORM</head>
                    <p>INTERESTING EXPERIMENTS.</p>
                    <p>Some interesting and successful experiments in trying to combat the cotton
                        cut worm (Agro tis Ypsilan) have been carried out at Kharaba, on the lands
                        of the Aboukir Company. The Khedivial Agricultural Society sent their
                        entomologist, Mr. Willcocks, to examine a method of dealing with the pest
                        proposed by Mr. Richmond, and we understand that Mr. Willcocks was to
                        impressed with the system employed that he strongly urged the society to
                        arrange for experiments to be carried out in the Behera province, where this
                        particular pest causes so much damage to the young cotton. The same worm has
                        this year also cleared off a great part of the berseem which was left to
                        seed. Unfortunately the society have postponed putting the method to further
                        practical tests till next year, although there was plenty of time to act on
                        their entomologist’s advice.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Richmond’s method of dealing with the pest is based on making the cotton
                        fields distasteful to the female moth, so as to prevent her laying her eggs
                        on the cotton fields or at the roots of the young plants. To do this he
                        advises that with the first watering which is given to the fields after
                        sowing the seed, two to three gallons of petroleum should be applied for
                        each feddan.</p>
                    <p>The simplest method of applying the petroleum is to bore a tiny hole in the
                        bottom of a full 33 lb. tin containing 4 gallons and place the tin on a
                        board at the point where the water is being run on to the field. The
                        petroleum falls in a tiny stream or almost in drops on to the running water
                        and is quite sufficient to make the necessary film.</p>
                    <p>As the irrigation water sinks into the soil it leaves behind it a very fine
                        film of petroleum, which is most distasteful to the moth, whilst it does no
                        harm to the germinating cotton. This is prevention of attack and for that
                        reason a very valuable precaution.</p>
                    <p>The greatest damage is done a few days after the plant makes its appearance
                        above ground, when the stem is very thin and easily gnawed through by the
                        caterpillar. With the second watering the petroleum should be applied in the
                        same quantity and manner as previously. After the second watering the plants
                        quickly become strong enough to withstand stem attacks, which are the most
                        fatal.</p>
                    <p>The petroleum film on the fields should kill any eggs and newly hatched
                        caterpillars with which it comes in contact. This may be called cure, of a
                        value only second to prevention. The method is a very simple one, very
                        cheap, and can be applied by any cultivator. Petroleum can be obtained in
                        any village in Egypt at about P.T. 10 per tin. Half a tin will do a feddan,
                        and the sole instructions to the fellah are to make a very small hole with a
                        pin. The experiments are to be continued in the autumn on the young berseem
                        crop, which is generally badly attacked by Agrotis at Aboukir if the berseem
                        is sown early.</p>
                    <p>From caterpillars collected at Kharaba Mr. Richmond finds that the chrysalis
                        stage is 14 days and the presumption is that there are a succession of
                        broods during the summer.</p>
                    <p>It is interesting to note that two of the caterpillars which were being
                        watched were badly attacked by parasites which appeared to bo the larva of
                        an Ichneumon fly. Those larva bored their way out of the bodies of the two
                        caterpillars and spun small yellowish white cocoons for themselves. Both
                        caterpillars attacked by the parasites died, being unable to turn themselves
                        into pupae. The cocoons of Ichneumon flys should on no account be
                        destroyed.</p>

                    <p>DIVIDEND AND DISSATISFACTION.</p>
                    <p>A London correspondent writes:—</p>
                    <p>Considerable dissatisfaction is expressed in shipping circles at the decision
                        of the directors of the Suez Canal Company to pay a dividend of 28 per cent.
                        on account of 1904, as against 26 per cent. for the previous year. It had
                        been hoped that the increase in net profits during the past twelve months
                        would have been devoted entirely to the reduction of the dues charged on
                        vessels using the Canal. The addition of 2 per cent. to the shareholders’
                        dividend knocks this idea on the head, and if the present charge of 8.50
                        francs per ton is reduced to 7.75 francs shipowners will think themselves
                        lucky, for the generosity of the company may even fall short of this small
                        concession. Indeed, I should not be surprised if the reduction is only to 8
                        francs per ton. Such a decision might be regarded with favor by some of the
                        shareholders, but I fancy that in the end the directors would regret their
                        niggardliness.</p>
                    <p>As to whether the redaction is likely to be maintained, a high authority in
                        the shipping world said to a Press representative last week: —-"In 1906 the
                        Canal Company are going to lose 10,000,000fr. in consequence of this
                        reduction , and it is a question whether or not such a loss can be
                        continued. The company are taking considerable risk in the interests of the
                        shipping trade—certainly not in the interest of their own shareholders.</p>
                    <p>The proposed redaction is 75o. per ton, which is equal to a reduction of
                        10,000,000fr. or £400,000. The arrangement is just part and parcel of the
                        London programme, and is by no means in consequence of the agitation which
                        was set on foot a short time ago."</p>
                    <p>On the other hand there are shipping authorities who hold the view that the
                        75c. reduction is distinctly the outcome of the recent agitation.</p>
                    <p>“At first," said one of these gentlemen to the representative, "they only
                        talked of a 25c. reduction, but, ultimately, a little sop of 75c. was
                        suggested.</p>
                    <p>"The company are paying 28 per cent dividend on the shares, which is a breach
                        of the London agreement All profit over 25 per cent., according to the terms
                        of that arrangement, ought to go to a reduction of the tonnage dues, and if
                        that were adhered to in all probability the rates would be brought down 2fr.
                        or 3fr.</p>
                    <p>"The agreement to which I refer was between M. de Lesseps on the one hand,
                        and the London Committee of Shipowners on the other. This is a clean,
                        logical agreement, and would, nodoubt, hold good at law. It is a great deal
                        more than an 'honorable understanding.’</p>
                    <p>"I learnt the other day from a gentleman of exceptionally high authority on
                        these matters that the only explanation which can be given for men like
                        those at the head of the Canal Company's affairs—including representatives
                        of the British Government—practically breaking their word, lies in the fact
                        that they have discovered that the London agreement, if adhered to, would
                        place them in the position of fiduciary legatees. Still, the code of honor
                        that regulates private firms should apply in the case of great
                        companies.</p>
                    <p>“The company might have come to the shipowners and said, ‘We are in a mess—we
                        must have this agreement altered.’ The shipowners, who have shown every
                        disposition to be reasonable, would, no doubt, have consented to discuss the
                        matter. Instead of that they have ridden rough-shod over everyone.</p>
                    <p>“As to the enforcement of the agreement, where is the court to enforce it ?
                        The shipowners would have to go to France, and in an international affair of
                        this kind they ought to have their own Government with them. The Government,
                        however, at this time are sitting on the fence.”</p>

                    <p>ROUMANIAN STEAMSHIP COMPANY</p>
                    <p>The Roumanian Steamship Company has ordered a new steamer for the
                        Constanza-Alex-andria line at the Chantiers de La Loire at Saint Nazaire.
                        The vessel, which is to cost frs. 2,340,000, will be the finest in the
                        company’s fleet. She is to be named the "Emperor Trajan."</p>
                    <p>The new line to Alexandria is an extension of the
                        Constanza-Constantinople-Athens service. This route has lately been brought
                        into prominence owing to the new Constanza-Constantinople cable, which is of
                        great economio importance. By this means, telegraphic correspondence will be
                        increased both between Berlin and Constantinople, on the one hand, and
                        between Scutari, Angora, Mossul, Baghdad, Basra, and Fao on the other.</p>
                    <p>As regards mails, if the Constanza rente is adopted instead of the Brindisi
                        line, the distance will be considerably shortened between Europe and Asia
                        Minor, especially when the Baghdad railway is completed. There is now a
                        rapid line of steamers between Constanza and Constantinople, and the
                        Roumanian Government intends to extend the Athens line to Alexandria.</p>

                        <head type="sub">Un accident de chemin de fer</head>
                        <p>Le 26 novembre 1902, vers 6h. du soir, le chef du train Ahmed Effendi Ali
                            circulait sur le marchipied d'un wagon lorsqu'il heurts une enorme
                            caisse que les ouvriers du prince Hussein Pacha Kamel avaient voulu
                            transporter quelque part et qu'ils durent laisser lie a 15 centimetres
                            de la voie quand les essiens de la charrette qui la portait furent
                            brises. Le malheureux jeune homme fut projete par terre et mourut trois
                            jours plus tard des suites de l'accident a l'hopital de Tantah ou il ne
                            fut transporte que le lendemain. Son pere, Ali Mohamed et ses freres et
                            soeurs majeurs et mineurs actionnerent le prince et la Cie du Delta
                            Light en paiement de L.E. 3,000 de dommages-interets.</p>
                        <p>Le tribunal civil les debouts de leur demande, pour le motif que
                            l'accident etait du a la propre imprudence de la victime qui, avertie
                            par le chef de gare de Nemret el Bassal de la presence de la caisse et
                            invite par lui a faire attention n'aurait tenu aucun compte de cette
                            invitation et aurait circule sur le marchepied.</p>
                        <p>La Cour, tout en confirmant le jugement en ce qui concerne les parents
                            majeurs qui ne recavaient ancun subside de la victime, le reforme en ce
                            qui concerne les parents mineurs auxquels elle accorde 200 L.E.
                            d'indemnite dont 100 devront etre versees par la Compagnie et les cent
                            autres par le prince Hussein Pacha Kamel.</p>
                        <p>Dans l'expose des motifs, la Cour ecarte l'accusation d'imprudence comme
                            invraisemblable, les temoignages recueillis de ce chef etant d'ailleurs
                            embarrasses et contradictoires et le pretendu avertissement du chef de
                            gare signale apres coup. Quant au prince, ses hommes ont commis une
                            double faute, celle de charger trop lourdement la charrette et ensuite
                            de la laisser a la distance de 15 centimetres de la voie. Il est vrai
                            que 'un d'eux fut depeche pour avertir le chef de gare, mais cet avis,
                            s'il attenue la responsabilite de leur maltre, ne la supprime pas. La
                            responsabilite de la Cie est tout aussi bien etablie par l'enquete : le
                            chef de gare est coupable 1° de ne s'etre pas rendu sur les lieux pour
                            s'assurer de la distance a laquelle la caisse se trouvait de la voie 2°
                            d'avoir laisse partir le train sans signaler le danger et tout au moins
                            sans l'accompagner lui-meme.</p>

                    <head type="sub">M. DE FREYCINCET'S REVIEW.</head>
                    <p>"The Egyptian Question," by M. Charles de Freycinet, Member of the French
                        Academy, published last week by MM. Calmann Levy, is a work which might have
                        been entitled "How the French lost Egypt." M. de Freycinet, the French
                        statesman who has held office more frequently and longer than any of his
                        contemporaries, is particularly well fitted to speak with authority on this
                        question. In his capacity as Foreign Minister he was called upon to study it
                        deeply and in July, 1882, he resigned office, after the Chamber by an
                        overwhelming majority had rejected his proposal to vote a credit of
                        9,410,000 francs destined to enable France to defend the Suez Canal, and to
                        insure uninterrupted and safe navigation through that international waterway
                        while the English were occupied in putting down Arabi Pasha's
                        insurrection.</p>
                    <p>At that time Prince Bismarck was still all-powerful at Berlin, and the
                        decision of the French Parliament was based on the apprehension that even
                        limited intervention might lead farther and entail European complications,
                        for which the young Republic was ill prepared. When questioned by the
                        committee of the House, M. de Freycinet himself refused to assume the
                        responsibility of counselling intervention in Egypt. That vote sounded the
                        knell of the Anglo-French condominium, but M. de Freycinet does not pretend
                        that the British Government sought that result.</p>
                    <p>On the contrary, the ex-Minister is at considerable pains to explain in his
                        book that the British Government was very desirous to obtain the
                        co-operation of France. However, he adds, "At the present time, when France
                        is re-generated, when she has reconstituted her army and her finances, when
                        she has acquired a powerful ally on the Continent, and when she possesses
                        precious friendships ; to-day, when the dominating and threatening policy of
                        M. de Bismarck has descended with him into the tomb, and when the hegemony
                        of Germany has given way before a just equilibrium of force, we have
                        difficulty in understanding the susceptibilities of public opinion in
                        1882."</p>
                    <p>M. de Freycinet then explains in the clearest possible language the various
                        phases of the Egyptian Question after the crushing of Arabi's rebellion down
                        to the signature of the recent Anglo-French accord, signed on April 8, 1904.
                        The object he had in view in writing this most able work, which constitutes
                        the history of the Egyptin Question from the French point of view from
                        Bonaparte's expedition to Egypt to the present moment, is to demonstrate
                        that if the condominium of England and France is dead and can never be
                        resurrected, nothing has happened and nothing has been done by France or
                        Europe, to counter on Great Britain's permanent possession of Egypt.</p>
                    <p>"It is," he says, "the invariable principle of Europe that Egypt must not
                        belong to any of the great Powers. Its possession insures such advantages
                        that the equilibrium of the States is disturbed by it. In the hands of one
                        single Power Egypt constitutes a threat for the interests of all others." M.
                        de Freycinet explains the attitude of Germany in the Egyptian Question by
                        showing it could have been inspired by no other reason than the desire to
                        perpetuate a cause of misunderstanding between France and Great Britain.
                        However that may be, it is certain that from 1882 until last year it was
                        France which constantly headed the opposition to the continued presence of
                        the English in Egypt, and sought by all means to hamper the action of Great
                        Britain in the valley of the Nile, to say nothing of the attempt made by
                        Major, now Colonel, Marchand to enter the country so to say bt the back
                        door. M. de Freycinet is evidently proud that France has thus "raised her
                        voice in favor of right. She alone has prevented a sort of prescription
                        being established, and has not permitted the silence of all to be
                        interpreted as a definitive acquiescence."</p>
                    <p>Towards the end of this interesting volume, M. de Freycinet speaks out very
                        clearly. He affirms that "if the Powers have done nothing to interrupt the
                        English occupation of Egypt, they have, fortunately, done nothing to confirm
                        it. The presence of the British troops is not more legitimate to-day than it
                        was twenty years ago. The 'exceptional and transitory' position of Great
                        Britain (to employ the words used by Lord Salisbury) is from the point of
                        view of right in no way modified. The convention of April 8, 1904, has
                        changed nothing. France has prohibited herself from taking an initiative,
                        and that is all. To-day England is no more than she was yesterday either the
                        sovereign of Egypt or its protector, or invested with a mandate from the
                        Sultan. The treaties of 1856 and 1878 are still in force. Europe can raise
                        the question and demand a solution in conformity with right."</p>
                    <p>M. de Freycinet does not know what Europe will do, but he says that,
                        notwithstanding contrary appearances, he has "no doubt that at some moment
                        in history Egypt will cease to be under British domination. Egypt will
                        either revert to the Sultan or be neutralised with a guarantee of the
                        European concert." The French ex-Prime Minister cannot say how that will be
                        accomplished, but he is inclined to think that it may be with the consent of
                        Great Britain. It would not, however, he thinks, be likely that </p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>England would voluntarily withdraw from Egypt without a compensation. He adds
                        :––</p>
                    <p>"Why should not the Sudan become the ransom of Egypt? At the present moment
                        the English occupy two equally false positions, first in Egypt, where the
                        Convention of April 8, 1904, has not altered the state of things, and
                        secondly, in the Sudan, where a contract vitiated by its bases violates both
                        the power of the Khedive and the rights of the European concert.
                        Notwithstanding their material strength, the English suffer from that
                        equivocal position which hampers their colonising genius. They assuredly
                        aspire to a regularly established domination. Would it, therefore, be
                        nothing for them to exchange so doubtful a situation for an unchallenged and
                        unchallengeable empire? Who can know to what suprises the general policy of
                        Europe may lead, what demands may be one day formulated and what account it
                        will be necessary to take of them? Does not prudence counsel avoidance of
                        such eventualities? Would not the most generous connduct be, as it often is,
                        the most advantageous? The Powers would applaud because they would consider
                        that the possession of the Sudan by England would not be too heavy a payment
                        for the independence of the world's thoroughfare. As for Turkey, she would
                        be too happy to abandon her rights over the Sudan to recover the exercise of
                        her sovereignty in Egypt."</p>

                    <p>Travellers who use the Brindisi route to and from Egypt, will regret to learn
                        that the Italian Government at the eleventh hour has decided not to avail
                        itself of the option of taking over the Southern railways. It will be
                        remembered that this option remained open till May 20. Much disappointment
                        will be felt in the South of Italy, but the decision is financially prudent.
                        It was understood that this route would be greatly improved by the
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>The Southern railways –– the geographical term is somewhat of a misnomer, for
                        a portion of the lines are in Northern Italy –– consist of the long piece of
                        rail from Bologna, down the Adriatic coast to Otranto, 550 miles in length,
                        of which 475 miles are traversed by the weekly Indian mail and are therefore
                        of special interest to British travellers ; of the line across the peninsula
                        from Foggia to Naples, 123 miles of railway, comprising between them 669
                        miles. This makes a total mileage of 1,342 miles for the whole of the
                        Southern lines.</p>

                    <head>GERMAN ANGLOPHOBIA</head>
                    <p>Herrr Bassermann, the National Liberal leader, was the chief speaker at the
                        Party's Congress which was held last week in Dresden. His references to
                        foreign politics were characterised by a strong anti-English bias. He
                        accused England of seeking to sow dissension between Germany and France in
                        Morocco, and observed that it was the chief aim of British policy to incite
                        European Powers to quarrel among themselves. In Eastern Asia, England, said
                        Herr Bassermann, was behaving in a very curious manner as the ally of Japan.
                        The Fleet was winding its way through French ports, and England contented
                        herself with paper protests. The argument employed by Herr Bassermann that
                        England is playing false to France in Morocco, and to Japan in the Far East,
                        may now be encountered every day in the German Press, which is doing its
                        best to get up the cry of "Perfide Albion" in Paris.</p>

                    <p>Professor Mendeleyeff, the world-renowned Russian chemist, has declared to a
                        member of the staff of the "Petersburgskaya Gazeta" that the political
                        movement in the Russian seminaries is being fostered and fed by Germany :
                        "Such a movement can be only to Germany's advantage, for the whole of
                        Germany understands very well that Russia is the only impediment in the way
                        of Germany's further development. It is to Germany's interest to weaken
                        Russia by internal disorders. If German diplomacy is apparently on Russia's
                        side, then that may be construed as a sign that German diplomacy is aware
                        that Russia will emerge from its difficulties with comparatively little
                        damage. This is my personal opinion with regard to Germany, and you can
                        print it, if you wish ; it is all the same to me." Professor Mendeleyeff
                        occupies such a high position in scientific circles at home and abroad that
                        his remarks are all the more striking.</p>

                        DEALINGS</head>
                    <p>In the Chancery Division on Thursday last, Mr. Justice Joyce had before the
                        action of Brown v. Haig and Oxley, by which the plaintiff asked to have an
                        account taken of certain mining concessions granted by the Egyptian
                        Government. –– Mr. Warmington, K.C., and Mr. Terrell appeared for the
                        plaintiff ; Mr. Neville, K.C., and Mr. Rankin for Mr. Oxley; and Mr.
                        Younger, K.C., and Mr. Ashton for Mr. Haig.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Warmington, in opening the case, said the parties were jointly entitled
                        to the concessions. The matter was before his Lordship on a motion for the
                        appointment of a receiver and manager, and the defendants said that accounts
                        had been offered and given. As a matter of fact, no account had been given
                        except was contained on a sheet of note paper, and that was no account at
                        all. In the result, under pressure it was consented that an account should
                        be taken by a gentleman to be named by the paries, and, failing agreement,
                        by an accountant to be named by the Court. A gentleman had been appointed in
                        his Lordship's chambers, and his report showed that no account had been
                        delivered, because there were no materials for it. The report also showed
                        that certain of the transactions justified not only the action being
                        brought, but that the suspicion which the plaintiff had that everything had
                        not been quite straight.</p>
                    <p>His Lordship : Of course, I am not going to take an account in Court.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Warmington : No, but my client is entitled to have an account. I should
                        like to facilitate matters, and if the defendants will adopt the account of
                        the gentleman appointed in your Lordship's chambers and will file the
                        ordinary affidavit, I shall know how to deal with it.</p>
                    <p>His Lordship: I should have thought that all the questions would arise on
                        that account.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Warmington agreed. The history of the case began at the beginning of
                        1901, but before that time the plaintiff and Mr. Oxley had for two or three
                        years been associated together for the purpose of obtaining concessions for
                        mining property in Australia and Egypt. Matters between plaintiff and the
                        Egyptian Government proceeded extraordinarily well, and the former obtained
                        seven concessions. The Government, however, thought that was too many to be
                        vested in one set of person, and four concessions were relinquished. Each
                        summer the plaintiff came to England to communicate with Oxley, and they
                        arranged for the dispostion of the concessions for their joint benefit. At
                        the end of 1900, it occurred to the plaintiff and Oxley, who was a company
                        promoter and financier, that it would be well for a third person to go to
                        Egypt to obtain some additional concessions, including those which plaintiff
                        had been obliged to surrender. Mr. Haig was the person selected to perform
                        that office, and he came to Egypt in January, 1901. One of the companies
                        controlled by Oxley was the British and Colonial Agency, Ltd., and he
                        thought he could utilise the company for the purpose of the concessions
                        obtained by Haig. The name of the company was then changed to the Egyptian
                        Sudan Minerals, Ltd. Mr. Haig was a gentleman of education and a collegiate
                        friend of some of the officials, and in March the Government granted him a
                        concession. The plaintiff desired that the concession should go into the
                        name of Haig, it being part of the arrangement that plaintiff's and Oxley's
                        names should not be mentioned to the Government.</p>
                    <p>His Lordship asked what was the dispute between the parties.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Warmington said the concession having been granted, parts of it were sold
                        in consideration of £6,000 in one case, £500 in another, and 40,000 shares
                        in a company were to be allotted to Haig for a third part. The purchasing
                        company was Egyptian Sudan Minerals, Ltd., and in order to show that there
                        were no profits in connections with the shares, Haig set up that the shares
                        were subject to an option which he gave to Oxley of purchasing them in
                        blocks of 4,000 at 4s. each for the first block, rising to 12s. per share
                        for the last block. That was a transaction which had no legal validity.
                        Defendants suggested that the plaintiff should be content with the 4s. and
                        not with the price that was actually obtained for the shares from outsiders.
                        They also suggested that certain advertising expenses should be borne by the
                        plaintiff, although the expenses were incurred after the sale.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Younger said the plaintiff was entitled as and when the concessions had
                        been sold and realised to receive one-third of the net profits. Until the
                        transaction was concluded the plaintiff had no rights at all except to see
                        the accounts relating to the transactions and have an account such as had
                        been given to him. His client's position was that there had been no profits
                        realised, but at present a large loss had been sustained. Under these
                        circumstances he contended that the action was misconceived and
                        premature.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Neville said the important question was whether this was a mere
                        partnership at will or not. If by giving the plaintiff one-third of the
                        profits was to give him a right to sell, the result would be disastrous. His
                        contention was that it was a joint adventure, and the plaintiff's rights did
                        not arise until the conclusion of the adventure.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Warmington contended that the plaintiff was entitled to participate in
                        the management, and he was entitled to an account, profits or no profits.
                        He, of course, did not ask for profits until there were some, and if a
                        deficit were shown plaintiff would contribute to it.</p>
                    <p>After some discussion, the parties agreed, without prejudice to any question,
                        the plaintiff admitting he was bound to contribute one equal third of the
                        expenses, that an account should be taken by an official referee of all
                        dealings and transactions between the plaintiff and defendants in connection
                        with the shares mentioned in a letter of the 13th September 1901. Further
                        consideration and costs were reserved, the official referee's account to be
                        conclusive with regard to the figures.</p>

                    <head>SUDAN FINANCE</head>
                    <p>When Lord Cromer's report was published the Sudan accounts for 1904 had not
                        yet been closed. His Lordship approximately estimated the anticipated
                        results as giving L.E. 576,000 revenue and L.E. 629,000 expediture, thus
                        leaving a deficit of L.E. 53,000. The accounts have now been closed, and the
                        total revenue is L.E. 576,013 and expenditure 628,931. The original
                        estimates placed the deficit at L.E. 194,000, revenue L.E. 469,000, and
                        expenditure L.E. 663,000, so the financial result, of the past year must be
                        considered extremely gratifying.</p>
                    <p>The result, however, is in reality not quite so favorable as would appear at
                        first sight, from a consideration of the figures given above.</p>
                    <p>In the first place, the revenue of 1904 has been swollen, to the extent of
                        L.E. 41,000, by certain extraordinary receipts, which will not recur in
                        future years. Under these circumstances, the true revenue of the year may be
                        stated as amounting to L.E. 535,000, or L.E. 66,000 in excess of the
                        original estimate.</p>
                    <p>In the second place, it will be observed that the expenditure (L.E. 621,931),
                        stated in the accounts, is less by L.E. 34,000 than the original estimate
                        (L.E. 663,000). This diminution in expenditure will, of course, go to swell
                        the surplus, and consequently, to increase the Reserve Fund of the Sudan
                        Government. On the other hand, inasmuch as about L.E. 14,000 of this
                        apparent economy does not represent real savings, but is due to the fact
                        that certain liabilities, incurred in 1904, have not yet been met, it is
                        clear that when those liabilities are met, the Reserve Fund will, <hi
                            rend="italic">pro tanto</hi>, be reduced.</p>
                    <p>When, however, due allowance has been made for these considerations, it may
                        confidently be asserted that the financial position of the Sudan shows a
                        very marked improvement as compared to previous years.</p>
                    <p>A consideration of the following figures, which give the amount of revenue
                        estimated as well as that realised, since the re-occupation of the country
                        took place, will show that the improvement has been progressive. The first
                        figures for each year represent the estimated, the second the realised
                        revenue :</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>When, shortly after Lord Kitchener's great victory, the revenue of the Sudan
                        was estimated at the modest figure of L.E. 8,000, few persons could have
                        anticipated that, before six years were over, it would have risen to well
                        over half a million. This result has, however, been achieved. Morever, it
                        has been attained concurrently with the adoption of a system of very light
                        taxation. The reports of all the local officials go to show that throughout
                        the country the taxes are now collected with ease.</p>
                    <p>In Lord Cromer's chapter on Sudan finance there is a passage on the principle
                        of taxation in Oriental countries, which deserves quotation here.</p>
                    <p>"In deciding what general policy is to be adopted in countries such as Egypt
                        and the Sudan, low taxation should be the keystone of the political arch. It
                        brings general tranquillity in its train. It is an essential preliminary to
                        steady and continuous moral and material improement. It allows, either at
                        once or eventually, of the adoption, without serious danger to the State, of
                        a policy in other matters which is in general conformity with the liberal
                        views and traditions of the British Government and of the British nation.
                        Expenditure on objects, however desirable in themselves, should, I venture
                        to think, be rejected, or at all events postponed, rather than that the
                        principle of maintainin taxes at a low figure should be in any degree
                        infringed. That is the policy which, for more than twenty years, has been
                        adopted in Egypt and for some seven years in the Sudan. I have pointed out
                        in this and in previous years, that Egypt has now passed out of the first
                        stage of development. The maintenance of taxation at a low figure for some
                        considerable period has produced its natural effect. The revenue has largely
                        developed. A commencement is now being made with the execution of the second
                        portion of the programme, namely, that which involves an increase of
                        expenditure in order to carry out various reforms and improvements. It
                        cannot be said that the Sudan has as yet emerged from the first stage, but
                        the foundations of a system of government suitable ot the requirements of
                        the country have been laid."</p>
