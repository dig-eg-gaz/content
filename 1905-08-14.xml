                        <head>OUR NEXT GOVERNMENT’S FOREIGN POLICY.</head>

                        <p>If all Radical leaders spoke with the knowledge and moderation employed
                            by Sir Charles Dilke, when discussing foreign affairs, their patriotism
                            would be much more in evidence than has, unfortunately, been the case of
                            late. Lord E. Fitzmaurice also deserves praise for his frank acceptance
                            of the principle that continuity of policy in our relations with other
                            Powers should be, and must be, strictly observed. It is most refreshing
                            and stimulating to have these utterances from representative Radicals
                            after the constant wavering of the Opposition chief. There is the more
                            likelihood that Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman would, if promoted to the
                            Premiership, come to the sound conclusion that instability of purpose in
                            directing the external affairs of the greatest and most widespread
                            Empire in the world would inevitably replace Great Britain in that
                            position of isolation which, not so long ago, crippled her influence
                            among the nations. The proposal to renew our treaty of alliance with
                            Japan, in more extended form, cannot be finally judged on its merits
                            until the de-tails are made known in full. But it is a long step towards
                            its adoption that the bare ‘idea of this new concordat should have
                            re-ceived general approval recently gp both sides </p>
                        <cb n="6"/>
                        <p>of the House. It is manifest that owing to the changes in the balance of
                            Asiatic power and influence resulting from the Russo-Japanese conflict,
                            the whole political situation in the Far East has completely altered. Up
                            to the present the alliance has merely bound Great Britain to help the
                            insular Power, should any other nation interfere in the war on the side
                            of Russia. That was a sufficient object to aim at when hostilities
                            began, and the world owes to it the isolation of both combatants in a
                            comparatively narrow area. But there are other points of danger in Asia
                            to the allies-points where conflict would be inevitable were either to
                            break away from the league of peace. It is, therefore, a perfectly sound
                            and statesmanlike policy on the part of His Majesty's Ministers to renew
                            the agreement in such an enlarged shape as may safeguard the whole of
                            Asia from the devastations of war.</p>
                        <p>It is obvious that the Russian Government would be much less likely to
                            break the peace it aware that Japan was closely associated with Great
                            Britain in its maintenance against all disturbers. There is a moral
                            force as well as a military in alliances: here in Europe the Dual
                            Alliance has continuously operated, ever since it came into being, as a
                            check on the possible aggressiveness of the Triple Allianoe directed
                            from Berlin Chauvinists at St Petersburg and Moscow would think, we may
                            make sure, once, and twioe, about a march to the Indus if that suicidal
                            endeavour would bring upon their over-grown Empire a Japanese invasion
                            of Eastern Siberia. It is this restrictive force on pugnacious
                            proclivities which lends so much value to the enlargement of the present
                            treaty; for one thing, it would render that farther partition of China
                            which is believed to find favor in august quarters at Berlin, well-nigh
                            impracticable. For the Celestial Empire, now so weak and impotent, could
                            then rely on receiving naval and military assistance from the two most
                            powerful fighting nations in Asia; and, with that support, could safely
                            afford to smile at the ‘mailed fist.”</p>
                        <p>As to Africa although it would be premature regard all difficulties in
                            the Congo State, dne to bad administration, as ended, improvements are
                            being introduced generally, while the Congo Government has unreservedly
                            undertaken to give effect to the report of the investigating Commission
                            as soon as it is rendered. It is not unnatural that British
                            philanthropists should display impatience at the secrecy which
                            characterised the inquiry for a time. Bat now that it is moving more
                            quickly in the required direction it would be a mistake on their part to
                            goad such a very willing horse as the present Cabinet It is much the
                            same in the case of Turkey. The Government is doing all in its power to
                            influence the Sultan to introduce administrative and financial reforms
                            without further delay, but Abdul Hamid still shows marked reluctance to
                            be hurried along a path he does not desire to tread. It may be hoped,
                            however, that the slumberous air of Yildiz Kiosk will be wholesomely
                            stirred by the solemn warning which fell from Lord -Percy lately.
                            Without any mincing of phrases, he counselled the Turkish Government to
                            reform its method of rule in Macedonia and else- where, lest “His
                            Majesty’s Government should have to reconsider their attitude.” The
                            Saltan is sufficiently sagacious to place the right construction on this
                            plain intimation, especially as it represents the united resolve of all
                            the Great Powers. Even Germany, so reluctant to give him offence, has at
                            last come into line with the rest of Europe on the burning question of
                            financial reform and its collaterals, and we imagine that here at all
                            events the coming Radical Government is certain to imitate its
                            predecessors in office. It is only over South African matters that a
                            certain uneasiness prevails as to “C. B.’s” intentions, but we doubt
                            whether any revolutionary changes are likely to be made by a Cabinet
                            that is not likely to be supported by a large and united majority.</p>

                        Russia is not vanquished. She has suffered reverses, but is not obliged to

                    <p>TRAMCAR Accident.—A Sudanese, Suroor Abdulla by name, belonging to the
                        Coastguards service, Alexandria, in dismounting from a tram, fell, and
                        received injuries sufficiently severe to necessitate his removal to
                        hospital. The man asserts that the conductor started the tram before he had
                        dismounted, and so caused him to be thrown off by the jerk, whilst the
                        conductor denies having done so, and says that the man sustained his
                        injuries by getting off the tram whilst in motion, contrary to the
                        regulations. An inquirt into the matter is being made by the
                        authorities.</p>
                    <p>British Chamber of Commerce.—We would draw the attention of manufacturers and
                        merchants to the work of the British Chamber of Commerce of Egypt, which was
                        formed in 1896 with the sole object of assisting British trade in this
                        country. The services of the Chamber are always at the disposal of any
                        member desiring information on trade matters generally, including the
                        question of appointing suitable agents. As no fee is charged for such
                        advice, it is obviously in the interests of all British traders here to
                        become members, especially when it is remembered that the annual
                        subscription is merely the nominal one of £1. The latter payment also
                        includes a copy of the monthly Journal issued by the Chamber. Home enquires
                        can obtain further particulars from our London office,'36, New'Broad-street,
                        which acts as agents to the Chamber.</p>
                    <p>The Rev. Roland Wormell assisted, and more than 70 boys and girls spent a
                        most enjoyable afternoon. After partaking of a sumptuous tea, which was
                        provided by Mr. G. B. Alderson, they all adjourned to the lawn, where they
                        disported themselves in all manner of games and races, egg-spoon race, three
                        legged race, tug of war, boys versus girls, etc., for which numerous prize
                        were given, and presented by Mrs. Anastas to each winner. There was also a
                        large number of consolation prizes, thereby making every little heart bright
                        and happy. Several ladies and gentlemen were present to assist in
                        entertaining the children. The proceedings terminated with hearty cheers for
                        Mr. G? B. Alderson, Mr. and Mrs. Anastas, and the ladies and gentlemen who
                        had assisted, and the singing of ‘God save the King” We may add that Mrs.
                        Anastas deserves the thanks of all members of the Church of England in
                        Alexandria for her seven years’ unceasing labours among the children of St.
                        Mark’s Sunday School, whose appreciation of which is seen at a glance,

                    <p>At the inquest held on Saturday before Mr. F. G. Freeman, H.B.M’s
                        Vice-Consul, at Ras el Tin hospital, it was proved that the sad accident, by
                        which Captains Stokes and. Carey lost their lives, took place between 4.30
                        and 5.0 p.m, In his evidence Captain Crawley, A.S.C., stated that hearing a
                        noise at about 5 p.m. he looked from the balcony ot the Beau Rivage Hotel
                        and saw Capt. Carey swimming against the current, and making little or no
                        progress Stokes having disappeared. Hearing him call for help Capt. Crawley
                        ran to the beach, took his coat off, and went in getting to within five or
                        six yards of the swimmer, when the current carried him away to the east. He
                        made a second attempt, this time with a rope, and was himself carried under,
                        and had to be hauled ashore, when Capt. Carey had disap-peared. The other
                        evidence dealt mainly with the attempts at restoring animation in the ease
                        of Capt. Carey, which appear to have been persevered with as long as there
                        was any hope. The jury which consisted of Messrs. J. T. Atkin, J. Gunn, and
                        C. D. Stacey gave a verdict in accordance with the evidence, and recorded
                        their hearty commendation of Capt. Crawley’s courageous attempt at a
                        rescue.</p>
                    <p>At 5 p.m. on Saturday the military funeral started from the Bourse. Shortly
                        before that hour a strong detachment of the 2nd Royal Inniskillking
                        Fusiliers had,arrived by special train from Cairo, and marched to the
                        square, where it was mot by the 2nd Royal Berkshire Regiment, ‘i he
                        procession was preceded by the Egyptian mounted police, who kept the streets
                        clear as far as the Rosetta gate. The military mounted police led the long
                        column, followed by the band of the 2nd Royal Berkshire Regiment, which
                        played the Dead March. The two gun carriages, which conveyed the bodies to
                        their resting place were draped with the Union Jack, and we were glad to
                        note that almost all the Europeans and Syrians who were present— and the
                        cortege passed through crowded streets —sainted the dead. General Bullock,
                        Maj. Ludlow.D.A.A.G., Admiral Sir R M. Blomfield, and several of the

                        detachment, and the 2nd Royal Berkshires brought up the rear. At the Rosetta
                        gate the procession was joined by the firing party, and the two bands of the
                        Inniskillings who played the Dead March as far as the cemetery. The Rev. A.
                        H. Manning, acting-Chaplain to the forces, conducted the burial service by
                        the grave, where a number of beautiful wreaths had been laid by the comrades
                        and friends of the deceased. The coffins were carried into the cemetery by
                        the. sergeants and staff sergeants of the Inniskiliing Fusiliers. On the
                        conclusions of the burial service, the usual volleys were fired over the
                        grave, and the general salute to the dead, and the "Last Post” brought the

                    <p>We mentioned in a recent issue that the above company, which has taken Over
                        the business of Mr. Stangen, the well known German tourist agent,
                        contemplated starting a river passenger service between Cairo and Assouan
                        during the tourist season of 1906-7, to compete with the old established
                        lines of Messrs. Cook and Son, and the Anglo-American Nile Steamer and Hotel
                        Company. Later it was announced that negotiations had been to entered into

                        in conjunction. It appears, from what we now learn, that the negotiations
                        between the two companies are still in progress, and there is every reason
                        to believe that a satisfactory arrangement will be arrived at sood. Several

                    <head>another Theory.</head>
                    <p>We have been shown a letter from a British resident in Constantinople which
                        gives the following news of the bomb outrage against H.I.M. the Sultan. "in
                        a country like this, where nothing in the shape of public meetings is
                        allowed, interest,even in such an occurrence, dies down very quickly. It is,
                        generally speak-ing, dangerous for an ordinary Turk to talk politics,
                        excepting in the privacy of his own house, where, it is to be presumed, no
                        members of the Khafieh are present. Consequently there has been no public
                        display of indignation—or of approbation-and all that I get from peasants,
                        boatmen, and the like, is—“We think it was an Armenian, but, please, may we
                        change the subjeot ?” Preposterous stories were current about the extent of
                        the casualties, many supposing that at least 1,000 persons were disposed of.
                        As a matter of fact, I think, seventeen were killed and forty odd wonnded.
                        The Saltan behaved quite coolly, realising that the danger to his person was
                        passed, and keeping off the crowd of officers and ministers that gathered
                        round him; as much, I fancy, from a desire to avoid another attack with cold
                        steel, as to stop the panic. The police scoured the town, arrested several
                        hundreds of harmless folk, and sent back to their homes as many Armenians
                        and Bulgars not domiciled here, as they could find. They have, as yet, hit
                        on no clue worth anything, though they got up a yam about an india-rubber
                        tyred carriage, which has appeared in all the papers. Many of the
                        best-informed residents think it more probable that the outrage was the work
                        of plotters at the palace—perhaps of the Albanian body guard, who are
                        terribly out of hand at present. Of course the revolutionaries, Armenians
                        and Macedonians, took the “oredit” for a cruel and clumsy outrage, and the
                        police are only too glad to be spared the trouble of ferreting about among
                        the secretaries and chamberlains at Yildiz Kiosk, some of whom are
                        disaffected scoundrels.” </p>

                    <p>A French gentleman, of the name of Emile Jullien, committed suicide yesterday
                        morning by jumping from a third floor balcony into the street. He sustained
                        frightful injuries to the head, and death was almost instantaneous. The
                        deceased, who lived at the Maison Sabbagh, in the Sharia Kasr-el-Nil, with
                        his brother and his family, had been suffering for over a year from
                        melancholia which, at times, assumed an acute form. This was the case on
                        Saturday night, when he was carefully watched. He ran twice to the balcony
                        early in the morning with the intention of jumping over, and was prevented,
                        hot the third time he succeeded in evading his watchers, and accomplished
                        his purpose. The late Monsieur Emile Jullien was a batchelor of 39 years of
                        age, and had formerly been employed at the local Mixed Tribunals. </p>

                        river had been unprecedently low from the middle of May, and that the
                        irrigation of the summer crops had only been rendered possible by the
                        supplementary supply derived from the Assouan-Reservoir. (b) That the flood
                        was very late in its earlier stages, and promised to be low. </p>
                    <p>The Assouan Reservoir was emptied on 20th July (one month later than in
                        1904), since which date the supply in the river has been maintained by the
                        flood, which reached Assouan nearly one month later than the usual time, and
                        then not in sufficient quantity to satisfy the demands for the irrigation of
                        the “sharaki” durah lands as well as the cotton crops, so that it will be
                        found necessary to maintain the canals in the Delta and Middle Egypt until
                        probably the middle of this month. </p>
                    <p>The rice crop, has, naturally, suffered in many places, but the cotton crop
                        has been entirely saved by the Assouan Reservoir. Both in the Delta and
                        Middle Egypt it is stated to be most excellent, and unless unfavorable
                        climatic conditions prevail in September next, the crop should be a record
                        one. The Cotton worm has been practically extirpated, owing to the very
                        energetic and successful measures organised by the Ministry of Interior. </p>
                    <p>The irrigation of the “sharaki" durah lands has been somewhat retarded, but
                        is in advance of the years previous to the construction of the weir below
                        the Delta Barrage and the Assiout Barrage : the delay has caused com plaint,
                        bat it is doubtful if any real damage has been done. It may be noted that in
                        1899, the irrigation of “sharaki” durah lands was not allowed until the 6th
                        August in the Delta, whilst in the present year it was allowed 10 days
                        earlier. Owing to the rise now taking place the irrigation of all crops in
                        the Delta and Middle Egypt is absolutely assured, and no further anxiety
                        need be felt throughout the flood. Regulation is being carried on both at
                        the Delta, Zifta and Assiout Barrages; the latter will be completely closed
                        within the next few days. </p>
                    <p>It may interesting to note that op to date not a drop of water has passed
                        down the two branches of the Nile into the sea. The “sadd” in the Rosetta
                        branch, however, is not likely to stand more than a few days longer. This
                        fact, alone, shows how very late the flood has been, and how usefuls the
                        barrages have been in utilising every drop of water available.</p>
                    <p>At Khartoum.—The following table gives a comparison of the gauges at Khartoum
                        tor 1905, last year, and the two very low years, 1899 and 1902, viz :— </p>
                    <!-- Table insert -->
                    <p>It will be seen from the above that the levels are 1.50 metres below those of
                        last year, which wan by no means a good year, and 25 to 30 centimetres below
                        those of 1899 and 1902, both yearn of extremely low floods. The Hood In the
                        While Nile has been fairly normal that it the Blue Nile completely failed.
                        Captain Lyons, who has most skilfully and so entifically studied the
                        question, states that there wan great deficiency in the rains in Abyssinia
                        during May and June, that in July matters improved, and “that it seems
                        probable that, so far as indications show, the August rains are more likely
                        to be poor than good." The prospects therefore, are not promising,and
                        although a rise has lately taken place on the Blue Nile and the Atbara, the
                        present indication is that the flood of this year will follow that of 1902. </p>

                        for 1905, last year, the very low years 1899 and 1902, as well as the
                        average for the past 30 years.</p>

                    <p>From the above it will be seen that the Assouan gauge is now 2.74 metres
                        below last year and 3.01 metres below the average of the last 30 years.
                        Taking into consideration the rise south of Assouan, now taking place, it is
                        probable that the flood of this year will follow that of 1902. According to
                        the rules of the Public Works Ministry, a “bad Nile” is declared when the
                        Assouan gauge does not reach 13 pics on the 15th August; as there is no
                        possibility of this occurring, the Ministry has decided to declare a “bad
                        Nile” at once, and instructions have been issued to take the same measures
                        as were carried out to meet he low flood of 1902. The area of “sharaki” in
                        1902 was 128,000 feddana, and, unless conditions rapidly improve, it is
                        quite probable that the same area may remain unirrigated by the present
                        flood.</p>
                    <p>Summary —In the Delta and Middle Egypt the irrigation of all crops is assured
                        by the Delta, Zifta and Asriont Barrages, though the durah crops must
                        necessarily be late. In Upper Egypt the conditions are far from favorable
                        and indicate a flood similar, if not inferior, to that of 1902. </p>

                    <p>Egyptian Prisons</p>
                    <p>COLES PASHA’S REPORT.</p>
                    <p>Judicial - (Continued).</p>
                    <p>Juvenile offenders.</p>
                    <p>In my report for 1903 1 drew attention to the fact that upwards of 4,000 boys
                        had been imprisoned during the year, and I expressed a hope that with the
                        revised code, such a record would never have to be made again. My hopes have
                        been so far realised that during the year under report 2,399 juveniles only
                        have been imprisoned, whilst 2,507 have been punished by whipping. I venture
                        to think, .however, that there is still room for improvement in our dealings
                        with juvenile offender, and that though Egyptian magistrates may perhaps be
                        accused of leniency when punishing old offenders they can hardly be found'
                        fault with for soft-heartedness, when administering justice to children.</p>
                    <p>Offences committed by juveniles.</p>
                    <p>In the present report I have been able to supply much more detailed
                        information regard ing juvenile criminals than, in any previous report, and
                        I have devoted two tables entirely to young criminals. In the first,
                        offences com-mitted by juveniles are classified and the punishments awarded
                        given, In the second, the classification shows the Courts that have dealt
                        with such cases. </p>
                    <p>If we first examine the offences committed</p>
                    <p>and punishments awarded we find</p>
                    <p>Casos. Imprisoned. Whipped.</p>
                    <p>Contraventions 2,461 1,161 1,299</p>
                    <p>Assaults 1,165 518 647</p>
                    <p>Thefts .. 839 484 354</p>
                    <p>The contraveners are many of them little shoe blacks without their regulation
                        “number,” or boys leading about blind beggars in proscrib ed quarters.
                        “Assault” means boys fighting md squabbling together, and the majority of
                        the little thieves (judging from those sent to the Reformatory*) are first
                        offenders. It is true that some of these children were imprisoned in default
                        of payment of a fine, but unless a child's parents can be made to pay the
                        fine, such a punishment means imprisonment for the child.</p>
                    <p>Boys cannot be sent to a Reformatory unless they have committed a crime or
                        délit, and in the absence of any Industrial Schools, it is,</p>
                    <p>[ admit, very difficult for judges to deal with such cases, but I am
                        convinced, that in many of them, a police prosecution is quite unnecessary,
                        and out of such a large number of cases only 87 youthful offenders (see
                        Judicial Adviser's Report) handed over to their parents a very small
                        percentage.</p>
                    <p>Ju'venile crime - where committed.</p>
                    <p>The number of young delinquents sentenced has little or no connection with
                        the population. For instance, Mehaila-el-Kubra is one of the largest town in
                        Egypt, and yet 15 boys only were whipped and none imprisoned throughout the
                        year. Mansonrah, too, has only 34 cases, whilst small villages like
                        Dikurnis, Samalloot, Deshna, Itai-el-Barood have many more apparently than
                        their share.</p>
                    <p>Juvenile courts.</p>
                    <p>The Ministry of Justice has lately established a juvenile court in Cairo and
                        a special judge sits once a week to deal with youthful offenders, but
                        personally I am rather doubtful whether this “tentative measure” will prove
                        very efficacious. The fact that the judge only sits once a week is of itself
                        a grave objection, as a sentence of whipping after a child has been several
                        days in prison defeats the purpose for which whipping is recommended. This
                        judge, too, can only deal with a small portion of the cases occurring in
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p> The problem is not easy of solution, but I am inclined to think that the
                        remedy lies more with the Procureur General’s Department than with the
                        Courts. A special Bureau dealing with juveniles, and a single member of the
                        Parquet receiving daily reports of cases and children awaiting trial in
                        prison throughout Egypt, will very soon check excessive zeal on the part of
                        police, or carelessness, or neglect, on the part of the Parquet ; especially
                        if all cases in which juveniles are concerned have precedence over ordinary
                        cases, and judges know that want of appreciation of instructions on their
                        part, will be heard of again. i may say that the Procureur General has
                        already acted in the matter somewhat on these lines, and if his circular
                        orders lately issued are obeyed by both Police and Parquet, we should see a
                        considerable improvement daring the current year. </p>
                    <p>Industrial school.</p>
                    <p>What is really required, too, is a special law for the Waifs and Strays of
                        the large towns and an establishment on the Reformatory model in which they
                        can be, received. Parents are constantly asking me to take charge of unruly
                        sous, and little homeless vagabonds have even come to me and asked to be
                        admitted to the Reformatory. It is with great reluctance that they have been
                        told that entrance to the Reformatory can only be gained through a Criminal
                        Court.</p>
                    <p>If such a law be passed, and a school be provided in addition to the
                        Reformatory, juveniles will very soon disappear from our prisons. </p>
                    <p>Labour in lieu of imprisonment.</p>
                    <p>We have seen that the number of persons imprisoned in default of payment of
                        fine has largely decreased, owing to the revision of the law which now makes
                        it less profitable to go to prison. For similar reasons, the number of
                        persons who elected to labour in lieu of imprisonment has decreased from
                        61,728 in 1993 to 43,684 in 1904.</p>
                    <p>This decrease is the most, marked in the large towns or bandars, especially
                        in Cairo and Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>Of the number who elected to work 92% completed their task, 1,168 or 3%
                        failed to report themselves, and 2,301 or 4% failed to complete their task
                        and were subsequently imprisoned. In 1903 the percentage were 93; 2; and 4
                        respectively.</p>
                    <p>(To be continued).</p>
                    <p> *Of the 1904 boys sent to Reformatory 80010 were first offenders. </p>

                    <p>IN THE Isles OF GREECE.</p>
                    <p> Of "many-gated Thebes,” there is little trace but broken potsherds ; at
                        Chaerones nothing whatsoever butt fragments of the colossal lion which
                        commemorated the valour of the Greeks who fell fighting against Philip of
                        Macedon, in that lost battle which was “the beginning evil to all the
                        Greeks.” Is it worth while to spend seven or eight hours in the train for
                        this ? Some two-thirds of our number decide that it is, and depart for the
                        Piaeus and Athens after a hurried breakfast. We who have chosen the better
                        part, watch them start (with mutual feelings of superiority), and then go
                        down to a more leisurely meal, after which we settle ourselves on deck. A
                        more perfect morning it would be hard to ima gine. ‘ Sea-girt Salamis,” far
                        astern, is a blue cloud on the horizon ; Athens is growing misty and unreal,
                        the city of a dream ; but we keep the crest of the Acropolis in sight until
                        we reach Cape Colonna, that classic headland (Sunium) which we have to play
                        off against the ruins of Thebes. Here, on the edge of the high promontory,
                        to which, 2,000 years ago, Plato came to meditate, twelve slender Doric
                        columns stand out milk white against the azure of the sky. These are all
                        that remain of the Temple of Pallas Athene, which, hallowing the “vestibule
                        of Attica,” was visible from afar to the eager eyes of the homeward bound
                        Athenian mariner. Hence, it was said, he could see the sunshine glittering
                        on the Spear of the colossal statue of Athene, the site of which we saw
                        yesterday on the Acropolis ; while from Athens, watchers could distinguish
                        whether the vessels rounding Cape Sunium bore the white sails which told of
                        victory, or the black, which signified defeat. It is very sad to be robbed
                        of one’s illusions, bat the Greeks must have possessed either field-glasses
                        equal to ours, or eyesight vastly better ! </p>
                    <p>Colonna rounded, our course curves northward, and soon after lunch we are
                        within sight of the Bay of Marathon—a scene which we feel with intense
                        satisfaction to be far superior in historical value to the battlefield of
                        Chæronea. It must be confessed that the savants on board are not in complete
                        agreement as to the precise spot on which the great fight took place, and a
                        lively argument ensues. What matter ? It is enough to know that some-where
                        on the sands of that quiet bay the Persian host disembarked, and that
                        somewhere amid the tangle of hills which guard it was the Athenian camp. A
                        mile or so more to north. or south, what, after all, does it matter ? “The
                        mountains look on Marathon,” and we too have looked, and beheld the scene of
                        the Greeks most splendid triumph.</p>
                    <p>And now, through the golden afternoon, we glide softly along the Egripos
                        Channel, with the mainland, fertile here and wooded—and rather like the
                        Kyles of Rute—upon the left,and on the right the shores of Egripos, the
                        classic Euboea. This beautiful island, ninety miles in length, is traversed
                        by a mountain chain, a continuation of Pelion, and we pass a succession of
                        wild; fantastic peaks; incredibly purple, impossibly blue. And in the midst
                        of the island, dominating the whole—a vision of dazzling snow-white, flecked
                        with shadows of brilliant cobalt—the splendid crest of Dirphe, more than
                        7,000 feet high, soars up into the,sky.</p>
                    <p>This day of leisure was to have seen many tasks accomplished, but it ends
                        with letters still unwritten, books unread, work untouched. To drink in as
                        much as possible of the beauty of earth, sky, and sea is the first and
                        paramount duty. Tea-time has come and gone, and we have come to the narrow
                        strait.</p>
                    <p>“Where Chalcis faces Aulis’ shore, And Aulis’ waters ebb and flow,”</p>
                    <p>Aulis, it may be explained, has four changes of the tide daily, which is not
                        what one would expect in the Mediterranean, Soundings are taken, the anchor
                        goes down, and the electric launch and ship’s boats are despatched to bring
                        back the Theban band. At what precise spot they are to be picked up no one
                        seems to know. One passenger, with more imagination than clearness of
                        vision, announces that she has discovered the travellers encamped upon the
                        shore, and recognised them by their Panama hats But, alas ! for the theory,
                        the group is presently seen to disperse, and the Panama hats resolve
                        themselves into a flock of goats ! Wherever they may be, our lost friends
                        are not there.</p>
                    <p>Time passes. Seven o’clock comes,and with it the inspiriting bugle call which
                        proclaims that the roast beef of old England awaits us, and in obedience to
                        the sommons we go down and dine.</p>
                    <p>Eight o’olock, and we are on deck again in brilliant moonlight which turns
                        prosaic masts and planks and spars into ebony and alabaster, and the quiet
                        waters round us into</p>
                    <p>“Perilous seas in faery lands forlorn."</p>
                    <p>‘ What has become of the launch?” we ask each other ; and “What has happened
                        to the Thebans is the question which begins to agitate anxious wives whose
                        husbands are on shore. Towards nine o'clock they return. It is hardly fair
                        for those who have not dined to be kept parleying with us who have, but they
                        have to run in the gauntlet of a good deal of questioning. “ Tired ? Oh, no,
                        thank yon, not at all. Accidents? No, nothing has gone wrong except a
                        steward overboard, and he quite enjoyed his immersion. Thebes was most
                        interesting, and the loveliest place you ever saw, and altogether to-day has
                        been quite the best thing in the whole cruise.” We think the same, and so
                        every one is pleased. And presently, while we turn in to dream of</p>
                    <p>“Summer isles of Eden lying . In dark purple spheres of sea.”</p>
                    <p>the Argonaut retraces her course southwards and, rounding the southern
                        extremity of Euboes makes for the coast of Asia Minor</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>It is high noon when we reach Assos. The sunshine is fiercer than any we have
                        felt as yet and the anchor clanks down into water which looks like solid
                        turquoise —a curiousous opaque blue which changes in the shallows near the
                        shore into transparent emerald. Turks in gorgeous raiment stand in rows upon
                        the tiny landing-stage and survey the British tourists with that combination
                        of interest and dignified calm which is to be seen only in the East.</p>
                    <p>An ancient writer, who possibly was fat and scant of breath, is supposed to
                        have said : “If you wish to hasten your death, climb Assos !” No one can
                        feel weary of life on this exquisite spring afternoon, but every,one obeys
                        the injunction of Statonicus, and a long procession is soon toiling up the
                        narrow and well-nigh perpendicular path which leads up to the crater of an
                        extinct volcano, the summit of which the Greeks who colonized Assos chose,
                        as was their wont everywhere, as a building site. Bright-hued, short-stalked
                        flowers enamel the face of the cliff, and when at last,after a climb of
                        nearly 800 feet, we arrive panting at the top we find the short, thymy
                        grass, on which we fling ourselves to rest, full of tiny scarlet anemones,
                        purple dwarf campanulas, and the creamy rock-rose.</p>
                    <p>Rains there are every where. Just below us is a mass of masonry projecting
                        from the hill side, howing where the great fortified city wall once ran, and
                        fragments of Doric columns strew the temple precincts,, where, amid the
                        relics of by-gone gradeur, shaggy brown calves are grazing, herded by
                        picturesque Turkish hoys, who,in spite of their Moslem creed, stand with
                        evident gratification to be photographed. The sites of theatre and
                        stos,agora, treasury,gymnasium,and the rest are all to be traced by the
                        antiquary, but,after what we saw in Athens,they do not greatly impress the
                        average intelligence. What alone is worth the climb, had it been twice as
                        long, and twice as hot—twice as steep it could hardly have been — is the
                        view from this rockfortress. which is celebrated as one of the finest sites
                        in Asia Minor.</p>
                    <p>Standing, as we do, on the crest of the promontory, we can look down on two
                        harbours—that on which we landed, and another, to which we shall presently
                        descend by a less precipitous path, where the remains ot an ancient mole or
                        jetty are still discernible. Opposite us, as we look south, lies Mitylene,
                        “the noble and pleasant island of Lesbos,” as Tacitus called it, birthplace
                        of “burning Sappho and on the left the coast line of the Troad treads away
                        eastwards, and the snowy summit of the many-fonntained Ida rises cloud like
                        into an unclouded sky. The prospect is such as to hold one spell-bound for a
                        long time, but at last it becomes necessary, or at least advisable, to move
                        on, and, leaving the Acropolis and its polygonal enclosing wall, we come to
                        the Turkish village of Behram, which occupies a terrace on the south-east
                        side of the cone. It is a bundle of white, windowless houses, grouped round
                        a dilapidated mosque.</p>
                    <p>From this point the hill slopes gently down to the banks of a river, which
                        our guide intro-duces as “divine Scamander,” but which, alas for his
                        veracity, turns out to ' be only the Touzla, the ancient Satniœis, which
                        Honor mentions as flowing past “high Pedassos.” There is very little water
                        in it just now, but in winter it is doubtless a rushing torrent, and it is
                        spanned by a fine old bridge.</p>
                    <p>All this side of the hill is dotted with sarcophagi—grim coffers of stone
                        which make of this flowery, sun baked path a veritable “street of the
                        tombs.' How many of us knew before, I wonder, what we are told by an
                        omniscient member of the party respecting the origin of the term
                        "sarcophagus?” The literal meaning of the word, it seems, is,“flesh-eating,”
                        and, according to Pliny, the trachyte of which these tombs were made had the
                        property of consuming or causing to waste away the bodies which they
                        contained.</p>
                    <p>Another pause to enjoy the beauty and exquisite peace this fresh view, and
                        the new turn our faces seawards again, this time skirting the other side of
                        the Acropolis rock, and passing the old gateway by which St. Paul entered
                        the city when on his last missionary journey, he came hither from Troas,
                        walking across the headland, round which his companions sailed. In so
                        leisurely a fashion do we make our way back that by the time we have reached
                        the harbour and the waiting boats, the sun is dipping into the sea and the
                        western sky is beginning to hang out pennons and streamers of flame-oolour,
                        scarlet and rose.</p>
                    <p>Yonder to the south-east is Dikili, the little port at which, early
                        to-morrow, some of us are to disembark for Pergamon. Tiny as it is, it
                        nevertheless boasts a telegraph office, and a busy man who is enjoying a
                        well-earned holiday remarks with some trepidation, “I told them at home that
                        if I were wanted back in a hurry they might wire to Dikili, but (hopefully)
                        I am sure they won’t know where it it!”</p>
                    <p>Once more evening has fallen, and we are back on the boat after a hot but
                        delightful day at Mitylene. Time fails in which to tell of the morning’s
                        sightseeing—of the climb to the in-avitable theatre—the modern cathedral,
                        where we are shown a fine marble chair of untold antiquity brought from the
                        ruined theatre, and displaying on one side a carven Sphinx, and on the other
                        the twisted coils of Aescula-pius's snakes of the ancient citadel, now a
                        Turkish fort, into which we are courteously welcomed by a benevolent old
                        general wearing red slippers and medals galore. Nor can much be told of the
                        afternoon, spent by a select and privileged few in exploring the town itself
                        under the auspices of a great traveller who had lived in it, and knew its
                        people well in buy-ing fascinating water-jars, and sampling strange drinks
                        outside a cafe where flaneurs, red-fezzed and swarthy, sat and smoked the
                        nargileh or pipe of peace. Strange that the word “Mitylene,” , which a week
                        ago conveyed so little to onr ears, will henoeforward be sufficient to
                        present to memory a bizarre, many-hued kaleidoscopic picture of Eastern
                        life.</p>
                    <cb n="4"/>
                    <p>The party from Pergamon come in while we are drinking our after-dinner
                        coffee, very proud of having visited one of the “Seven Churches,” very stiff
                        and sore after-six hours of bumping in native carts. In comparing- our
                        respective experiences the evening slips away and before the break of dawn
                        we are in sight of Smyrna.</p>

                <div type="article">
                    <p>CAPTAIN KISHIWADA.</p>
                    <p> He was an officer of reserves, and had waited patiently for embarkation
                        orders. In the meantime he had worked at the common task, the daily round,
                        that of a stationer. Month after month clipped by, hot Kishiwada’s
                        enthusiasm for active service was not rewarded. He spent his lunch hour over
                        at the railway station, watching the troop-trains running through the
                        flagged way. He waved to the truck loads of bluecoated infantry, and cheered
                        when the children cheered. Then the day of all days came, and the envelope
                        with orders for the front.</p>
                    <p>One morning I was riding down the main street of Yokohama and saw an officer
                        of in fantry, a little sturdy, blue-uniformed man, and his face was all
                        aglow like the rising sun of Nippon. A rickshaw man pulled up, lifted his
                        mushroom straw hat, and bowed to the officer and offered him a ride. The
                        officer was Captain Kishiwada, and when he rode off down the street the
                        little girls followed, and then the little boys, and then the big girls and
                        big boys, until half of Yokohamo seemed to be running after Captain
                        Kishiwada’s rickshaw. Here and there the rickshaw pulled up while the
                        Captain went into different shops. I presumed he was making purchases. While
                        inside, the little Jap boys with soldier caps waved small flags and sang war
                        songs, and when the Captain appeared again they cheered and shouted “Nippon
                        Banzai” until they were hoarse.</p>
                    <p>Here was a nation with half a million troops at the front making a fuss over
                        one solitary member of the force. It all looked so childish, Imagine an
                        officer in London riding about the streets making calls and followed by a
                        lot of street children hanging on to his cab. But was it all so childish
                        ?</p>
                    <p>Then the rickshaw stopped outside a fancy goods shop, a little one-roomed
                        place. After the Captain came ont I went in and made a purchase. Then I
                        tried to find out who the Captain was. I said to the little proprietor :</p>
                    <p>"I hope the Captain has made a big order with you.” The little proprietor
                        replied : “Oh, no. That was Captain Kishiwada, my brother. He is off to the
                        front, and has just been saying good-bye to the different business people
                        who are his friends. He is my brother.”</p>
                    <p>I asked the fancy goods man, why he, too, was not at the front, and the
                        expression that came over his face was the most depressing I have ever seen.
                        It was one of acute and intense disappointment. The fancy goods man bared
                        his arm, and in very sad tones remarked, “You see that my arm is thin. It
                        could not hold a sword. There is no chance for me. I cannot go to the front
                        I am an invalid.” Then he turned away. The ordeal was too much for him. A
                        little later he came hack to me, and with pride pointed down the road, where
                        Captain Kishi-wada’s rickshaw was standing “Ah! but my brother is strong. I
                        said to him when I bade him gopd-hye, “When yon strike for Nippon, strike a
                        blow for me," and my brother will. I had another brother, on the staff of
                        Nogi, bat he is dead. He was killed. Captain Kishiwada will not come back
                        either. He will be killed too.” I came out of the shop and walked down the
                        street. Over Kishiwada’s shop was a flag with a great, big, red sun on it, I
                        thought over the fancy-goods man's words. I thought of the army that had
                        business men on the General Staff, whose officers were plain business
                        people, and whose officers were not ashamed of the fact. Then I thought of
                        another army, and it almost made me sick thinking.</p>

                    <p>FLOWER FARMING.</p>
                    <p>AN AUSTRALIAN EXPERIMENT.</p>
                    <p>Although Nature has become largely replaced by Science in the manufacture of
                        choice perfumes and essential oils, the demand for flowers for industrial
                        purposes in various parts of the world is being steadily maintained, and in
                        Europe and America flower farming is conducted on an extensive and
                        remunerative scale. Yet in the countries of the Commonwealth, so rich in
                        plants yielding delicious perfumes and valuable essential oils, little or
                        nothing has been done, so far, to practically utilise the advantages thus
                        afforded. Systematic flower farming is, says a Sidney correspondent, still
                        in its experimental stages, and there exists an almost untouched field of
                        illimitable extent at the command of those possessing the necessary capital
                        and experience in the manufacture of perfumery and essential oils.</p>
                    <p>IN Australia the garden flowers of Europe and Asia, especially those emitting
                        the richest fragrance, are found growing in unsurpassed luxuriance, many
                        being obtainable nearly all the year round, their profusion and cheapness
                        proving how easily they are reared. Several of the essential oils obtained
                        from the leaves of native plants are really perfumes, and their chief use is
                        in scenting soaps and other preparations. The quantities used are small,
                        most of the plants being wild. Among the native perfume-yielding plants
                        which remain un-utilised are several varieties of acacis, includ-ing a few
                        which furnish a scented wood. The Acacia Farnesiana, which is largely
                        cultivated in Italy and the South of Franoe—the well-known pomade, called
                        “Cassia,” being produced by placing the sweet-scented flowers in melted
                        mutton fat or olive oil, until the latter become impregnated with their
                        odour—grows plentifully in many parts of New South Wales and other States ;
                        and another species of acacia, familiarly known as the Golden Wattle, is
                        equally useful as a perfume plant ; as is also the Native Laurel, or Mock
                        Orange.</p>
                    <p>Among the plants from which sweet scented and other oils may be obtained are
                        the Native Sassafras. Peppermint, Bloodwood, Blue Gum, Mountain Ash, White
                        Gum, Ironbark, Woolly Butt, Spotted Gum, TallowWood, Messmate, Red Gum,
                        Poplar Box, and other species of Eucalyptus ; Ridge Myrtle, Tea-tree, Native
                        Peppermint, Dog-wood, and Turmeric. Practically, the number of native shrubs
                        and trees in the Commonwealth capable of being utilised in the manufacture
                        of perfumes and essential oils is without limit, and when the large
                        quantities of either product, obtainable from compara-tively small
                        proportions of bark or leaves, is taken into consideration, it will be seen
                        that in this direction Australia possesses exceptional advantages for those
                        possessing the requisite capital and experience to establish large and
                        remunerative productive industries. It may a;lso be mentioned that the
                        Olive, Castor Oil Plant, and Linseed grow luxuriantly in the Commonwealth,
                        and are easily cultivated.</p>
