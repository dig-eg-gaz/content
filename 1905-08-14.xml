                        <head>OUR NEXT GOVERNMENT’S FOREIGN POLICY.</head>

                        <p>If all Radical leaders spoke with the knowledge and moderation employed
                            by Sir Charles Dilke, when discussing foreign affairs, their patriotism
                            would be much more in evidence than has, unfortunately, been the case of
                            late. Lord E. Fitzmaurice also deserves praise for his frank acceptance
                            of the principle that continuity of policy in our relations with other
                            Powers should be, and must be, strictly observed. It is most refreshing
                            and stimulating to have these utterances from representative Radicals
                            after the constant wavering of the Opposition chief. There is the more
                            likelihood that Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman would, if promoted to the
                            Premiership, come to the sound conclusion that instability of purpose in
                            directing the external affairs of the greatest and most widespread
                            Empire in the world would inevitably replace Great Britain in that
                            position of isolation which, not so long ago, crippled her influence
                            among the nations. The proposal to renew our treaty of alliance with
                            Japan, in more extended form, cannot be finally judged on its merits
                            until the de-tails are made known in full. But it is a long step towards
                            its adoption that the bare ‘idea of this new concordat should have
                            re-ceived general approval recently gp both sides </p>
                        <cb n="6"/>
                        <p>of the House. It is manifest that owing to the changes in the balance of
                            Asiatic power and influence resulting from the Russo-Japanese conflict,
                            the whole political situation in the Far East has completely altered. Up
                            to the present the alliance has merely bound Great Britain to help the
                            insular Power, should any other nation interfere in the war on the side
                            of Russia. That was a sufficient object to aim at when hostilities
                            began, and the world owes to it the isolation of both combatants in a
                            comparatively narrow area. But there are other points of danger in Asia
                            to the allies-points where conflict would be inevitable were either to
                            break away from the league of peace. It is, therefore, a perfectly sound
                            and statesmanlike policy on the part of His Majesty's Ministers to renew
                            the agreement in such an enlarged shape as may safeguard the whole of
                            Asia from the devastations of war.</p>
                        <p>It is obvious that the Russian Government would be much less likely to
                            break the peace it aware that Japan was closely associated with Great
                            Britain in its maintenance against all disturbers. There is a moral
                            force as well as a military in alliances: here in Europe the Dual
                            Alliance has continuously operated, ever since it came into being, as a
                            check on the possible aggressiveness of the Triple Allianoe directed
                            from Berlin Chauvinists at St Petersburg and Moscow would think, we may
                            make sure, once, and twioe, about a march to the Indus if that suicidal
                            endeavour would bring upon their over-grown Empire a Japanese invasion
                            of Eastern Siberia. It is this restrictive force on pugnacious
                            proclivities which lends so much value to the enlargement of the present
                            treaty; for one thing, it would render that farther partition of China
                            which is believed to find favor in august quarters at Berlin, well-nigh
                            impracticable. For the Celestial Empire, now so weak and impotent, could
                            then rely on receiving naval and military assistance from the two most
                            powerful fighting nations in Asia; and, with that support, could safely
                            afford to smile at the ‘mailed fist.”</p>
                        <p>As to Africa although it would be premature regard all difficulties in
                            the Congo State, dne to bad administration, as ended, improvements are
                            being introduced generally, while the Congo Government has unreservedly
                            undertaken to give effect to the report of the investigating Commission
                            as soon as it is rendered. It is not unnatural that British
                            philanthropists should display impatience at the secrecy which
                            characterised the inquiry for a time. Bat now that it is moving more
                            quickly in the required direction it would be a mistake on their part to
                            goad such a very willing horse as the present Cabinet It is much the
                            same in the case of Turkey. The Government is doing all in its power to
                            influence the Sultan to introduce administrative and financial reforms
                            without further delay, but Abdul Hamid still shows marked reluctance to
                            be hurried along a path he does not desire to tread. It may be hoped,
                            however, that the slumberous air of Yildiz Kiosk will be wholesomely
                            stirred by the solemn warning which fell from Lord -Percy lately.
                            Without any mincing of phrases, he counselled the Turkish Government to
                            reform its method of rule in Macedonia and else- where, lest “His
                            Majesty’s Government should have to reconsider their attitude.” The
                            Saltan is sufficiently sagacious to place the right construction on this
                            plain intimation, especially as it represents the united resolve of all
                            the Great Powers. Even Germany, so reluctant to give him offence, has at
                            last come into line with the rest of Europe on the burning question of
                            financial reform and its collaterals, and we imagine that here at all
                            events the coming Radical Government is certain to imitate its
                            predecessors in office. It is only over South African matters that a
                            certain uneasiness prevails as to “C. B.’s” intentions, but we doubt
                            whether any revolutionary changes are likely to be made by a Cabinet
                            that is not likely to be supported by a large and united majority.</p>

                    unexpectedly light, as the authorities fear to take extreme measures. Fifteen

                <p>British Chamber of Commerce.—We would draw the attention of manufacturers and
                    merchants to the work of the British Chamber of Commerce of Egypt, which was
                    formed in 1896 with the sole object of assisting British trade in this country.
                    The services of the Chamber are always at the disposal of any member desiring
                    information on trade matters generally, including the question of appointing
                    suitable agents. As no fee is charged for such advice, it is obviously in the
                    interests of all British traders here to become members, especially when it is
                    remembered that the annual subscription is merely the nominal one of £1. The
                    latter payment also includes a copy of the monthly Journal issued by the
                    Chamber. Home enquires can obtain further particulars from our London

                    Mr. G. B. Alderson, they all adjourned to the lawn, where they disported
                    themselves in all manner of games and races, egg-spoon race, three legged race,
                    tug of war, boys versus girls, etc., for which numerous prize were given, and
                    presented by Mrs. Anastas to each winner. There was also a large number of
                    consolation prizes, thereby making every little heart bright and happy. Several
                    ladies and gentlemen were present to assist in entertaining the children. The
                    proceedings terminated with hearty cheers for Mr. G? B. Alderson, Mr. and Mrs.
                    Anastas, and the ladies and gentlemen who had assisted, and the singing of ‘God

                    of the Church of England in Alexandria for her seven years’ unceasing labours
                    among the children of St. Mark’s Sunday School, whose appreciation of which is

                <p>At the inquest held on Saturday before Mr. F. G. Freeman, H.B.M’s Vice-Consul, at
                    Ras el Tin hospital, it was proved that the sad accident, by which Captains
                    Stokes and. Carey lost their lives, took place between 4.30 and 5.0 p.m, In his
                    evidence Captain Crawley, A.S.C., stated that hearing a noise at about 5 p.m. he
                    looked from the balcony ot the Beau Rivage Hotel and saw Capt. Carey swimming
                    against the current, and making little or no progress Stokes having disappeared.
                    Hearing him call for help Capt. Crawley ran to the beach, took his coat off, and
                    went in getting to within five or six yards of the swimmer, when the current
                    carried him away to the east. He made a second attempt, this time with a rope,
                    and was himself carried under, and had to be hauled ashore, when Capt. Carey had
                    disap-peared. The other evidence dealt mainly with the attempts at restoring
                    animation in the ease of Capt. Carey, which appear to have been persevered with
                    as long as there was any hope. The jury which consisted of Messrs. J. T. Atkin,
                    J. Gunn, and C. D. Stacey gave a verdict in accordance with the evidence, and
                    recorded their hearty commendation of Capt. Crawley’s courageous attempt at a
                    rescue.</p>
                <p>At 5 p.m. on Saturday the military funeral started from the Bourse. Shortly

                    Body and the British community followed. The Iunis-killings detachment, and the
                    2nd Royal Berkshires brought up the rear. At the Rosetta gate the procession was
                    joined by the firing party, and the two bands of the Inniskillings who played
                    the Dead March as far as the cemetery. The Rev. A. H. Manning, acting-Chaplain
                    to the forces, conducted the burial service by the grave, where a number of
                    beautiful wreaths had been laid by the comrades and friends of the deceased. The
                    coffins were carried into the cemetery by the. sergeants and staff sergeants of
                    the Inniskiliing Fusiliers. On the conclusions of the burial service, the usual
                    volleys were fired over the grave, and the general salute to the dead, and the

                <p>We mentioned in a recent issue that the above company, which has taken Over the
                    business of Mr. Stangen, the well known German tourist agent, contemplated
                    starting a river passenger service between Cairo and Assouan during the tourist
                    season of 1906-7, to compete with the old established lines of Messrs. Cook and
                    Son, and the Anglo-American Nile Steamer and Hotel Company. Later it was
                    announced that negotiations had been to entered into between the latte and the
                    Hamburg-Amerika Company to work the two services in conjunction. It appears,
                    from what we now learn, that the negotiations between the two companies are
                    still in progress, and there is every reason to believe that a satisfactory
                    arrangement will be arrived at sood. Several meetings have already taken place
                    in Europe between the representatives of both sides, but nothing definite has

                <head>CONSTANTINOPLE OUTRAGE</head>
                <head>another Theory.</head>
                <p>We have been shown a letter from a British resident in Constantinople which gives
                    the following news of the bomb outrage against H.I.M. the Sultan. "in a country
                    like this, where nothing in the shape of public meetings is allowed,
                    interest,even in such an occurrence, dies down very quickly. It is, generally
                    speak-ing, dangerous for an ordinary Turk to talk politics, excepting in the
                    privacy of his own house, where, it is to be presumed, no members of the Khafieh
                    are present. Consequently there has been no public display of indignation—or of
                    approbation-and all that I get from peasants, boatmen, and the like, is—“We
                    think it was an Armenian, but, please, may we change the subjeot ?” Preposterous
                    stories were current about the extent of the casualties, many supposing that at
                    least 1,000 persons were disposed of. As a matter of fact, I think, seventeen
                    were killed and forty odd wonnded. The Saltan behaved quite coolly, realising
                    that the danger to his person was passed, and keeping off the crowd of officers
                    and ministers that gathered round him; as much, I fancy, from a desire to avoid
                    another attack with cold steel, as to stop the panic. The police scoured the
                    town, arrested several hundreds of harmless folk, and sent back to their homes
                    as many Armenians and Bulgars not domiciled here, as they could find. They have,
                    as yet, hit on no clue worth anything, though they got up a yam about an
                    india-rubber tyred carriage, which has appeared in all the papers. Many of the
                    best-informed residents think it more probable that the outrage was the work of
                    plotters at the palace—perhaps of the Albanian body guard, who are terribly out
                    of hand at present. Of course the revolutionaries, Armenians and Macedonians,
                    took the “oredit” for a cruel and clumsy outrage, and the police are only too
                    glad to be spared the trouble of ferreting about among the secretaries and
                    chamberlains at Yildiz Kiosk, some of whom are disaffected scoundrels.” </p>
                <p>SHOCKING SUICIDE IN CAIRO</p>
                <p>A French gentleman, of the name of Emile Jullien, committed suicide yesterday
                    morning by jumping from a third floor balcony into the street. He sustained
                    frightful injuries to the head, and death was almost instantaneous. The
                    deceased, who lived at the Maison Sabbagh, in the Sharia Kasr-el-Nil, with his
                    brother and his family, had been suffering for over a year from melancholia
                    which, at times, assumed an acute form. This was the case on Saturday night,
                    when he was carefully watched. He ran twice to the balcony early in the morning
                    with the intention of jumping over, and was prevented, hot the third time he
                    succeeded in evading his watchers, and accomplished his purpose. The late
                    Monsieur Emile Jullien was a batchelor of 39 years of age, and had formerly been
                    employed at the local Mixed Tribunals. </p>

                <head>The Nile FLOOD.</head>
                <head>MR. WEBB’S Report</head>
                <p>In my last note I pointed out the following, viz (a) that the levels of the river
                    had been unprecedently low from the middle of May, and that the irrigation of
                    the summer crops had only been rendered possible by the supplementary supply
                    derived from the Assouan-Reservoir. (b) That the flood was very late in its
                    earlier stages, and promised to be low. </p>
                <p>The Assouan Reservoir was emptied on 20th July (one month later than in 1904),
                    since which date the supply in the river has been maintained by the flood, which
                    reached Assouan nearly one month later than the usual time, and then not in
                    sufficient quantity to satisfy the demands for the irrigation of the “sharaki”
                    durah lands as well as the cotton crops, so that it will be found necessary to
                    maintain the canals in the Delta and Middle Egypt until probably the middle of
                    this month. </p>
                <p>The rice crop, has, naturally, suffered in many places, but the cotton crop has
                    been entirely saved by the Assouan Reservoir. Both in the Delta and Middle Egypt
                    it is stated to be most excellent, and unless unfavorable climatic conditions
                    prevail in September next, the crop should be a record one. The Cotton worm has
                    been practically extirpated, owing to the very energetic and successful measures
                    organised by the Ministry of Interior. </p>
                <p>The irrigation of the “sharaki" durah lands has been somewhat retarded, but is in
                    advance of the years previous to the construction of the weir below the Delta
                    Barrage and the Assiout Barrage : the delay has caused com plaint, bat it is
                    doubtful if any real damage has been done. It may be noted that in 1899, the
                    irrigation of “sharaki” durah lands was not allowed until the 6th August in the
                    Delta, whilst in the present year it was allowed 10 days earlier. Owing to the
                    rise now taking place the irrigation of all crops in the Delta and Middle Egypt
                    is absolutely assured, and no further anxiety need be felt throughout the flood.
                    Regulation is being carried on both at the Delta, Zifta and Assiout Barrages;
                    the latter will be completely closed within the next few days. </p>
                <p>It may interesting to note that op to date not a drop of water has passed down
                    the two branches of the Nile into the sea. The “sadd” in the Rosetta branch,
                    however, is not likely to stand more than a few days longer. This fact, alone,
                    shows how very late the flood has been, and how usefuls the barrages have been
                    in utilising every drop of water available.</p>

                    1905, last year, and the two very low years, 1899 and 1902, viz :— </p>
                <!-- Table insert -->
                <p>It will be seen from the above that the levels are 1.50 metres below those of
                    last year, which wan by no means a good year, and 25 to 30 centimetres below
                    those of 1899 and 1902, both yearn of extremely low floods. The Hood In the
                    While Nile has been fairly normal that it the Blue Nile completely failed.
                    Captain Lyons, who has most skilfully and so entifically studied the question,
                    states that there wan great deficiency in the rains in Abyssinia during May and
                    June, that in July matters improved, and “that it seems probable that, so far as
                    indications show, the August rains are more likely to be poor than good." The
                    prospects therefore, are not promising,and although a rise has lately taken
                    place on the Blue Nile and the Atbara, the present indication is that the flood
                    of this year will follow that of 1902. </p>

                <p>From the above it will be seen that the Assouan gauge is now 2.74 metres below
                    last year and 3.01 metres below the average of the last 30 years. Taking into
                    consideration the rise south of Assouan, now taking place, it is probable that
                    the flood of this year will follow that of 1902. According to the rules of the
                    Public Works Ministry, a “bad Nile” is declared when the Assouan gauge does not
                    reach 13 pics on the 15th August; as there is no possibility of this occurring,
                    the Ministry has decided to declare a “bad Nile” at once, and instructions have
                    been issued to take the same measures as were carried out to meet he low flood
                    of 1902. The area of “sharaki” in 1902 was 128,000 feddana, and, unless
                    conditions rapidly improve, it is quite probable that the same area may remain
                    unirrigated by the present flood.</p>
                <p>Summary —In the Delta and Middle Egypt the irrigation of all crops is assured by
                    the Delta, Zifta and Asriont Barrages, though the durah crops must necessarily
                    be late. In Upper Egypt the conditions are far from favorable and indicate a
                    flood similar, if not inferior, to that of 1902. </p>
