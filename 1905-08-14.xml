                        <head>OUR NEXT GOVERNMENT’S FOREIGN POLICY.</head>
                        <p>If all Radical leaders spoke with the knowledge and moderation employed
                            by Sir Charles Dilke, when discussing foreign affairs, their patriotism
                            would be much more in evidence than has, unfortunately, been the case of
                            late. Lord E. Fitzmaurice also deserves praise for his frank acceptance
                            of the principle that continuity of policy in our relations with other
                            Powers should be, and must be, strictly observed. It is most refreshing
                            and stimulating to have these utterances from representative Radicals
                            after the constant wavering of the Opposition chief. There is the more
                            likelihood that Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman would, if promoted to the
                            Premiership, come to the sound conclusion that instability of purpose in
                            directing the external affairs of the greatest and most widespread
                            Empire in the world would inevitably replace Great Britain in that
                            position of isolation which, not so long ago, crippled her influence
                            among the nations. The proposal to renew our treaty of alliance with
                            Japan, in more extended form, cannot be finally judged on its merits
                            until the de-tails are made known in full. But it is a long step towards
                            its adoption that the bare ‘idea of this new concordat should have
                            re-ceived general approval recently gp both sides </p>
                        <cb n="6"/>
                        <p>of the House. It is manifest that owing to the changes in the balance of
                            Asiatic power and influence resulting from the Russo-Japanese conflict,
                            the whole political situation in the Far East has completely altered. Up
                            to the present the alliance has merely bound Great Britain to help the
                            insular Power, should any other nation interfere in the war on the side
                            of Russia. That was a sufficient object to aim at when hostilities
                            began, and the world owes to it the isolation of both combatants in a
                            comparatively narrow area. But there are other points of danger in Asia
                            to the allies-points where conflict would be inevitable were either to
                            break away from the league of peace. It is, therefore, a perfectly sound
                            and statesmanlike policy on the part of His Majesty's Ministers to renew
                            the agreement in such an enlarged shape as may safeguard the whole of
                            Asia from the devastations of war.</p>
                        <p>It is obvious that the Russian Government would be much less likely to
                            break the peace it aware that Japan was closely associated with Great
                            Britain in its maintenance against all disturbers. There is a moral
                            force as well as a military in alliances: here in Europe the Dual
                            Alliance has continuously operated, ever since it came into being, as a
                            check on the possible aggressiveness of the Triple Allianoe directed
                            from Berlin Chauvinists at St Petersburg and Moscow would think, we may
                            make sure, once, and twioe, about a march to the Indus if that suicidal
                            endeavour would bring upon their over-grown Empire a Japanese invasion
                            of Eastern Siberia. It is this restrictive force on pugnacious
                            proclivities which lends so much value to the enlargement of the present
                            treaty; for one thing, it would render that farther partition of China
                            which is believed to find favor in august quarters at Berlin, well-nigh
                            impracticable. For the Celestial Empire, now so weak and impotent, could
                            then rely on receiving naval and military assistance from the two most
                            powerful fighting nations in Asia; and, with that support, could safely
                            afford to smile at the ‘mailed fist.”</p>
                        <p>As to Africa although it would be premature regard all difficulties in
                            the Congo State, dne to bad administration, as ended, improvements are
                            being introduced generally, while the Congo Government has unreservedly
                            undertaken to give effect to the report of the investigating Commission
                            as soon as it is rendered. It is not unnatural that British
                            philanthropists should display impatience at the secrecy which
                            characterised the inquiry for a time. Bat now that it is moving more
                            quickly in the required direction it would be a mistake on their part to
                            goad such a very willing horse as the present Cabinet It is much the
                            same in the case of Turkey. The Government is doing all in its power to
                            influence the Sultan to introduce administrative and financial reforms
                            without further delay, but Abdul Hamid still shows marked reluctance to
                            be hurried along a path he does not desire to tread. It may be hoped,
                            however, that the slumberous air of Yildiz Kiosk will be wholesomely
                            stirred by the solemn warning which fell from Lord -Percy lately.
                            Without any mincing of phrases, he counselled the Turkish Government to
                            reform its method of rule in Macedonia and else- where, lest “His
                            Majesty’s Government should have to reconsider their attitude.” The
                            Saltan is sufficiently sagacious to place the right construction on this
                            plain intimation, especially as it represents the united resolve of all
                            the Great Powers. Even Germany, so reluctant to give him offence, has at
                            last come into line with the rest of Europe on the burning question of
                            financial reform and its collaterals, and we imagine that here at all
                            events the coming Radical Government is certain to imitate its
                            predecessors in office. It is only over South African matters that a
                            certain uneasiness prevails as to “C. B.’s” intentions, but we doubt
                            whether any revolutionary changes are likely to be made by a Cabinet
                            that is not likely to be supported by a large and united majority.</p>

                        formed in 1896 with the sole object of assisting British trade in this
                        country. The services of the Chamber are always at the disposal of any
                        member desiring information on trade matters generally, including the
                        question of appointing suitable agents. As no fee is charged for such
                        advice, it is obviously in the interests of all British traders here to
                        become members, especially when it is remembered that the annual
                        subscription is merely the nominal one of £1. The latter payment also

                        were given, and presented by Mrs. Anastas to each winner. There was also a
                        large number of consolation prizes, thereby making every little heart bright
                        and happy. Several ladies and gentlemen were present to assist in

                        made a second attempt, this time with a rope, and was himself carried under,
                        and had to be hauled ashore, when Capt. Carey had disap-peared. The other
                        evidence dealt mainly with the attempts at restoring animation in the ease
                        of Capt. Carey, which appear to have been persevered with as long as there
                        was any hope. The jury which consisted of Messrs. J. T. Atkin, J. Gunn, and
                        C. D. Stacey gave a verdict in accordance with the evidence, and recorded
                        their hearty commendation of Capt. Crawley’s courageous attempt at a
                        rescue.</p>
                    <p>At 5 p.m. on Saturday the military funeral started from the Bourse. Shortly
                        before that hour a strong detachment of the 2nd Royal Inniskillking
                        Fusiliers had,arrived by special train from Cairo, and marched to the
                        square, where it was mot by the 2nd Royal Berkshire Regiment, ‘i he
                        procession was preceded by the Egyptian mounted police, who kept the streets
                        clear as far as the Rosetta gate. The military mounted police led the long
                        column, followed by the band of the 2nd Royal Berkshire Regiment, which
                        played the Dead March. The two gun carriages, which conveyed the bodies to
                        their resting place were draped with the Union Jack, and we were glad to
                        note that almost all the Europeans and Syrians who were present— and the
                        cortege passed through crowded streets —sainted the dead. General Bullock,
                        Maj. Ludlow.D.A.A.G., Admiral Sir R M. Blomfield, and several of the
                        principal members of the Head Quarters staff, representatives of the
                        Governorat and the Egyptian Army, and severa! Well known members of the
                        Consular Body and the British community followed. The Iunis-killings
                        detachment, and the 2nd Royal Berkshires brought up the rear. At the Rosetta
                        gate the procession was joined by the firing party, and the two bands of the
                        Inniskillings who played the Dead March as far as the cemetery. The Rev. A.
                        H. Manning, acting-Chaplain to the forces, conducted the burial service by
                        the grave, where a number of beautiful wreaths had been laid by the comrades
                        and friends of the deceased. The coffins were carried into the cemetery by
                        the. sergeants and staff sergeants of the Inniskiliing Fusiliers. On the
                        conclusions of the burial service, the usual volleys were fired over the
                        grave, and the general salute to the dead, and the "Last Post” brought the
                        sad ceremony to an end</p>
                    <p>The following special army order has been issued from the Headquarters, Cairo

                    <p>We mentioned in a recent issue that the above company, which has taken Over
                        the business of Mr. Stangen, the well known German tourist agent,
                        contemplated starting a river passenger service between Cairo and Assouan
                        during the tourist season of 1906-7, to compete with the old established
                        lines of Messrs. Cook and Son, and the Anglo-American Nile Steamer and Hotel
                        Company. Later it was announced that negotiations had been to entered into
                        between the latte and the Hamburg-Amerika Company to work the two services
                        in conjunction. It appears, from what we now learn, that the negotiations
                        between the two companies are still in progress, and there is every reason
                        to believe that a satisfactory arrangement will be arrived at sood. Several
                        meetings have already taken place in Europe between the representatives of

                    <head>CONSTANTINOPLE OUTRAGE</head>
                    <head>another Theory.</head>
                    <p>We have been shown a letter from a British resident in Constantinople which
                        gives the following news of the bomb outrage against H.I.M. the Sultan. "in
                        a country like this, where nothing in the shape of public meetings is
                        allowed, interest,even in such an occurrence, dies down very quickly. It is,
                        generally speak-ing, dangerous for an ordinary Turk to talk politics,
                        excepting in the privacy of his own house, where, it is to be presumed, no
                        members of the Khafieh are present. Consequently there has been no public
                        display of indignation—or of approbation-and all that I get from peasants,
                        boatmen, and the like, is—“We think it was an Armenian, but, please, may we
                        change the subjeot ?” Preposterous stories were current about the extent of
                        the casualties, many supposing that at least 1,000 persons were disposed of.
                        As a matter of fact, I think, seventeen were killed and forty odd wonnded.
                        The Saltan behaved quite coolly, realising that the danger to his person was
                        passed, and keeping off the crowd of officers and ministers that gathered
                        round him; as much, I fancy, from a desire to avoid another attack with cold
                        steel, as to stop the panic. The police scoured the town, arrested several
                        hundreds of harmless folk, and sent back to their homes as many Armenians
                        and Bulgars not domiciled here, as they could find. They have, as yet, hit
                        on no clue worth anything, though they got up a yam about an india-rubber
                        tyred carriage, which has appeared in all the papers. Many of the
                        best-informed residents think it more probable that the outrage was the work
                        of plotters at the palace—perhaps of the Albanian body guard, who are
                        terribly out of hand at present. Of course the revolutionaries, Armenians
                        and Macedonians, took the “oredit” for a cruel and clumsy outrage, and the
                        police are only too glad to be spared the trouble of ferreting about among
                        the secretaries and chamberlains at Yildiz Kiosk, some of whom are
                        disaffected scoundrels.” </p>
                    <p>SHOCKING SUICIDE IN CAIRO</p>
                    <p>A French gentleman, of the name of Emile Jullien, committed suicide yesterday
                        morning by jumping from a third floor balcony into the street. He sustained
                        frightful injuries to the head, and death was almost instantaneous. The
                        deceased, who lived at the Maison Sabbagh, in the Sharia Kasr-el-Nil, with
                        his brother and his family, had been suffering for over a year from
                        melancholia which, at times, assumed an acute form. This was the case on
                        Saturday night, when he was carefully watched. He ran twice to the balcony
                        early in the morning with the intention of jumping over, and was prevented,
                        hot the third time he succeeded in evading his watchers, and accomplished
                        his purpose. The late Monsieur Emile Jullien was a batchelor of 39 years of
                        age, and had formerly been employed at the local Mixed Tribunals. </p>

                    <head>The Nile FLOOD.</head>
                    <head>MR. WEBB’S Report</head>
                    <p>In my last note I pointed out the following, viz (a) that the levels of the
                        river had been unprecedently low from the middle of May, and that the
                        irrigation of the summer crops had only been rendered possible by the
                        supplementary supply derived from the Assouan-Reservoir. (b) That the flood
                        was very late in its earlier stages, and promised to be low. </p>
                    <p>The Assouan Reservoir was emptied on 20th July (one month later than in
                        1904), since which date the supply in the river has been maintained by the
                        flood, which reached Assouan nearly one month later than the usual time, and
                        then not in sufficient quantity to satisfy the demands for the irrigation of
                        the “sharaki” durah lands as well as the cotton crops, so that it will be
                        found necessary to maintain the canals in the Delta and Middle Egypt until
                        probably the middle of this month. </p>
                    <p>The rice crop, has, naturally, suffered in many places, but the cotton crop
                        has been entirely saved by the Assouan Reservoir. Both in the Delta and
                        Middle Egypt it is stated to be most excellent, and unless unfavorable
                        climatic conditions prevail in September next, the crop should be a record
                        one. The Cotton worm has been practically extirpated, owing to the very
                        energetic and successful measures organised by the Ministry of Interior. </p>
                    <p>The irrigation of the “sharaki" durah lands has been somewhat retarded, but
                        is in advance of the years previous to the construction of the weir below
                        the Delta Barrage and the Assiout Barrage : the delay has caused com plaint,
                        bat it is doubtful if any real damage has been done. It may be noted that in
                        1899, the irrigation of “sharaki” durah lands was not allowed until the 6th
                        August in the Delta, whilst in the present year it was allowed 10 days
                        earlier. Owing to the rise now taking place the irrigation of all crops in
                        the Delta and Middle Egypt is absolutely assured, and no further anxiety
                        need be felt throughout the flood. Regulation is being carried on both at
                        the Delta, Zifta and Assiout Barrages; the latter will be completely closed
                        within the next few days. </p>
                    <p>It may interesting to note that op to date not a drop of water has passed
                        down the two branches of the Nile into the sea. The “sadd” in the Rosetta
                        branch, however, is not likely to stand more than a few days longer. This
                        fact, alone, shows how very late the flood has been, and how usefuls the
                        barrages have been in utilising every drop of water available.</p>

                    <!-- Table insert -->
                    <p>It will be seen from the above that the levels are 1.50 metres below those of
                        last year, which wan by no means a good year, and 25 to 30 centimetres below
                        those of 1899 and 1902, both yearn of extremely low floods. The Hood In the
                        While Nile has been fairly normal that it the Blue Nile completely failed.
                        Captain Lyons, who has most skilfully and so entifically studied the
                        question, states that there wan great deficiency in the rains in Abyssinia
                        during May and June, that in July matters improved, and “that it seems
                        probable that, so far as indications show, the August rains are more likely
                        to be poor than good." The prospects therefore, are not promising,and
                        although a rise has lately taken place on the Blue Nile and the Atbara, the
                        present indication is that the flood of this year will follow that of 1902. </p>

                    <p>From the above it will be seen that the Assouan gauge is now 2.74 metres
                        below last year and 3.01 metres below the average of the last 30 years.
                        Taking into consideration the rise south of Assouan, now taking place, it is
                        probable that the flood of this year will follow that of 1902. According to
                        the rules of the Public Works Ministry, a “bad Nile” is declared when the
                        Assouan gauge does not reach 13 pics on the 15th August; as there is no
                        possibility of this occurring, the Ministry has decided to declare a “bad
                        Nile” at once, and instructions have been issued to take the same measures
                        as were carried out to meet he low flood of 1902. The area of “sharaki” in
                        1902 was 128,000 feddana, and, unless conditions rapidly improve, it is
                        quite probable that the same area may remain unirrigated by the present
                        flood.</p>
                    <p>Summary —In the Delta and Middle Egypt the irrigation of all crops is assured
                        by the Delta, Zifta and Asriont Barrages, though the durah crops must
                        necessarily be late. In Upper Egypt the conditions are far from favorable
                        and indicate a flood similar, if not inferior, to that of 1902. </p>
