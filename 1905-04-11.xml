                    <head>THE BUDGET.</head>
                    <p>The Home Government has been lucky in obtaining a Budget surplus, for if a
                        deficit had had to be faced, necessitating additional taxation, it would
                        have provided the Opposition with the proverbial last straw wherewith to
                        break the<cb n="6"/> back of the Government majority. Now at the Forthcoming
                        General Election its supporters will be able at any rate to point out to the
                        electors that something has been done to secure a "Free Breakfast Table" by
                        reducing the tea tax. The greatest disappointment, however, in the
                        Chancellor's Budget speech last night will be caused by the announcement
                        that the income tax is to remain unchanged, and the fact that the Government
                        has not seen its way to listen to the overwhelmingly strong claims which the
                        income tax payer has for relief, will make hosts of its supporters among the
                        professional and middle classes very listless in the coming electoral
                        struggle.</p>
                    <p>The additional revenue in the year just closed is clearly accounted for by
                        the increased taxation imposed by the last Budget, and when we come to
                        examine the figures, we find that the increase is very largely due to the
                        Income-tax payers, who have again come to the rescue of the Government.
                        Indeed, had this not been the case the Chancellor of the Exchequer would
                        have had to face a deficiency, for not only did Customs, Excise, and Estate
                        Duty realise about £1,900,000 less than the estimate, but a supplementary
                        credit of nearly half a million for the Somaliland Expedition had to be
                        added to the expenditrue of the past year. The two items which, together,
                        have produced £1,840,000 beyond estimate, are Income-tax, which is
                        responsible for £1,250,000 of this sum, and Stamps for the balance of
                        £590,000. The increase under the latter heading is much the more
                        satisfactory of the two, for it undoubtedly means that business is
                        improving, and that contracts of all sorts are being entered upon in larger
                        measure than in the previous year. The increased receipts from Income-tax
                        are almost wholly due, we imagine, to the extra pressure put upon the
                        taxpayer to secure payment of the impost in every case before the year
                        closed. In other words, the increased yield is very largely made up of the
                        contributions of those who are usually in arrears when the national accounts
                        are made up, but who this year have been coaxed or harried into earlier
                        payment. This, of course, will be an important element in the revenue
                        calculations for the ensuing year, for even Chancellors of the Exchequer
                        cannot have their cake and eat it too. The falling off in Customs and Excise
                        will be viewed with different feelings, according to the standpoints of
                        individuals. The temperance party-or rather we should say the teetotalers,
                        for all sensible men are for temperance except the intemperate total
                        abolitionist-will rejoice that Excise shows a reduction below estimate of
                        three-quarters of a million. This means a considerably less national "drink
                        bill" than formerly, and, indeed, it is common knowledge that we are
                        reducing our consumption of ordinary alcoholic liquors.</p>

                            <p>House of Commons— The budget surplus for 1904-1905 is £1,414,000. The
                                estimated surplus for 1905-1906 is £2,972,000. The budget reduced
                                the tax on tea by two pence on the lb after the 1st July. The sugar
                                and income taxes remain unchanged. A Considerable portion of the
                                surplus is to be devoted towards redeeming the national debt. Mr.
                                Austen Chamberlain said the past year had been an unsatisfactory one
                                both commercially and financially. The revenue on sugar promised to
                                be an expanding one. The revenue on tea was £210,000 short of the
                                estimate chiefly owning the merchant holding their supplies back
                                during the past quarter, in the hope of a reduction in the duty. The
                                consumption of spirits and beer was steadily diminishing. He had
                                reduced the tax on tea because the article was one of daily
                                consumption in every household and came mainly from the British
                                colonies. (Reuter.) </p>

                    <head>THE ABYSSINIAN BANK. A LINK WITH EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>Writing from Adis Abeba on March 12, Reuter's agent says:- The consummation
                        of the scheme for the establishment of a State Bank of Abyssinia is a
                        triumph for Sir John Harrington, who has shown the Emperor Menelik very
                        clearly the many advantages which such an institution in proper hands would
                        secure to his country. I understand that the capital is to be apportioned as
                        follows: one-half to the National Bank of Egypt, whose agent, Mr, McGil
                        Ivray, has been here for the last month arranging the details; one quarter
                        to an Italian group of financiers, and the remaining quarter to a French
                        syndicate, under the auspices of M. Ilg. the Kings Conseiller d'Etat. There
                        is a rumor here that Sir John Harrington has been offered an important
                        position in the bank when it is established. His acceptance would be a
                        serious loss to British diplomacy here, though an undoubted gain to the
                        bank. Speaking if the National Bank of Egypt's monopoly in Abyssinnia, the
                        "African world" says:- There is no doubt that by means of railroads and the
                        Nile waterways a valuable trade route will be established sooner or later
                        between Abyssinia , the Sudan, and Egypt.To Sir Ernest Cassel and the
                        National Bank of Egypt is due the credit for taking a step which cannot fail
                        to promote progress in this direction. Their scheme paves the way for the
                        introduction on a large scale of British capital into Abyssinia, and
                        provides an important financial link between the country and Egypt. French
                        and Italian financiers certainly have a hand in the new Abyssinian Bank, but
                        the National Bank of Egypt holds half the stock and is the controlling
                        factor. The value if this is clear from the agreement, which gives the
                        Abyssinian Bank a minting and banking monopoly for fifty years, with the
                        right to issue bank notes and establish entrepôts throughout Abyssinia. The
                        possibilities of such a monopoly, from the British point of view, are
                        boundless, and Sir Ernest Cassel is to be congratulated on having carried
                        through so important an enterprise. </p>

                    <p>Extraordinary scenes were witnessed yesterday at the Anglo Egyptian Bank at
                        Alexandria, on the occasion of the subscription to the issue of the Egyptian
                        Trust and Investment, Limited. The subscription opened at 9am. and by 11
                        a.m. the capital of the company (£200,000) had been covered forty times
                        over. At midday, when the bank closes, hundreds of persons were still
                        waiting to put in their applications, and the bank was thronged with an
                        excited crowd all through the afternoon. The struggle to get to the counter
                        was very keen, and even when the bank closed in the evening hundreds of
                        would-be investors had not yet sent in their applications. Before the bank
                        opened this morning crowds were gathering a the doors, and in the course of
                        the forenoon the applications were coming in in such vast numbers that it
                        was decided to close the list at midday today. Telegrams from London state
                        that the applications have been very numerous, and at Cairo alone the
                        capital has been subscribed several times over. The management in Egypt has
                        decided to work day and night in order to complete the allotment, and to be
                        in a position to return the surplus cheques, at an early date. </p>

                    <p>The imports into Egypt during February last are values at L.E. 1,385,341,
                        this being an increase on the corresponding month of last year of L.E.
                        131,074. From the 1st January to 28th February the imports amounted to L.E.
                        3,164,448, an increase of nearly half a million on the figures for the first
                        two months of last year. In this increase, it is not very satisfactory to
                        find that the United Kingdom only shares to the extent of L.E. 77,429. it
                        is, however, a better record than last year, when British imports declined
                        by L.E. 75,810 for the first two months of the year. There was also but a
                        very small augmentation in the imports from British possessions in the
                        Mediterranean, which amounted to L.e. 27,945, as against L.E. 24,507.
                        Imports from British possessions in the Far East declined considerably, from
                        L.e> 169,647 to L.E. 135,153. While British exports to Egypt make but a poor
                        showing during the first two months of the year, every other country has
                        profited by the increased trade of Egypt. America particularly has nearly
                        doubled her exports to Egypt, the figures for that country having risen from
                        L.E. 28,473 to LE 55,945. German imports increased by L.E. 33,801, French by
                        L.E. 68,277, Belgian by L.E. 13,744, Austrian by L.E. 11,498, Italian by

                    <p>With regard to the new rolling stock we hear from a well-informed source that
                        one or more of a new consignment of trucks, supplied by a Belgian firm, have
                        derailed on a curve near Alexandria, which is reputed to be the sharpest on
                        the whole State railway system. The last consignment of trucks, received
                        from a British firm in September, 1904, did precisely tho same thing. A very
                        slight alteration set the British trucks right, and it is believed that the
                        Belgian trucks, of which there are fifty of the type in question, can be
                        altered as easily. The Belgian firm concerned has supplied tho state Rail-
                        ways Administration with large numbers of trucks, which have proved very
                        satisfactory and are not dear. We hear, however, that the Railway
                        Administration has given the last order fur trucks to a good British firm
                        whose price is a little higher. The Belgian company is said to have been a
                        little careless over this particular contract, and the placing of the latest
                        order with a British firm may be regarded as a hint to" tho company to take
                        tho greatest possible trouble over the fulfillment of the con- tracts that
                        may be given them in future. In this connection our readers will be in-

                        three-quarters of a million to be spent on the railways, of which L.B.

                        Abbassieh was held on Sunday at MM. Cattaui's grounds in the Ismailieh
                        quarter of Cairo. The sales went off excellently, the kiosks being besieged
                        by buyers. Miles E. Cattaui, N. Rossi, and R. Mosseri sold bric-a-brac; the
                        teas were sold by Mile Aline Mosseri and Mile Leonie Curiel, while other
                        refreshments were under the care of Miles L. Suares and J. Mondolfo. Mme
                        Maurice Cattaui Bey presided over the lottery, and the Miles Gallico over
                        the "petits chevaux." Among the many buyers were Count B. de Kosziebrodzki,

                        Chalom, and many well-known members of the Israelite community of Cairo. The
                        Bracale Orchestra played throughout the sale.</p>

                    <head>ST. MARK'S, ALEXANDRIA. "THE HOLY CITY."</head>
                    <p>It is proposed to render this remarkably popular work by an augmented choir
                        in St. Mark's Church on Tuesday, 25th inst., at 5.45 m. "The Holy City" is a
                        sacred cantata, com- posed for the Birmingham Musical Festival in 1882 by
                        Alfred R Gaul, Mus. Bac. Cantab., organistand choirmaster of 8t Augustine's
                        Church, Edgbaston. Mr. Gault cantatas have attained a greater popularity
                        with amateur choral societies than those of any other com- poser. It is
                        interesting to mention that his music has been performed in Persia, Rus-
                        sia, China, India, South America, South Africa, the United States of
                        America, France, and most of the English colonies. Like all his cantatas,
                        "The Holy City" appeals succesfully to those who love choral sing- ing, and
                        who take an interest in sacred nar- ratives set to thoroughly singable music
                        which can at once be appreciated. With the exception of two hymns ("No
                        shadows yonder by Horatius Bonar, and "For thee, O dear, dear country," by
                        J.M. Neale), a verse from Milton's poem 'At a Solemn Music' ("List l the
                        Cherubic Host,") and three verses from the Te Deum, the words are entirely
                        scriptural and are admirably chosen. The work consists of the prologue
                        (added by the composer in 1901), an obviously appropriate and beautiful
                        introduction. Part I. "Contemplation" is the fundamental note in the
                        treatment of the subject, which is suggested by the following passages of
                        Scrip- ture: "Here we have no continuing city." "Thy kingdom come." The
                        desire for a higher and better life is expressed in the words of a tenor
                        solo, "My soul is athirst for God." In Part II " Adoration " is the ketnote.
                        The subject is announced in a bass solo, "I saw a new heaven and a new
                        earth," with its pianissimo "Sanotus" sang as a chorus. The desire and pro-
                        mises of Part I. are represented are realised in Part II. The whole cantata
                        is an uninterrupted flow of charming melody and effective choral writing. To
                        the choir of St. Mark's, and to those who assist them, lovers of sacred
                        music will be grateful for introducing to Alexandria this deservedly popular
                        work. The rendering of the cantata will occupy not more than 1 1/6 hour.
                        Those present will be invited to contribute towards the expense incurred by
                        the choir in purchasing the music, hiring a piano, etc.</p>

                    <head>LA QUESTION DES THEATRES</head>
                    <p>Monsieur le Directeur</p>
                    <p>de "l'Egyptian Gazette" Permettez-moi d'abord dé vous remercier de la
                        publication dans votre estimable journal de l'interview que j'ai eu avec un
                        de vos rédac teurs à propos de l'emplacement d'un grand théâtre d'opéra.</p>
                    <p>Bien que je pus m'attendre à l'approbation de tous les cercles compétents
                        dans une question qui touche de si près à l'avenir et à l'em bellissement de
                        la ville d'Alexandrie, je n'osai、 espérer pour ma proposition un accueil
                        aussi chaleureux et aussi unanime; ce qui prouve combien l'idée de
                        construire un superbe théâtre sur la place occupée par l'ancienne gare de
                        Ramleh est heureuse et conforme tant aux intérêts des habitants qu'aux lois
                        de l'esthé tique.</p>
                    <p>Lorsque, en effet, vous remontez le boulevard de Ramleh pour prendre le tram
                        de San Stefano, vous découvrez maintenant l'horizon là où se trouvait jadis
                        la gare de Ramleh. Le sol y est de cinq mètres plus élevé qu'à la ! place
                        des consuls et domine tout un réseau de rues et de boulevards. On peut
                        s'imaginer co qu'un édifice monumental attirant du plus loin le regard
                        aurait là de majestueux. Cette situation avait tellement frappé les anciens
                        qu'ils y avaient érigé le fameux palais des Césars.</p>
                    <p>Qu'on ne me vienne pas dire que cela dé tournera la ligne des trams. Ceux-ci
                        aboutissent en ligne droite à la Tour des Romains et c'est grâce à un détour
                        qu'on les a rejoint au bouleva vard de Ramleh. En redressant la direction,
                        on obtiendra un espace libre de cent mètres de largeur sur cent mètres de
                        longueur; mais comme toute la beauté de l'édifice réside en ce e toute que
                        le milieu de la façade monumentale corresponde éxatement au milieu du
                        boulevard de Ramleh où elle charmera l'oeil du promeneur sur tout le
                        parcours, et que d'autre part tout le terrain nécessaire n'appartient pas à
                        la Munici palité, il faudra empiéter sur la propriété privée.</p>
                    <p>Supposons que la façade ait 50 mètres de large. En faisant coincider le
                        milieu de la façade avec le milieu du boulevard, on voit que la ville ne
                        dispose que de 35 mètres. Le reste, soit 15 mètres, appartient à M. Casulli.
                        Celui-ci devra donc céder à la ville 15 mètres pour le théâtre et 20 autres
                        pour l'isoler, soit en tout un lot de 35 mètres de large sur une longueur de
                        100 mètres. Le prolongement de la rue Pereira, qui s'impose, servira à
                        isoler l'édifice du côté de Ramleh. De cette manière la ville disposera d'un
                        terrain libre de 5,000 mètres carrés, fimités du côté nord par les terrains
                        de la Municipalité, du côté Est par le prolongement de la Rue Pereira, du
                        côté Sud par une rue de 20 mètres de large, et du côté Ouest par le
                        boulevard de Ramleh et la rue Missala. La port cédée par M. Casulli serait
                        de 4,450 m2. dont 35m. X 100 n. soit 3,500 m2. sur le côté sud et 950 m2.
                        pour l'ouverture de la rue Pereira. De ces 4,450 m2. il faut déduire un
                        excédent de 850 m2 cédé à Casulli pour l'alignement. Le reste, soit 3,600
                        m2. serait compensé en terrains appartenant à la Municipalité.</p>
                    <p>La ville n'aurait donc rien à payer pour le terrain et tout l'argent
                        disponible pourrait être affecté à l'embellissement du théâtre dont l'ar-
                        chitecture ferait l'orgueil d'Alexandrie. Notre ville se montrerait ainsi la
                        digne émule de l'ancienne capitale des Ptolémées et des Césars. G. ZOURO</p>
