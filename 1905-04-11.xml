                    <head>AN UNSATISFACTORY YEAR.</head>
                    <p>LONDON, April 10. House of Commons— The budget surplus for 1904-1905 is
                        £1,414,000. The estimated surplus for 1905-1906 is £2,972,000. The budget
                        reduced the tax on tea by two pence on the lb after the 1st July. The sugar
                        and income taxes remain unchanged. A Considerable portion of the surplus is
                        to be devoted towards redeeming the national debt. Mr. Austen Chamberlain
                        said the past year had been an unsatisfactory one both commercially and
                        financially. The revenue on sugar promised to be an expanding one. The
                        revenue on tea was £210,000 short of the estimate chiefly owning the
                        merchant holding their supplies back during the past quarter, in the hope of
                        a reduction in the duty. The consumption of spirits and beer was steadily
                        diminishing. He had reduced the tax on tea because the article was one of
                        daily consumption in every household and came mainly from the British
                        colonies. (Reuter.) </p>

                        which passed here. A steamer has sighted Admiral Enquist’s squadron at
                        anchor 150 miles from Singapore. Four Japanese warships were sighted off
                        Cape St. Jaques on the 7th inst. (Reuter.) Batavia, April 11. Presumably
                        Admiral Rodjestvensky with most of his battleships is at Muntok (Banca

                        Upper Oxus has been detached to reinforce the Kushk garrison is denied here.
                        It is added that the troops hitherto at Merv will remain there. No troops
                        have arrived in Turkestan from Orenburg except some Cossack reliefs.

                        respect of the new issue of shares of this company has been posted from

                    <p>THE FRENCH CRUISER “Ensernet” arrived at Suez yesterday from Djibouti, and
                        will probably return to that port after a short stay there. She carries 17
                        guns, and a crew of 275 men all told. </p>
                    <p>THE GREAT NUMBER of tourists who have busted Egypt this season, has has the
                        result of flooding Sicily with visitors on their return to Europe. Taormina

                    <p>CATTLE PLAGUE - The following are the localities where deaths from cattle
                        plague occurred last week: 14 at Mina-el-Kamh, 19 at Zagazig, 3 at bit
                        Ghamr, 1 at Chibine el-Kom, 2 at Menouf, 2 at Ghizeh, and 1 at Embabeh. </p>
                    <p>PRINCE COLIBRI, who is said to be the smallest man on earth, has come down to

                    <p>KASR El-Nil Bridge- A credit of L.E. 600 has been opened for moving the
                        overhead telegraph wires that go along Kasr el-Nil bridge. These wires are
                        to be taken under the river bed and will not therefore be liable to any
                        injury owing to the opening of the bridge. </p>
                    <p>ZEITOUN.-The roads in Zeitoun (writes a correspondent) are in a deplorable
                        condition. This state of the roads causes much needless cruelty to animals
                        dragging loads of stones, coal, petroleum, etc. It is to be hoped that the
                        attention of the Tanzim Department will be drawn to the fact. </p>
                    <p>THE LOTTERY LAW.- The Alexandria Gouvernorat was besieged this morning by
                        crowds of street lottery ticket vendors, who complained of the conduct of
                        the police in stopping their means of livelihood. The authorities of the
                        Gouvernourat replied that the police were only carrying out the law. </p>
                    <p>THE EGYPTIAN DIRECTORY for 1905 (Rizzo &amp; co., Cairo) is a great
                        improvement on its predecessors, and judging by appearances this eminently
                        useful publication has come to stay. It is exceedingly well got up and is
                        replete with all that information which is usually to be found in a
                        first-class directory. All the provincial towns of Egypt are included, also
                        the Sudan. </p>
                    <p>CAIRO IMPROVEMENTS.- Considerable improvements are to be made in Cairo. The
                        Sharia Abbas is to be carried long the old track of the Matarieh railway
                        line and thence to Kasr el-Nil Bridge. This scheme will give an open
                        highway, free form the heavy traffic in the central part of the city, from
                        Koubbeh Palace and Abbassieh, as well as from the Cairo railway station to
                        Kasr el-Doubara, etc. </p>
                    <p>THE LAST HOMEWARD TRANSPORT of the season,the “Sicilia” (Capt. G.H.G.
                        Weston, R.N.R), arrived at Port Said yesterday morning from Bombay for Malta
                        and Southampton. The troops on board numbered 971, consisting of details and
                        the 38th Brigade of the Royal Field Artillery, composed of the 24th, 34th
                        and 72nd Batteries. The officer commanding is Lt. Col. Watkins, Royal Horse
                        Artillery. </p>
                    <p>MENA HOUSE.-The management of Mena House Hotel are offering special terms to
                        residents desirous of spending the Easter holidays there, and no doubt a
                        great number will avail themselves of this opportunity to spend a few
                        pleasant days at the pyramid. Despite the advanced season the hotel is still
                        nearly full, and on Sunday last, at luncheon time, the big dining hall has
                        the appearance of being in the height of the season. In the evening again,
                        many drove out to dine and spend the evening inhaling the delicious fresh
                        air of the desert. </p>

                        birthday of the King of the Belgians, and despatched the following telegram,
                        to his Majesty at Brussels: “Reunis occasion soixante duxueme anniversaire,
                        the presents respectueuses felicitations.” The following reply was received
                        from the King’s secretary, M. Carton de Wiart:- “Le row me charge de
                        remercier la Colonie Belge de see sentiments partriotiques.” The Belgian
                        Club was founded two months ago and already numbers over fifty members. The

                    <head>THE ABYSSINIAN BANK.</head>
                    <head>A LINK WITH EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>Writing from Adis Abeba on March 12, Reuter’s agent says:- The consummation
                        of the scheme for the establishment of a State Bank of Abyssinia is a
                        triumph for Sir John Harrington, who has shown the Emperor Menelik very
                        clearly the many advantages which such an institution in proper hands would
                        secure to his country. I understand that the capital is to be apportioned as
                        follows: one-half to the National Bank of Egypt, whose agent, Mr, McGil
                        Ivray, has been here for the last month arranging the details; one quarter
                        to an Italian group of financiers, and the remaining quarter to a French
                        syndicate, under the auspices of M. Ilg. the Kings Conseiller d’Etat. There
                        is a rumor here that Sir John Harrington has been offered an important
                        position in the bank when it is established. His acceptance would be a
                        serious loss to British diplomacy here, though an undoubted gain to the
                        bank. Speaking if the National Bank of Egypt’s monopoly in Abyssinnia, the
                        “African world” says:- There is no doubt that by means of railroads and the
                        Nile waterways a valuable trade route will be established sooner or later
                        between Abyssinia , the Sudan, and Egypt.To Sir Ernest Cassel and the
                        National Bank of Egypt is due the credit for taking a step which cannot fail
                        to promote progress in this direction. Their scheme paves the way for the
                        introduction on a large scale of British capital into Abyssinia, and
                        provides an important financial link between the country and Egypt. French
                        and Italian financiers certainly have a hand in the new Abyssinian Bank, but
                        the National Bank of Egypt holds half the stock and is the controlling
                        factor. The value if this is clear from the agreement, which gives the
                        Abyssinian Bank a minting and banking monopoly for fifty years, with the
                        right to issue bank notes and establish entrepôts throughout Abyssinia. The
                        possibilities of such a monopoly, from the British point of view, are
                        boundless, and Sir Ernest Cassel is to be congratulated on having carried
                        through so important an enterprise. </p>

                        waiting to put in their applications, and the bank was thronged with an
                        excited crowd all through the afternoon. The struggle to get to the counter
                        was very keen, and even when the bank closed in the evening hundreds of
                        would-be investors had not yet sent in their applications. Before the bank
                        opened this morning crowds were gathering a the doors, and in the course of
                        the forenoon the applications were coming in in such vast numbers that it
                        was decided to close the list at midday today. Telegrams from London state
                        that the applications have been very numerous, and at Cairo alone the
                        capital has been subscribed several times over. The management in Egypt has
                        decided to work day and night in order to complete the allotment, and to be
                        in a position to return the surplus cheques, at an early date. </p>

                    <p>The imports into Egypt during February last are values at L.E. 1,385,341,
                        this being an increase on the corresponding month of last year of L.E.

                        3,164,448, an increase of nearly half a million on the figures for the first
                        two months of last year. In this increase, it is not very satisfactory to
                        find that the United Kingdom only shares to the extent of L.E. 77,429. it
                        is, however, a better record than last year, when British imports declined
                        by L.E. 75,810 for the first two months of the year. There was also but a
                        very small augmentation in the imports from British possessions in the
                        Mediterranean, which amounted to L.e. 27,945, as against L.E. 24,507.
                        Imports from British possessions in the Far East declined considerably, from
                        L.e> 169,647 to L.E. 135,153. While British exports to Egypt make but a poor

                        profited by the increased trade of Egypt. America particularly has nearly
                        doubled her exports to Egypt, the figures for that country having risen from
                        L.E. 28,473 to LE 55,945. German imports increased by L.E. 33,801, French by

                    <head>STATE RAILWAY CONTRACTS. </head>
                    <p>With regard to the new rolling stock we hear from a well-informed source
                        that one or more of a new consignment of trucks, supplied by a Belgian firm,
                        have derailed on a curve near Alexandria, which is reputed to be the
                        sharpest on the whole State railway system. The last consignment of trucks,
                        received from a British firm in September, 1904, did precisely tho same
                        thing. A very slight alteration set the British trucks right, and it is
                        believed that the Belgian trucks, of which there are fifty of the type in
                        question, can be altered as easily. The Belgian firm concerned has supplied
                        tho state Rail- ways Administration with large numbers of trucks, which have
                        proved very satisfactory and are not dear. We hear, however, that the
                        Railway Administration has given the last order fur trucks to a good British
                        firm whose price is a little higher. The Belgian company is said to have
                        been a little careless over this particular contract, and the placing of the
                        latest order with a British firm may be regarded as a hint to" tho company
                        to take tho greatest possible trouble over the fulfillment of the con-
                        tracts that may be given them in future. In this connection our readers will
                        be in- terested to bear that the Finance Ministry has opened credits of over
                        three-quarters of a million to be spent on the railways, of which L.B.
                        420,000 are for the purchase of new roll- ing stook.</p>

                    <head>ST. MARK’S, ALEXANDRIA.</head>
                    <head>"THE HOLY CITY."</head>
                    <p>It is proposed to render this remarkably popular work by an augmented choir
                        in St. Mark’s Church on Tuesday, 25th inst., at 5.45 m. “The Holy City” is a
                        sacred cantata, com- posed for the Birmingham Musical Festival in 1882 by
                        Alfred R Gaul, Mus. Bac. Cantab., organistand choirmaster of 8t Augustine’s
                        Church, Edgbaston. Mr. Gault cantatas have attained a greater popularity
                        with amateur choral societies than those of any other com- poser. It is
                        interesting to mention that his music has been performed in Persia, Rus-
                        sia, China, India, South America, South Africa, the United States of
                        America, France, and most of the English colonies. Like all his cantatas,
                        "The Holy City" appeals succesfully to those who love choral sing- ing, and
                        who take an interest in sacred nar- ratives set to thoroughly singable music
                        which can at once be appreciated. With the exception of two hymns ("No
                        shadows yonder by Horatius Bonar, and "For thee, O dear, dear country,” by
                        J.M. Neale), a verse from Milton’s poem ‘At a Solemn Music’ (“List l the
                        Cherubic Host,") and three verses from the Te Deum, the words are entirely
                        scriptural and are admirably chosen. The work consists of the prologue
                        (added by the composer in 1901), an obviously appropriate and beautiful
                        introduction. Part I. “Contemplation” is the fundamental note in the
                        treatment of the subject, which is suggested by the following passages of
                        Scrip- ture: "Here we have no continuing city." “Thy kingdom come." The
                        desire for a higher and better life is expressed in the words of a tenor
                        solo, “My soul is athirst for God." In Part II “ Adoration " is the ketnote.
                        The subject is announced in a bass solo, “I saw a new heaven and a new
                        earth," with its pianissimo “Sanotus” sang as a chorus. The desire and pro-
                        mises of Part I. are represented are realised in Part II. The whole cantata
                        is an uninterrupted flow of charming melody and effective choral writing. To
                        the choir of St. Mark’s, and to those who assist them, lovers of sacred
                        music will be grateful for introducing to Alexandria this deservedly popular
                        work. The rendering of the cantata will occupy not more than 1 1/6 hour.
                        Those present will be invited to contribute towards the expense incurred by
                        the choir in purchasing the music, hiring a piano, etc.</p>
