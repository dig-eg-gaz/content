                    <head>THE STATE OF RUSSIA.</head>
                    <p>The news received from Russia during the last few days is hardly likely to
                        encourage the partisans of a Russian alliance. The cruel massacre of Jews at
                        Bielostok, the peasant outbreaks in several provinces, the revival of the
                        strikes in St. Petersburg, and the continuance of insubordination in the
                        Black Sea fleet, show conclusively that the concessions hitherto extored
                        from the Government will not satisfy the mujiks, much less the revolutionary
                        organisations. The Duma, which complains of the dilatory methods of
                        officialism, is itself criticised by the insurgent peasants for its
                        incapcacity to effect an instant change in the conditions of their tenure,
                        and the naive villager, who in his simplicity imagines that the whole land
                        system of Russia can be remodelled in a fortnight, chafes against the delays
                        caused by the limitation of the powers of his representatives. The
                        disclosures of Prince Urusoff have, of course horrified the Duma and the
                        intelligent members of the Russian public but whether they were entirely
                        wise from the patriotic point of view is highly doubtful. The one chance for
                        Russia, the one possibility of avoiding a period of anarchy and revolution
                        that may last for a generation, is a working agreement between the remains
                        of the autocracy and the Constitutional Democrats of Duma. Should this be
                        rendered impossible by the folly of the autocrcy or by the indiscretion of
                        members of the assembly nothing can save Russia from being reduced to
                        importence. The overthrow of the autocracy could only lead to a victory of
                        the extremis forces, the Jacobins of the Russian reign of terror, whose
                        subversive ideals are hardly likely to prove efficient in aught but
                        destruction. The Constitutional Democrats, the conservative element both
                        among peasants and land owners, would alike fall victims to a revolutionary
                        town proletariat organised and led by the apostles of anarchy, and if
                        thedemands and actions of the revolutionary party furnish any clue to their
                        policy we may expect them to aim at a very extreme form of revolutionary
                        Socialism. The alternative is military despoism with General Trepoff at the
                        helm. Metternich's dictum that one can do anything with bayonets but sit on
                        them condemns any such regime in advance. </p>
                    <p>As far as one can judge there are five parties in Russia proper which count.
                        The old guard of autocracy, powerless for the moment to attract support, but
                        still capable of playing off one party against another; the peasants easily
                        roused to fury against Cossacks, or Jews, tax collectors, or "intelligents,"
                        childisly ignorant and incapable, for the present, of that combination that
                        would lead their enormous numbers to certain victory, the various
                        revolutionary groups whose programmes are rigidly Socialist or frankly
                        Anarchist, but which agree in aiming at the utter overthrow of the
                        Bureacracy, the Church, and the Tsardom, and in drawing for support upon the
                        poorer Jew and the industrial population of the great cities; the
                        constitutional party, with all its subdivisions, that desire the
                        establishment in one form or another of a constitutional Government upon
                        British or French lines; and lastly, the Separatist sections -- united in a
                        common desire to throw off the Russian yoke once and for all and whose hopes
                        may yet be gratified should the threatened Revolution sweep away the Tsardom
                        and convert the army into a national guard. A third of the Poles, a great
                        majority of the Finns, Georgians, Armenians, and Moslems of Central Asia and
                        the Caucasus form this gropu. Should the autocracy sink in blood we may yet
                        see a Polish republic, an independent Georgia, and Transcaucasia, its
                        Armenians overthrown, won back by the armies of the Sultan. As for the ruin
                        of thousands of French investors and the bankruptcy of the Empire, nothing,
                        unhappily, seems more probable.</p>

                    <p> On arriving at Chibin el Kom at half past three this afternoon, one of my
                        first duties was to call upon the mourdir, Mohmoud Bey Shoncri, and to
                        receive the ticket which would admit me to the special tables which have
                        been reserved for members of the press for the trial of the villagers who
                        are accused of unprovokedly attacking British officers at Denishwai on the
                        13th inst., as has already been related in the "Egyptian Gazette." The trial
                        will be held in a large marquee, which has been erected in the inner court
                        of the mondirieh, and only those holding tickets will be admitted. The
                        preparations fot the trial, which have been made under the direction of the
                        Ministry of the Interior, are excellent. At one end of the tent a platform
                        has been erected, which is destined for the members of the special tribunal.
                        At each side of, and at right angles to this platform are the "docks," in
                        which the accused will be placed, and directly in front of these are the
                        tables for the representatives of the Press, forming three sides of a
                        square, within which are the seats for thsoe directly concerned in the
                        trial, including the officers of the Army of Occupation who will be present.
                        Beyone the Press tables are several rows of seats for thsoe who have
                        obtained tickets for the trial. </p>
                    <p> On the east bank of the canal which runs past Chibin el Kom the British
                        troops, consisting of a company of Mounted Infantry, a detachment of the 6th
                        Inniskilling Dragoons,, dismounted, and forty Military Mounted Police are
                        encamped. Mr. Machell, who returned here yesterday and will remain until the
                        end of the trial, is staying on board the deliabieh Scout. Moberly Bey
                        returned to Chibin this evening from Denishwai, where he has spent the whole
                        of to-day collecting evidence. </p>

                    <head>Excitement at Chibin</head>
                    <p> At ten minutes past seven Judge Bond, Lt. Col. E. R. Ludlow, and Major Pine
                        Coffin arrived from Cairo and were met by a detachment of the Military
                        Mounted Police. Considerable excitememt was caused by their arrival. From
                        the moment that the detachment of Mounted Police arrived at the station the
                        villagers in the vicinity collected in considerable numbers, and when the
                        train drew up at the platform there must have been between three and four
                        hundred lining the approach to the station. The party was met at the station
                        by Mahmoud Bey Shoucri. It will interest your readers to learn that every
                        comfort for the members of the Court, including Osman Bey Mortada, greffier,
                        has been arranged for by the Military of the Interior, who have placed rooms
                        at their disposal in the mondirieh. </p>
                    <p> For the moment, I can give you no further news. The commencement of the
                        trial to-morrow morning is awaited here with great interest, especially by
                        the large number of Press representatives who have arrived. Speculation as
                        to the results of the trial is rife both here and in Cairo, and, indeed,
                        probably throughout Egypt. To anticipate the verdict, to assent that such
                        and such sentences will be passed, or that the accused will be liberated
                        without punishment, is exceedingly foolish and absolutely futile. That
                        justice will be meted out to the offenders is the desire of all, and the
                        constitution of the special tribunal may be considered as a guarantee of the
                        right course being taken. The scoused have been provided with most able
                        lawyers for their defence and it cannot be doubted that the decision of the
                        Court, wahtever it may be, will be in accordance with the evidence and,
                        therefore, just. </p>

                    <p> I cannot say how long the trial will last, as it is impossible to discover
                        what course the proceedings will take, in so far as the defence is
                        concerned. It is possible that two days may suffice, but on the other hand,
                        it may spread over three or four days. </p>

                    <head>EVIDENCE OF OFFICERS</head>
                    <dateline>Chibin el Kom, Sunday.</dateline>
                    <p> The special tribunal, under the presidency of Boutros Pacha Ghali, commenced
                        its sittings at ten o'clock this morning and adjourned at 1 p.m. for an
                        interval of three hours. Sometime before the trial commenced a considerable
                        crowd collected in the vicinity of the moudirieh, but admirable oder was
                        kept by the police. When I entered the tent shortly after nine o'clock
                        nearly every seat was occupied and the tables reserved for the Press were
                        crowded with Special Correspondents, of whom there were over forty. </p>
                    <p> At ten minutes to ten the fifty-two men who have been arrested were brought
                        into Court and placed in the docks, which face each other. The charge also
                        includes seven others who have not been found. Each prisoner carried round
                        his neck a large card bearing the number under which he is entered on the
                        charge sheet. The accused varied in age considerably, some being but youths,
                        of 18 or 19, and others old men, but all were coarse-featured, uneducated
                        sons of the soil. A few minutes after ten the members o the tribunal took
                        their seats; after which the names of the accused were called out, and the
                        general charge was read by the Secretary to the Court, Osman Bey Mortada, in
                        which the events of the 13th inst., as revealed by the preliminary enquiry,
                        were related in Arabic and the prisoners were charged with taking part
                        therein. </p>

                <div type="item">
                    <byline>A Contretemps.</byline>
                    <p> The three lawyers for the defence, Maltres Ahmed Bey Yousef, Ismain Bey
                        Assem, and Mohamed Bey Yousef, then informed the Court which of the
                        prisoners each represented, and Bontros Pacha Ghali commenced to ask each
                        individual what answer he desired to make to the charge, whether he pleaded
                        "guilty" or "not guilty." This was to be done according to the numbering of
                        the prisoners, but it was found that the numbers had been chagned. As
                        considerable in-convenience would be caused throughout the trial by the
                        numbers not coinciding with the names of the prisoners, the President of the
                        Tribunal ordered them to be re-changed and the tribunal left the Court until
                        this was done, a delay of half-an-hour being caused by the contretemps. </p>

                    <byline>Not Guilty.</byline>
                    <p> On the return of the tribunal the prisoners were charged individually, and
                        all pleaded "not guilty." Various reasons and denials were given. Some were
                        in their houses that morning, others were not in the vilage, a few of the
                        mean pleaded that they were ill and not on the scene at all, and several
                        merely said they had done nothing. </p>

                    <byline>Major Pine-Coffin's Evidence.</byline>
                    <p> The first witness for the prosecution was Major Pine Coffin, who came into
                        Court with his arm in a sling and limping slightly, and he was allowed to
                        sit while he gave his evidence. Witness deposed that on Wednesday, the 13th
                        inst., he went out to shoot pigeons near the village of Denishwai in cmopany
                        with four other officers. They rode from the camp on horseback for a short
                        distance, after which they met a carriage which had been sent for them by
                        some perosn. When they got near the village they got out of their carriage
                        and walked along the road where they met a man wearing a blue galabieh and
                        red slippers and accompanied by four or five fellaheen, whom witness took to
                        represent the omdeh. The onbashi of the police, who accompanied them, had
                        been sent on in front to ask permission of the omdeh for the officers to
                        shoot pigeons. </p>
                    <p> Questioned by Lt. Col. E. R. Ludlow, Major Pine-Coffin said that all the
                        officers were in khaki uniform, wearing knee- breeches and spurs and
                        helmets, and all wore their regimental shoulder badges. </p>
                </div>
                <div type="item">
                    <byline>Permission to Shoot.</byline>
                    <p> Major Pine-Coffin was then asked by Mr. Hayter if he could identify this man
                        from among the prisoners in the docks, and the witness pointed out as an old
                        man, prisoner No. 11, as being the man whom he met on the road. Continuing,
                        witness said that when he went out pigeon shooting he always obtained
                        beforehand the permission of the omdeh of the village. Not being able to
                        speak Arabic, witness told his guide, Abdul, ot ask the manif they might
                        shoot pigeons. the man said "Yes," but told Abdul that they must go far back
                        from the village. Witness pointed out some trees and asked, through his
                        guide, if that was far enough away, and was told that it was. Having
                        received permission to shoot, witness, Capt. Baull, and Lieut. Smithwick
                        went off to the trees, while Capt. Bostock and Lieut. Porter went to the
                        south-east of the village. A map was then shown Major Pine-Coffin, who
                        pointed out the positions which they took up. </p>
                    <p> Continuing, witness said that he sent the guide to the other two officers to
                        see if they were far enough away from the village and that everything was in
                        order. Of the party at the trees Major Pine-Coffin was in the middle, with
                        Capt. Bull on his left and Lieut. Smithwick on his right. Witness fired one
                        shot at a pigeon and then turning round henoticed that Capt. Bull was trying
                        to charge his gun. This man had been given charge of Capt. Bull's cartridge
                        bag to carry for him. </p>

                    <byline>Beginning of Trouble.</byline>
                    <p> Witness then hurried towards the officers who were on the other side and saw
                        that the men became more excited because they saw smoke issuing form a spot
                        near the village. Very shortly afterwards Abdul, the guide, came running
                        back and was very excited. He said that something was on fire and that the
                        other officers were being mobbed. Witness went across the road, followed by
                        Capt. Bull and Lieut. Smithwick. He did not know about the fire except from
                        seeing the smoke. As they went towards Capt. Bostock and Lieut. Porter to
                        help them they were followed by the natives. On their arrival at the scene
                        witness asked what was the matter and was told by Lieut. Porter that his gun
                        had been taken from him and had gone off accidentally, and that he thought a
                        woman had been shot. Witness understood, at the time, that the woman was
                        dead, and realising that Lieut. Porter's position was serious he desired to
                        get the officers away without trouble. </p>
                </div>
                <div type="item">
                    <byline>Lieut. Porter Arrested.</byline>
                    <p> Witness, who had not been attacked personally up to this point, gave up his
                        gun and desired the other officers to do the same. He then told Lieut.
                        Porter that he had killed a woman and that he must take him away, and would,
                        therefore, arrest him. Intimating this to the crowd he took Lieut. Porter by
                        the neck and commenced to march him off. Capt. Bull and Lieut. Smithwick
                        were behind him, but he did not see the former. Starting towards the
                        carriages they were surrounded on the right and left sides and in the rear
                        by fellaheen, but he could not say that there were any in front of them. </p>
                    <p> At this point witness was asked to identify from among the fifty-two
                        prisoners those whom he knew to have formed past of the crowd. Of these he
                        recognised 29, stating that he was not prepared to swear that they all took
                        part in the attack, but was confident that they were present. </p>

                    <byline>The Ringleader.</byline>
                    <p> Prisoner No. 28, Mohamed Darous Azwan, was, said witness, the ringleader of
                        the mob, which he urged on with great energy, but he could not say if he
                        carried a stick. In identifying prisoner No. 9 witness remarked that he
                        believed him to have taken the part of the officers. Witness was informed
                        that No. 28 said he had given him (the witness) water and that the latter
                        had offered him his watch and a bakshish. Witness said that he had offered
                        his watch to show that he would pay for any damage that was done and to try
                        to pacify them. Prisoner did not take the watch. It was pointed out to
                        witness that at the inquiry he did not recognise Nos. 4, 25, and 13, but
                        that he did so now. Witness stated that, as he had sadi before, he could not
                        swear to them, but that he spoke to the best of his belief. </p>

                    <byline>Major Struck Senseless.</byline>
                    <p> At the time that they started for the carriage all the officers were fairly
                        near together. They were all within an area of about fifty yards and he was
                        escorting Lieut. Porter. When they got about half-way to the carriage a man
                        struck witness from behind on the head and he was knocked senseless, and had
                        no recollection of what happened afterwards until he regained consciousness.
                        He lost consciousness three times. The next thing that he remembered was
                        that they were going along the road followed by a crowd of fellaheen with
                        sticks who were throwing mud. Capt. Bull and Capt. Bostock were on the road
                        and were pursued by natives with nabouts and he shouted to them to get back
                        fo camp. Witness's helmet was knocked off his head early in the attack and
                        he lost his watch, medeal ribbon and brooch, and cartridges, and his coat
                        was ripped up. Being knocked senseless a second time witness recovered
                        consciousness to find a man hittin ghis arm with a nabout and he felt that
                        it was broken. He saw that Lieuts. Porter and Smithwick were with him, while
                        Capts. Bull and Bostock were well ahead. </p>

                    <byline>Dragged to the Village.</byline>
                    <p> The natives dragged witness and Lieuts. Porter and Smithwick back towards
                        the village, witness only being semi conscious. They were made to sit down
                        and Lieut. Porter said, "Oh, they are going to burn us." Witness regained
                        full consciousness when the onbashi of police returned and gave him water.
                        There were probably people helping them and these would probably have taken
                        their part before but dared not. The man whom witness had taken to represent
                        the omdeh was, he believed, the same man who met him last year. He had no
                        reason to believe that the guide misinterpreted what this man said. </p>

                    <p> Major Pine-Coffin was recalled and counsel for the defence were asked if

                        He gave the watch as a payment for the burned tibn, and not as a reward for
                        services rendered. </p>
                    <p> In answer to Mohamed Bey Youssef he said that the four men whom they met
                        were on the road when they got out of the carriages and that he did not
                        recognise any of them among the prisoners except No. 11, whom he took to
                        represent the omdeh. The man who held the cartridges and the one who told
                        them where to go were of this party. The only previous notice these men had
                        that the officers of the party wished to go shooting was that given by the
                        onbashi of police when he went to inform the omdeh. </p>
                    <p> Counsel pointed out that three persons, other than the woman, were found
                        wounded. "Did witness know of this?" "No, he only knew that they woman was
                        wounded and he believed her to be dead,:" as told him by Lieut. Porter.
                        Witness always understood that wild pigeons, such as they were shooting at,
                        were public property when they were outside the bounds of the village. </p>
                    <p> Before retiring, Major Pine-Coffin asked to be allowed to say that he had
                        marched through the country for three years and had always been received
                        with every respect by the omdehs and notabilities of the villages. On his
                        aprt he was alwasy kind to the natives and never had any ill feeling against
                        them. </p>

                    <byline>Lieut. Smithwick's Evidence.</byline>
                    <p> Lieut. Smithwick, who was called as next witness, said that ongetting out of
                        the carriage he wwent to the extreme right. After firing two shots he saw
                        the guide beckoning excitedly to him and he went along the road towards the
                        other party, Major Pine Coffin and Capt. Bull having already gone. When he
                        got within 50 or 60 yards of the crowd he heard a muffled report and saw the
                        people surge back. He saw Lieut. Porter standing there and a man with his
                        gun in his hand. He saw nobody lying wounded. He also saw that Lieut. Porter
                        was being handled roughly and Major Pine-Coffin take hold of him, by the
                        arm, and when he got up to them he was told to take the other arm. He did
                        not understand, but thought the idea was to arrest Lieut. Porter. Major
                        Pine-Coffin told him to give up his gun, and as he did so it was snatched
                        from him. Mohamed Darous Azwan, prisoner No. 48, appeared to witness to be
                        one of the leaders of the mob. They were joined by Capts. Bull and Bostock,
                        and on reaching the carriages the other four officers got in and he mounted
                        his horse and rode away. Turning round he saw that those in the carriage
                        were being pulled out and he returned but was pulled off his horse. Someone
                        shouted for them to run, and they all started together, Capts. Bull and
                        Bostock leading. </p>

                    <byline>Savage Attack.</byline>
                    <p> After he had gone a short way he saw Major Pine-Coffin lying on the ground
                        with his face downwards and a native on top of him. He pulled the man off,
                        and identified prisoner No. 24 as being the man. Witness saw Capt. Bull
                        struck twice with half a brick on the side, back, and head. Capt. Bull
                        staggered, dazed, and bleeding profusely. Witness himself was struck with a
                        brick on the face and on the back and neck by a nabout. The fellaheen
                        dragged them back towards the village and threw them on the ground, kicking
                        them to make them rise. Witness was unconscious. He saw Major Pine-Coffin
                        hit twice and identified one man in the crowd who proposed to cut their
                        throats were made to sit on the threshing floor surrounded by heaps of tibn
                        as if they meand to burn them. Witness recognised witness No. 9, whom he
                        believed to be friendly. </p>
                    <p> Capt. Bostock, who was next called deposed that he was with Lieut Porter
                        about 300 yards from the village and 100 yards from the tibn. After nine
                        shots had been fired people gathered round and a fire broke out which lasted
                        two minutes. He tried to reach the carriage by offering bakshish. He managed
                        to reach the road and was beaten continuously. He saw Capt. Bull struck and
                        bleeding and pulled from the carriage, while they were beating him severely.
                        When the officers ran to the camp witness led and called for help. On
                        returning from the camp hes aw Capt. Bull lying unconscious. The
                        sergeant-major made a hasty examination of the captain and saw a severe
                        wound on the right temple and three or four on the head. They took him to
                        camp as quickly as possible. Witness made a superficial post-mortem
                        examination of the body and concluded that death was due to concussion of
                        the brain and sunstroke. </p>
                    <p> Dr. Nolan was then called and stated that in his report he had said that the
                        wounds were caused by violent blows with a blunt instrument, but the direct
                        cause of death was heat apoplexy. Capt. Bostock's evidence was consistent
                        with his report. </p>
                    <p> Dr. Nolan stated that, after hearing the evidence, he concluded that death
                        was due to heat apoplexy aggravated by concussion of the brain caused by
                        blows. </p>

                    <dateline>Suakin, June 20.</dateline>
                    <p> The heavy rains are beginning to show signs in the mountains on the
                        Suakin-Athera line and El Kaimakam Longfield Bey, R.E., chief engineer and
                        assistant director of railways, is taking precautionar measures to cope with
                        them, as last year's wash-outs have taught the railways a good lesson.
                        Bimbashi Ali Eff. Shawki has inspected the whole of the line from Atbara to
                        Suakin, and it is hoped that no damage will be done to the linet his year,
                        especially as so many bridges and culverts have been put down this year. </p>
                    <p> Mr. Kerr, Acting Governor Red Sea Provinces, has arrived here from Erkoweit
                        to examine some important cases both here and at Port Sudan. He will return
                        to Erkoweit in a few days. </p>
                    <p> The hot weather has now "come to stay" at Suakin. The hot winds and
                        sandstorms are almost unbearable. </p>

                    <p> Advices from Athens report that M. Naoum, first dragoman of the Hellenic
                        Legation in Constantinople, is the most probable candidate for the post of
                        Hellenic Consul General in Egypt, which has been rendered vacant by the
                        recall of M. Gennadis. </p>
                    <p> M. Naoum is, it is true, a foreign subject, but in virtue of the new law
                        concerning dragomans in the service of the Hellenic Government, M. Naoum can
                        easily become a naturalised Hellenic subject. </p>
                    <p> The Athens "Acropolis," speaking of the probable appointment of M. Naoum,
                        dwells upon the valuable services rendered by that diplomatist as assistant
                        delegate at the negotiations for the conclusion of the Treaty of Peace and
                        the Consular Convention with the Turkish Government. M. Naoum was also one
                        of the delegates for the conclusion of the Turko-Hellenic Commercial
                        Convention. In conclusion, the "Acropolis" alludes to the judgment and
                        diplomatic tact displayed by M. Naoum in the negotiations for a commercial
                        arrangement with Egypt. </p>

                    <head>OLD CENTRE OF MAHDISM LOYAL.</head>
                    <p> We are glad to be able to inform our readers of the complete success of the
                        column under Miralai O'Connell Bey, Moudir of Kordoan, which left for
                        Taloudi towards the end of last month. </p>
                    <p> The column was composed of 350 men of the Camel Corps and 200 Sudanese
                        infantry drawn from the garrisons of El Obeid and Bars. Its task was
                        extremely arduous. It had to march over 250 miles through districts which
                        ahd been converted into quagmires by the heavy rains. The men were often up
                        to their necks in water, and how transport animald and especially camels,
                        could have been brought through these sloughs passes the understanding. None
                        the less the column struggled on and finally reached and relieved Taloudi on
                        June 12. </p>
                    <p> The survivors of the garrison of 100 men reported that after the attack made
                        on them by Arabs during a "diluks," or native dance, in which two officers
                        and 40 men were killed, they had held out in their zeribs and repulsed
                        several attacks. Meantime the Nubas of the hill and several Baggara clans of
                        the district attacked the rebels, who eventually retierd to Jebel Illiri, a
                        mountain S.E. of Talondi, which has for long been the haunt of criminals and
                        broken men of every tribe. </p>
                    <p> these banditti made common cause with the rebels of Taloudi, but must now
                        repent their folly. The Moudir of Kordofan with his force immediately
                        attacked and stormed their stronghold, thus disposing of both the Taloudi
                        rebels and the outlaws of teh Illiri mountain. 350 of the enemy perished,
                        100 prisoners were taken, and their complete overthrow made it possible for
                        the Government to send back a squadron of Sudanese cavalry which had been
                        dispatched from Shendi to Kaka, on the White Nile, to co-operate, if
                        necessary, with the western column. </p>
                    <p> The causes of the outbreak are still obscure but O'Connell Bey denies the
                        rumor that reached Khartoum via Kodok that it had been provoked by the
                        misconduct of Egyptian officers towards the Arab women of the district. In
                        his opinion -- and there is every reason to trust his knowledge of Kordofan
                        and its tribes, -- the Taloudi Arabs, who had long been wont to raid and
                        enslave the unfortunate Nubas of the neighbouring mountains, viewed the
                        establishment of a Government at Taloudi with bitter hostility and resolved
                        to rid themselves of it at the first opportunity. </p>
                    <p> A very satisfactory feature of this brillian little campaign is the attitude
                        of the great majority of teh tribes of Southern Kordofan. Nubars and Arabs
                        alike opposed the rebels and the people of Jebel Gedir, the first Mahdist
                        centre in the country, where Mohamed Ahmed of Dongola remained after leaving
                        Abba island in 1881 and where the Kawakla tribe possessed a famous and holy
                        stone on which the Prophet Mohamed is said to have sat and prayed, showed
                        themselves aboslutely loyal. </p>
                    <p> The new Government has evidently won the respect of large sections of the
                        Sudanese, -- a repsect that will be considerably enhanced by the news of its
                        latest victory. </p>

                    <byline> TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE" </byline>
                    <p> Sir, -- Your readers will, for the most part, concur in the concluding
                        observations of your comment on the pathetic relation by a Cairo
                        correspondent of "Our Englishman's" midnight misadventure in search of
                        adventure after dining, it must be supposed, not wisely however well,
                        winding up by crossing the Rubicon. But the preface convicting the Secret
                        Police of having "grossly exceeded their powers," seems scarcely justified
                        in your correspondent's story of the mishap. </p>
                    <p> Had "our Englishman" paid attention at school to his classics, he would not
                        have failed to remember the Latin dietum, "Mens tuum negotium;" indicating
                        the only safe course to outsiders when thieves are being looked after in
                        dark corners by the constituted authorities. </p>
                    <p> He would have borne in mind, too, another classical adage, "Mens tuus
                        oculus," useful to, and intended for, over-curious persons in search of
                        midnight adventures. From "our Englishman's" interest in the capture by the
                        guardians of public safety of the "native lady," there is left a faint
                        suspicion that the attraction which led to his headlong chase after the
                        police in a "hantour" from the English Church to the Telegraph Office, was
                        the exciting prospect of witnessing some fray in which the "negotium" of the
                        police might be women's instead of men's. </p>
                    <p> Wittingly or Unwittingly, "our Englishman” seems to have done his levels
                        best to associate himself with the deeds of darkness of the malefactor who
                        so indignantly repundiated the honour of his acquaintance at the caracol. </p>
                    <p>There is a tinge of ingratitude, too, in complaining of the kind privilege
                        accorded him of being alluded to drive in his own hired carriage, albeit at
                        his own expense, accompanied by a special escort, instead of being conveyed
                        to the police station in 'Black Maria" at the expense of the Egyptian
                        Government, according to a practice less suited to the dignified position of
                        "our Englishman.” </p>
                    <p>There is an aphorism of French origin, "Save me from my friends not borne in
                        mind by your correspondent in giving evidence, that the "peppery individual”
                        in whose behalf he demands ‘‘complete satisfaction for this outrage” on a
                        victim of his own "legitimate curiosity,” 'soundly rated the whole assembly”
                        at the police caracol (we can easily imagine the language in which a
                        proficient in kitchen Arabic and Italian would express himself). This, as
                        you say, in London or Paris, would have ensured him a night's lodging for
                        the remaining hours, under bars and bolts, to be followed, next day, by a
                        suitable fine from police magistrate. </p>

                    <head>BATHING AT ALEXANDRIA.</head>
                    <head>TO THE EDITOR OF "THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</head>
                    <p>Sire,—With reference to your interesting article on "The Bathing Season," I
                        should like to point out that the subsidiary precautions which you suggest,
                        such as provision of boats, etc., will be quite ineffectual to make the
                        Alexandria-Ramleh coast a safe resort for bathing, unless something is done
                        to protect the port and bays along the coast from the heavy seas by means of
                        breakwaters. As long as the quays from Kait Bey to Gebel Silsila are exposed
                        to the sea swept under N. W., N. and N.B. gales, not only can nothing in the
                        way of promenade piers or bathing places be established in that port, but
                        even the quay itself stands in danger of being demolished by a high sea.
                        What should be done is to construct a breakwater between Kait Bey Point and
                        Silsila Point on the line of shoals which exists between these points. Such
                        a breakwater could, I understand, be constructed for about L.E. 50,000,
                        enclosing a calm-water space for boating, bathing, etc., of some 2,000
                        acres. The rent and fees which would be obtained would in a short period
                        re-coup the Municipality for the expenditure incurred. Something similar
                        might be done to convert Stanley Bay into a safe bathing and boating place,
                        and perhaps at other points along the coast. Alexandria would then possess
                        boating and bathing accommodation worthy of its position as the largest
                        seaport in the Eastern Mediterranean — Yours etc., </p>

                    <head>THE RUSSIAN OUTLOOK.</head>
                    <p>There seems to be no practical doubt that, whatever may have been the cause
                        of the trouble at Bielostok, the massacre of the Jews, which is still going
                        on, has been committed with the connivance, if not at the actual suggestion
                        of the local authorities. That, of course, is entirely in agreement with the
                        classic tradition in Russia. Whenever the Government and the people are at
                        loggerheads, or likely to be so, you may look for a "pogrom"- that is to
                        say, a massacre of the Jews. The Hebrew is the lightning-conductor by means
                        of which the Russian bureaucracy is wont to divert public attention from its
                        own misdeeds. This time, however, it is difficult to see what the Government
                        has to gain. In the first place, the news of the Bielostok affair has caused
                        something like a panic on the Bourse, and it has added fuel to the flames of
                        conflict between the Government and the Duma. The outlook, therefore, is not
                        improving as time goes on, and the evolution of any reasonable
                        constitutional system from the existing welter of conflicting theories seems
                        more remote than ever.</p>

                    <head>ILL-TREATMENT OF TURKISH ARMENIANS.</head>
                    <p>The “Times” has received from Mr. G, Hagopian some extracts from private
                        letters written by'Turkish Armenians describing the ill-treatment to which.
                        They are subjected by Turkish soldiers and Hamidieh Kurds in Erzerum, Van,
                        Bitlis, Sasun, and other parts of Turkish Armenia. One of the writers, in a
                        letter dated April 10, states that in consequence of great tumults at
                        Erzerum the Armenian merchants and citizens had closed their shops. He adds
                        that many emissaries pass from Turkey into Caucasia in order to excite the
                        Mohamedans against the Armenians and thus prevent the latter from helping
                        their kinsfolk in the Turkish Empire. In the neighbourhood of Bitlis famine
                        is spreading, and Van is in a state of terror dreading a general massacre.
                        Another letter dated from Sasun on January 5 states that in the plain of
                        Mush the taxes of those who have nothing are exacted from those who are
                        better off. Fighting has on several occasions taken place between the Turks
                        and Kurds, and the Armenians who endeavoured to save their villages from
                        being looted. At Zaitoun, according to the statement of a third writer,
                        collective arrests take place of young men accused of being political
                        criminals; and fears are expressed that the Turkish authorities are seeking
                        opportunity to carry out "their usual programme.” </p>

                    <head>PROFESSOR PETRIE'S LATEST WORK.</head>
                    <p>The expedition to Sinai the winter before last, the record of which is now
                        presented to us under the title of “Researches in Sinai,” was for Professor
                        Flinders Petrie the realisation of a long-cherished ambition. When, over a
                        quarter of a century ago, he first came to Egypt, and read the stories of
                        the Sinaitic monuments, he was filled with a desire to be able to visit
                        them, and this wish remained with him through the subsequent years employed
                        in other spheres of activity. The Professor largely achieved his object by
                        means of what would appear to be an unfortunate circumstance. The reduction
                        of the means provided by the Exploration Fund made it necessary to choose a
                        site where copying was more required than the costly work of excavation. We
                        cannot but feel that this and the other reasons which led to the selection
                        of Sinai as the field of operations, was a happy combination which has
                        brought results that will be appreciated not merely by Egyptologists and
                        archæologists generally, but also by Bible-students and the reading public.
                        The difficulties under which the researches were carried on were many, and
                        varied much from those met within Egyptian exploration.</p>
                    <p>The author tells us that the food for the party of 34 workers b]had to be
                        provided at five days’ journey from the base of operations, and every drop
                        of water had to be carried many miles. In Sinai grim nature gives you the
                        stone and the serpent, instead of the bread and the fish." Then, too, the
                        camel was the only means of conveyance on the long and tedious journeys, and
                        lastly, the Bedouin of the desert is unfitted to bear the fatigue connected
                        with the work of excavation, and it was necessary to send for 30 natives
                        from Upper Egypt.</p>
                    <p>The party, leaving Suez at the beginning of December, went South into the
                        wilderness, the historic "three days journey" to Wady Ghrandel, and thence
                        to Magareh, where the search for inscriptions commenced in real earnest.
                        Here were discovered the sculptured rocks bearing the image of King
                        Semerkhet, of the First Dynasty (5,000 B.C.). The scene of King
                        Semerkhet—or, as spelt in Egypt,— Mersekha—has been engraved on the smooth
                        face of the upper sandstone rock, nearly 400 feet above the floor of the
                        Valley. Why this record of Semerkhet’s conquest was placed in such an
                        out-of-the-way spot it is difficult to understand, for it is not likely to
                        be noticed by any but those passing immediately by it.</p>
                    <p>This monument, the only one now remaining at Maghareh—the others are in Cairo
                        Museum—has through thousands of years of storm and sunshine remained
                        impervious to atmoapheric influences, and the original face does not appear
                        to have lost even a single coat of grain sands. Three figures of the king
                        were found, vis., as king of Upper Egypt, with his Ka name, with the crown
                        of lower Egypt; second, as king of Lower Egypt, unnamed; and, third, as king
                        of Upper Egypt, with the hawk name, uncrowned, smiting a chief of the
                        Bedouins whom he has seized.</p>

                        <byline>Turquoise Syndicate's Vandalism.</byline>
                        <p>Professor Petrie relates a sad story of the results of the policy of
                            greed carried out by a turquoise syndicate. This company, some three or
                            four years ago, obtained a concession, and no sort of supervision of
                            operations seems to have been exercised by the responsible authorities.
                            Io consequence a number of very valuable monuments were ruthlessly
                            destroyed in the haste to acquire turquoises.</p>
                        <p>“Everything gave way to the desire for dividends, with the result that
                            the promoters lost their money, the natives lost their turquoises, and
                            the world lost many of its most ancient monuments. ...Ignorant engineers
                            destroyed, what was, in the European market of museums, worth far more
                            than all the turquoises which they extracted.”</p>
                        <p>As Professor Petrie bitterly adds: "The Goths, who protected and
                            preserved the monuments of Rome, were cultivated in comparison with the
                            dividend-hunting prospector.” It is small consolation to know that the
                            materialistic Vandals lost their money in the "enterprise," and one
                            feels that the punishment suggested in another case by the “Mikado"
                            would not be too severe an atonement for these misdeeds. </p>
                        <p>The party arrived just in time to prevent a further tale of destruction
                            by natives, who were imitating the example of the white man. Blasting
                            operations were in progress, without heed to the sculptures, and a large
                            block with an inscription of Sahura was just saved from being broken up.
                            To add to the annoyance of the Professor and his colleagues the minor
                            inscriptions of the XIIth dynasty were effaced by a native whilst they
                            were at dinner. "Nothing was safe, and the only possible course was to
                            remove the remaining carvings bodily from the rocks”; a grant to cover
                            the cost being allowed by Sir William Garstin. </p>

                        <byline>The Hat-Hor Temple.</byline>
                        <p>The chief feature of the work of the expedition was the excavation of the
                            temple of Hat-Hor at Serabit. In the work before us we have a detailed
                            and very instructive description of the ancient dwellers in the land,
                            illustrated with a series of excellent photographs. Professor Petrie
                            deals at length with the much-debated point as to the form of ritual
                            practised in the temple by the ancients. He is now convinced that to
                            suppose it was imported Egyptian worship would be a "crude
                            misunderstanding," as all the ritual traced is Semitic. Tons upon tons
                            of white ashes were found near the temple, which are held to be an
                            important factor in favour of the Semitic theory. The suggestion put
                            forward by Lepsius that these ashes are beds of slag is dismissed as a
                            mistake, based upon ignorance of meteorology, and Dr. Petrie also
                            refuses to entertain the other theory that they originated from the
                            burning of plants to extract alkali, as this is an unlikely place for
                            obtaining plants. "It is evident," he says, "that the nature of these
                            offerings here to the 'Mistress of Turquoise' would be festal sacrifices
                            vows and free-will offerings, as they were for the purpose of honouring
                            the goddess, with prayers and offerings before the work (in the mines)
                            and the payment of vows after it. This is exactly what we find; the fat
                            and blood were burnt and perished, and the ashes remain with the pottery
                            from the social feast of the worshipper." In a country so barren as
                            Sinai it is not be expected that the bones of the animals sacrificed
                            would long escape the beasts and birds of prey, and therefore the
                            failure to discover bones presents no problem.</p>
                        <p>Occupation of the temple is traced back to Snefern, the last king of the
                            IIIrd dynasty, about 4750 B.C., and the connection of subsequent rulers
                            down to 1150 B. C. is made out. The temple reached the height of its
                            glory under Amenemehat III., in whose reign, for 40 years, there was
                            constant activity there. The cave was daring that time enlarged to its
                            present size. On the walls are the names of an official, Ameny, and his
                            family; and the cave in the name of Amenemehat III. The other altar was
                            also inscribed by this king. {To be continued}</p>

                    <head>THE AUSTRALIAN NORTH.</head>
                    <p>For some time the conviction has been growing in Australia that greatly
                        increased population is an absolute necessity, if it is not to be
                        jeopardised as a British possession. The policy that is to attract
                        immigrants to the South and West is already generally outlined, although it
                        has not been passed by Parliament: but another attempt is to be made to
                        develop the most desolate part of the island continent—that is to say, the
                        Northern Territory of South Australia. At present a No-Man’s Land, more
                        remote and less attractive even than the Never-Never Land of Queensland, it
                        contains little save a coastal cable station. But the Governor-General of
                        the Commonwealth, in opening the Parliament, announced that the territory,
                        which it has always seemed ridiculous to include in South Australia, is
                        about to be offered to the Commonwealth as a whole. The general consensus of
                        opinion is that white labour is unsuitable for so hot a country : but the
                        labour party will strongly object to the introduction of Indians, or other
                        coloured citizens of the Empire. Foreigners, of course, are not to be
                        thought of. This will probably be backed up by those who uphold the doctrine
                        of a "White Australia" in its entirety, it remains to be seen what success
                        will attend a compromise that has been suggested, that coloured labour,
                        though allowed preforce in the North, should only be allowed as far as a
                        certain degree of latitude.</p>

                        leave Lughmann for Cabul, three muftis of the court were brought up for
                        trial for taking bribes and maltreating the poor. The Ameer gave orders to
                        the governor that the men were to be buried alive, and the sentence was duly
                        executed after his departure.</p>

                        celui-ci n'opère bien que lorsqu'il est pris avec de bons aliments et des
                        boissons fortifiantes, telles que vin, café, thé. Chacun choisit, pour se

                        occupations. La fatigue de la purgation étant annulée par l'effet de la
                        bonne alimentation, on se décide aisément à recommencer autant de fois que
                        cela est nécessaire.</p>
