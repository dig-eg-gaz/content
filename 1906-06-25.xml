                    <head>THE STATE OF RUSSIA.</head>
                    <p>The news received from Russia during the last few days is hardly likely to
                        encourage the partisans of a Russian alliance. The cruel massacre of Jews at
                        Bielostok, the peasant outbreaks in several provinces, the revival of the
                        strikes in St. Petersburg, and the continuance of insubordination in the
                        Black Sea fleet, show conclusively that the concessions hitherto extored
                        from the Government will not satisfy the mujiks, much less the revolutionary
                        organisations. The Duma, which complains of the dilatory methods of
                        officialism, is itself criticised by the insurgent peasants for its
                        incapcacity to effect an instant change in the conditions of their tenure,
                        and the naive villager, who in his simplicity imagines that the whole land
                        system of Russia can be remodelled in a fortnight, chafes against the delays
                        caused by the limitation of the powers of his representatives. The
                        disclosures of Prince Urusoff have, of course horrified the Duma and the
                        intelligent members of the Russian public but whether they were entirely
                        wise from the patriotic point of view is highly doubtful. The one chance for
                        Russia, the one possibility of avoiding a period of anarchy and revolution
                        that may last for a generation, is a working agreement between the remains
                        of the autocracy and the Constitutional Democrats of Duma. Should this be
                        rendered impossible by the folly of the autocrcy or by the indiscretion of
                        members of the assembly nothing can save Russia from being reduced to
                        importence. The overthrow of the autocracy could only lead to a victory of
                        the extremis forces, the Jacobins of the Russian reign of terror, whose
                        subversive ideals are hardly likely to prove efficient in aught but
                        destruction. The Constitutional Democrats, the conservative element both
                        among peasants and land owners, would alike fall victims to a revolutionary
                        town proletariat organised and led by the apostles of anarchy, and if
                        thedemands and actions of the revolutionary party furnish any clue to their
                        policy we may expect them to aim at a very extreme form of revolutionary
                        Socialism. The alternative is military despoism with General Trepoff at the
                        helm. Metternich's dictum that one can do anything with bayonets but sit on
                        them condemns any such regime in advance. </p>
                    <p>As far as one can judge there are five parties in Russia proper which count.
                        The old guard of autocracy, powerless for the moment to attract support, but
                        still capable of playing off one party against another; the peasants easily
                        roused to fury against Cossacks, or Jews, tax collectors, or "intelligents,"
                        childisly ignorant and incapable, for the present, of that combination that
                        would lead their enormous numbers to certain victory, the various
                        revolutionary groups whose programmes are rigidly Socialist or frankly
                        Anarchist, but which agree in aiming at the utter overthrow of the
                        Bureacracy, the Church, and the Tsardom, and in drawing for support upon the
                        poorer Jew and the industrial population of the great cities; the
                        constitutional party, with all its subdivisions, that desire the
                        establishment in one form or another of a constitutional Government upon
                        British or French lines; and lastly, the Separatist sections -- united in a
                        common desire to throw off the Russian yoke once and for all and whose hopes
                        may yet be gratified should the threatened Revolution sweep away the Tsardom
                        and convert the army into a national guard. A third of the Poles, a great
                        majority of the Finns, Georgians, Armenians, and Moslems of Central Asia and
                        the Caucasus form this gropu. Should the autocracy sink in blood we may yet
                        see a Polish republic, an independent Georgia, and Transcaucasia, its
                        Armenians overthrown, won back by the armies of the Sultan. As for the ruin
                        of thousands of French investors and the bankruptcy of the Empire, nothing,
                        unhappily, seems more probable.</p>

                <byline>(From our special correspondent)</byline>
                <dateline>Chibin el Kom, Saturday evening.</dateline>
                <p>On arriving at Chibin el Kom at half past three this afternoon, one of my first
                    duties was to call upon the mourdir, Mohmoud Bey Shoncri, and to receive the
                    ticket which would admit me to the special tables which have been reserved for
                    members of the press for the trial of the villagers who are accused of
                    unprovokedly attacking British officers at Denishwai on the 13th inst., as has
                    already been related in the "Egyptian Gazette." The trial will be held in a
                    large marquee, which has been erected in the inner court of the mondirieh, and
                    only those holding tickets will be admitted. The preparations fot the trial,
                    which have been made under the direction of the Ministry of the Interior, are
                    excellent. At one end of the tent a platform has been erected, which is destined
                    for the members of the special tribunal. At each side of, and at right angles to
                    this platform are the "docks," in which the accused will be placed, and directly
                    in front of these are the tables for the representatives of the Press, forming
                    three sides of a square, within which are the seats for thsoe directly concerned
                    in the trial, including the officers of the Army of Occupation who will be
                    present. Beyone the Press tables are several rows of seats for thsoe who have
                    obtained tickets for the trial. </p>
                <p>On the east bank of the canal which runs past Chibin el Kom the British troops,
                    consisting of a company of Mounted Infantry, a detachment of the 6th
                    Inniskilling Dragoons,, dismounted, and forty Military Mounted Police are
                    encamped. Mr. Machell, who returned here yesterday and will remain until the end
                    of the trial, is staying on board the deliabieh Scout. Moberly Bey returned to
                    Chibin this evening from Denishwai, where he has spent the whole of to-day
                    collecting evidence. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="item">
                <head>Excitement at Chibin</head>
                <p>At ten minutes past seven Judge Bond, Lt. Col. E. R. Ludlow, and Major Pine
                    Coffin arrived from Cairo and were met by a detachment of the Military Mounted
                    Police. Considerable excitememt was caused by their arrival. From the moment
                    that the detachment of Mounted Police arrived at the station the villagers in
                    the vicinity collected in considerable numbers, and when the train drew up at
                    the platform there must have been between three and four hundred lining the
                    approach to the station. The party was met at the station by Mahmoud Bey
                    Shoucri. It will interest your readers to learn that every comfort for the
                    members of the Court, including Osman Bey Mortada, greffier, has been arranged
                    for by the Military of the Interior, who have placed rooms at their disposal in
                    the mondirieh. </p>
                <p>For the moment, I can give you no further news. The commencement of the trial
                    to-morrow morning is awaited here with great interest, especially by the large
                    number of Press representatives who have arrived. Speculation as to the results
                    of the trial is rife both here and in Cairo, and, indeed, probably throughout
                    Egypt. To anticipate the verdict, to assent that such and such sentences will be
                    passed, or that the accused will be liberated without punishment, is exceedingly
                    foolish and absolutely futile. That justice will be meted out to the offenders
                    is the desire of all, and the constitution of the special tribunal may be
                    considered as a guarantee of the right course being taken. The scoused have been
                    provided with most able lawyers for their defence and it cannot be doubted that
                    the decision of the Court, wahtever it may be, will be in accordance with the
                    evidence and, therefore, just. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="item">
                <head>Duration of Trial</head>
                <p>I cannot say how long the trial will last, as it is impossible to discover what
                    course the proceedings will take, in so far as the defence is concerned. It is
                    possible that two days may suffice, but on the other hand, it may spread over
                    three or four days. </p>

                <head>EVIDENCE OF OFFICERS</head>
                <dateline>Chibin el Kom, Sunday.</dateline>
                <p>The special tribunal, under the presidency of Boutros Pacha Ghali, commenced its
                    sittings at ten o'clock this morning and adjourned at 1 p.m. for an interval of
                    three hours. Sometime before the trial commenced a considerable crowd collected
                    in the vicinity of the moudirieh, but admirable oder was kept by the police.
                    When I entered the tent shortly after nine o'clock nearly every seat was
                    occupied and the tables reserved for the Press were crowded with Special
                    Correspondents, of whom there were over forty. </p>
                <p>At ten minutes to ten the fifty-two men who have been arrested were brought into
                    Court and placed in the docks, which face each other. The charge also includes
                    seven others who have not been found. Each prisoner carried round his neck a
                    large card bearing the number under which he is entered on the charge sheet. The
                    accused varied in age considerably, some being but youths, of 18 or 19, and
                    others old men, but all were coarse-featured, uneducated sons of the soil. A few
                    minutes after ten the members o the tribunal took their seats; after which the
                    names of the accused were called out, and the general charge was read by the
                    Secretary to the Court, Osman Bey Mortada, in which the events of the 13th
                    inst., as revealed by the preliminary enquiry, were related in Arabic and the
                    prisoners were charged with taking part therein. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="item">
                <byline>A Contretemps.</byline>
                <p>The three lawyers for the defence, Maltres Ahmed Bey Yousef, Ismain Bey Assem,
                    and Mohamed Bey Yousef, then informed the Court which of the prisoners each
                    represented, and Bontros Pacha Ghali commenced to ask each individual what
                    answer he desired to make to the charge, whether he pleaded "guilty" or "not
                    guilty." This was to be done according to the numbering of the prisoners, but it
                    was found that the numbers had been chagned. As considerable in-convenience
                    would be caused throughout the trial by the numbers not coinciding with the
                    names of the prisoners, the President of the Tribunal ordered them to be
                    re-changed and the tribunal left the Court until this was done, a delay of
                    half-an-hour being caused by the contretemps. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="item">
                <byline>Not Guilty.</byline>
                <p>On the return of the tribunal the prisoners were charged individually, and all
                    pleaded "not guilty." Various reasons and denials were given. Some were in their
                    houses that morning, others were not in the vilage, a few of the mean pleaded
                    that they were ill and not on the scene at all, and several merely said they had
                    done nothing. </p>

            <div type="item">
                <byline>Major Pine-Coffin's Evidence.</byline>
                <p>The first witness for the prosecution was Major Pine Coffin, who came into Court
                    with his arm in a sling and limping slightly, and he was allowed to sit while he
                    gave his evidence. Witness deposed that on Wednesday, the 13th inst., he went
                    out to shoot pigeons near the village of Denishwai in cmopany with four other
                    officers. They rode from the camp on horseback for a short distance, after which
                    they met a carriage which had been sent for them by some perosn. When they got
                    near the village they got out of their carriage and walked along the road where
                    they met a man wearing a blue galabieh and red slippers and accompanied by four
                    or five fellaheen, whom witness took to represent the omdeh. The onbashi of the
                    police, who accompanied them, had been sent on in front to ask permission of the
                    omdeh for the officers to shoot pigeons. </p>
                <p>Questioned by Lt. Col. E. R. Ludlow, Major Pine-Coffin said that all the
                    officers were in khaki uniform, wearing knee- breeches and spurs and helmets,
                    and all wore their regimental shoulder badges. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="item">
                <byline>Permission to Shoot.</byline>
                <p>Major Pine-Coffin was then asked by Mr. Hayter if he could identify this man
                    from among the prisoners in the docks, and the witness pointed out as an old
                    man, prisoner No. 11, as being the man whom he met on the road. Continuing,
                    witness said that when he went out pigeon shooting he always obtained beforehand
                    the permission of the omdeh of the village. Not being able to speak Arabic,
                    witness told his guide, Abdul, ot ask the manif they might shoot pigeons. the
                    man said "Yes," but told Abdul that they must go far back from the village.
                    Witness pointed out some trees and asked, through his guide, if that was far
                    enough away, and was told that it was. Having received permission to shoot,
                    witness, Capt. Baull, and Lieut. Smithwick went off to the trees, while Capt.
                    Bostock and Lieut. Porter went to the south-east of the village. A map was then
                    shown Major Pine-Coffin, who pointed out the positions which they took up. </p>
                <p>Continuing, witness said that he sent the guide to the other two officers to see
                    if they were far enough away from the village and that everything was in order.
                    Of the party at the trees Major Pine-Coffin was in the middle, with Capt. Bull
                    on his left and Lieut. Smithwick on his right. Witness fired one shot at a
                    pigeon and then turning round henoticed that Capt. Bull was trying to charge his
                    gun. This man had been given charge of Capt. Bull's cartridge bag to carry for
                    him. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="item">
                <byline>Beginning of Trouble.</byline>
                <p>Witness then hurried towards the officers who were on the other side and saw
                    that the men became more excited because they saw smoke issuing form a spot near
                    the village. Very shortly afterwards Abdul, the guide, came running back and was
                    very excited. He said that something was on fire and that the other officers
                    were being mobbed. Witness went across the road, followed by Capt. Bull and
                    Lieut. Smithwick. He did not know about the fire except from seeing the smoke.
                    As they went towards Capt. Bostock and Lieut. Porter to help them they were
                    followed by the natives. On their arrival at the scene witness asked what was
                    the matter and was told by Lieut. Porter that his gun had been taken from him
                    and had gone off accidentally, and that he thought a woman had been shot.
                    Witness understood, at the time, that the woman was dead, and realising that
                    Lieut. Porter's position was serious he desired to get the officers away without
                    trouble. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="item">
                <byline>Lieut. Porter Arrested.</byline>
                <p>Witness, who had not been attacked personally up to this point, gave up his gun
                    and desired the other officers to do the same. He then told Lieut. Porter that
                    he had killed a woman and that he must take him away, and would, therefore,
                    arrest him. Intimating this to the crowd he took Lieut. Porter by the neck and
                    commenced to march him off. Capt. Bull and Lieut. Smithwick were behind him, but
                    he did not see the former. Starting towards the carriages they were surrounded
                    on the right and left sides and in the rear by fellaheen, but he could not say
                    that there were any in front of them. </p>
                <p>At this point witness was asked to identify from among the fifty-two prisoners
                    those whom he knew to have formed past of the crowd. Of these he recognised 29,
                    stating that he was not prepared to swear that they all took part in the attack,
                    but was confident that they were present. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="item">
                <byline>The Ringleader.</byline>
                <p>Prisoner No. 28, Mohamed Darous Azwan, was, said witness, the ringleader of the
                    mob, which he urged on with great energy, but he could not say if he carried a
                    stick. In identifying prisoner No. 9 witness remarked that he believed him to
                    have taken the part of the officers. Witness was informed that No. 28 said he
                    had given him (the witness) water and that the latter had offered him his watch
                    and a bakshish. Witness said that he had offered his watch to show that he would
                    pay for any damage that was done and to try to pacify them. Prisoner did not
                    take the watch. It was pointed out to witness that at the inquiry he did not
                    recognise Nos. 4, 25, and 13, but that he did so now. Witness stated that, as he
                    had sadi before, he could not swear to them, but that he spoke to the best of
                    his belief. </p>

                <p>At the time that they started for the carriage all the officers were fairly near
                    together. They were all within an area of about fifty yards and he was escorting
                    Lieut. Porter. When they got about half-way to the carriage a man struck witness
                    from behind on the head and he was knocked senseless, and had no recollection of
                    what happened afterwards until he regained consciousness. He lost consciousness
                    three times. The next thing that he remembered was that they were going along
                    the road followed by a crowd of fellaheen with sticks who were throwing mud.
                    Capt. Bull and Capt. Bostock were on the road and were pursued by natives with
                    nabouts and he shouted to them to get back fo camp. Witness's helmet was knocked
                    off his head early in the attack and he lost his watch, medeal ribbon and
                    brooch, and cartridges, and his coat was ripped up. Being knocked senseless a
                    second time witness recovered consciousness to find a man hittin ghis arm with a
                    nabout and he felt that it was broken. He saw that Lieuts. Porter and Smithwick
                    were with him, while Capts. Bull and Bostock were well ahead. </p>

                <byline>Dragged to the Village.</byline>
                <p>The natives dragged witness and Lieuts. Porter and Smithwick back towards the
                    village, witness only being semi conscious. They were made to sit down and
                    Lieut. Porter said, "Oh, they are going to burn us." Witness regained full
                    consciousness when the onbashi of police returned and gave him water. There were
                    probably people helping them and these would probably have taken their part
                    before but dared not. The man whom witness had taken to represent the omdeh was,
                    he believed, the same man who met him last year. He had no reason to believe
                    that the guide misinterpreted what this man said. </p>

                <p>At this point the Court rose, and did not meet again till four o'clock. </p>
                <p>Major Pine-Coffin was recalled and counsel for the defence were asked if they
                    wished to ask any questions. </p>
                <p>In answer to Ismain Bey Assem, witness said that the man to whom he offered his
                    watch was among the crowd but he could not say what his intentions were. He gave
                    the watch as a payment for the burned tibn, and not as a reward for services
                    rendered. </p>
                <p>In answer to Mohamed Bey Youssef he said that the four men whom they met were on
                    the road when they got out of the carriages and that he did not recognise any of
                    them among the prisoners except No. 11, whom he took to represent the omdeh. The
                    man who held the cartridges and the one who told them where to go were of this
                    party. The only previous notice these men had that the officers of the party
                    wished to go shooting was that given by the onbashi of police when he went to
                    inform the omdeh. </p>
                <p>Counsel pointed out that three persons, other than the woman, were found
                    wounded. "Did witness know of this?" "No, he only knew that they woman was
                    wounded and he believed her to be dead,:" as told him by Lieut. Porter. Witness
                    always understood that wild pigeons, such as they were shooting at, were public
                    property when they were outside the bounds of the village. </p>
                <p>Before retiring, Major Pine-Coffin asked to be allowed to say that he had
                    marched through the country for three years and had always been received with
                    every respect by the omdehs and notabilities of the villages. On his aprt he was
                    alwasy kind to the natives and never had any ill feeling against them. </p>

                <p>Lieut. Smithwick, who was called as next witness, said that ongetting out of the
                    carriage he wwent to the extreme right. After firing two shots he saw the guide
                    beckoning excitedly to him and he went along the road towards the other party,
                    Major Pine Coffin and Capt. Bull having already gone. When he got within 50 or
                    60 yards of the crowd he heard a muffled report and saw the people surge back.
                    He saw Lieut. Porter standing there and a man with his gun in his hand. He saw
                    nobody lying wounded. He also saw that Lieut. Porter was being handled roughly
                    and Major Pine-Coffin take hold of him, by the arm, and when he got up to them
                    he was told to take the other arm. He did not understand, but thought the idea
                    was to arrest Lieut. Porter. Major Pine-Coffin told him to give up his gun, and
                    as he did so it was snatched from him. Mohamed Darous Azwan, prisoner No. 48,
                    appeared to witness to be one of the leaders of the mob. They were joined by
                    Capts. Bull and Bostock, and on reaching the carriages the other four officers
                    got in and he mounted his horse and rode away. Turning round he saw that those
                    in the carriage were being pulled out and he returned but was pulled off his
                    horse. Someone shouted for them to run, and they all started together, Capts.

                <byline>Savage Attack.</byline>
                <p>After he had gone a short way he saw Major Pine-Coffin lying on the ground with
                    his face downwards and a native on top of him. He pulled the man off, and
                    identified prisoner No. 24 as being the man. Witness saw Capt. Bull struck twice
                    with half a brick on the side, back, and head. Capt. Bull staggered, dazed, and
                    bleeding profusely. Witness himself was struck with a brick on the face and on
                    the back and neck by a nabout. The fellaheen dragged them back towards the
                    village and threw them on the ground, kicking them to make them rise. Witness
                    was unconscious. He saw Major Pine-Coffin hit twice and identified one man in
                    the crowd who proposed to cut their throats were made to sit on the threshing
                    floor surrounded by heaps of tibn as if they meand to burn them. Witness
                    recognised witness No. 9, whom he believed to be friendly. </p>
                <p>Capt. Bostock, who was next called deposed that he was with Lieut Porter about
                    300 yards from the village and 100 yards from the tibn. After nine shots had
                    been fired people gathered round and a fire broke out which lasted two minutes.
                    He tried to reach the carriage by offering bakshish. He managed to reach the
                    road and was beaten continuously. He saw Capt. Bull struck and bleeding and
                    pulled from the carriage, while they were beating him severely. When the
                    officers ran to the camp witness led and called for help. On returning from the
                    camp hes aw Capt. Bull lying unconscious. The sergeant-major made a hasty
                    examination of the captain and saw a severe wound on the right temple and three
                    or four on the head. They took him to camp as quickly as possible. Witness made
                    a superficial post-mortem examination of the body and concluded that death was
                    due to concussion of the brain and sunstroke. </p>
                <p>Dr. Nolan was then called and stated that in his report he had said that the
                    wounds were caused by violent blows with a blunt instrument, but the direct
                    cause of death was heat apoplexy. Capt. Bostock's evidence was consistent with
                    his report. </p>
                <p>Dr. Nolan stated that, after hearing the evidence, he concluded that death was
                    due to heat apoplexy aggravated by concussion of the brain caused by blows. </p>

                <dateline>Suakin, June 20.</dateline>
                <p>The heavy rains are beginning to show signs in the mountains on the
                    Suakin-Athera line and El Kaimakam Longfield Bey, R.E., chief engineer and
                    assistant director of railways, is taking precautionar measures to cope with
                    them, as last year's wash-outs have taught the railways a good lesson. Bimbashi
                    Ali Eff. Shawki has inspected the whole of the line from Atbara to Suakin, and
                    it is hoped that no damage will be done to the linet his year, especially as so
                    many bridges and culverts have been put down this year. </p>
                <p>Mr. Kerr, Acting Governor Red Sea Provinces, has arrived here from Erkoweit to
                    examine some important cases both here and at Port Sudan. He will return to
                    Erkoweit in a few days. </p>
                <p>The hot weather has now "come to stay" at Suakin. The hot winds and sandstorms

                <head>HELLENIC CONSULATE-GENERAL</head>
                <p>Advices from Athens report that M. Naoum, first dragoman of the Hellenic
                    Legation in Constantinople, is the most probable candidate for the post of
                    Hellenic Consul General in Egypt, which has been rendered vacant by the recall
                    of M. Gennadis. </p>
                <p>M. Naoum is, it is true, a foreign subject, but in virtue of the new law
                    concerning dragomans in the service of the Hellenic Government, M. Naoum can
                    easily become a naturalised Hellenic subject. </p>
                <p>The Athens "Acropolis," speaking of the probable appointment of M. Naoum, dwells
                    upon the valuable services rendered by that diplomatist as assistant delegate at
                    the negotiations for the conclusion of the Treaty of Peace and the Consular
                    Convention with the Turkish Government. M. Naoum was also one of the delegates
                    for the conclusion of the Turko-Hellenic Commercial Convention. In conclusion,
                    the "Acropolis" alludes to the judgment and diplomatic tact displayed by M.
                    Naoum in the negotiations for a commercial arrangement with Egypt. </p>

                <head>OLD CENTRE OF MAHDISM LOYAL.</head>
                <p>We are glad to be able to inform our readers of the complete success of the
                    column under Miralai O'Connell Bey, Moudir of Kordoan, which left for Taloudi
                    towards the end of last month. </p>
                <p>The column was composed of 350 men of the Camel Corps and 200 Sudanese infantry
                    drawn from the garrisons of El Obeid and Bars. Its task was extremely arduous.
                    It had to march over 250 miles through districts which ahd been converted into
                    quagmires by the heavy rains. The men were often up to their necks in water, and
                    how transport animald and especially camels, could have been brought through
                    these sloughs passes the understanding. None the less the column struggled on
                    and finally reached and relieved Taloudi on June 12. </p>
                <p>The survivors of the garrison of 100 men reported that after the attack made on
                    them by Arabs during a "diluks," or native dance, in which two officers and 40
                    men were killed, they had held out in their zeribs and repulsed several attacks.
                    Meantime the Nubas of the hill and several Baggara clans of the district
                    attacked the rebels, who eventually retierd to Jebel Illiri, a mountain S.E. of
                    Talondi, which has for long been the haunt of criminals and broken men of every
                    tribe. </p>
                <p>these banditti made common cause with the rebels of Taloudi, but must now repent
                    their folly. The Moudir of Kordofan with his force immediately attacked and
                    stormed their stronghold, thus disposing of both the Taloudi rebels and the
                    outlaws of teh Illiri mountain. 350 of the enemy perished, 100 prisoners were
                    taken, and their complete overthrow made it possible for the Government to send
                    back a squadron of Sudanese cavalry which had been dispatched from Shendi to
                    Kaka, on the White Nile, to co-operate, if necessary, with the western column. </p>
                <p>The causes of the outbreak are still obscure but O'Connell Bey denies the rumor
                    that reached Khartoum via Kodok that it had been provoked by the misconduct of
                    Egyptian officers towards the Arab women of the district. In his opinion -- and
                    there is every reason to trust his knowledge of Kordofan and its tribes, -- the
                    Taloudi Arabs, who had long been wont to raid and enslave the unfortunate Nubas
                    of the neighbouring mountains, viewed the establishment of a Government at
                    Taloudi with bitter hostility and resolved to rid themselves of it at the first
                    opportunity. </p>
                <p>A very satisfactory feature of this brillian little campaign is the attitude of
                    the great majority of teh tribes of Southern Kordofan. Nubars and Arabs alike
                    opposed the rebels and the people of Jebel Gedir, the first Mahdist centre in
                    the country, where Mohamed Ahmed of Dongola remained after leaving Abba island
                    in 1881 and where the Kawakla tribe possessed a famous and holy stone on which
                    the Prophet Mohamed is said to have sat and prayed, showed themselves aboslutely
                    loyal. </p>
                <p>The new Government has evidently won the respect of large sections of the
                    Sudanese, -- a repsect that will be considerably enhanced by the news of its
                    latest victory. </p>

                <head>ENGLISHMAN'S NIGHT ADVENTURE.</head>
                <byline> TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE" </byline>
                <p>Sir, -- Your readers will, for the most part, concur in the concluding
                    observations of your comment on the pathetic relation by a Cairo correspondent
                    of "Our Englishman's" midnight misadventure in search of adventure after dining,
                    it must be supposed, not wisely however well, winding up by crossing the
                    Rubicon. But the preface convicting the Secret Police of having "grossly
                    exceeded their powers," seems scarcely justified in your correspondent's story
                    of the mishap. </p>
                <p>Had "our Englishman" paid attention at school to his classics, he would not have
                    failed to remember the Latin dietum, "Mens tuum negotium;" indicating the only
                    safe course to outsiders when thieves are being looked after in dark corners by
                    the constituted authorities. </p>
                <p>He would have borne in mind, too, another classical adage, "Mens tuus oculus,"
                    useful to, and intended for, over-curious persons in search of midnight
                    adventures. From "our Englishman's" interest in the capture by the guardians of
                    public safety of the "native lady," there is left a faint suspicion that the
                    attraction which led to his headlong chase after the police in a "hantour" from
                    the English Church to the Telegraph Office, was the exciting prospect of
                    witnessing some fray in which the "negotium" of the police might be women's
                    instead of men's. </p>
                <p>Wittingly or Unwittingly, "our Englishman” seems to have done his levels best to
                    associate himself with the deeds of darkness of the malefactor who so
                    indignantly repundiated the honour of his acquaintance at the caracol. </p>
                <p>There is a tinge of ingratitude, too, in complaining of the kind privilege
                    accorded him of being alluded to drive in his own hired carriage, albeit at his
                    own expense, accompanied by a special escort, instead of being conveyed to the
                    police station in 'Black Maria" at the expense of the Egyptian Government,
                    according to a practice less suited to the dignified position of "our
                    Englishman.” </p>
                <p>There is an aphorism of French origin, "Save me from my friends not borne in mind
                    by your correspondent in giving evidence, that the "peppery individual” in whose
                    behalf he demands ‘‘complete satisfaction for this outrage” on a victim of his
                    own "legitimate curiosity,” 'soundly rated the whole assembly” at the police
                    caracol (we can easily imagine the language in which a proficient in kitchen
                    Arabic and Italian would express himself). This, as you say, in London or Paris,
                    would have ensured him a night's lodging for the remaining hours, under bars and
                    bolts, to be followed, next day, by a suitable fine from police magistrate. </p>

                <head>BATHING AT ALEXANDRIA.</head>
                <head>TO THE EDITOR OF "THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</head>
                <p>Sire,—With reference to your interesting article on "The Bathing Season," I
                    should like to point out that the subsidiary precautions which you suggest, such
                    as provision of boats, etc., will be quite ineffectual to make the
                    Alexandria-Ramleh coast a safe resort for bathing, unless something is done to
                    protect the port and bays along the coast from the heavy seas by means of
                    breakwaters. As long as the quays from Kait Bey to Gebel Silsila are exposed to
                    the sea swept under N. W., N. and N.B. gales, not only can nothing in the way of
                    promenade piers or bathing places be established in that port, but even the quay
                    itself stands in danger of being demolished by a high sea. What should be done
                    is to construct a breakwater between Kait Bey Point and Silsila Point on the
                    line of shoals which exists between these points. Such a breakwater could, I
                    understand, be constructed for about L.E. 50,000, enclosing a calm-water space
                    for boating, bathing, etc., of some 2,000 acres. The rent and fees which would
                    be obtained would in a short period re-coup the Municipality for the expenditure
                    incurred. Something similar might be done to convert Stanley Bay into a safe
                    bathing and boating place, and perhaps at other points along the coast.
                    Alexandria would then possess boating and bathing accommodation worthy of its
                    position as the largest seaport in the Eastern Mediterranean — Yours etc., </p>
