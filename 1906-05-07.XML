                <p>LORD CROMER AND EGYPTIAN COMPANIES</p>
                <p>Lord Cromer’s Report oovere such a vast fiold that it is impossible for us to
                    deal with the many subjects of economics, finance, admi¬nistration, and work of
                    the Ministries in one short article. Each reader will seek for himself the
                    chapter which interests him most, and there are few indeed who have not some
                    interest in one or more of the Egyptian companies. These will read with close
                    attention what Lord Cromer has to say of the economic condition of the country
                    as bearing on companies, present and future. The attitude of the Government
                    towards commercial undertakings is explicitly stated. It is no function of a
                    Government to distinguish between good and bad investments. Of that the investor
                    must himself be the sole judge. There has been too much talk of Egyptian "booms”
                    as if we were all being carried along on a tidal wave of prosperity to find
                    ourselves presently stranded or dashed on the rocks. Clearly and logically Lord
                    Cromer reviews the situation leading to the conclusion, in which he will have
                    the support of those who best know the country, that the prosperity of Egypt is
                    no mushroom growth which will eventuate in a reaction. We heartily welcome such
                    a much-needed authoritative statement of the physician whose finger has been on
                    the pulse of Egypt for a quarter of a century. Whilst this hopeful view will
                    encourage the bona-fide investor it most not be concluded that there is no word
                    of warning for the reckless and over-sanguine. Far from it, for it is clearly
                    pointed oat that Egypt is an agricultural country liable to the vicissitudes of
                    crops, markets, and plant diseases, and though in many respects less liable to
                    these than other countries, still, entire exemption may not always be looked
                    for. The masterly exposition of conditions in Egypt must be read in its entirety
                    to be folly appre¬ciated, and we heartily commend a careful perusal of the
                    chapter to all who take an interest in the country. Investors mast neither
                    assume that all Egyptian undertakings are based on an unsounded foundation, nor
                    must they ran to the opposite extreme of judging them all as sound concerns.
                    "Caveat emptor” is a sound motto, and no Govern¬ment can wholly protect a fool.
                    Egypt can absorb much capital, which can be safely and profitably employed in
                    development of land and in other ways, bat the company promoter is as
                    unscrupulous as he is ubiquitous. and if he mislead the unwary by garbled
                    quotations from Lord Cromer’s Report, the victim has himself alone to blame.
                    Encourage¬ment and warning are so blended that the timorous and unwary will find
                    much for their guidance, and for our part we cannot see what more could have
                    been said for their direction.</p>

                    <p>The usual weekly Florio Rubattino steamer from Genoa, Leghorn, Naples, and
                        Messina, was due to arrive at Alexandria yesterday, but the steamer has not
                        been sighted yet and no news has been received as to the vessel’s
                        whereabouts. The Alexandrian agency sent telegrams to Italy to the head

                        this afternoon.</p>
                    <p>It is certain that the steamer touched at Naples and it is believed that as
                        there was a general strike then at that port, the steamer has been delayed

                    <p> The situation at Rafah, near El Arish, may be summed up as follows</p>
                    <p>The Turks are encamped at a point fifty yards on the Egyptian side of the
                        frontier, some four miles from the coast. They number 50 soldiers, with 3
                        officers and a tax collector.</p>
                    <p>The two pillars which have always been recognised by the people of El Arish
                        as the boundary marks were undoubtedly removed by the Turks on the night of
                        April 12. Owing no doubt to the fact that the frontier is populated only by
                        Bedouins who cultivate the plain between Sheikh Zeyoud—16 miles from El
                        Arish—and Gaza in places where water is to be found the news seems to have
                        taken some time to reach El Arish and Cairo.</p>
                    <p>Eleven Egyptian telegraph poles have been appropriated and Turkish poles
                        substituted.</p>
                    <p>The Sawarka Bedouins of the frontier district complain that the Turks have
                        stolen their cattle and after driving-them away have turned their horses
                        loose on their corn fields.</p>
                    <p>A strip of land about 800 yards in width lying between the recognised
                        frontier line and the road running from the interior to Ain Rafeib, north of
                        Rafah, has been registered in the Saltan’s name. It is said to prodace a
                        good crop.</p>
                    <p>We gather that the attitude of the Turks towards-the Egyptian delegates was
                        courteous enough, but that they absolutely refused to admit the right of
                        Capt. Waymouth, of H.M.S. Minerva, who accompanied them, to take any part
                        whatever in the discussion relative to the violation of the frontier, on the
                        ground that it was a purely Egyptian concern.</p>
                    <p>The so-called German mission, which arrived at El Arish and was sent back to
                        Gaza, was composed of Hebrews, most of them Russian subjects, who wanted to
                        buy land at El Arish. The fact that a German Jew led the party accounts for
                        the extraordinary and misleading stories that have been spread as to the
                        aims of the "mission.” In our opinion the “disguised German officers” or
                        “secret agents” were sim- ply what they declared themselves to be, viz.,
                        poor Jews looking for a good bargain in land. Henceforward the German agents
                        must be class'd with the great gun which one of our contemporaries averred —
                        it is true. on Bedouin evidence—to have entered Rafah behind a team of 18
                        horses.</p>
                    <p>Rafah is 25 miles E.N.E of El Arish and boasts a couple of good wells—Ain
                        Rafeih and Ain Rafah. The boundary pillars, one of which bore an inscription
                        commemorating H.H, the Khedive’s visit in 1897, have marked the frontier
                        “min zaman,” and there seems no rea¬son to distrust the evidence of the
                        “oldest inhabitants” cf El Arish in this particular.</p>

                    <p> H.M.S. Minerva. returned here on Friday evening from Ei Arisb, after nearly

                        there, but some very wild rumours are current Yesterday afternoon the
                        Minerva received a wireless message from outside and left immediately, and
                        up to the time of writing has not returned.</p>
                    <p>There is a rumour that the message received by the Minerva was to the effect
                        that there was a ship in distress outside, but whether this is the case or

                    <head>THE TURKISH STANDPOINT.</head>
                    <p>In the course of an interview with a repre-sentative of the‘‘Egyptian
                        Gazette" this morning, H. E.Ghazi Mukhtar Pacha,the Imperial Ottoman High
                        Commissioner, declared that the Sublime Porte agreed with Lord Fitzmaurice
                        as regards the first part of his statement in the House of Lords on
                        Wednesday, that “the Sinai pen¬insula did not form part of Egypt proper.”
                        The Sublime Porte, however, could not agree with the second part of that
                        statement, namely, that it remained under undisputed Egyptian
                        Administration. Here the Porte differed, as Lord Fitzmaurice did not qualify
                        that admini¬stration, which is, according to the Porte, temporary, and
                        subject to reversion (repren- able) to Turkish administration.</p>
                    <p>The Ghazi further declared that in view of the commercial importance which
                        would be likely to accrue to Akaba as the Red Sea terminus of the Hedjaz
                        Railway, it would obviously not be advisable to have two different
                        administrations so close to one another ; bat that Turkey had never
                        entertained the least idea, which Great Britain attributed to her, of
                        nearing the Suez Canal; all she desired was to have more elbow room for
                        Akaba.</p>
                    <p>He was convinced of a pacific solution.</p>
                    <p>As for the report of Germany supporting Turkey, this was totally
                        unfounded.</p>

                    <head>THE NATIVE ATTITUDE.</head>
                    <p>A correspondent writes:</p>
                    <p>It is greatly to be hoped that the expression of opinion on the part of a
                        native notable given to your Damanhour Correspondent, and which appeared in
                        Saturday's paper, is anything but epresentative of the feelings entertained
                        by rthe great majority of the Egyptian native population towards the English
                        people. But should this unfortunately be the case, it is, I think, greatly
                        due, not as you say in your leading article to “the tactless behaviour of
                        two or three officers, private soldiers, or tour¬ists,” but to the general
                        want of consideration for native feelings shown by so large a number of
                        English people. Europeans generally, I know, are quite as bad as my
                        countrymen, but as they simply profit by British rule, without taking part
                        in the government of the country; it is only the conduct of the English that
                        stands BO prominently in view. “We must show them our superiority,” said a
                        young Eng- lishman to me a few days ago, and it is this very claim of
                        superiority that is so harmful in its effects, as well as unjust in its
                        conception. Still it is greatly to be hoped that as a body the fellaheen, as
                        yon remark, are “either neutral or actually friendly to the British
                        Occupation.” Indeed it would be strange were it otherwise, for it is
                        inconceivable that after enjoying many years of freedom from tyranny, and
                        experienc- ingan ever-growing prosperity they would wish to go back to the
                        old misrule—or worse. Why should they? Religions fanaticism, we are told
                        would be the important factor, but there is certainly no reason why it
                        should be. Even the suppression of slavery has been carried out in such a
                        way that no interference with the Koran and its teachings has taken place,
                        while the ill-advised action of certain missionary zealots has been promptly
                        and effectually check-ed. A great responsibility rests at the present moment
                        on the native Press. Certain papers have of late adopted a far more friendly
                        at¬titude to the British Agent and Advisers, and the policy carried out by
                        the Egyptian Go¬vernment with their help has met with more cordial support
                        than formerly. They will render valuable service if at the present crisis
                        they do their best to strengthen the hands of the Egyptian Government. If
                        they do this, and Egyptian officials take the same firm stand as they did in
                        the recent Alexandria riot, when it will be remembered there was the same
                        sense of fear of a Mohamedan rising, we can all await the action of
                        diplomacy in the frontier question, or in the last resort the clash of arms,
                        without contemplating the possi- bility of so terrible an event as a
                        collision between the Mohamedan and Christian populations.</p>

                    <p>M. Andre Mevil, writing in the “Echo de Paris,” says: “It is to be expected
                        that England will embrace this opportunity of dealing a blow to
                        Constantinople, showing the Porte that she is always to be counted with in
                        the East. Indirectly, too, she would thus deal a blow to German
                        influence.</p>
                    <p>“Nor must we forget that the dispute that has arisen concerning Egypt cannot
                        leave ns indifferent, as, according to article 9 of the Convention of April
                        8, 1904, the French and British Governments are under engagements to lend
                        each other mutual support of their diplomacy for the execution of the
                        clauses relating to Egypt and Morocco. It is certain that if there be need
                        England will receive from ns the same support which she gave ns in the
                        Moroccan affair. From the International point of view, the. Tatah incident,

                    <head>AGITATION AGAINST BARTAU PACHA</head>
                    <head>IMPORTANT MEETING.</head>
                    <p>The agitation among the Armenian com-munity of Alexandria on the subject of
                        deposing Bartau Pacha from the presidency of the community came to a head
                        yesterday, when a mass meeting of all the representatives of the community
                        was held at the Alhambra Theatre. The female sex had been invited to attend,
                        and a large number of ladies put in an appearanoe. Among those present were
                        the leading notables among the Armenians in the city, with the exception of
                        Bartau Pacha, who of coarse refrained from attending.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Bekarian was chosen chairman, and opened the proceedings with a short
                        speech. He declared that it was a great democratic victory, and that the
                        deposition of the president and of the old committee was due to the united
                        efforts of the Armenians, assisted by the good services of Mustapha Pacha
                        Ibadi, the new Governor of Alexandria, Miralai Hopkinson Bey, Commandant of
                        the Alex andria City Police, and Heddaya Bey, who acted in a most fair and
                        equitable manner in this question. The chairman then asked Mr. Damadian to
                        give a concise explanation to the meeting of the reason why it had been con-
                        vened.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Damadian, who spoke for three-quar¬ters of an hoar, declared that the
                        community was entirely victorious and that Bartau Pacha had been obliged to
                        resign against his will. He described the scenes which had occurred at the
                        church on the last three Sundays, and the interview which the Armenian
                        representa¬tive had had with the Governor of Alexandria. He then dealt with
                        the destruction of the tablet erected by Bartan Pacha in the church and
                        showed that it was broken with the general consent of the community, who
                        ob¬jected to the presence of such a tablet in their church. He proposed that
                        a new tablet should be erected in its stead bearing the date of the
                        destruction of the former one, with the words “Maintain the Constitution.”
                        This proposal was greeted with great cheers and daring the entire speech Mr.
                        Damadian was frequently applauded. He then read out an official letter
                        received from the Bishop of Egypt, Monsignor Meguerditch Aghavnouni,
                        addressed to the community, wherein he said that the preparations for the
                        new elections would begin to-day (Monday). Mr. Damadian said that the action
                        of the Bishop was very welcome but somewhat tardy.</p>
                    <p>Daring the speech a number of telegrams and letters were received from the
                        Armenian communities at Cairo and Tantah, all strongly supporting the
                        present policy of the colony. Mr. Damadian thanked the English advisers of
                        the Khedivial Government for having given ear to their grievances, and ended
                        a brilliant speech by calling on all his hearers to pull together so that
                        the community should pre¬serve a united front to its enemies.</p>
                    <p>Three representatives of the Armenians of Alexandria were afterwards elected
                        by acclama-tion. These were Messrs. Sbnorkian, Damadian, and Tonrohondjian.
                        The meeting then closed, while the Armenian Band played the Khedivial
                        March.</p>
                    <p>The agitation against Bartau Pacha began a month ago, when a lawsuit was
                        brought against the Armenian newspaper “Azad Pen” for having given publicity
                        to certain private actions of Bartau Pacha and Mr. Agop Onghourian. The
                        newspaper was defend¬ed by Maitre Mercinier, who made a brilliant speech in
                        defence. The speech was reproduced in the paper and its contents were such
                        that an agitation was at once set on foot to depose Bartau Pacha.</p>

                    <head>WHAT PORT SAID OWES TO THE CANAL</head>
                    <p>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.)</p>
                    <p>Port Said, Thursday.</p>
                    <p> In spite of many pessimistic prognostica¬tions, the colossal American
                        floating dock, Admiral Dewey, got safely through the Canal, a fact which
                        reflects great credit on the officials of the transit service of the Canal
                        Co. It would be impossible to estimate how much Port Said owes to the
                        company. In fact, the very existence and structure of the town and harbour
                        are the result of the opening of the Canal.</p>
                    <p>The “foul and stagnant ditch,” founded on the earnings, according to Lord
                        Palmerston, of "cafe waiters deceived by the newspapers lying on the tables,
                        or grocers and dry goods assistants entrapped by the paper, in which they
                        wrapped their wares," has proved to be a success beyond what the most
                        sanguine may have dared to dream. In the words of Colonel Sir Howard
                        Vincent, a town now flourishes with between 40,000 and 50,000 inhabitants,
                        where fortunes have been made and will be made, where ships can coal quicker
                        than any¬where else in the world; bat which “The Daily News,” with that
                        accuracy of forecast which has always distinguished it, ridiculed as
                        absurd—“the building of a town without money, without water, without stone.”
                        Syn¬onymous as is the United States with every¬thing typical of modem
                        progress, she can as yet show nothing so illustrative of the grit necessary
                        to put through, in spite of organized and influential opposition, so great a
                        feat of engineering. When de Lesaeps cut the first sod of the Suez Canal, he
                        had not at his disposal the mighty machines and appliances which America
                        will use in her latest attempt to cut through the Isthmus of Panama. Long
                        after his detractors are forgotten, the name of Lesseps will be honoured as
                        that of a man who was able, not only to conceive a great idea, but to carry
                        it out.</p>
                    <p>Russian Troops.</p>
                    <p>There seems to be no end to the almost constant stream of Russian troops
                        being re¬patriated from Vladivostock to Odessa. One of their officers who
                        came ashore will remem¬ber with gratitude one of the officials of the
                        Passport Office, who, after the former left the office, found a pocket-book,
                        fall of valuable papers and a large roll of banknotes, which was promptly
                        returned through the Russian Consul.</p>
                    <p>An Innovation.</p>
                    <p> Many people will be pleased to hear that the police have reserved to
                        themselves the privi¬lege of granting leave to cafes to keep open all night
                        At present the cafe mast close at two in the morning ; consequently people
                        living in their neighbourhood will no longer be disturbed from sunset to
                        sunrise.</p>
                    <p>Street Pests.</p>
                    <p>It is pleasing to see also that the police are more vigilant in preventing
                        the molestation of passengers by people selling obscene photo-graphs and
                        post cards, as well as keeping an eye on the numerous touts and shoe-blacks,
                        whose name is legion. The supervision of the Rue de Commerce by two European
                        police officials has done much to mitigate this nui¬sance.</p>
                    <p>The Dust Nuisance.</p>
                    <p>The provision of water-carts has considerably allayed the dust nuisance,
                        though the roads are so far removed from what they ought to be that in
                        places which have received an extra amount of water there is created a mud
                        nuisance for a short time after their passing.</p>
                    <p>H.M.S. Minerva.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday evening the Minerva arrived from El-Areech, off the port. She sent
                        ashore for letters and dispatches, and after the arrival of the Cairo train
                        put out to sea again.</p>
                    <p>Personal.</p>
                    <p> The many friends of Mr. Mailing, British Vice Consul, will regret to hear
                        that, owing to ill-health, it has been necessary for him to leave Port Said
                        for a time for Europe.</p>
                    <p> We are pleased to hear that Dr. Orme, the cleaver surgeon at the Government
                        Hospital, is making a good recovery in England.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Christian, the representative of Messrs. Wills &amp; Co. in their
                        contract work on the harbour extensions, has commenced his duties at Port
                        Said.</p>
