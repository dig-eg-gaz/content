                    <p>The manner in which the news of the release of the Denishwai prisoners has
                        been received is worthy of note. The absence of anything like excitement,
                        demonstration or unrest on the part of the populace is especially gratifying
                        and redounds very much to their credit. This shows that the people of Egypt
                        are making progress in the appreciation of their own dignity and a sense of
                        becoming self-respect. Exceptions prove the rale. Unfortanetely we must call
                        attention to the ravings and rantings and hysterical exeltation of the
                        controlled by Mustapha Pasha Kamel. Nothing of course could have been in
                        worse taste or more distant from the troth than his assertion of having in
                        the smallest degree contributed to the exercise of clemency by the Khedive.
                        To take up soch a standpoint is absolute effrontery. The Pasha clearly
                        thinks that he can turn the occasion to his own adVantage and so we meet
                        with paragraphs such as these in his newepapers- </p>
                    <p>"The generous decision of the National Party at the meeting of the General
                        Assembly to erect a kuttab at Denishwai as a fitting memorial of the tragedy
                        has been received with delight io all parts of Egypt." </p>
                    <p>"Letters of congratulation are daily reaching Our Director thanking him in
                        his quality of Leader for the Party for the enlightened direc tion that has
                        been given to the national commemoration of Denishwai." </p>
                    <p>Or again :-— </p>

                        have realised LE 183 and 660 milliémes."' </p>
                    <p>Evidently these items of news were inspired to throw dust in the eyes of the

                        considerable time but has hitherto only received miserably inadequate

                    <head>EGYPT'S WINTER </head>
                    <p>Our Cairo Corresponiient writes </p>
                    <p>January is nearly half over and there is still no sign of winter in Egypt.
                        There was a slight mist in Cairo until about nine o'clock on Sun- day
                        morning certainly, but by ten o'clock the sun had dispelled the last
                        suspicion of this, and the streets were flooded with sun of an almost equal
                        strength to that of summer. Are we to get any winter at all this season!
                        Opinions upon this point are varied in the extreme. On the one hand it is
                        predicted that the coming Febroary will be one of record cold, and on the
                        other it said that the first balf of January over, we shal] have no reason
                        to fear the advent of cold weather during the present season. It is
                        certainly a most unusual experience for the residents.of Cairo to pass this
                        month in a state of perspiration in the day time and one of warm comfort at
                        night. This time last year people hurried bome at nightfall and took refuge
                        from the biting cold of the atmosphere behind thickly drawn curtains and by
                        the side of the largest stove that was ayailable, while those who were
                        fortunate exough to possess a fireplace in their dwelling were regarded with
                        envy by the rest of their lewe fortanate fellows. The cold wave which
                        attacked England in December hes passed and « general thaw has set in, and
                        here again, unless there is a return of extreme cold to the British Isles
                        the predictions of the weather prophets must be admitted to be entirely at
                        fault, for from the early months of the autumn it has been steadily asserted
                        by those who are usually supposed to know, that the winter in England was to
                        be one of more than ordinary severity, every indication having been
                        fegistered to this effect. It may be that the cold which was expected in
                        Eng- land may pass to us, it may be that the world is to be free from any
                        extremes of temperature during the wipter months, and after all, though we
                        may perhaps miss the stimulating influen- ces of the sharper air, we are at
                        least saving oi! and coal bills which ia these days of inflated rentals is
                        at least a blessing not to be desniead</p>

                        first and primaeval appearance in Cairo. M. Soubeyran as Rhadames belied his

                        adequate as the high priest, and dignified : his great passage, the sentence
                        of Rhadames—a trap to many a bass —was well given, impressive, and
                        convincing. The chorus was good throughout, and triamph ed over the many
                        difficult momenta where th» singing was behind scenes, and practically
                        unaccompanied : and the orchestra was admirable. The three principal singers
                        M. Valette as Amavasro, Mme Magve as Aida, and Mme Pierens as Amneris, were
                        at their best. M. Va- lette was most excellent, the part suited him, and
                        showed the full extent of bis voice and dramatic power: as usval his was
                        thorough and exact, and, best of all for a baritone, he was never off the

                        mezza-voce notes are a charm. Mme Fierens again showed what a grasp she has
                        of opera, and singing, especially in her denunciation of the bloodthirsty
                        priesthood the eloquence and meaning of her lower notes, and the power and
                        passion of her singing al! through proved how completely she had mastered

                        direction. The menrbership shows an 'i of 41 on lest year's figores, the

                        heretofore: A considérable number of members developed into guod shots, so
                        that it was never difficuly at any time throoghout the season, to get

                        mesting a some what easy chance. Some exeolient. play was witnessed on the

                        continaed to have most of the play and Gregson was celled upon to save three

                        Gregson only partly cleared and Cliff running up netted the second goal with
                        a high shot. The Cavalrymen attacked but were stop ped by Purvis. The check
                        was, however, only temporary and the Coldi#tream custodian was called upon
                        to save several shots. Play now became very fast and several players became
                        exvited The referee was equal to the occasion and free kicks were numeroyg,
                        the majority being against the Guards, ome almost giving Woodward a point,
                        the ball jest grazing the bar. The Guards from division came away at a great
                        pace and a inelée ensued in front of the Dragoons citadel, from which Chiff
                        secered and netted the third and final goal. Watson then got away and was
                        missed by two forwards when close in, bet Henry relieved to toach. A pretty
                        attack by the Guards forwards looked dangerous but Hay seoured and gave to
                        Watson who made a strong run to the opposing "95" where Barker in tackling
                        was guilty of an unsportemantike act, for which he was promptly ordered off
                        the field The resulting 'penalty' gave the Dragoons a unique chance, but the
                        leather went wide. The Guards were much the heavier side and weight was
