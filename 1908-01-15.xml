                    <p>EGYPTIAN POLITIV2- DENISHWAIL </p>
                            <p>The manner in which the news of the release of the Denishwai
                                prisoners has been received is worthy of note. The absence of
                                anything like excitement, demonstration or unrest on the part of the
                                populace is especially gratifying and redounds very much to their
                                credit. This shows that the people of Egypt are making progress in
                                the appreciation of their own dignity and a sense of becoming
                                self-respect. Exceptions prove the rale. Unfortanetely we must call
                                attention to the ravings and rantings and hysterical exeltation of
                                the controlled by Mustapha Pasha Kamel. Nothing of course could have
                                been in worse taste or more distant from the troth than his
                                assertion of having in the smallest degree contributed to the
                                exercise of clemency by the Khedive. To take up soch a standpoint is
                                absolute effrontery. The Pasha clearly thinks that he can turn the
                                occasion to his own adVantage and so we meet with paragraphs such as
                                these in his newe- “kuttab at Denishwai as a fitting memorial of the
                                tragedy has been received with delight io all parts of Egypt.”
                                “Letters of congratulation are daily reaching Our Director thanking
                                him in his quality of Leader for the Party for the enlightened direc

                                Denishwai.” Or again :-— “The snbseriptions for the Denishwai which
                                are being collected by “Al- Lewa” have realised LE 183 and 660
                                milliémes.”’ Evidently these items of news were inspired to throw
                                dust in the eyes of the ignorant, bot happily they appear to have
                                been received with stony apathy. </p>
                            <p>THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY </p>
                            <p>The scheme for a National University has now been before the public
                                tor a considerable time but has hitherto only received miserably

                                indifference or to defects in the scheme as it presents itself to
                                the minds of the Egyptians, we are anable to judge However, geserous
                                help is now at hand of a very substantial character which ought to
                                set the enterprise going on thoroughly business lines. The Khedive
                                has consented to an endow. ment of LE 5,00) a year to be taken from
                                the Wakfs Adininistration. This new departore should show the
                                Egyptians that the project has received the Khedivial approbation
                                and is a satisfactory proof ef the enlightened interest which his
                                Highness manifests in the ed2cation of his subjeota. </p>
                            <p>EGYPT'S WINTER </p>
                            <p>Our Cairo Corresponiient writes January is nearly half over and there
                                is still no sign of winter in Egypt. There was a slight mist in
                                Cairo until about nine o'clock on Sun- day morning certainly, but by
                                ten o'clock the sun had dispelled the last suspicion of this, and
                                the streets were flooded with sun of an almost equal strength to
                                that of summer. Are we to get any winter at all this season!
                                Opinions upon this point are varied in the extreme. On the one hand
                                it is predicted that the coming Febroary will be one of record cold,
                                and on the other it said that the first balf of January over, we
                                shal] have no reason to fear the advent of cold weather during the
                                present season. It is certainly a most unusual experience for the
                                residents.of Cairo to pass this month in a state of perspiration in
                                the day time and one of warm comfort at night. This time last year
                                people hurried bome at nightfall and took refuge from the biting
                                cold of the atmosphere behind thickly drawn curtains and by the side
                                of the largest stove that was ayailable, while those who were
                                fortunate exough to possess a fireplace in their dwelling were
                                regarded with envy by the rest of their lewe fortanate fellows. The
                                cold wave which attacked England in December hes passed and «
                                general thaw has set in, and here again, unless there is a return of
                                extreme cold to the British Isles the predictions of the weather
                                prophets must be admitted to be entirely at fault, for from the
                                early months of the autumn it has been steadily asserted by those
                                who are usually supposed to know, that the winter in England was to
                                be one of more than ordinary severity, every indication having been
                                fegistered to this effect. It may be that the cold which was
                                expected in Eng- land may pass to us, it may be that the world is to
                                be free from any extremes of temperature during the wipter months,
                                and after all, though we may perhaps miss the stimulating influen-

                            <p> “Aida” was really finely given : principals, chorus, orchestra,
                                dancers, all excellent, and the scenery and staging were samptnous,
                                worthy of “Aida’s” first and primaeval appear- ance in Cairo. M.

                                instinct with tone and emphasis ; his lower notes are certainly not
                                pleasing, but in the higher register he can when be is not think-

                                passage, the sentence of Rhadames—a trap to many a bass —was well
                                given, impressive, and convincing. The chorus was good throughout,
                                and triamph ed over the many difficult momenta where th» singing was
                                behind scenes, and practically unaccompanied : and the orchestra was
                                admir- able. The three principal singers M. Valette as Amavasro, Mme
                                Magve as Aida, and Mme Pierens as Amneris, were at their best. M.
                                Va- lette was most excellent, the part suited him, and showed the
                                full extent of bis voice and dramatic power: as usval his was
                                thorough and exact, and, best of all for a baritone, he was never

                                again showed what a grasp she has of opera, and singing, especially
                                in her denunciation of the bloodthirsty priesthood the eloquence and
                                meaning of her lower notes, and the power and passion of her singing

                            <p>We are informed that the Ist Battalion 6th Rifles are about to give a
                                dramatic performance at Cairo, in aid of the funds of the Soldiers
                                and Sailors Families Association. The piece selected for
                                presentation is a most amusing farcical.comedy entitled “Our
                                Regiment,” the same piece in fact which this Battalion acted with so
                                moch success last winter at Khartoum We onderstand that the Egyptian
                                Govern. ment has most generously placed the Opera Honse at the

                                Poncet. We are confident, therefore, that the piece will have every
                                scenic advantage that it is possible to provide. February 19 is the

                                balf who gave Smith several opportanitiés. The Guards continaed to
                                have most of the play and Gregson was celled upon to save three
                                shots in rapid succession, two frem Morris.and one from Parker, Half

                                goal to nfl in favor of the Coldstreamers. Before commencing the
                                second half, the Dragoon Captain changed Wdodward to centre half,
                                May going on the right ; and with the assistance of the wind it
                                was'theught they would do better The restart was fot‘in existence
                                many min utes when Wateon got nicely away and things looked
                                promising until Henry tackled jost-in the nick of time Play then
                                settled down in mid-field and for some little time matters were
                                even. Stevens securing from a melee and sent over to Cliff who ran
                                down the touch at a great place and ceatered to Ivey, who sent in @
                                stiff shot which Gregson only partly cleared and Cliff running up
                                netted the second goal with a high shot. The Cavalrymen attacked but
                                were stop ped by Purvis. The check was, however, only temporary and
                                the Coldi#tream custodian was called upon to save several shots.
                                Play now became very fast and several players became exvited The
                                referee was equal to the occasion and free kicks were numeroyg, the
                                majority being against the Guards, ome almost giving Woodward a
                                point, the ball jest grazing the bar. The Guards from division came
                                away at a great pace and a inelée ensued in front of the Dragoons
                                citadel, from which Chiff secered and netted the third and final
                                goal. Watson then got away and was missed by two forwards when close
                                in, bet Henry relieved to toach. A pretty attack by the Guards
                                forwards looked dangerous but Hay seoured and gave to Watson who
                                made a strong run to the opposing “95" where Barker in tackling was
                                guilty of an unsportemantike act, for which he was promptly ordered
                                off the field The resulting ‘penalty’ gave the Dragoons a unique
                                chance, but the leather went wide. The Guards were much the heavier
                                side and weight was telling its own tale play became rough and the
                                referee cautioned lvey twice, also Smith Hay was next conspicuons
                                for a neat solo effort Eluding three of the opposition he ran
                                amartly down the field and looked all over a scorer, when tackled by
                                Parker. The Dragoons were now having the best of matters aud Short
