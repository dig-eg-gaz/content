                    <p>The report of the International' Commission on this important question has
                        now * been made and also published in the " Official Journal" together with
                        many appendices, one of which even gives the number of hours which the
                        members worked at each of the 17 con- ferences required to elaboraterthis
                        report, and immediately following the report we are given a Ministerial
                        decree naming another Commis- sion, whose mission is to advise a8 to the ne-
                        cessary measures to be 'taken. We, in our ignorance, had been thinking all
                        along that this was just what the Internatioual Commis- sion was created
                        for. It is a most strange thing, that from time immemorial, the people who
                        rule the destinies of this country, often seem to have an unconquerable
                        fancy for put- ting the cart before the borse,-and the im- portant matter to
                        which we refer does not appear to have been an exception to the rale, We
                        maintain that if the gentlemen forming this new Vommission named by the
                        Council of Ministers on the 24th December last, had been set to work last
                        summer and had, as they were qualified to do, collected all the necessary
                        data, and if, when this had been done, they had sent for any one member of
                        the Inter- national Commission, and as an expert had submitted to him the
                        subject thus prepared and backed up by all the necessary informa- tion, and
                        had asked him to give to the examination of the question all the time ne-
                        cessary for its study, the expert would then have advised the Commission, in
                        such a way that they would have been able to produce a definite report which
                        would have left no doubt on the question. Such cannot be said of the report
                        before us it is full of doubts and uncertainties from beginning to end, and
                        this can be said without any disparagement to the ability of those who
                        madeit. Tocome to this country as strangers, at the time of the year the
                        least suited. for the observations they had to make, and in 17 days to get
                        to the bottom of such a question, is too much to expect from human nature,
                        however strenuous and however much prolonged was their work. It has been
                        said of some of the best informed men in this country, that it was
                        extraordinary how so-and-so knew as much as he did, for he never seemed to
                        do much except to loaf about, but it is often in this sort of way that
                        information is ac- quired. The International Commissioners laid much stress
                        on the fact that they did not see in the works any notices prohibiting
                        nuisances and enjoining cleanliness; did it never occur to them that works
                        in this country sre generally ran by a gang of Arabs, who cannot read any
                        notice, in whatever lan- gaage it might be written, and that the Earo- pean
                        supervisers do not require such notices ; in this country such matters are
                        generally looked after by a good foreman or ganger, who is properly
                        instructed ;—we have no donbt that the Cairo Water Company has such a man,
                        if not the sooner they get him the better. Among so much that is uncertain
                        we see several things in the report that seem fairly clear, The Commisioners
                        are not satisfied that the water supply is entirely aatisfactory ;—that the
                        in-take from the river is in an unsatisfactory position, and should be moved
                        above the town and future suburbs; that the manner of distributing the water
                        in the poorer quarters of Cairo ig open to the most severe condemna- tion on
                        hygienic grounds; that house taps should be provided," and the. practice. of
                        conveying water from the public taps should be discouraged in every way
                        practicable ; that the sand should be washed with filter- ed water before
                        being used. As the question is still sub-jadice, we will not revert in
                        greater detail to many of its recommenda- tions ; the above semarks suffice
                        to show that very much is necessary which might be undertaken at once, and
                        in order to save time in such an important matter and espe- cially now that
                        acholera epidemic is raging not very far off, would it not be possible for
                        the new commission to first make a pre- liminary report, which~ might
                        confirm that part of the present report,-about which there ean be vo doubt,
                        reserving for further study the more doubtful questions to which the
                        International Commission refers. Not only is time money, but in this case it
                        may mean a great deal more.</p>

                    <p>We are pleased to bear that the principal ice factories .in this town have at
                        last come to an understanding amopg themselves, as announ- ced in another
                        column, to fix once and for all-a constant wholesale and retail price for
                        the aale of ice It is well known that for some years past there has been
                        very keen competition, the actual consumers have benefitted to no very great
                        extent on account of the retail.ice merchants getting s profit out of all
                        proportion to the price paid by them to the manufacturer It has now been
                        decided to fix the prices at a constan€ figure which will still leave the
                        ice merchants in town and at Ramleb a reasonable margin of profit, at the
                        same time protecting the public against the outrageous prices which were on
                        several 'occasions demanded by certain of the merchants last season at #
                        time when there was « scarcity of ice due to breakdowns at one or two of the
                        factories. A central manage- ment 'has, now been arranged for, which will
                        control the whole of the distribution of the ice to the various retail
                        merchants all over the town, and there will be several depéts in convenient
                        parts of the town where house- holders and other small consumers can send
                        their servants to obtain small quantities from 1 oke upwards. The pablic
                        will be duly informed by notices in all the principal local and by special

                        compare most favourably with those of any town in Europe and it is hoped

                        by the acting British Consal General there, Major 1. Ramsay, a summary of
                        which appears in another column of to-day's issue The report states that
                        from Aleppo to Bagdad a service of post carriages has recently been started.
                        These carriages do the journey in about eight or nine days. From Bagdad to
                        Busrah there are British steamers at least once a week, and there are
                        several Turkish steamers. From Busrah to Karachi and Bombay there is the
                        weekly mail steamer of the British India Steam Navigation Company, as well
                        as other steamers. The cost of a carriage from Aleppo to Bagdad is about £15
                        sterling, and é quarter of this sum for one seat. The cost of a first- class
                        ticket by steamer from Bagdad to Karachi is about £10.</p>
                    <p>The fare from Suez to Bombay by steamer is over £34, which by this route
                        would be very little more-from -Alexandria or Port Said to Karachi, while
                        the interest ot the | overland route is not to be compared to the | dreary
                        voyage down the Red Sea and the long tramp from Aden across the Indian
                        Ocean, The short sea journey to Beyrout includes visits to Jaffa and Caiffa,
                        with opportunities of visiting Jerusalem and Nazareth. The train for Aleppo
                        from Beyrout takes a night and a day, from 10.50 p.m. to 6.15 p.m., the
                        follow- ing day, while the traveller, who is not pressed for time can visit
                        Baalbek and Damascus. Then there is Aleppo with its magnificent castle, "the
                        best example of twelfth century Arab workmanship in all Syria." The journey
                        across the great Mesopotamian plains evokes memories of Niniveh, Babylon,
                        and the great rivers of Assyria with all the reminisences of the Anabasis
                        from our schooldays, and then comes Baghdad and the journey down the
                        Euphrates to Bassorah and thence throagh the Persian Gulf to India.</p>

                    <p>The bridge across the Blue Nile at Khartoum, on which operations have almpady
                        been com- menced, will be, when it is completed at the end of 1909, the most
                        valuable structure of its kind in Africa. It will cross the river from the
                        vicinity of the old infantry barracks to a point between the Gordon College
                        and the British barracks. The width of waterway here 'is about 1,700 ft. The
                        bridge is to have sevén equal spans, each 218 ft. 6 in. in length, three ap-
                        proach spans varying from 40 ft. to 80 ft. in length, and on the. northern
                        end an opening span of 111 ft. 9 in. clear opening. It has been designed to
                        accommodate eventaally two lines of the 3 ft. Gin. gauge railway; but at the
                        outset it will take one line, and there will then also be a roadway 2! ft.
                        wide and a footpath 11 ft. wide. The latter will be carried on brackets
                        outside the west side main girders, The total weight of steel used in the
                        bridge and piers will be aboot 5,000 tons, The rolling span is not, as has
                        been erroneously stated in several journals, to be of the American Scherzer
                        type. It is entirely of British origin, having been designed by the
                        Cleveland Bridge Com- pany, and is being manufactured at their works. It is
                        to have atotal length of 140 ft, consisting of an overhanging portion ot 112
                        ft. and 28 ft. at the rear end to the back ofthe counterweight box. It will
                        be electrically operated from a cabin situated on the northern approach. A
                        temporary timber bridge is to be erected to carry the traffic until the
                        permanent structure has been completed.</p>

                        the opportanity of testing the well known resources of the catering
                        department beforehand. Lady Oppenheimer had a party of seven including Lady

                        MacNeill, </p>
                    <p> Many others arrived on the scene about 9.30 | when the orchestra preluded
                        the programme with the Khedivial and English National Anthems in honour of
                        Accession Day, and in spite of the sultriness of the evening dancing was
                        continued gaily till nearly 1 o'clock ; various people repairing to the
                        restaurant again for supper. Mrs. Hornblower and Miss Smith were amongst
                        these letter ; and Mrs. de B. Carey was chaperoning another cheery party
                        which included Princess Irene Duleep Singh, Miss Carey, Mr. Grey, Mr.
                        Rentian and others. Among the dancers were noticed Mrs. Maclean and Miss
                        Barnes Lawrence, Miss Joseph and Miss Burns, Miss Schreiber who was with
                        Captain and Mrs. Bailey, Mr. and Mrs. Chatterton Adams, Mrs. Peach in a
                        dainty frock of blue chiffon ran with lace and narrow bands of coloured
                        embroidery, Miss Davidson in &amp; pretty dancing frock of pale green satin,
                        Miss Tuck in a very pale shade of pink, Mrs. Darell · in purple, Miss Morris
                        in white with scarlet poppies, Mrs. Nolan in &amp; striped vieux rose
                        chiffon trimmed with velvet. Among the lookers on were Colonel and Mrs.
                        Parker, the latter in black velvet and lace, Mrs. Davidson, in a beautifully
                        fitting gown of black chiffon velours, Mıs. Tuck, Captain and Mrs. Dunbar,

                        the Italian orchestra which has been playing at the Semiramis this season.
                        The dance music is excellent, but still more to be appreciated are the daily
                        programmes which are rendered between the hours of 5 and 6.30 p.m. We
                        listened with greatest pleasure to the selections given yesterday afternoon
                        : one Baccarole by Offenbach "Les Contes d'Affmann", being specially worthy
                        of praise. </p>

                                paramountcy in the Per- sian Gulf, Hon. Hugh Fraser said he feared
                                that the period was approaching when her paramountcy would be
                                challenged far more seriously than ever in the past. When the rail-
                                way reaches Bagdad it was imperative that Great Britain should build
                                a line from thence to the sea. Great Britain must insist upon' the
                                Turks abandoning their claim to El Katar and restoring the

                    <head>EGYPTIAN POLICE.</head>
                    <p>A correspondent writes from Cairo to the "Daily Telegraph": — The lack: of
                        public security in the provinces, more especially in the Delta, is causing
                        the gravest anxiety. Brigan- dage, theft, and murder are ever increasing,and
                        in this respect the state of the country is worse than in the time of the
                        Khedive Saad Pasha. The cause is the unwieldiness of the machinery of the
                        Ministry of the Interior. Moreover, there is no high official in the
                        Ministry of the Interior who has, had any..previous, experien- ce of police
                        work. It is a government by experiment. Another fact which great: ly
                        militates against 'the saccessful policing of the country is the fact that
                        the police of Egypt are by composition and training essen- tidlly « military
                        force, a gendarmerie, yet they are administered as a civil force.</p>
                    <p>The theory of the present Administration is that the Mudirs, or governors of
                        provinces, are absolutely responsible to the Minister for the stateof the
                        district under their control, But, in reality, their authority is
                        continually being tinkered with by a young inspector, who has neither a
                        sufficient knowledge of the country nor of Arabicto know when he is being
                        wilfully misled, and who lessens the responsi- bility and weakens the
                        authority of the Madir; in fact, he irritates instead of soothing. What is
                        needed is a resident inspector who is entire- ly cognisant of the conditions
                        under which, and of the characters of the people he is sent to help to
                        govern, a man old enough to havea natural anthority, with a certain
                        knowledge of the country and experience of the people he is sent to govern,
                        a working knowledge of their language, and, above all, he must bave- had
                        practical experience of police work ; infact, return to, and an improvement
                        on, the system in vogue before the Egyptian Civil Service was started.</p>
                    <p>At the present moment all seriously-minded Egyptians, who have been loyal to
                        the oecupa- tion throughout, are waveringin their allegiance, because of the
                        apparent inability of the present Government to suppress" crime. When a
                        crime is committed in a yillage, there is not one man, woman, or child in
                        that village who does not know the author withijn'an hour. Yet in many cases
                        which come betore the parqnet the police profess themselves unable to trace
                        the culprit, and in many wellknown cases the wrong man has been sentenced.
                        Neither the' Minister of the Interior nor the Adviser has the power to de
                        mand to see e proces verbal drawn up by one of his police, after it has come
                        into the hands of the parquet, a fact which has been the cause of much
                        abuse. There is no reason why the Egyptian should not become a very
                        efficient policemen, but he must learn, and at present he has no one to
                        learn from, as the knowledge of his superiors is merely experimental. There
                        are Advisers to the Ministers, and, with the ex- ception of the Ministry of
                        the Interior, these Advisers are specialists. There should therefore be
                        resident advisers to the Mudirs, who know their subject, and who ean
                        insist'on the right method being adopted instead of merely expe-
                        rimenting.</p>

                    <p>The "Avenir du Tonkin," which bas just ar rived, relates a horrible discovery
                        made on the Claire River by French officials on November 21 last.</p>
                    <p>A raft made of banana trunks was slowly floating down the river, and on it
                        were two hu man forms. Ona boat being put off it was dis- covered that the
                        two forms were corpses — a woman lying on her back with outstretched arms,
                        and a man placed face downwards over her. They had been crucified to each
                        other by huge nails passed through their hands and an- kles and driven into
                        cross beams of wood. The woman's mouth was sewn op, but her eyes were wide
                        open and showed that she had died an atrocious death, after an/agony which
                        perhaps lasted for two days. Ina corner of the raft at- tached to a stake
                        was a little child crying feeb- ly for help.</p>
                    <p>A placard fixed close to the two bodies ex- plained that the woman's crime
                        was that of having deceived her husband, and that the man crucified to her
                        was the husband's inter- preter. Curses were called down upon anybody who
                        should attempt to rescue them or set them tree. The woman was evidently of
                        good station, for she wore a silk robe, while the man, who was not more than
                        twenty, wore the dress of an in- terpreter. The child was rescued and cared
                        for, bat was found in such an exhausted condition that it died two days
                        later.</p>
                    <p>The raft must have been seen by hundreds of people on the river banks, but
                        nobody had attempted to rescue the unfortunate and tortu- red beings nailed
                        to it. or to save the child.</p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN COTTON IN SIND</head>
                    <p>We have just to hagd a paper on Egyptian | cotton, published in the
                        "Indo-European Com- mercial Intelligence and trade Register," read by Prof.
                        Shahani before the Karachi Branch of the British Empire League. It is
                        needless to say that there is an urgent need for sach well- studied
                        expositions of such a subject at the pre- gent time when development along
                        all the lines is going on apace.</p>
                    <p>Up to this time experiments with Egyptian cotton are few and far between, and
                        have many times proved failures, though it must be said that the acreage
                        for-this cotton is increasing for the last five years till it has reached
                        the fi gure of 5.098 acres this year. But we hope that the perseverance of
                        Prof. Shahani will be re- warded and that we shall have, in Sind at least,
                        soon many acres brought under this cul- tivation. This cotton is extremely
                        useful for fine and delicate fabrics, which are not being manufactured here
                        just for want of it.</p>
                    <p>Prof. Shahani made about four or-five ex periments, and, asa result, he comes
                        to the conclusion that Sind has special aptitudes, facilities and advantages
                        for the growth of Egyptian cotton. There are four varieties of this, viz,
                        Abasi, Metafhfi, Yanowich, and Ashmoni, of which, according to the writer of
                        the paper, Metaffifi is the best suited for Sind. 'The cost of this,
                        estimated by Mr. | Fletcher, Deputy Director of Agricultare, is | about Rs.
                        40 per acre. It is to be hoped that Prof Sbanani's appeal will be responded
                        to both by the Government and the people and that his expectations about
                        lakhs of acres be- ing brought-under this cultivation will be realised. The
                        last portions of his speech deal, in a general way, with the need for
                        scientific agricultural education and the consequent ne cessity for
                        extending the Sind Arts College in this direction also. We are glad that
                        this necessity is already wisely recognized by the Bombay Government, which
                        has sanctioned the opening of anew Agricultural College at Poona from the
                        next year.</p>

                    <head>PESTS AND FUNGI OF EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>Mr. Walter Draper, Director of the Govern- ment Gardens Delta Barrage, Egypt
                        (who has made a special stady of the "Coceids," or scale insects of Egypt,
                        which have hitherto received very little attention, and the habits of which
                        are, in many cases, imperfectly understood), has just published a brochure
                        on the "Injurious Scale Insects and Mealy Bugs of Egypt, toge- ther with
                        other insects, pests, and fungi," which will prove equally useful to
                        planters and arboriculturists in all zones, temperate and torrid alike.</p>
                    <p>We say this, remarks "Tropical Life," as, with the march of science and
                        iuereased facilities for transport, the serious disadvan tage of hitherto
                        unknown pests arriving with fresh plants forces one to realise that au in
                        creased number of varieties causes an increased namber of responsibilities
                        on the part of the plant doctor, In 1891, Mr. Draper tells us, seven species
                        of "coccidse," or seale insects, were recorded in Ceylon ; but three years
                        later 72 distinct species were found. A tew of the pests are of use,
                        including the cochineal insect (Coceus cacti) and the Lacca insect, which
                        fur nishes the well-known product "lac" ofcom merce.</p>
                    <p>Many, perhaps most, of these pests are found in all countries, but in
                        tropical and sub- tropical centres "the absence of a severe resting stage in
                        winter creates an almost endless succession of broods of coccide following
                        one after another," causing it to be a matter of prime importance to take
                        the matter in hand at once and eradicate, or at least check, the pests
                        before they become unmanageable.</p>

                    <p>SUPPRESSION OF THE DEPARTMENT.</p>
                    <p>The action. of the Egyptian Government in practically suppressing the Mines
                        Department is, says the "Financial News', difficult 'to un: derstand. It is
                        believed, however, to be pri- marily due to economical motives ;. but when
                        it is considered how much time and money have been spent in the necessary
                        preliminary work and the installation of headquarters at Edfou, now in
                        readiness for the carrying out of experiments, the action cannot but cause
                        séme amount of surprise, Opinions are expres: sed in mining circles that
                        this suspension of operations may also possibly be due to the Government not
                        wishing to ,incur further ex- pense on what may prove an unremunerative
                        undertaking, although, on the other hand, mineral discoveries ot
                        considerable value can be placed to the credit of this Department. An oil
                        field and marble and sulphur have been found, of good quality and in
                        workable quan- tities, to say nothing of the pottery -indastry, which might
                        be largely developed. It must be _ admitted that as far as gold is concerned
                        the | results have not. been gratifying ; but it has been proved that gold
                        exists in Egypt, as well as emeralds and rubies, and although these may not
                        be found in fabulous quantities, there should be no reason for ignoring the
                        existence of other minerals in the large tracts of country as yet
                        unexplored. It is therefore to be hoped tthe Government may reconsider their
                        de- ion, and that the working of the Department may only remain in abeyance,
                        otherwise it would appear that the movey already spent in the Edfou. station
                        has been unjustifiably wasted.</p>

                    <head>TRADE OF BAGDAD.</head>
                    <p>The Acting British Consul-General at Bag- dad, Major J. Ramsey, writes as
                        follows :—'"'In my opinion Bagdad offers a very promising market for many
                        kinds of British manufac- turers. The chief difficulty of pushing the trade
                        lies in bringing buyers and sellers into such close relationship with each
                        other that each can understand the needs of the other. In certain lines of
                        business I can act as a medium of communication, but I canaot supply
                        detailed technical . information, nor is it possible aceurately to describe
                        in writ- ing the advantages and disadvantages attaching to Bagdad as
                        amarket. NoCousularreports, how ever carefully prepared, can be as useful as
                        a personal knowledge of the market to be ex- ploited, and this is especially
                        true of a country where no official statistics are published, where
                        foreigners enjoy privileges that are denied to natives, an{ where the
                        relations between the Governors and the people are such as residents of
                        England would find it difficult to realise. For these reasons I feel
                        convinced that the best me- thod of pushing our trade is to persuade firms
                        doing a large business to send out their repre- sentatives to see things for
                        themselves. ... . An agent of a firm travelling to India could examine the
                        market not only at Bagdad. but also at Beyrout and Aleppo (both iaportant
                        commercial centres ) with the expenditure of a very little money and time...
                        . Manofactu- rers well know that there is no difficulty in get- ting from
                        England to Constantinople or Port Said. From either of these places there
                        are nu merous steamers running to Beyrout. From Beyrout to Aleppo there is a
                        railway, and a branch from this railway' would enabie a tra veller to visit
                        Damascus.</p>

                    <p>Our Cairo operatic critic writes :-</p>
                    <p>I went again to "Lohengrin" on Monday, and again to me the best part of the
                        whole performance wasthe sécond act. Mile Magne was even better than before,
                        ber phrasing delighttul, and fallef meaning, and her voice pure and
                        faultless, and egain Mme Fierens .showed what knowledge and dramatic power
                        she has. One could take alight— very slight—exception if to one or two high
                        notes wherein she was shade tooemphatic: bat her low notes-are j i superb,
                        and far more convincing in their light and shade than those of the average
                        good contralto. 1 do not wish to query the dicta of other critics, still
                        less to attack or blame singera,, conductors or others, but I confess Ms
                        cannot comprehend certain of the critiques, I read on this opera; unless it
                        be that the points of view vary immensely. M. Soubeyran conventional ; the
                        ohe sang, nb doubt, in the manner of a good and cultivated musician, but
                        with none of the emphasis or resonance 80 necessary to the part, and the
                        other never seemed to be in real and enthusiastic touch with bis orchestra,
                        chorus or principals : there were moments in the first act where had bis
                        baton been the baquette enchantée of one description | read,' the situation
                        would have been saved: as it was, that whole act was distinetly shaky.
                        Again, too, I wished. the wholeperformance could have commenced at a later
                        hour if only to get the audience into their places. The theatre wes almost
                        empty when the overture began and. people streamed in, one by one, and two
                        by two, in a most trying manner; And why, oh why applaud Wagner of all:
                        people during" the act, hete, there, and everywhere! it might suit "le Fille
                        do Regiment" or "Trovatore," but it is almost criminal in "Lohengrin" and
                        almost everyone knows that at Bayrenth and the for example, and M. Baron
                        seemed so entirely German opera houses there is no entry allowed, nee the
                        act has begun, and no applause whatever till it is ended.</p>

                        of the second match, working out well.</p>

                    <p>» Furber III. » Pennyman (back).</p>
                    <p>This was rather a sticky game—at the beginning ofthe third chukker reds weré
                        11 goals to Subalterns II. 12 goals, but they failed to make the extra point
                        and were defeated by the margin of 1 goal.</p>
                    <p>Second Match.</p>
                    <p>60th Rifles B. Coldstream Gds. No. III.</p>

                    <p>», Willan. » Campbell.</p>
                    <p>The 60th scored goals in great form Capt. Kennedy especially being at his
                        best. The Coldstream Guards team III are all beginners, but never lost heart
                        and each:player ii his turn played well and gave promise of better things in
                        the future. The 60th won by 5 goals</p>
                    <p>3rd Match.</p>

                    <p>Col. Macfarlane Capt. Eden.</p>
                    <p>This was a great match. The first Chukker the K.0.8.B. managed to keep the
                        ball away from their goal, and at the end of the. second chukker the Tigers
                        had. ouly seored «1 point. Their shots at goal on several occasions only
                        just failed. The third chukker they scored 2 goals more and were 3 to 5 at
                        the commence: ment of the 4th period. Mr. Napier with a good shot brought
                        the score to 4 goals to 5, and Capt. Dunbar with a difficult angle shot made
                        the score level. The bell rang and it was necessary to play anextra Chukker
                        and during the first 2 miautes Capt. Dunbar made the win- ning shot, the
                        Tigere winning by 1 goal. Capt. Bartlett played an excellent game. for the
                        win- ners. The K.O.S.B. played up well, Capt. Stoney being especially
                        conspicuoos. They woold per- haps have done better had they played a defen-
                        sive game, rather than forcing the attack. Col. Macfarlane at back,
                        considering he had about the best No I in Cairo up against him, did splendid
                        .work.</p>

                    <p>Vendredi, 10 Janvier</p>
                    <p>La séatice de ce matin a présenté une anima- tion a laquelle nous n'étions
                        plus habitués de- puis longtemps. L'ouverture a été particulie- | rement
                        chande ; un peu plus tard on s'est cal- mé pour reprendre vers la fin et
                        clétarer ferme et en hausse. Bien que des affaires aient été traitées en
                        assez grand nombre, |'amélioration | est dic surtout au changement de
                        position d'un | grand nombre de spéculateurs qui, au regu | 'de meilleures
                        nouvelles d'Europe, ont changé | leur fusil d'épaule. En effet, la baisse
                        du] taux privé 4 Londres et celle surtout du taux officiel de la Banque de
                        France' 8 1/2 7 ont produit ici une excellente impression. Mais il y
                        ad'autres facteurs de la reprise : c'est en premier lieu Pintervention des
                        arbitragistes qui ayant trouvé a vendre au Stock Exchange avec des
                        différences de prix appréciables avec notre cote ont di se couvrir sur notre
                        place, et en second lieu la hausse du coton dont les fluctuations baissiéres
                        de ces derniers jours avaient exercé sur nos valeurs ane influence
                        désastreuse</p>
                    <p>Bref, la plupart de nos titres de premier or- dre ont bénéficié d'un retour
                        de faveur. En tous cas les vendeurs s'étant 'retirés, les haus- siers ont eu
                        libre carritre. D'autres valears ont profité du revirement, comme cela
                        arrive d'ailleurs toujours en pareille circonstance.</p>

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. </p>
                    <p>Many people leave Egypt far too early in the year, for as a rule the weather
                        in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt is
                        Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list shewing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short ones are as
                        follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers of the P.&amp;O., the Egyptian Mail S.S,. Co., North German
                        Lloyd, Orient, and Messageries Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor,
                        British India, Bibby and Henderson Lines are also excellent, and their
                        steamers are largely patronised by travellers to Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said can now be made without change
                        in 4 ½ hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O. Brindisi express
                        from Port Said, by the Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., from Alexandria to Marseilles
                        and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe. The Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., have
                        also made arrangements whereby luggage can be collected and sent to any
                        address.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail<cb n="6"/> Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these
                        leaves Port Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian
                        mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. <hi rend="italic"
                            >Giardini</hi> is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to
                        Taormina is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the
                        town is much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                        restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of
                        Etna, and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic
                        remains that are found all over the island, are an endless sources of
                        pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a Greek city,
                        which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in
                        B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be seen. The cathedral
                        was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with about 300,000 inhabitants,
                        is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful climate. Much of
                        interest is to be found in this fine city. <hi rend="italic">The Palazzo
                            Reale</hi> is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of <hi
                            rend="italic">S. Giovannia degli Eremiti</hi> with its picturesque
                        cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal
                        Park are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                            bay—<hi rend="italic">Castellamare</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Sorrento</hi>. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento [you can
                        drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                            <hi rend="italic">City of Flowers</hi> and its surrounding country. In
                        Florence itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst
                        the local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. <hi rend="italic"
                            >The Cascine</hi> is the most attractive and fashionable promenade in
                        Florence, whilst the <hi rend="italic">Viale dei Colli</hi>, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to <hi rend="italic">Vallombrosa</hi>, with its <hi
                            rend="italic">Monastery</hi> 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is
                        made first by ordinary train from Florence to <hi rend="italic">St.
                            Ellero</hi>, thence by cog-wheel railway to <hi rend="italic"
                            >Saltino</hi>. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                        striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,

                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo

                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea. No hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi> you make the tour of the
                        beautiful Italian lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come <hi rend="italic"
                            >Tremezzo</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Cadenabbia</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Menaggio</hi> with the prettily-situated town of <hi rend="italic"
                            >Bellaggio</hi> opposite. The walk from <hi rend="italic">Tremezzo</hi>
                        along the shore of the lake to <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> is most
                        enjoyable. A steam tram runs from <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> to <hi
                            rend="italic">Porlezza</hi> on Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour,
                        then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M. de Caprino.and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town, situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>
