                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed
                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.
                        Najem Houry proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the
                        sea. Magnificent Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For

                        Army Contractor, Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia
                        (on Railway) to Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin
                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the
                        world. Also the tower or palace, the scene of "Othello'' and of Ford's
                        "Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus in the winter months is
                        delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                        to maintain the high<lb/> level of the preceding tomes. As we ander<lb/>
                        stand that arrangements have already been<lb/> made for bringing "The
                        World's History" up<lb/> to date, criticism may be deferred until the<lb/>
                        new volumes appear. But in the meantime<lb/> we might record our
                        appreciation, in general<lb/> terms, of the care with which the present<lb/>
                        volume has been prepared.</p>
                    <p>The History of South-Eastern and Eastern<lb/> Europe deals in a measure with
                        one of the most<lb/> interesting periods of Western civilisation. The<lb/>
                        influence of Hellenism was so pronounced that<lb/> its relation to the
                        gradual development of the<lb/> standards of Oriental art and culture
                        ne-<lb/> cessarily present a most absorbing study. The<lb/> founding of
                        Alexander's Empire gave it op-<lb/> portunities for expansion which, if not
                        parti-<lb/> cularly impressive, were at least unfettered.<lb/> Alexandria
                        and the revival of Babylon were<lb/> but stages in its evolution; and,
                        although<lb/> Hellenism could regard these centres as in-<lb/> tellectual
                        possessions, they were as much the<lb/> outcome of an accidental condition
                        as they<lb/> were the product of an intellectual conquest.<lb/> Gradually,
                        however, the union between the East<lb/> and the West brought about the
                        destruction<lb/> of the very purpose which it had been intended<lb/> to set
                        up. At a distance Hellenism assumed<lb/> qualities which it was found
                        incapable of pre-<lb/> serving in the press of its domestic environ-<lb/>
                        ment, and the union of the East and the West<lb/> fell quickly and as
                        marvellously as it had been<lb/> drawn together.</p>
                    <p>It is with this subject. The Influence of Hel-<lb/> lenism after Alexander
                        the Great, that the<lb/> present volume opens, while other important<lb/>
                        phases in the history of the world that are<lb/> discussed refer to the
                        Story of Turkey in<lb/> Europe and Armenia, to the Position of the<lb/>
                        Albanians, to Bohemia before its union with<lb/> Austria, to that avalanche
                        of barbarians that<lb/> gave rise to the Danube peoples, and to Eas-<lb/>
                        tern Europe. Each chapter is the work of a<lb/> distinguished master and
                        presents an elaborate<lb/> and scholarly survey of the changes which<lb/>
                        have taken place in the growth of the world.</p>

                        their steamers sailing for Southampton will on<lb/> November 1 be reduced to
                        ten guineas, which<lb/> is £1 10s. below ordinary winter rates. As a<lb/>
                        result the Canadian lines are considering the<lb/> question of following

                        extremely grave, as big â€œcutsâ€ into first cabin<lb/> fares bring them
                        almost as low as second cabin<lb/> fares, and if these are adjusted

                    <head>RED SEA SALT FOR THE FAR EAST.</head>
                    <p>A German export journal having published<lb/> an article on the advantage to
                        be derived from<lb/> the export of fish (particularly salmon, with<lb/>
                        which the River Amur and its tributaries<lb/> abound) from the Far East to
                        Europe, the<lb/> question of a return freight has given rise, the<lb/>
                        "Financier" states, to the suggestion that the<lb/> deposits of rock salt to
                        be found in Turkey<lb/> might very well be turned to aecount, It is<lb/>
                        added that the salmon of the Amur, owing to<lb/> its high quality, has won a
                        favoarable position<lb/> on the St. Petersburg, London, and Hamburg<lb/>
                        markets, though hitherto only in small quan-<lb/> tities. The chief obstacle
                        to the disposal of large<lb/> quantities of Amur River salmon,
                        independent<lb/> of the great distance and the locking-up of the<lb/>
                        Nikolaiefisk port with ice, is the absence of<lb/> rock-salt on the spot,
                        which is so requisite for<lb/> keeping fish during long voyages.</p>
                    <p>Up till recently the demand for salt in the<lb/> Far East was mostly
                        satisfied by supplies, from<lb/> Hamburg, of German origin, and the
                        firms<lb/> engaged in this trade so monopolised it as to<lb/> be able to
                        gradually raise the price to such a<lb/> point as to actually interfere with
                        their own<lb/> trade. This situation prompted the Russischer<lb/> Import
                        Combination to seek other sources of<lb/> rock-salt supply for the Far East
                        ; and this firm<lb/> has fixed its affections on the deposits to be<lb/>
                        found on the Turkish shore of the Red Sea. It<lb/> has already made an
                        arrangement with the<lb/> chief authority--the "Dette Publique," in<lb/>
                        Constantinople. It is further proposed to<lb/> develop the exchange of goods
                        between Turkey<lb/> and the Far East by bringing timber home to<lb/> Turkey
                        in exchange for the salt.</p>

                        <p>Larnaca, September 19th.</p>
                        <p>Some heavy rain fell at Nicosia and in some<lb/> parts of the plain last
                            week. It was of some<lb/> use in freshening up the parched
                            vegetation,<lb/> in softening the baked ground, and in making<lb/> the
                            dusty roads less unpleasant. Fortunately<lb/> it came just before
                            cotton. picking had become<lb/> general. On Troodos the storm lasted
                            through<lb/> the greater part of two days, and has been<lb/> followed by
                            very enjoyable weather.</p>
                        <lb/>
                        <p>An all-day cricket match, Civilians v.<lb/> Military took place on
                            Troodos on the 14th<lb/> inst. After a closely fought game the
                            match<lb/> was won by the former who also scored a<lb/> victory in the
                            first match earlier in the season.<lb/> Cold collation was provided for
                            the players by<lb/> the Civilians.</p>
                        <p>The olive crop is now being gathered in the<lb/> low-lying pasts of the
                            Island. The gathering in<lb/> the higherlands is generally fixed to
                            begin<lb/> towards the end of September. Under the Olive<lb/> Law the
                            date for gathering this fruit is annually<lb/> fixed by the District
                            Commissioners. This<lb/> provides a safeguard against thefts from
                            the<lb/> trees, which formerly were wholesale among<lb/> the villagers
                            as soon as the olives approached<lb/> in any degree the point of
                            maturity. Under<lb/> this Law fresh olives may not be exposed for<lb/>
                            sale prior to the date fixed, and from that date<lb/> the owners are
                            enabled to take the necessary<lb/> precautions to protect their
                            produce.<lb/> The pomegranate crop is reported to be less<lb/> than last
                            year, and the prices are accordingly<lb/> high.</p>
                        <p>The Asbestos Company is steadily at work<lb/> on Mt. Troodos and the
                            little settlement there<lb/> presents a busy scene. Should the
                            quarries<lb/> prove as extensive as is anticipated, and of the<lb/>
                            desired quality, the industry should afford<lb/> profitable employment
                            to a considerable num-<lb/> ber ofmen and women. That the existence
                            of<lb/> asbestos was known to the ancients and was an<lb/> object of
                            commerce in Cyprus in olden times is<lb/> a well known fact. Various
                            writers refer to it<lb/> and Mons. Gaudry mentions that one use to<lb/>
                            which it was put was in the manufacture of<lb/> shrouds or sacks for
                            princes and persons of<lb/> high degree. The bodies were enclosed
                            in<lb/> them and burnt the sacks remaining intact<lb/> and preserving
                            the calcined remains of the<lb/> deceased.</p>
                        <p>A scheme is on foot in the Limassol district<lb/> for constructing a
                            single line of railway from<lb/> Limassol to Troodos, passing through
                            several<lb/> of the vine villages of that locality.<lb/> Much loss is
                            annually caused to caroub tree<lb/> owners by the depredations of rats.
                            Efforts<lb/> have from time to time been made for their<lb/>
                            extermination, but with small results. A move-<lb/> ment of a practical
                            kind has now been started<lb/> in the Larnaca district which promises
                            well. A<lb/> society has been formed with the object of<lb/> collecting
                            funds for the purchase of rats, and<lb/> also to encourage the planting
                            of caroub trees.<lb/> The work is receiving excellent local
                            support,<lb/> and already a considerable sum has been col-<lb/> lected
                            among different villages, so that opera-<lb/> tions can be begun without
                            delay. Experiments<lb/> are also to be made with various rat
                            poisons<lb/> to discover an effective remedy against this<lb/> serious
                            pest.</p>

                            summer vacation with his pareuts on T'roodos,<lb/> has been unwell and
                            has been removed to the<lb/> Nicosia Hospital, Lady King Harman has<lb/>
                            returned to Nicosia to be near him.</p>
                        <p>Much regret is felt among the English com-<lb/> munity at the sad death
                            of Canon Marriott, of<lb/> St. Georges Colleges, Jerusalem. He was
                            in<lb/> Cyprus only last spring with Bishop Blyth, and<lb/> made many
                            friends. Much sympathy is felt for<lb/> his widow in her
                            bereavement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Arthur Page, of the Chief Secretariat,<lb/> has been appointed
                            Commissioner of Kyreina,<lb/> in succession to Major Tankerville
                            Chamber-<lb/> layne who is shortly retiring.</p>
                        <p>Turkey has now reduced the quarantine on<lb/> arrivals from 4 days to 2
                            days, so we shall<lb/> probably see a falling oft in the number ot<lb/>
                            vessels performing voluntary quarantine at<lb/> Larnaca.</p>

                        considerably enlarged, and the reading, smok-<lb/> ing, and music saloons

                        is<lb/> perfect ; this saloon can seat 85 passengers in<lb/> comfort. The

                        and attach-<lb/> ed to them are bathrooms, fitted with hot and<lb/> cold
                        water, and lavatories with up-to-date<lb/> sanitary arrangements. The first

                        an infallible cure for sea-sick-<lb/> ness. The vessel is fitted with the
                        Popp<lb/> wireless telegraphic system, by which messages<lb/> can be
                        transmitted some 300 miles.</p>
                    <p>A large number of people visited the ship<lb/> yesterday afternoon,including
                        Mustapha Pasha<lb/> Ibadi, Governor of Alexandria, and expressions<lb/> of
                        admiration were heard on all sides.</p>

                        <p>Advices from Hodeida state that the des-<lb/> patch of the commission
                            from Mecca to the<lb/> Imam (mentioned in my last letter) has been<lb/>
                            postponed. The reasons are not known, but if<lb/> rumour is to be
                            believed the despatch of the<lb/> commission is considered unnecessary
                            and like-<lb/> ly to be as fruitless as the others. The latest<lb/>
                            reports from Yemen state that there has been<lb/> again some trouble
                            amongst the Arab soldiers<lb/> in Zabeed. An affray took place between

                        large audience at the Eldorado theatre. The<lb/> varions bouts were
                        brilliantly contested and<lb/> the spectators were lavish in their applause
                        of<lb/> the competitors. The 12 champions made an<lb/> excellent impression

                        Italy, and Pontelli was the occasion of<lb/> tremendons excitement, and in
                        the ardour<lb/> of combat a good deal of the stage decora-<lb/> tion was
                        broken, and Ruggero with. terrific<lb/> force sent his adversary into the
                        orchestra.<lb/> The concert which preceeded the wrestling<lb/> was a great
                        success, Mademoiselle Va-<lb/> lintine and the famous imitator
                        Carallieri<lb/> being well received. This evening the second<lb/> round in

                    <head>THE HAMIDIEH<lb/> SCHOOL OF ENDUSFTRY.</head>
                    <byline>(From our Beyrout CORRESPONDENT)</byline>
                    <p>The ceremony of the inauguration of the<lb/> Hamidieh School of Industry and
                        Commerce,<lb/> and of the Hamidieh Hospital was a grand and<lb/> solemn
                        function, having been celebrated by<lb/> Imperial order. The inception of
                        this enter-<lb/> prise is due to the initiative and progressive<lb/> spirit
                        of our Governor General, Khalil Pasha,<lb/> and, indeed, this is but one of
                        many enterprises<lb/> of an analogous nature with which he has distin-<lb/>
                        guished his career during his tenure of office<lb/> in other vilayets of the
                        Empire. This last<lb/> however, is the most noteworthy, and eclipses<lb/>
                        his former achievements in its colossal propor.<lb/> tions. With a wise
                        sense of the fitness of things<lb/> his Excellency conceived the happy idea
                        of<lb/> commemorating the foundation of these institu-<lb/> tions, and
                        christening them with the imperial<lb/> name on the 30th anniversary of His
                        Majesty's<lb/> accession to the throne ; and levied a head tax<lb/> of two
                        mejidies on every Ottoman subject<lb/> leaving or entering this town. The
                        collection<lb/> of this tax and its manner of utilisation seem<lb/> to have
                        been made with creditable regularity.<lb/> Over £27,000 have been collected
                        and spent<lb/> on this memorial establishment and the active<lb/> manner in
                        which the work has been, and is still<lb/> being, pushed, despite the
                        scarcity of labourers.<lb/> and masons, proves that the wages have been<lb/>
                        settled so far with the utmost punctuality.<lb/> The choice of the spot is
                        another testimony to<lb/> the sagacity of the Governor General. For
                        such<lb/> establishments a vast tract of land, salubrious<lb/> and not very
                        far from the town, was necessary,<lb/> and with shrewd insight Khalil Pasha
                        has sol-<lb/> ved the problem of both cost and proximty. To<lb/> the South
                        West of Beyrout, and not very far<lb/> from the centre thereof lies a vast
                        stretch of<lb/> sand dunes that extend to the sea. So far these<lb/> sandy
                        lands have been neglected, and the<lb/> ownership thereof was in some cases
                        ambiguous<lb/> and not very clearly asserted out of a sense of<lb/> neglect
                        attaching as a rule to things of little<lb/> value. Now Khalil Pasha has
                        appropriated<lb/> out of this land about 35,842 pics for the<lb/> erection
                        of the imperial monuments. Some<lb/> people have criticised what they
                        described a<lb/> high handed act but apart from the appro-<lb/> priateness
                        of making a generous contribution<lb/> from the people towards the
                        commemoration<lb/> of a happy and unique event in a sovereign's<lb/> reign.
                        His Excellency has created a beautiful<lb/> quarter where there was nothing
                        but a<lb/> sandy desert. The gain to the neighboring<lb/> lands is very
                        considerable and far outweighs<lb/> the nominal loss of the part
                        appropriated<lb/> Furthermore the Vali has caused the electric<lb/> tramway
                        to include in its network of lines one<lb/> extending to the said quarter,
                        and already<lb/> around the imposing group of buildings, partly<lb/>
                        achieved and partly on the way to completion,<lb/> a number of fine houses
                        have sprung up and,<lb/> owing to the additional advantage of a very<lb/>
                        salubrious climate, this quarter is destined to<lb/> become very popular.
                        The spot is very elevated<lb/> and from every point the sea and the hills
                        are<lb/> dominated. On the crest ot this sandy mound<lb/> the group of
                        commemorative buildings was<lb/> planned to be erected, and the following
                        have<lb/> already been practically completed. The first is<lb/> the
                        direction, a two storeyed building of fine<lb/> hewn Lattakia stone, with a
                        facade of 44 meters<lb/> and a depth of 30 meters. Two vast halls, 15<lb/>
                        rooms and several porches constitute the<lb/> ground floor. The upper floor
                        consists of a vast<lb/> reception hall, 30 meters long and 7 meters<lb/>
                        wide, with a fine colonnade of marble, and two<lb/> smaller halls, three
                        balconies and ten rooms.</p>
                    <p>The second is the establishment proper, and<lb/> has an equal front and width
                        of 60 metets.<lb/> It is also two storeyed and the ground floor<lb/> is
                        composed of 14 study rooms, workshops,<lb/> and studios, as well as five
                        porches, while the<lb/> upper storey consists of five halls and fifteen<lb/>
                        dormitories. The third is the refectory with<lb/> a front of 44 meters by a
                        width of 30 metres,<lb/> and a magnificent colonnade of 48 columns,<lb/>
                        with a seating capacity for sixty persons.<lb/> Adjoining the refectory is a
                        culinary establish-<lb/> ment with several rooms and baths, and a<lb/> front
                        of 44 meters by a width of 16 meters.<lb/>
                    </p>
                    <p>The fourth of the principal group is a mos-<lb/> que 28 meters long by 18
                        wide. The fifth<lb/> constitutes in fact a lesser group of three<lb/>
                        buildings representing one hospital for women<lb/> 18 meters long by 20
                        wide, already finished,<lb/> aud two others of 47 meters length by 10<lb/>
                        width, each for men, and expected to be finish-<lb/> ed within a month.
                        Attached to these hos-<lb/> pitals will be auxiliary buildings for
                        kitchen<lb/> baths ete. Each of these hospitals contains a<lb/> big hall and
                        six rooms with 25 beds. To the<lb/> women's hospital is annexed a maternity,
                        and<lb/> a clinic, while a pharmacy and laboratory are<lb/> attached to the
                        hospitals.</p>
                    <p>Now besides the above mentioned buildings<lb/> there is yet to be built
                        according to the ori-<lb/> ginal plan another, to match in style and<lb/>
                        proportion, the establishement proper and in<lb/> that case the Direction
                        will stand in the middle<lb/> His Excellency has solicited His
                        Majesty's<lb/> permission to continue levying the head tax<lb/> to raise the
                        funds necessary for the continnuation<lb/> of the scheme, and the Imperial
                        sanction is <lb/> said to have been granted. Surrounding the <lb/> central
                        group of buildings is a large park 150 <lb/> meters long and 155 meters
                        wide, with four <lb/> ponds and jets in the middle, five elegant <lb/>
                        kiosks and a profusion of spouts to be fixed <lb/> at intervals of 20
                        meters. This park is to be <lb/> open for the public, and will, indeed, be
                        the <lb/> only on Fridays and Sundays with certain<lb/> restrictions.</p>

                    <head type="sub">THE SITUATION IN THE SOUTH.</head>
                    <p>In March last I pointed out, says a cor-<lb/> respondent to the "Globe" the
                        seriousness of<lb/> the problem which would face the Majlis, or<lb/>
                        National Assembly, in controlling the affairs<lb/> ofSouthern Persia, which
                        promised develop-<lb/> ments along certain lines as. these develop-<lb/>
                        ments have since that date taken place, to the<lb/> consternation. of the
                        Assembly, I give a brief<lb/> account of the leading features of the
                        situation<lb/> as it stands to-day.</p>
                    <p>Unlike the involved politics of most parts of<lb/> Persia, those of Fars are
                        comparatively simple,<lb/> as two factors control the situation; to the
                        ex-<lb/> clusion of minor parties. These are the two<lb/> great nottiad
                        tribes of the Qashqai and Arab.<lb/> The former has both its summer and
                        winter<lb/> quarters in Fars, journeying in May to the<lb/> highlands of Kam
                        Firuz and Western Fars,<lb/> and returning in October via the Shiraz
                        valley<lb/> to the lowlands of Shapur, and the sonthern<lb/> plainlainds
                        about Lar and Darab. The Arabs,<lb/> however, whose native soil is Persian
                        Arabistan<lb/> the that flat country about the head of the<lb/> Persien
                        Gulf--take a more or less direct line<lb/> easterly by way of Bebbehan to a
                        district<lb/> farther north of Shiraz, that of Dehbid, a fertile<lb/> plain
                        some 7,500 feet above sea level. As in<lb/> the case of the Qashquai, they
                        set out for the<lb/> higlands in May, to return in October and<lb/> November
                        for the winter. Both tribes are im-<lb/> mensely wealthy, considered by
                        Persian stan-<lb/> dards, owning extensive herds of cattle and<lb/> growing
                        their corn upon land for the use and<lb/> irrigation of which they pay
                        nothing. Consider-<lb/> able revenue also accrues to them from the<lb/> sale
                        of the rugs and carpets for which Fars is<lb/> celebrated, and which are
                        manufactured ex-<lb/> clusively by the women in their tents.</p>
                    <p>The Qashqai, which is a tribe of Turkish<lb/> origin, owns allegiance to its
                        own leaders, the<lb/> hereditary Il-Khani, the present head bearing<lb/> the
                        title Saulat ud Douleh, â€œThe Fury of the<lb/> Empire,â€ who as a rule
                        moves with the tribe,<lb/> and who is personally responsible fur its
                        good<lb/> behaviour and regular payment of such taxes<lb/> as the Government
                        can induce them to render.</p>
                    <p>As has been the case with every semi-<lb/> independent tribe, past
                        Governments have not<lb/> failed to endeavour to break their power by<lb/>
                        splitting them into factions, which policy has<lb/> at times succeeded, byt
                        which, while leaving<lb/> the tribe weaker that it might otherwise have<lb/>
                        been, has engendered a hatred of Rersians and<lb/> their methods. They are
                        now fairly well united<lb/> under the Saulat ud Douleh, who has
                        succeed-<lb/> ed in temporarily silencing his brother the<lb/> Zargham ud
                        Douleh, whose following has been<lb/> considerably reduced within the last
                        few<lb/> months.</p>
                    <p>The Arab tribes have no such hereditary<lb/> leader, and while they have
                        their sectional<lb/> headmen, they have been accustomed to ac-<lb/>
                        knowledge allegiance to a leader who has re-<lb/> ceived his appointment
                        from the Government<lb/> Such leadership hag been and is a rich prize<lb/>
                        for which to scheme, for it confers great power<lb/> and wealth uponan
                        astute man who under-<lb/> stands how to treat the nomads. For years<lb/>
                        they were under the leadership of Amir Agha<lb/> Khan, Mansur us Saltaneh--a
                        native of Shiraz,<lb/> whose father had been colonel of the Arab<lb/>
                        regiment--long since disbanded. The Qavvam<lb/> ul Mulk, also a Shirazi, who
                        was then rising to<lb/> the power he has possessed for so many years<lb/> in
                        Fars, succeeded in procuring his dismissal,<lb/> aud gained the post
                        himself. Bad as his rule<lb/> has been, he has taken pains to understand
                        the<lb/> people over whom he has given full control,<lb/> and has gained
                        their preference for him over<lb/> any other. His two sons have been brought
                        up<lb/> in intimacy with the tribesmen, and while his<lb/> fighting power
                        was thus increased, the Qavvam<lb/> ul Mulk steadily pursned his course of
                        purchas-<lb/> ing land and controlling the local affairs of<lb/> Shiraz,
                        which latter he achieved by securing<lb/> the appointment of mayor ot the
                        town for his<lb/> elder son, the Salar us Sultan.</p>
                    <p>In the autumn of 1905, after the late Shah's<lb/> second son, Prince Shaa us
                        Saltaneh, had been<lb/> expelled fromShiraz by the infuriated
                        population,<lb/> urged on by the Mayor, the Government, fearful<lb/> of
                        leaving there so powerfula personage, induced<lb/> the Qavvam ul mulk to
                        accompany the Prince<lb/> to Teheran, giving pledges that he would
                        stand<lb/> in no danger. Confident that his sons could<lb/> manage the
                        position, and by threats, if neces-<lb/> sary, of revolution, sufficiently
                        protect him,<lb/> he agreed, and found himself a prisoner almost<lb/>
                        immediately after his arrival at the capital.</p>
                    <p>This bold step on the part of the Govern-<lb/> ment was rendered possible by
                        the treachery<lb/> of s man in whom the Qavvam ul Mulk had<lb/> for years
                        placed the greatest confidence, one<lb/> Mirza Hussein Khan Kavari, at whose
                        back<lb/> was the well-armed population of his district<lb/> of Kavar, near

                        by<lb/> the Government, and deserting his former<lb/> chief, fled to a
                        garden near Shiraz, where he<lb/> took up a fortified position. Later, when
                        the<lb/> Qavvan ul Malk returned to Shiraz, deprived<lb/> of his control of
                        the Arab tribe, Mirza Hussein<lb/> Khan, more commonly known as the Mu'<lb/>
                        tamed ud Divan, proceeded to Teheran, where<lb/> he commenced a campaign of
                        intrigue against<lb/> his former benefactor to such effect that the<lb/>
                        younger son came to Teheran in the hope of<lb/> adjusting affairs. Thither
                        he was followed by<lb/> his elder brother, and the old Qavvam ul Mulk<lb/>
                        left alone in Shiraz, his properties unguarded,<lb/> and fearful of new
                        treachery, made a piligrim-<lb/> age to Meshed, where he now remains.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the Nizam us Saltaneh, present<lb/> Governor of Shiraz, has
                        announced to the<lb/> Arabs that their leader will henceforth be the<lb/>
                        traitor Mu'tamed ud Divan, and the sons,<lb/> who still remain in Teheran,
                        have protested<lb/> in vain against this appointment. Nor are<lb/> the
                        troubles of the Qavvam ul Malk ended<lb/> here, for the Qashqai tribe, quick

                    <p>Two officers of the 2nd Battalion Essex<lb/> Regiment--Captains C. 1. Ryan,
                        and C. J. B.<lb/> Daubeny, have been selected for service with<lb/> the
                        Khedive's army under the usual conditions.<lb/> The first named officer
                        joined the gallant<lb/> "Pompadours" in February, 1897, and served<lb/> with
                        the 2nd Battalion in the South<lb/> African War, earning the Queen's medal
                        with<lb/> four clasps for the operations in Orange River<lb/> Colony,
                        1901-2, and Captain Daubeny, who<lb/> joined the regiment in 1896, served
                        with the<lb/> Essex Regiment, and the 29th Battalion Mount-<lb/> ed
                        Infantry, for which he received the Queen's<lb/> medal with four clasps.</p>
                    <p>Second Lieutenant D. French, Royal Dublin<lb/> Fusiliers, of the 1st
                        Battalion, Alexandria, has<lb/> been advanced to the rank of full
                        lieutenant.<lb/> He got his second lieutenancy in May, 1902,<lb/> and had an
                        exceptionally long time to serve<lb/> for his second star.</p>
                    <p>Major S.C. Johuston, King's Own Scottish<lb/> Borderers, has gone on retired

                        with it in the operations of 1889 on the<lb/> Soudan Frontier (medal, and
                        Khedive's star),<lb/> and he was adjutant ofa battalion of Imperial<lb/>
                        Yeomanry in the South African War, 1902<lb/> (Queen's medal with two
                        clasps). The vacancy<lb/> has been filled by the promotion of Captain<lb/>
                        A. G. Fraser, adjutant of the Galloway Rifles.<lb/> Major Fraser, who now
                        returns to regimental<lb/> daty, has served alittle over nineteen years<lb/>
                        for his major's crown, and he has a good war<lb/> record to his credit,
                        including the Chitral<lb/> Relief Expedition, 1895 (medal with clasp) ;<lb/>
                        the Soudan Campaign, 1898, whilst employed<lb/> with the Egyptian Army, and
                        was orderly<lb/> officer to Major General Hunter at the battle<lb/> of
                        Atbara ; and was afterwards through the<lb/> operations at Gedaref as base
                        commandant<lb/> (mentioned in despatches, medal with clasp,<lb/> British
                        medal, and 4thclass Medjidie). He<lb/> was with the 1st Battalion of the
                        King's Own<lb/> in South Africa, sharing in the fighting in the<lb/>
                        Transvaal (Queen's medal with clasps).</p>
                    <p>A new buoy shackle, designed by Lieutenant<lb/> D.J. Munro, assistant to the
                        commander of<lb/> Sheerness Dockyard, is ordered to be issued to<lb/> six
                        torpedo boat destroyers for experimental<lb/> purposes. The shackle has been
                        designed to<lb/> overcome the difficulty experienced by scouts,<lb/> torpedo
                        gun boats, torpedo boat destroyers,<lb/> and torpedo boats in shackling on
                        to a large<lb/> buoy, and it is small enough to take the<lb/> anchor shackle
                        on a buoy. The shackle pin is<lb/> attached to the shackle by a keeper
                        chain, and<lb/> cannot be lost overboard, and the pin is secured<lb/> by a
                        special ring, obviating the use of screws,<lb/> forelocks, or any of the
                        ordinary methods of<lb/> securing the pins of shackles.</p>
                    <p>Sanction has been given for the employment<lb/> of Brevet-Colonel J E. Gough,
                        V.C., A.D.C. as<lb/> Inspector-General of the King's African Rifles.<lb/>
                        The advancement of Colonel Gough, who is at<lb/> present serving on the
                        General Staff at Head-<lb/> quarters of the Irish command, has been as<lb/>
                        rapid as his carver has been distinguished. He<lb/> joined the Rifle Brigade
                        in 1892 as a Second<lb/> Lieutenant, in which he now holds the<lb/>
                        regimental rank of Captain, and he saw a good<lb/> deal of active
                        campaigning during the first ten<lb/> years of his service. In 1896-7 he
                        took part in<lb/> the expedition against. Chikusi and Chilwa in<lb/> British
                        Central Africa, and was present at the<lb/>
                        <cb n="5"/> battle of Khartoum in 1898. In the South<lb/> African War he
                        took an active part in the<lb/> defence of Ladysmith and the subsequent<lb/>
                        operations of the Natal Army under Sir Red-<lb/> vers Buller (brevit
                        majority). Subsequently he<lb/> was employed as a special Service Officer
                        in<lb/> the Somaliland operations of 1902-8 (Victoria<lb/> Cross and brevet
                        of Lieutenant-Colonel). His<lb/> selection tor the post of Inspector General
                        of<lb/> the King's African Rifles, at 35 years of age,<lb/> follows closely
                        upon his recent appointment as<lb/> Aide-de-Camp to the King, together

                        got wet<lb/> through to the skin. In my own mind I have<lb/> no doubt that
                        this is what brought on the<lb/> sciatica and lumbago from which I first
                        suffered<lb/> 12 years ago. Iwas confined to my bed for a<lb/> long time,
                        and the agony I underwent was<lb/> terrible. I also had rheumatism and <hi

                    <p>Occasionally my head was so bad that I was<lb/> light headed ; many atime I
