                        <p>LORD CURZON'S RESIGNATION</p>

                        <p>The receipt of the full text of the despatches that have passed between
                            the Viceroy and the Secretary of State for India makes it only too clear
                            that Lord Curzon’s resignation is the outcome of a protracted straggle
                            with the military policy of Lord Kitchener of Khartoum, supported, as it
                            was, by the Home Government. No doubt most of our readen have followed
                            the course of Indian events closely enough to be aware of the essential
                            features of what was, in reality, a duel over a question of principle
                            fought by two of the ablest and most distinguished men of the day but a
                            brief summary of their respective positions may be of interest. Lord
                            Kitchener came to India an avowed reformer: the South African War had
                            shown England the necessity for thorough preparation for war in every
                            branch of the land service, and, unlike the nation, Lord Kitchener did
                            not forget the lesson. Realising that the embarrassments of Russia in
                            the Far East gave India a breathing space for a thorough military
                            reorganisation, end realising too that tht overthrow of Muscovite
                            ambitions on the Pacific would probably drive the northerners to fight
                            their way south through Persia and Beluchistan to the open water, he
                            determined to reorganise the Indian Army in a manner that seemed to him
                            most in accordance with the teaching of modern war fare. The position in
                            which the great Anglo Egyptian soldier found himself, was hardly
                            calculated to satisfy a masterful mind that was impressed by the
                            necessity of acting rapidly and decisively. Though a member of the
                            Viceroy’s Council by virtue of his position as Commander-in-Chief, he
                            found his suggetions liable to be criticised by the “Military Member,”
                            whose duty it was to review the suggestions and plans of the Commander
                            in-chief, and report thereon to the Viceroy. The “Military Member” was
                            his junior in rank and, on occasion, his critic, and it was obvious that
                            a less masterful man than Lord Kitchener might well have complained of
                            the obstructions which the system opposed to any rapid reform. In
                            conseqnenoe of his representations a committee on Indian Army
                            Administration was formed last May. It contained two former
                            Commanders-in-Ghief in India, in Lord Roberts and Sir George White, it
                            sought the opinion of a large number of distinguished Anglo- Indian
                            civilians and soldiers, and found that (we quote the words of the
                            report) “while custom and oonvenienoe have assigned a practically unique
                            position to the Commander -in Chief in regard to the Indian Government,
                            his actual position in the official hierarchy is anomalous. The orders
                            of the Government of India, are conveyed to him by the Military
                            Department, which is presided over by an officer of junior rank and
                            possibly of inferior military attainments and experience to himself.
                            This officer, who for many years past has been a Major-General, has as
                            Secretary to the Government in his Department another officer, also
                            reoently a Major- General, who has not only the office of conveying to
                            the Commander-in-Chief the decisions of the Government of India, bnt can
                            himself be consulted, without reference to his immediate chief, by the
                            Viceroy on any military question. The Commander-in-Chief has therefore,
                            between himself and the Viceroy, two officers of junior rank, both of
                            whom are entitled to criticise all his proposals from a military
                            standpoint. It is obvious that such a procedure can only be worked
                            satisfactorily by those conoerned if very special tact and judgment are
                            shown on both sides.”</p>
                        <p>Lord Curzon, on the other hand, protested that the nature of his own
                            functions made him responsible for all that the Commander- in-Chief did,
                            and that he required expert advice to be able to criticise and control
                            his suggestions. He further pointed out that in the case of a
                            Commander-in-Chief who was ignorant of Indian conditions, and more
                            especially of the preferences and prejudices of the native Army, the
                            presence of a military critic who had a long Indian experience was
                            essential to the Council. None the less he was overruled and offered to
                            resign his position in June, but finally decided to accept a compromise
                            by which the “Military Member” was not to concern himself with purely
                            military matters, but to confine his advice to questions referring to
                            military supply and finance. 'Friction reoommenced when Lord Canon
                            strongly recomended Major General Sir R Barrow, a distinguished frontier
                            officer, for the post of Military Member. Tho Secretary of State for
                            India opposed the Viceroy’s suggestion on the ground that this officer
                            would be required for high executive command in case of war. On the 5th
                            inst. the Viceroy replied that the Home Government was denying him the
                            confidence that alone would enable him to serve them with success in
                            rejecting his recommendation, and again offered his resignation. Mr.
                            Balfour then intervened and pointed out that the duty of advising the
                            King as to the appointment of members of the Council rested with the
                            Secretary of State, and that “no greater violation of the Constitution
                            could well be imagined than that this duty should degenerate into a
                            merely formal submission to his Majesty of the views aud recommendations
                            of the Viceroy.”</p>
                        <p>We need not follow the dispute to its close. Lord Curzon offered his
                            resignation and it was regretfully accepted by the Premier. The
                            strongest of recent Indian Viceroys had failed to persuade the British
                            Government to accept his version of the Constitution. Lord Curzon may
                            have shown a certain tactlessness (caused no donbt by ill-health) in his
                            reoent relations with his official superiors, but there is every reason
                            to forget this and to dwell on the remarkable services which he has
                            rendered to India and the Empire. He has reduced the wild regions of the
                            Frontier Province to some thing like order, has struggled with success
                            against plague and famine, and to the great joy of every energetic
                            official has very considerably reduced the amount of official red tape.
                            His expedition to Tibet has been vigorously criticised and equally
                            vigorously defended, his attitude towards native education also met with
                            considerable opposition, but the natives of India, while ready enough to
                            entitle him a reactionary, benefited from his stern repression of all
                            acts of violenoe or brutality towards them on the part of Europeans.</p>

                            was found dead at Alexandria on the same day. From the first of January

                            of appointing suitable agents. As no fee is charged for such advice, it
                            is obviously in the interests of all British traders here to become
                            members, especially when it is remembered that the annual subscription
                            is merely the nominal one of £1. The latter payment also includes a copy
                            of the monthly Journal issued by the Chamber. Home enquirers can obtain

                    <head>The Cutting of the Khalig. Saturday's Festivities</head>

                    <p>As every resident in this country is aware the rise of the Nile and the
                        consequent ceremony known as the Cutting of the Khalig, has been celebrated
                        - from time immemorial by an important festival at this period of the year.
                        It.is not simply a poetical metaphor, but an axiomatic fact which requires
                        no proof that the Nile is the Providence of Egypt, and therefore it is not
                        surprising, that as a time of universal rejoicing by the native portion of
                        the population of this cosmopolitan country,. the Khalig fête outshines most
                        of the great religious festivals.</p>

                    <p>This time-honored celebration took place at Old Cairo on Saturday with the
                        customary festivities. From early afternoon the Tramway Company, which had
                        organised a special service of trams to Foum-el-Khalig, brought down crowds
                        of visitors from all parts of the city; and by nine o’clock, when the
                        official ceremony commenced, there were many thousands of people to witness
                        the illuminations of the river craft and grounds, and the fireworks.
                        According to an old custom, previous to the arrival of the Khedive’s
                        representative the Ulemas of the El Azhar were entertained at a banquet. In
                        the unavoidable absence of H. E Fakhry Pasha, the Acting Regent, his place
                        was taken by H. K Ibrahim Pasha Naguib, the under Secretary of State of the
                        Ministry of the Interior, who presided at the ceremony and received the
                        principal guests. In the part of the enclosure reserved for such as were
                        favored with invitation cards there was a large number of officials, both
                        European and Native, several Diplomatic and Consular representatives,
                        officers of the Army of Occupation and the Egyptian Army, and last, but not
                        least, quite a number of ladies. On the river, between the bank and the
                        opposite Island of Rodah, the numerous small craft in the shape of steam
                        pleasure-launch-es, dahabeahs, and large boats, were a very pretty sight
                        when lit up with innumerable lights at night The illuminations on shore and
                        decorations added a charm to a scene that was already picturesque and
                        interesting. In seems a thousand pities that the ceremony should happen to
                        fall at a time of the year when it is rarely witnessed by tourists, for it
                        is a sight that would impress a visitor as one of great beauty, and give him
                        a good idea of a real native fantasia. The display of fireworks was much
                        appreciated, more especially the set pieces, which seemed to astonish a
                        large proportion of the Arab audience.</p>

                    <p>In reality of late years the cutting of the Khalig is a misnomer for a
                        ceremony that has no raison d’être, since the old canal that traversed and
                        supplied the great city with water (over which a tramway line now runs for a
                        greater part of the distance) has been filled up, for the ceremony was
                        instituted to celebrate the cutting of the Khalig or dam that separates the
                        canal from the river. Up to the time of the Khalifa Omar Ibn-el-Hattab, some
                        1,300 years ago, it was the custom to celebrate the occasion by throwing
                        into the river a young and beautiful virgin decked with jewels and this was
                        done to propitiate the Evil One and appease his wrath. But at that period
                        Amr Ibn- el-Aas, the Calipha’s Wali, stopped this barbarity and substituted
                        for the real living virgin one made of clay, which custom was, it is said,
                        still in vogue lees than century ago.</p>

                    <head>THE SULTAN’S ACCESSION FETES.</head>

                    <p>The committee appointed to organise the fêtes to be held on September 1, in
                        celebration of the twenty-ninth anniversary of the accession of the Sultan
                        to his throne, are arranging a programme of altogether exceptional
                        brilliancy, for they feel that the rejoicings on this occasion should be
                        particularly universal in Egypt on account of His Majesty’s fortunate escape
                        from the dastardly attempt upon his life.</p>

                    <p>The committee hope, therefore, that the residents of Egypt of all
                        nationalities will assist towards the success of the fêtes by buying tickets
                        for the Esbekieh Gardens, and the Theatre. The prices of tickets will be as
                        follows: </p>

                        <p>Some time back I wrote regarding the large amount of work which is being
                            done towards levelling, reclaiming and raising the land behind the
                            Railway Station and that between the Bassins Cherif and Abbas. A visit
                            to the railway station reveals great and numerous improvements in the
                            traffic departments; commodious luggage and goods sheds have lately been
                            completed fitted up with tables which are labelled with large letters
                            for the purpose of sorting with facility. There are now five pairs of
                            rails for passenger trains and two for goods, in connection with which
                            last a bond shed has been built. Some 150 yards nearer the old cemetery,
                            will, in about two years’ time, see the erection of another station,
                            which is to be an improvement on the present one; but the old station
                            will still be used. The land between the present metals and the lake is
                            about three feet below the level of the station yards. This is now being
                            raised some five five feet with land which is taken from Dowrie Point
                            and the surroundings, and it is on this raised land that the new station
                            is to be built. I am informed that 700,000 cubic yards is the quantity
                            of land required for filling in. This work, it is hoped, will be be
                            concluded about next June, when the new station is to be at once taken
                            in hand.</p>

                            cemetery, which has not been used for interment for some years past. In
                            connection with the large improvements rapidly going on in this
                            decidedly dirty and insanitary quarter of the town, the authorities, it
                            appears, have granted permission to the relatives of those buried there,
                            to remove the remains to the newer and more commodious burial ground;
                            the result being that somewhat repelling sights are frequently to be
                            witnessed, as the coffins are exhumed in daylight.</p>

                        several policemen ran to her assistance, whereupon three other Italians took
                        the part of their countryman and attacked the police, two of the men drawing

                    <p>Par contrat de cession du Juin 1898, passé entre Sir Elwin Palmer, Conseiller
                        Financier de S.A. le Khédive, dûtment autorisé par décision du Conseil des
                        Ministree, et un groupe de capitalistes, ceux-oi s’engageaient a acheter
                        toutes les proprietés de la Daïra Sanieh dont la dette s’élevait au 31
                        Décembre 1897 a la somme de £ 6.431.500.</p>

                    <p>Le prix de cette acquisition était convenu a la somme de £ 6.431.500, mais
                        aux termes de l’art. ler on devait “déduire de cette somme " le montant au
                        pair des obligations qui " auront été remboursées a partir du 31 de- “
                        cembre 1897 jusqu’au jour ou la vente sera “ devenue définitive, et d’autre
                        part, ajouter “ au prix d'achat, les sommes que le Gouverne- “ ment Egyptien
                        aura dû payer a l’Adminis- “ tration de la Daïra Sanieh en raison de "
                        déficits éventuels.” </p>

                    <p>Ce prix était payable, contre, remise de toutes les propriétés de la Daïra
                        Sanieh, le 15 0ctobre l905, date avant laquelle le Gouverne- rnent s’était
                        engagé a ne pas éteindre la dette de la dite Daïra.</p>

                    <p>Les Capitalistes signataires de la convention ou la Société a former par eux,
                        s’engageaient a vendre ces propriétés dans le laps de sept aunées de leur
                        prise de possession (Art 5), et le Gouvernement avait droit a la moitié du I
                        bénéfice net que les capitalistes on la Soeiété a former réaliseraient sur
                        le prix d’achat (Art. 6).</p>

                    <p>Les capitalistes ou la So iAtA 4 former par eux devaient dAposer, le ler
                        Aofit 1898, au Ministers des Finances, un cautionnement de £500,000 (Art
                        7.)</p>

                    <p>Faute de n’avoir pas complétement exécuté, le 15 Ootobre 1905, l’achat dont
                        s’agit, une somme de £50,000 a prendre sur le cautionnement, était ipso
                        facto, acquise an Gouvernement; mais au oontraire, au cas d’accomplissement
                        le cautionnement de £500,000 était restitué (Art. 8.)</p>

                    <p>Tels sont les accords a la suite desquels les capitalistes, signataires de la
                        convention, ont constitué la Société de la “New Daira Sanieh Cy. Ltd.” qui,
                        au fond, achetait pour revendre lies biens de la Daira Sanieh, afin de
                        permettre de payer la dette de cette administration que cas biens
                        garantissaient spécialement, dette que le Gouvernement s’était eugagé a ne
                        pac éteindre avant le 15 Ootobre 1905.</p>


                    <p>Le bénéfice net résultant de cette réslisation, apres paiement de la Dette
                        Daïre Sanieh, devait se répartir par moitié outre le Gouvernement et la
                        Société.</p>

                    <p>La New Daira Sanieh Cy. Ltd. a vendn 4 terme tout le Domaine de la Daira
                        Sanieh ;1 oils se trouve aujourd’hui substituAe par la SociAtA Egyptienne de
                        la Nouvelle Daira Sanieh.</p>

                    <p>Cette derniére Société a cédé au Crédit Foncier Egyptien le solde de toutos
                        ses créances a terme, garanties par le privilege du vendeur non payé A.</p>


                    <p>Le Crédit Foncier Egyptien, de son côté, a en reoours a une Emission
                        d’Actions et a une. Emission d’Obligations qui permettront de payer le prix
                        de cette cession partie au ler Octobre et partie au 15 Octobre 1905.</p>


                    <p>Et o’est a la veille da remboursement qui doit être fait aux créanciers de la
                        Daïra Sanieh et a la veille de la liquidation des droits respectifs dérivant
                        de la cession du 21 Juin 1898 que L.L.A.A. les Princes, fils du Khédive
                        Ismaïl, réclament judiciairemant, en prétendant que le Domaine de l’ancienne
                        Daïra Sanieh, constituant un simple gage affecté a la garantie de l’emprunt
                        Daïra, la réalisation de , ce gage doit leur revenir, aprés remboursement de
                        cet Emprunt.</p>


                    <p>Le Domaine de l’anocienne Daïra Sanieh était la propriété de S.A. le Khédive
                        Ismail qui avait incontestablement le droit d’en disposer a son gré.</p>


                    <p>Par oontrat du 12 juillet 1877, S. A. le Khtédive Ismaïl affectait ce Domaine
                        en hypothéque, pour garantir le service des intérêts et l’amortisaement de
                        la dette générale de la Daïra Sanieh.</p>


                    <p>Plus tard, en 1880, a é é promulguée la Loi de liquidation qui dispose
                        formellement en son article 40:</p>


                    <p>“Sont déclarées propriétés de l’Etat les pro- "priétés des Daïras Sanieh et
                        Khassa, men “tionnées dans les états annexés au contrat “du 12 juillet 1877
                        ou dans les inscriptions | “prises en vertu de co contrat.”</p>


                    <p>Voila qui est aussi net que catégorique. Le Domaine de l’ancienne Daïra
                        Sanieh est devenu une propriété del’Etat: c’est dono dans la striote limits
                        de ses attributions que le Gouvernement Egyptien, proprétaire, a conolu la
                        convention sus-ana'ysée du 21 Juin 1898 qui est aujourd’hui un fait
                        accompli.</p>


                    <p>Il n’est pas inutile de rappeler qu’a l’époque déja lointaine de la Loi de
                        Liquidation, le Domaine de l’ancienne Daïra Sanieh fasait a peine, on ne
                        faisait même pas, face a sescharges.</p>

                    <p>Dés lors, en vertu de quel principe de droit ou d équite peut-on sontenir que
                        L.L A.A. les Princes, fils du <persName>Khédive Ismaïl</persName>, peuvent
                        éleverune prétention quelconque sur la rálisation faite d'un bien, qu'une
                        Loi, réguliérement promulguée, a fait sortir du ratrimoine du
                            <persName>Khédive Ismaïl</persName> faite d’un bien, qn’une Loi,
                        rAguliArament pro- mulguAe, a fait sortir da patrimoine du <persName>Khédive
                            Ismaïl</persName> qui l'avait affecté en hypothéque, pour le faire
                        rentrer dans le Domaine de l’Etat?</p>


                    <p>La réclamation judiciaire de L.L.A.A. les Princes indique-t-elle qu'ils aient
                        en un droit personnel et direct sur tout ou partie dea immeubles ayant
                        composé le Domaine de l'ancienne Daïra Sanieh?</p>


                    <p>Nous l’ignorons encore.</p>

                    <p>Maia sans qu’il soit besoin d’examiner, dansce cas, la question de propriété,
                        il suffit de relever:</p>
                    <p>1. Que depuis le 12 Juillet 1877, date du contrat par lequel leur Auguste
                        Pére affectait en hypothéque le Domaine de l'ancienne Daïra Sanieh, dans das
                        conditions qui en remettaient a des tiers convenus l'administration, ils
                        n’ont élevé aucune réclamation: ce qui ferait encourir a leur action
                        l’application de la Loi sur la prescription de quinze ans.</p>

                    <p>2. Que l'art. 86 de la Loi de Liquidation, en édictant "qu’a partir de la
                        publication de la " presénte Loi, nul ne sera recevable devant “ aucune
                        juridiction, pour quelque cause et “ sous quelque forme que ce soit, a
                        intender " une action quelconque, soit contre le Gou- “ vernement, soit
                        contre les Administrations " de l’Etat, a raison de droits acquis antérieu-
                        “ rementan ler Janvier 1880” frapperait leuraction d’une forclusion
                        insurmontable.</p>


                    <p>En outre,</p>
                    <p>L.L A. A. qui m’ont pu ignorer ni la Loi de liquidation, (nul n’est censé
                        ignorer la Loi), ni la convention du 21 Juin 1898, ni certaines ventes
                        effectuées antérieurement a la convention du 21 Juin 1898, ont bien démontré
                        parleur attitude profondément silencieuse que leur sentiment d'aujourd'hui
                        n'était guére leur sentiment d'alors et qu'ils ne sont victimes d'aucune
                        surprise.</p>

                    <p>On se demande done, avec certaine raison, si la cause de leur brusque et
                        tardif réveil ne serait pas un effet de la plus value dont les immeubles ont
                        bénéficié en cours de l'exécution de la convention du 21 Juin 1891, au-dela
                        de toute prévision.</p>

                    <p>Mais en admettant Même, contrairement a la réalité des choses et
                        contrairement aux textes de loi, que la réclamation de L.L.A.A. les Princes
                        soit bien fondée, les porteurs d'actions de la New Daira Sanieh Cy. Ltd. ne
                        seraient en rien atteints.</p>

                    <p>En effet, e'est en vertu de la convention du 21 Juin 1898 que les
                        capitalistes qui l'ont signée out réalisé le Domaine de l'Ancienne Daïra
                        Sanieh dans des conditions déterminées.</p>

                    <p>Par conséquent, si pour une raison que nous ne pouvons prévoir, le bénéfice
                        de tout ou partie de cette rélisation devait faire retour a LL. AA. les
                        Princes, aprés paiement des créances garanties sur ce Domaine, il ne saurait
                        s'agir quie de la moitié des bénéfices nets revenant au Gouvernement,
                        puisque l'autre moitié de ces bénéfices nets, attribuée par la convention du
                        21 Juin 1898, ne constituerait que la compensation convenue au profit des
                        personnes et des capitaux qui se sont employés a cette réalisation: il
                        s'agirait pour cette derniére moitié d'une charge grevant
                        conventionnellement le Domaine réalisé.</p>

                    <p>D'autre part, le Gouvernement Egyptien ne devrait-il pas relever et garantir
                        tous les porteurs de titres de la New Daira Cy Ltd. du dommage que leur
                        causerait l'admission de l'action dont nous contestons le bien fondé?</p>

                    <p>La réclamation de LL. AA. les Princes peut-elle entraver ou retarder, soit
                        les paiement a effectuer par le Crédit Foncier Egyptien, soit la liquidation
                        finale?</p>

                    <p>Certainement non:</p>

                    <p>L.L. A.A. les Princes devrainent pour ce fairs, procéder par voie de
                        saisie-arrêt.</p>

                    <p>Or, pour procéder par voie de saisie-arrêt ils n'ont ni titre liquide et
                        reconnu, ni titre a faire liquider provisoirement par le juge de
                        service.</p>

                    <p>Ils se heurtent au texte formel de l'art. 40 de la Loi de liquidation, et
                        tant qu'ils n'auront pas tourné a leur profit ce texte de Loi par une
                        décision en dernier ressort, ils devront assister en spectateurs impassibles
                        et impuissants aux événements qu'ils ne peuvent modifier.</p>

                    <p>D'autre part et même pour le cas ou il leur serait loisible de recourir a la
                        Procédure de saisie-arrêt, croit on que L.L. A.A. le Princes s'engageraient
                        dans cette voie si grosse de conséquences?</p>

                    <p>Pour notre part nous écartons une telle hypothése.</p>

                    <p>Ils seraient responsables de intérêts sur les sommes considérables dont ils
                        entraveraient ou retarderaient la réglement, et cette consideration est de
                        nature a arrêter les plus hardis.</p>

                    <p>D'ailleurs, s'ils ont confiance en leur droit ils n'ont qu'a le poursuivre,
                        sans s'arrêter a des moyens aux quels on s'attache alors seulement qu'on a
                        en face de soi des personnalités d'une solvabilité douteuse: ce qui n'est
                        pas le cas.</p>

                    <p>Done et comme consequence des considerations qui précédent, les titres de la
                        New Daira Sanieh Cy. Ltd. ont bien aujourd'hui et doivent avoir la même
                        valeur qu'ils avaient il y a quelques jours, avant que L.L. A.A. les Princes
                        aient élevé leur réclamation judiciaire qui a jeté sur le marché un émoi que
                        rien ne justifie.</p>

                        pouvait pas fonctionner et qu'il y aurait lieu de la soustraire de
                        l'Entreprise du quai. <persName>M. James</persName>, appelé des Indes pour
                        donnerson avis, appuya la maniére de voir du Gouvernement. <persName>M.
                            Quellennec</persName> se prononca dans le même sens, ainsi que
                        l'Administration Municipale et plusieurs membres de la Commission.</p>
                    <p>Le Conseil Municipal, s'en remettant a des personnages d'une si haute
                        compétence et redoutant de trop engager sa responsabilité, vota la
                        suppression du collecteur en mai 1903. Le mois suivant, le président
                        proposait de porter l'emprunt a un million de livres pour faire face a de
                        nouveaux travaux d'assainissement.</p>
                    <p>Ce fut grâce a un événement imprévu que la nouvelle combinaison échoua.
                            <persName>M. Almagiá</persName> refusa l'offre de compensation a lui
                        faite par la Municipalité et demanda qu'on déduiett les 28100 livres du
                        collecteur du monstant des nouveaux travaux proposés par MM. Webb, Wuellenec
                        et le président de la Commission; cette demande fut rejetée et un comité,
                        composé de MM. Abani, Escoffier, Rothacker et Zouro, fut nommé fut d'avis de
                        rejeter la suppression du collecteur et son rapport qui fut soumis a la
                        Commission fut approuvé par celle-ci par 14 voix contre 7. De plus comité de
                        provisoire fut élu permanent pour veiller a l'exécution du collecteur et
                        deux autres membres luifurent adjoints: MM. Stagni et Yehia Bey. Le comité
                        ainsi formé élabora un nouvean rapport qui fut également approuvé par la
                        Commission.</p>
                    <p>En dépit des notes MM. James et Quellenec, de M. Webb et des Travaux Publios,
                        en dépit du président et de plusieurs membres de la Commission, le comité
                        avait triomphé. Le Gouvernement, bien qu'a contre-coeur et en se défendant
                        de toute responsabilité en cas d'echec, approuva la décision Municipale et
                        voila comment, aprés mille péripéties, le collecteur fut construit.</p>
                    <p>Maintenant qu'il est terminé et qu'il fonetionne a souhait les conseillers
                        municipaux qui n'ont pas de diplômes et qui l'out neanmoins emporté sur les
                        diplômés et les techniciens doivent sourire d'aise et se demander si les
                        parchemins sont indispensables a la conduite de affaires. C'est, comme on le
                        voit, un précédent plutôt dangereux, mais a qui la faute?</p>

                        promenade; les bordures des trottoirs sont posées sur un assez long parcours
                        et si les travaux marchent encoure un mois ou deux avec cette rapidité, le
                        public alexandrin pourra enfin se promener prés de la mer. Il reste
                        cependant beaucoup a faire pour rendre la promenade praticable. Si le
                        brise-lames n'est pas constrait, il faudra nécessairement jeter de gros
                        blocs tout le long du mur du quai pour briser les vagues qui rencontrant une
                        surface lisse et mi-circulaire s'élévant bien au-dessus du parapet et
                        déferlent sur la route. Ces blocs serviront en même temps a protéger le mur

                        qu'un des vices les plus regrettables de notre ville, c'est assurément le
                        mauvais fonctionnement des égouts. Des odeurs pestilentielles s'en dégagent,
                        surtout de ceux a grillage. Nous sommes étonnués de ce que la Municipalité
                        n'adompte pas partout le systéme a syphon, installé dans certaines rues et
                        qui, restant complétement dissimulé et ne laissant échapper aucun miasme,

                    <head>CANADA’S WEALTH</head>
                    <p>A note of warning as to the Englishman's neglected opportunities in the North
                        West of Canada is struck by the Special Commissioner of "TheStandard,"" who,
                        writing from Edmonton, Alberta Province, says:-Slavs and Teutons are being
                        drawn into the North West in great numbers this year, as in other years, and
                        the tide of English immigration of the right kind is still so ssluggish that
                        it is possible Englishmen will find themselves forestalled in this part of
                        their unknown and-by the majority of them-unappreciated heritage.</p>

                    <p>What I wish to do now, however is to tell of a region which is available for
                        English emigration, and to which others will assuredly be brought if the
                        opportunity of effective British occupation and ownership be missed. Not
                        political occupation, for that already exists, and will continue as long as
                        the Dominion remains an integral part of the realm; but actual occupation in
                        the sense that the soil is owned and tilled by men of English blood, who
                        will raise English families upon it, and build up distinctively English
                        communities. That is the ideal we would all like to see realised in the
                        unoccupied areas of Empire; and hence this note of warning, based on a study
                        of immigration statistics and on observatino of Slavonic and Teutonic
                        communities of peasant proprietors now in the North West, and still daily
                        pouring into the country for purposes of settlement. If the Englishman does
                        not come into the region, the German, the Gallician, the Russian will
                        come-are, indeed, now coming, filching-though blamelessly and because of
                        English apathy and want of enterprise-our inheritance from us.</p>

                    <p>The area of which the little town of Edmonton is the centre, lies in the
                        extreme North West of Canada-the Farther North West, as it may be called. It
                        is a continuation of the valley of the North Saskatchewan. Edmonton is the
                        prospective capital of the newly autonomous province of Alberta. On the
                        east, for some hundreds of miles, are the rich valley lands of the
                        Saskatchewan; and about these the reader already knows something from the
                        articles descriptive of my search for a homestead. For about fifty miles to
                        the south, and also to the north and eastward to the foothills of the Rocky
                        Mountains, is a tract of rich black soil, which is known to be as good as
                        that of the wheat belt of Manitoba and the Plains of Regina. Away to the
                        north lies the vast and, as yet, but partially explored basin of the
                        Mackenzie. What the soil may be worth in this farther region remains to be
                        demonstrated. It is as certain as such things can be that within a radius of
                        fifty miles from Edmonton, in any direction, there is land which is as good
                        as any to be found east of the Rockies. Without posing as an expert in such
                        matters, it may be said that I have been long enough in Canada to know the
                        difference between good land and bad-to be able to distinguish at a glance
                        land of the kind on which mammoth crops are grown and that which would not
                        support a goat. The soil in the Edmonton district is of the first order.</p>

                    <p>The good land of the <placeName>Edmonton</placeName> regin begins from the
                        south at the <placeName>Red Deer River</placeName>, that which lies between
                        Red Deer and Calgary being better suited for cattle and sheep runs. At Red
                        Deer, by the way, is a farm which bears the name of an historic scholastic
                            town-<placeName>Berkhamsted</placeName>, about thirty miles on the north
                        road from London. At Berkhamsted a school has existed since mediaeval times.
                        Under <persName>Dr. T.C. Fry</persName>, formerly of
                            <placeName>Cheltenham</placeName>, it has been rebuilt, reorganized, and
                        newly equipped, and it is now taking rank as one of the foremost educational
                        institutions in England. I make this digression because here at Red
                        Deer-over five thousand miles from the ancient picturesque little
                            <placeName>Hertfordshire</placeName> town-there is an extensive "fixed"
                        farm, owned by him and managed for him, where Berkhamsted boys come to fit
                        themselves for Colonial lite. Dr Fry's idea seems to be that in every school
                        there are some lads who, for diverse reasons are better suited for Colonial
                        life than for more conventional or exacting careers, and that it is an
                        advantage for such as these to graduate, so to speak, on a Colonial farm
                        which is linked with the organisation of a home school rather than to be
                        sent out by parents to take their chance. Hence the establishment at Red
                        Deer.</p>

                    <p>It is not on grain alone that the North stakes its hopes for the future,
                        though here there are great possibilities, as anyone can see who will
                        consider this article in relation to the efforts of the scientists to evolve
                        an earlier ripening variety of wheat. It is essentially an area for "mixed"
                        farming. Hog raising is already an important industry. Cattle and sheep do
                        well. there is bushland in abundance-in superabundance, perhaps, when one
                        thinks of the severe labour involved in clearing the ground and tearing out
                        the stumps. But the timber is not large. Many of the trees are of the girth
                        of clothes props, and there are large tracts of willow bush which can easily
                        be burnt off. At any rate there is bountiful supply of timber for log
                        housebuilding and fuel; and in this respect the region has an advantage over
                        any home-steading land west of the Third Meridian, where we have to go
                        twenty miles or more before enough wood can be obtained to cook a prairie
                        chicken.</p>

                    <p>And Nature, ever lavish, has furnished the Edmonton country with natural gas
                        and illimitable coal, which lies just under the prarie and crops out in the
                        ravine of the <placeName>Saskatchewan</placeName>. To get tolerable coal now
                        all one has to do is to back a wagon against the side of the ravine and
                        shover the fuel out of the earth.</p>

                    <head>JAPAN'S NEW MORAL EDUCATION.</head>
                    <p>Certain obvious facts of present-day life are forcing parents, educators, and
                        statesmen to consideration of the place of ethical instruction in
                        State-supported schools, says the Boston "Transcript." The modern man, with
                        all his passion for social betterment, his increased knowledge of the world
                        in which he lives, his added leisure from toil, and his increased wealth, is
                        not proving so loyal to ideals of conduct as could be wished. The Decalogue,
                        not to mention the Sermon on the Mount, seems to be an excellent thing for
                        children to know and obey still; and the question is insistent now as to
                        whether Church, school and the home, but especially the school are bringing
                        to bear effectively upon the youth of today those ethical principles which
                        are as permanent as humanity itslef.</p>

                    <p>Possibly, as in no many other things, we may have to turn to Japan for light
                        on how to do our duty. There the wisest of men in authority, including the
                        Emperor, no doubt, have realised that the present era, with its
                        disintegration of religious belief, is a particularly critical time; that
                        however much the Confucian ethic has done in the past, it cannot be a solid
                        foundation for the future.</p>

                    <p>In consequence Japan's department of education has begun to issue moral
                        text-books for use by the pupils of the schools, and those for elementarly
                        grades which have been in use during the past year, on the whole, have been
                        generally approved, such criticism as has come being chiefly that some of
                        the older and more conservative statesmen, who dislike emphasis on the
                        rights of the individual, his duty to cultivate self-reliance and
                        self-respect and independence of spirit. To these champions of the eler
                        régime such teaching seems to militate against questioning loyalty to the
                        Emperor, filial piety, and unquestioning patriotism.</p>
                    <p>"Not so," reply the supporters of the new teaching, based on utilitarian
                        conceptions of morals; "we do insist on all that Japan hitherto has deemed
                        highest, but we add to it now that principle of individualism which the
                        Occident has stood for, that right of the individual as over against the
                        many, that private initiative and that self-reliance which have made the
                        Occidental man so powerful and so creative." Hence the code set forth in
                        this series of books is one of balanced thought on altruism and egoism,
                        loyalty to the throne and liberty of the subject, etc.; and if continued in
                        use and the permanent standard of the Japan of the future, they will show
                        that in another most important sphere of life Occidental standards have
                        attained complete recognition by far-sighted, public-spirited Orientals.</p>
                    <p>Of course, the advantage which a nation like Germany or Japan, with authority
                        centralised, has over England in a matter like this is its power to impose
                        on the entire school system of the nation the fruit of the deliberations of
                        experts. We have spasms of virtue, and start commissions of educators at
                        work on schemes of teaching ethics to our children-and what comes of it? But
                        here a plan is perfected and at work in every primary school in Japan, with
                        every child getting, in language that is said to be a model for concieseness
                        and simplicity, wisdom on such themes as chivalry, sincertiy, economy,
                        filial piety, politeness, self-dependence and self-support, work, patience,
                        pity for animals, kindness, benevolence, the public good, home, masters and
                        servants, public health, the Emperor and duties of subjects to him,
                        diligence in study, etc. Illustrations from history, ancient and modern,
                        Japanese, and American and European, illuminate and enliven the homilies as
                        incidents from actual life always do; and proverbs and wise sayings-Oriental
                        and Occidental-supplement the homily adonrned by biography.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, now and again the compilers of the books have drawn for students
                        portraits of ideal Japanese. Will it be for naught that thousands of
                        children come to think thus of what a "good Japanese" is? "A good Japanese
                        is one who fulfils all his duties to his parents, brothers and sisters, and
                        relations; who never forgets the veneration due to his ancestors; who, as a
                        master, is kind and considerate to his servants; who, as a servant, is
                        faithful to his master. He will never forget benefits conferred on him. He
                        will act straightforwardly in all things, scrupulously observing his
                        agreements, acting in a generous and large-minded way to others; he will be
                        kindly and charitbale, a respector of what is right, and full of compassion
                        for the unfortunate; holding in high esteem public order; devising schemes
                        for furthing the progress of society, and careful not to be guildy of any
                        impropriety even in his dealings with foreigners. A good Japanese develops
                        his physical powers, stores his mind with useful knowledge; cultivates
                        valour, endurance, self-control, moderation, modesty, and self-examination;
                        ever bears in mind what is required of him in work, business, competition,
                        and money-making, and how men's trust is to be won. He forms useful habits;
                        he practises virtue; he applies his mind to the practical application of
                        learning; he devises measures for self-development and continual progress. A
                        good Japanese thinks highly of his country, and by the culture of a spirit
                        of loyalty and patriotism strives to fulfil all the obligations of a good
                        citizen. In this manner should we develop our own personality, raise
                        fammilies, and do all that is required of us to benefit the world and or
                        fellow men."</p>

                    <p>The practical question is whether we are not likely to be left behind by our
                        friends the Japanese in the great duty and privilege of education of
                        twentieth-century citizens.</p>

                    <head>GERMANS IN MADEIRA</head>
                    <p>The other week <persName>Lord Percy</persName> informed <persName>Mr.
                            Lawrence</persName> that the Government is aware of concessions lately
                        granted to German subjects in <placeName>Madeira</placeName>, whereby
                        British trade is endangered, and is in communication with the Portuguese
                        Government on the matter. This information would have been more valuable but
                        for the fact that rather more than a year ago Lord Percy returned the same
                        answer to a similar question from <persName>Sir Walter Foster</persName>,
                        who had been staying on the island and knew the state of affairs. The
                        intervention of our Minister at <placeName>Lisbon</placeName> was sufficient
                        to prevent the German syndicate from obtaining a concession for the supply
                        of water to the town of <placeName>Funchal</placeName>, and consequently to
                        all the shipping. But the expropriation clause in the sanatorium concession
                        still remains, and the syndicate continues to import building material and
                        furniture for a sanatorium which is no sanatorium at all but a first-class
                        hotel, and strenuous efforts are being made at
                        <placeName>Lisbon</placeName>, by methods which are said to be exceedingly
                        agreeable to poor politicians, to obtain the right to erect a casino on a
                        scale that would not be excessive at <placeName>Monte Carlo</placeName>, and
                        to legalise gambling. One move in the game is distinctly neat. Last season
                        the German syndicate acquired the lease of the old Casino, which has two or
                        three years to run, and closed down the establishment. Then they went about
                        provoking public opinion on the matter, and everybody said how dull the
                        place was without a little quiet gambling.</p>

                    <p>The question is not merely a question of trade. British merchants in
                            <placeName>Madeira</placeName>do not object to German competition unless
                        the competitors have such unfair advantages as the sanatorium concession
                        grants. But the syndicate is rapidly acquiring large trading interests, and
                        is able to import duty free furniture for which the British hotel-keepers
                        have to pay duties amounting to about £100 a ton. The expropriation clause
                        enables it to buy whatever land it requires, and though our Minister has
                        been assured that no land held by British subjects will be expropriated it
                        is now endeavouring to expropriate a parcel of land near the heart of
                            <placeName>Funchal</placeName>, held by Messers. W. and <persName>A.
                            Reid</persName>, the hotel proprietors. The syndicate refused to buy
                        this land when it was in the open market; now it claims the right to buy the
                        property, which cost £7,000, for the erection of a sanatorium for the
                        consumptive poor of Germany. It is not quite usual to place such
                        institutions in the centre of populous towns. Our Minister should be
                        instructed to oppose this act of injustice most vigorously. The Germans
                        would never have thought of acquiring the land if they had not wished to
                        deal a blos at <persName>Messrs. Reid</persName>'s business. It is quite
                        evident that, as the interests of the syndicate increase, it will come more
                        and more frequently into friction with local British residents, and will be
                        backed heartily by the German Government, which is not indifferent to the
                        strategic importance of Madeira's position, within a few hours' steaming
                        from <placeName>Gibraltar</placeName>. In this respect German policy is
                        unalterable. Here we have the story of German methods in
                            <placeName>Samoa</placeName>, <placeName>Venezuela</placeName>,
                            <placeName>China</placeName>, <placeName>Turkey</placeName>, and
                            <placeName>Morocco</placeName> all over again. First the acquisition of
                        apparently small concessions; then terrorism exerted over a weak Government;
                        finally the assertion of rights including, if possible, the right of
                        occupation, The Germans in <placeName>Madeira</placeName> state openly that
                        they mean to drive the English traders out of the island by means of these
                        concessions. If they should succeed it will require no great effort of
                        prophecy to foresee the time when the Portuguese will follow the
                        English.</p>

                    <p>It is essential that on two points our Government should stand firm. The
                        concessions which grants the right of free importation and of expropriation
                        must be withdrawn, and no gambling concession must be granted. Already the
                            <placeName>Lisbon</placeName> Government has stated that it will cancel
                        the concession if it can be proved that the trading company has acquired the
                        rights of the Sanatorium company. Now, the concession was acquired by a
                        certain German Prince, who stands high in the Emperor's favor. He sold his
                        rights for £20,000 to the Madeira Sanatorium Vorbereitungs Gesellschaft,
                        which has a capital of £40,000. It was this company, nominally, which build
                        the Kurhaus St. Anna, 1,200 feet above the sea, on on of the finest sites of
                        Madeira, but it is controlled by the Madeira Actien Gesellschaft, which now
                        has a capital of £300,000, and has taken over a large proportion of the
                        rights and responsibilities of the smaller concern. Indeed it was this large
                        company which lately issued invitations for the laying of the
                        foundation-stone of a second sanatorium which is going to be built in the
                        hills. Whether this will retain its character after the foundation-stone has
                        been laid, or whether the proprietors think that they really must do
                        something in return for the concession, is not yet apparent. Though the two
                        companies have different offices in <placeName>Berlin</placeName> they are
                        managed and directed by the same people, and their intimate connection lies
                        the ground for cancelling privileges which were only granted in behalf of
                        the consumptives of <placeName>Germany</placeName>, through the kindly
                        influence of the <persName>Queen of Portugal</persName>, and were not meant
                        to be used for trading purposes at all. As a fact the proprietors of the
                        Kurhaus St. Anna ought to pay the Portuguese Government a sum considerably
                        exceeding £10,000 for duties on furniture alone. It is a singular fact that
                        a distinguished German philanthropist, and an expert in sanatorial matters,
                        has resigned his positino on the board of the smaller company owing to the
                        discovery that the Kurhaus is no more and no less an hotel run on commercial
                        lines.</p>

                    <p>The concession has not been submitted to the Cortes, nor have its terms been
                        published. On this count, therefore, its legality is doubtful. We understand
                        that a year ago our Minister in <placeName>Lisbon</placeName> could not get
                        a copy, but he does not need a copy. All he needs to do is to insist that
                        the term sanatorium shall be rigidly applied, and that nothing in the nature
                        of a fraud on the Portuguese public shall enable German traders to compete
                        on favorable terms against our own, nor to expropríate their best ground on
                        the plea of building sanatoria which are really hotels. The water scheme was
                        a direct bid for power, and so is the gambling scheme; but the German
                        designs will fall to the ground if the Foreign Office insists on fair play
                        and no favor.</p>

                    <head>A CRUISER'S FATE</head>
                    <p>The superannuated cruiser Fearless has been having a sad time of it. She was
                        sold by the Admirably to be broken up, and she seems to have made a bid for
                        life by breaking adrift in <placeName>St. George</placeName>'s Channel. The
                        steamship Ardcola volunteered, so to speak, for police duty, and towered her
                        out to <placeName>Holyhead</placeName>; but when it came to her owner paying
                        for that service, there was more trouble. She was arrested by a Custom House
                        officer, on a writ issued by the Admirably Court, and so in her old age
                        because security for a salvage debt. The Fearless, if ships have souls, must
                        have been devoutly grateful to the owner's master, who ignored the Custom
                        House man and took her on to Rhyl for exhibition to seaside Britons. But she
                        was never exhibited. On Saturday the Admiralty Court issued a writ of
                        attachment against both owner and master, of whom the former has left her
                        quite in the lurch, sailing away in a yacht which canot be heard of. he is
                        to pay £50 or go to gaol for on month; he is also to pay the salvage debt or
                        lose her; and there is little hope that in any case the Fearless will escape
                        the fate ordained her by an ungrateful country. A shorter shrift had been
                        more merciful.</p>

                    <head>COTTON INDUSTRY OF BRITISH INDIA.</head>
                    <p>We have frequently directed attention to the progress of the cotton industry
                        in the Far East, and especially in Japan and China, and have indicated that
                        Lacashire manufacturers should keep themselves informed regarding the
                        developments which are taking place. Probably, from their point of view,
                        what is being done in British India is of greater importance, as the
                        competition thereby produced will be more directly felt. From a report
                        received at teh Board of Trade from the India Office we learn that for the
                        official year ending March 31, 1904, there were in India 204 cotton mills,
                        containing 46,421 looms and 5,213,344 spindles. Of this number, 113 were
                        exclusively spinning-mills, three were exclusively weaving-mills, and in 86
                        both spinning and weaving were carried on. A daily average of 186,271
                        persons was employed-vis. 118,640 men, 36737 women, 19,159 young persons,
                        and 11,735 children. Nine of these 204 mills, with 171,960 spindles and
                        1,365 looms, were closed throughout the year. The aggregate of the nominal
                        capital and debentures invested in the mills is estimated to be alightly in
                        excess of 200 millions of rupees, and of this, 158 millions of rupees, or
                        10,500,000, is paid up. The Bombay Presidency possesses 69 per cent of the
                        mills, 70 per cent of the spindles, and 76 per cent of the looms. In the
                        native state and French territory there are 19 mills, with 3,304 looms and
                        267,902 spindles. Only 33 of the mills are owned otherwise than by
                        joint-stock companies. The industry dates from 1851, when the first mill was
                        started. In the last 20 years the number of mills has increased by 152 per
                        cent, and their working capacity has proportionately augmented, the number
                        of looms having increased by 182 per cent, and of spindles by 156 per
                        cent.</p>

                    <p>The great decline in 1900-1901 was due partly to the drought in India, which
                        impaired the purchasing power of the people and at the same time raised the
                        price of the raw material. A noticeable fact is the continued increase in
                        the production of yarn of counts higher than No. 20, which is as much as
                        100,000,000 lb., being 18 per cent of the whole production. Using Egyptian
                        and other imported cotton, the Bombay mills are now spinning in appreciable
                        quantity yarns of No. 40 and upwards. The production of the finer yarns-Nos.
                        31 to 40- increased last year to about 16,250,000 lb., from less than
                        12,200,000 lb. in the two preceding years and 11,000,000 lb. in 1900-1. </p>

                    <p>The weaving-mills were less affected than the spinning mills by the high
                        price of raw cotton in 1903-4, for there was a consierable advance in the
                        price of cloth, and both the home and the foreign demand was good. The
                        production last year, therefore increased by about 12 1/2 per cent. Weaving
                        is concentrated in the Bombay mills to an even greater degree than spinning,
                        the mills of that province producing about 86 per cent of the whole quantity
                        woven in British India. Madras and the United Provinces each produce about 4
                        per cent, and the Central Provinces 6 per cent of the whole. The goods woven
                        are mainly grey (unbleached) goods, these representing 80 per cent of the
                        whole production.-"Engineering."</p>
