                    <head>THE ALGECIRAS CONFERENCE</head>
                    <p>A Havas telegram from Algeciras, which we publish to-day, announces that
                        Germany has refused to entertain the French proposal regarding the policing
                        of Morocoo by French and Spanish officers selcted by the Sultan.</p>

                    <!-- not sure if this should be considered column 4 or 6 -->
                    <p>Germany bases her non pouumus attitude on the fact that to permit such a
                        scheme would be oontrary to the internationalisation of the country and the
                        equality of the Powers there. As the conference may come to pieces on this
                        question it is important to consider it, especially in view of the new light
                        thrown on the subject by the statements which I appeared in the "Times" of
                        yesterday week. It will be remembered that a recent "inspired” communique to
                        the German Press gave it to be understood that France had claimed the right
                        to police the whole of Morocco, a claim against which Germany had protested,
                        and would protest, on the ground that it infringed the principle of the
                        Sultan’s independence, and would lead to the "Tunisification” of the She-
                        reefian Empire. Now as the Paris correspondent of the "Times” pointed out
                        yesterday week. M. Revoil has never made any each claim on behalf of h’s
                        Government—we shall see, present¬ly, why not. Ail that France claims is, as
                        M. Revoil has made it dear, the right to organise the policing of the ports,
                        and it is round the problem of organizing the necessary police force for the
                        seaports that the struggle is going on behind the screen of diplomatic
                        decency inter-posed by the formal meetings over which the Duke of Almodovar
                        presides.</p>
                    <p>Why is that particular problem the only one for which M. Revoil would have
                        been likely to claim, as he has done, the right of France to find the
                        necessary solution ? The answer is - simple enough. The penetration of the
                        civilising influence in Morocco must proceed, as the . anatomists say, from
                        without inwards. The fringe of Moroccan seaports formas the row of doors by
                        which Moroccao communicates (in so far as she is compelled to do so) with
                        Europe on the north and on the west These towns contain considerable
                        European populations engaged in trader or owning laud in the vicinity.
                        Outside the zone of the influence of these towns reigns immemorial chaos,
                        which extends over the rest of the land, right away to the Algerian frontier
                        on the east, and south¬wards to the sands of the Sahara. Can any sane person
                        imagine that France has any desire to attempt the subjugation—for that it
                        would have to be — manu military of an enormous country, absolutely
                        unprovided with roads, and inhabited by fierce, fighting tribesmen, who dare
                        not, if they could, grow more corn and other necessaries than they actually
                        want, for fear of the rapacity either of neighbours or of the local
                        governors in those of their districts where these feel themselves able to
                        practice extortion ? Years hence the interior of Morocco may gradually yield
                        to the process of more or less practise penetration; but for the present it
                        is enough to attempt to civilise the coasts—a proofs of which European
                        interests m the seaports have long been in sore need. Now, considering that
                        Germany's interests in Marocco have been officially declared to be purely
                        commercial, (though these amount to only about £90,000 worth of trade per
                        annum) one might have supposed that such interests would have been admirably
                        served by the prompt inauguration of a system which would guarantee the
                        security of life and property in and around the ports. But not a bit of it:
                        the German proposal, we are told, is that the Sultan shall do the work, with
                        the assistance of the minor powers. That would mean, of course, that there
                        would be no efficient organisation what¬ever. France, with her Algerian
                        experience, with her Algerian prestige, is the obvious agent to be selected
                        by Europe for the job; hot Germany, it seems, will not consent Wby? Because,
                        as as it would appear, she prefers the continuance of the present state of
                        things to a change which would put an everlasting veto upon the ambition
                        which she cherishes, but does not avow, of securing a foothold on the
                        Atlantic seaboard herself She knows that, for the present, that ambition
                        cannot be realised, bat she holds on to it, knowing that every¬thing comes
                        to those who know how to wait, and that, since she cannot get her own way
                        yet, the next best thing is to keep the door open, and bide her time until
                        circumstances, shall allow her to slip in. Those circumstances?, however,
                        will hardly be present just yet But the German game scarcely bodes well for
                        the success of the Morocco Conference.</p>

                        completely breakdown. The reason is that Germany has quite refused to

                        police force in Morocco. France wants Morocco’s policing to be entrusted to

                    <p>The election for the General College took place at the Bourse yesterday
                        amidst marked apathy. Out of over 1,400 electors only 842 recorded their
                        vote, and of this number over half were taken from their offices and shops
                        in motors and private carriages. All the four can¬didates elected were in
                        the first list, while the unsuccessful candidates were Mr. Zonro, Dr.
                        Lisaridis, Mr. Achilles Abbat, and Mahmoud Ghimei. The votes gained by the
                        successful candidates were : Mr. Michael Salvago, 632 ; Mr. Tambacopoulo,
                        579 ; Mr. H. P Kingham, 5 2 ; and Dr. Valensin. 552. Mr, Zouro headed the
                        second list with 231 votes, Mr. Achilles Abbat obtained 139 Dr Lascaridis
                        135, and Mahmoud Ghimei 95. Mr. Kingham and Dr. Valensin having obtained an
                        equal number of votes, they cast lots who should replace Mr. G. B. Alderson
                        for his unexpired tenure of office. Dr. Valensin was the winner, so he will;

                    <p>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.)</p>
                    <p>Helouan, Monday.</p>
                    <p>Soma excitement was caused in Helouan to day on the arrival of the mid-day
                        train from Cairo, by an attack made upon a gentle­man resident in the town
                        who had travelled by the train and was proceeding homewards. The assailant
                        carried a thick stick with which: he dealt the gentleman a terrific blow in
                        the face, causing an ugly wound which bled profusely. The assistance of the
                        police having been obtained, the assailant was taken to the police station.
                        The gentleman attacked, having given an account of the occurrence, was
                        astounded at being informed that the police could neither arrest nor detain
                        his assailant on account of his being a Spanish subject. The man was
                        consequently liberated, and may easily have left the country before the
                        consular law can be put in motion. Something should be done, undoubtedly, to
                        ensure the safety of life and limb and the interests of justice in such
                        cases.</p>

                    <p>This morning Mr. Fabri, a cabowner, was to have been charged with inciting
                        others to commit breaches of the peace during the recent cab strike at
                        Alexandria. The case, which was to have been heard before the British

                    <p>A great amount of dissatisfaction has been aroused among the public of
                        Alexandria by the surrender of the Municipality to the demands of the cabmen
                        The new tariff is considered very high. For example, a two-horse carriage
                        now costs P.T. 5 for half an hour instead of P.T. 6 for an hour. The whole
                        basis of the new tariff shows a large increase and it is presumed that the
                        Municipality have decided on these increases so as not to forego the great
                        increase in the tax on the users of the unnumbered carriages.</p>

                    <p>ATTENDANCE NEARLY ALL ENGLISH</p>
                    <p>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT)</p>
                    <p>Port Said, Saturday</p>
                    <p>The fancy dress ball, in aid of the funds of the Port Said Sporting Club,
                        given on the 10th inst., was a great success. We are not yet in a position
                        to say bow much the club has gained financially by the function, hot no
                        doubt quite a respectable sum will go into the treasurer's coffers. In view
                        of the fact that the Sporting Club will be "international,” it is
                        regrettable j that the different colonies, of which Port Saidsociety is
                        composed, were not more numerously represented. A casual glance round the
                        spacious ballroom sufficed to show that practi­cally the entire attendance
                        was English. There was not so much animation and gaiety, as once usually
                        expects to see at a masked ball, and those who ventured forth in fancy dress
                        did not distinguish themselves, either by the beauty or originality of their
                        dresses.</p>
                    <p>The Governor, H.E. Mustapha lbadi Pacha, , entertained a party to supper, and
                        several other other smaller parties partook of the excellent fare provided
                        by the Savoy Hotel. It was not until nearly 4 a.m. that the last of the
                        pleasure-seekers left the hall.</p>

                    <p>On Thursday morning another of those "love and jealousy dramas” occurred
                        here. A Belgian, 30 years of age, made a savage ; attack on a woman named
                        Rejane, who appears to have been the man’s mistress, but had recently
                        declared that she would no longer have anything to do with him. So last
                        Thursday the victim received a call from her former lover, and just as he
                        appeared on the point of departing, he made a sudden attack and inflicted
                        several severe outs with a razor. The woman was conveyed to the hospital and
                        is now reported to be progressing favourably. The ‘hero of the drama,” as
                        this would-be murderer is called here, endeavoured to poison himself at the
                        caracol, but an antidote was administered in good time and his condition is
                        not considered dangerous. He now states that he merely intended to disfigure
                        his victim, — not to kill her. The Belgian Consul is awaiting instructions
                        from the Diplomatic Agentin Cairo; in the meantime, the prisoner will be
                        kept under arrest by the local authorities.</p>

                    <p>The new wall, and grilled railings, that are being erected along the Marina,
                        by the Suez Canal Co., will certainly be a great improve¬ment on the old
                        wooden pilings. But why should Port Said be caged in ? The majority of
                        residents here already feel their isolated position keenly enough, but the
                        new barriers, when completed, will certainly only add to the depression. The
                        view from the water will give one the impression that Port Said is a huge
                        quarantine park, or, may be a stranger will mistake the town for a
                        "leper-colony.” People are ever ready to say all the bad things they ; can
                        about Port Said; some speak from experience others from hearsay. But when
                        the powers that be go it the trouble and expense of raising so impenetrable
                        a barrier, they are inviting the delicate irony of our critics. If the
                        object of the wall and high railings is to prevent smuggling, it should
                        prove a huge success, bat if, as many are inclined to think, it is a serious
                        attempt to beautify the town, we must look upon it as the failure of a good
                        intention.</p>

                        Anglo-American Hospital and the Church Poor Fund. We hope that residents and
                        visitors will thus help these institutions, as well as improve their
                        acquaint­ance with ancient Egypt, by attending these lectures, the tickets
                        for which can be Lad separately at all the hotels.</p>
                    <p>The first lecture was on that period of Imitative Art from the XIX h dynasty
                        til’ Roman times. Prof. Petrie remarked that, though the art of Ancient
                        Egypt is more or less familiar to everyone, yet it is generally credited
                        with the style which is only the latent and least original form which it
                        assumed. Its long history is ignored, and only its worst phase is commonly
                        recognised. The cause of this misunderstanding is clear. The latest
                        buildings were those which survived most completely. They attracted the
                        attention of the European copyists by their preservation, and hence the
                        early publications filled the popular view with the great temples of the
                        base epoch. Then worse has followed ; for bad copies of this bid work have
                        been placed be­fore our eyes for trade purposes, until the vilest parodies
                        have come to be accepted as representing ancient Egypt to the public mind.
                        What is commonly called Egyptian decoration is worse than the worst
                        debasement which ever took place anciently.</p>
                    <p>The same misunderstanding took place in regard to Creak Art. In became known
                        through Roman conies ; and our great-grandfathers were brought up on the
                        worst taste of the later Roman empire, and made yet worse conies of it That
                        stage of knowledge is much like the public acquaintance with Egypt at
                        present Since that the good Roman work came to be appreciated; and at
                        present all Roman copies are looked on as only indica­tions of what we have
                        lost of the great age of Greek rt; and our understanding of it is drawn from
                        the original son roes of the creative age of Pericle, and the still earlier
                        time. It is such an appreciation of the true value and character of Egyptian
                        Art, as opposed to the late degradation of it, that wilt be brought forward
                        in these lectures.</p>
                    <p>We shall deal with three main ages of art. The most familiar age, that of the
                        late works, is our subject, today, and it is best understood in general. It
                        was the age of imitative art, when there was no hope for good work except in
                        the copying of what went before it. The earlier age of conscious art, and of
                        scholarly training in art, we shall consider next week. And the really
                        formative period and sponta­neous art will be best understood after
                        considering the more familiar periods.</p>
                    <p>The beginning of the Imitative period is in the works of Rameses II. That
                        sovereign is best known by his profusion of monuments ; but all of them were
                        hopeless imitations, when they were not direct thefts of earlier works. We
                        fee in them the stiffness of mechanical copying by rule ; and the weakness
                        of mere smooth finish is se«n under his successors. Rameses III., unable to
                        avoid coarseness, tried to give the virtues of his failings by an attempt at
                        strength in the use of deep shadow.</p>
                    <p>“The methods of training the artists can be seen in the drawings and carvings
                        of students which have been preserved, snob as the heads and figures of
                        kings, and one observant sketch of a youngpeasant. Through the weakness of
                        the later work a certain anility is seen for conventional expression, and
                        some of the wooden faces of coffins are graceful and refined.</p>
                    <p>“In statuary, good traditions may be seen mixed with clamminess of attitude
                        and pose, as in the gold statuette of Hershefi and the statue of
                        Amenardas.</p>
                    <p>In the XXVIth dynasty the traditional relief fell to a very low condition ;
                        but improvement was sought by direct copying of older work. In the«e copies
                        the detail may be almost indistinguishable trom that of early times, bat the
                        lack of pose and unity of the figures at once betrays the copyist. The
                        overloading with detail also shows the lack of originality.</p>
                    <p>"The statuary of the age is better ; but its success is largely due to using
                        hard stones, with mechanical finish and precision of surfaces. The animal
                        figure appear to ns better than the me”, bat that may be due to oar closer
                        appreciation of the human figure. The polished basalt figures of the
                        hippopotamus goddess, the cow, and others in the Cairo Museum show this.
                        Portraiture evidently attracted the best artists, probably because it was
                        better paid for, as in modern times</p>
                    <p>"Under the Ptolemies the work is still poorer. The limbs are mechanically put
                        together with­out any true connection, as in the Philotera in the Vatican.
                        The work was entirely a matter of joining together so many separate parts by
                        mechanical rules. In order to give some effect, every part was exaggerated
                        in an absurd manner, much like the degraded taste shewn in the Farnese
                        Hercules The power of portraiture was the last surviving trace of Egyptian
                        Art, as is seen on some stucco heads of coffins.</p>
                    <p>"The late architecture shows the same faults of mechanical conving ; but new
                        motives were sought for, as at Esneh. Some skill in graceful design still
                        continued, such as the pavilion of Trajan at Philse. The last survival of
                        the old style of building is the Deivel Abyad at Sohag where as late as the
                        IV’h century A D the temple type was adapted to a Christian Church. It is to
                        be helped that this most interesting monument will be most minutely
                        conserved in the coming repairs which are now promised</p>
                    <p>It is an ungrateful task to point out the deficiencies of the work which
                        usually passesas typical of Egypt hot it is only by contrast­ing this with
                        what went before it that we can see how much, greater Egyptian Art was than
                        is commonly supposed from the familiar examples. That contrast will be
                        described in the lectures on the Conscious and the Spontaneous Art, on the
                        following Monday.”</p>

                    <p> REFERENCES TO IRELAND. </p>
                    <p>London, February 19.</p>
                    <p>The King’s Speech, after referring to the lamented death of King Christian,
                        says that “the Prince and Princess of Wales are visiting m many portions of
                        my vast Indian Empire as time admits. The reception afforded them by all
                        els8968 has been mist gratifying to me. 1 trust that the visit will tend to
                        strengthen among my Indian subjects loyalty to the Crown and attachment to
                        this country.”</p>
                    <p>Relations with foreign coin tries continue friendly. His Majesty rejoices
                        that the war between Russia and Japan has resulted in an honourable peace.
                        The Speech mentions, with out comment, the conclusion of a new Anglo-
                        Japanese Agreement His Majesty earnestly hopes that the negotiations at
                        Algeciras will be conducive to the maintenance of peace be­tween all nations
                        The Speech records briefly the accession of King Hakon and Queen Maud and
                        the appointment of reform commissioners In Crete.</p>
                    <p>His Majesty trusts that the international financial commission will lead to
                        salutary reforms in Macedonia.</p>
                    <p>A new constitution with responsible govern­ment for the Transvaal will be
                        drawn up. This will delay the elections for a few months beyond July :
                        meanwhile no further licenses for the importation of Chinese will be issued.
                        A responsible government will also be granted to the Orange River Colony.
                        “My earnest hope is that the grant of free institutions may be followed by
                        an increase of prosperity and loyalty to the Empire.”</p>
                    <p>The Colonial Conference has been postponed until early in 1907.</p>

                    <p>Imports continue to show a steady and accelerating increase and together with
                        the growing activity in the home trade, indicate that the British industries
                        are in a sound progressive condition. The Speech calls atten­tion to the
                        growing national expenditure and says that Ministers are considering plans
                        for improving and effecting economies in the Go­vernment of Ireland and for
                        introducing therein means for associating the people with the conduct of
                        affairs. My desire is that the government of the country, in reliance of
                        ordinary law, may be carried on in a spirit regardful of the wishes and
                        sentiments to the Irish people.</p>
                    <p>Measures are being considered for attracting people to the land.</p>
                    <p>The Speech announces the introduction of Bills to amend education, for
                        dealing with trade disputes, amending workmen’s compensa­tion, equalising
                        rates in the Metropolis, and amending the Unemployed Act. (Reuter)</p>

                        to be chosen by the Sultan should be French and Spanish. Germany declares
                        that this proposal is contrary to the principle of internationalisation and
                        the equality of all the Powers in Morocco (Havas)</p>
                    <p>Algeciras, February 20.</p>
                    <p>Germany suggests that the police should be under the supervision of the
                        diplomatic body at Tangier, while France intimates that she will accept a
                        foreign but not a German inspector general, who will be the intermediary
                        between the Powers and the police organisation.(Reuter)</p>

                    <head>PROSPECTUS</head>
                    <p>The Company has been formed for the purpose of (inter alia) carrying on
                        business as Engineers Contractors and Builders, and the undertaking of
                        irritation, railway, canal, marine, sewage, and constructional engineering,
                        and public works of all kinds.</p>
                    <p>In consequence of the growth of the trade and the increase of the wealth in
                        Egypt, and the consequent raising of the standard of living among all
                        classes, and the steady increase in the population, the building industry in
                        Egypt has been extraordinarily active within recent years ; and it is
                        reasonable to suppose that the activity will be at least well maintained, if
                        not increased, in the future. Engineering and building operations of all
                        kinds are in progress throughout the country. Large sums of money are to be
                        expended on public works. Private h on 80s, flits and offices are on all
                        sides being erected, and the demand for snob buildings is ever
                        increasing.</p>
                    <p>The following is an extract from the note by the Financial Adviser on the
                        Budget for 1906 :—</p>
                    <p>“Roughly speaking, it may be said that Egypt is actually spending from L.E.
                        300,000 to L.E. 400,000 annually on public buildings ; not, I think, an
                        extravagant sum, having regard to the revenue of the country and the fact
                        that everything has to be provided ab initio, hospitals, post offices,
                        prisons, asylums, schools, police stations, to say nothing of Gouvernorats,
                        and other Government build­ings of practically every description.</p>
                    <p>“Of course in the above figures are not included great works of public
                        utility of a remunerative nature, which are charged to Reserve Fund.”</p>
                    <p>With the working capital at its command, the Company will be in a position to
                        take full advantage of the increasing prosperity of the country, and to
                        undertake engineering and building con tracts of the largest kind. Hitherto
                        it has been found that where any works of magnitude have been executed in
                        Egypt, the preponderance of contracts has been secured by - European Arms.
                        As regards the erection of buildings, as distinguished from other works, the
                        Company will be in the favourable position of being able to complete them
                        from basement to 1 roof, including their equipment throughout with
                        electrical and sanitary appliances ; thus theprofits on minor contracts can
                        be secured to the Company. There is &amp; great demand for small residential
                        houses in Cairo and Alexandria, and a wide field is open to the Company to
                        erect small houses in suitable localities, according to the plans and
                        requirements of purchasers, and 1 to have the cost of erection secured by
                        Mortgages payable in installments, with the usual ; interest thereon,
                        extending over a period to suit the convenience of clients.</p>
                    <p>The Company will in the first instance acquire and amalgamate the businesses
                        i carried on by the well-known firms of Engineers, Contractors and Builders,
                        Messrs. McClure &amp; Dorling, of Alexandria, and Messrs. G. L. Pezzi &amp;
                        Co., of Cairo and Alexandria. Both firms are highly respected, and have been
                        entrusted with numerous important contracts by—amongst others—the Egyptian
                        Government, H. H. The Khedive, the British Government, the Egyptian State
                        Railways Administration, the Prisons Department, the Quarantine Board, the
                        British Schools, the Alexandria Water Company, etc., etc</p>
                    <p>Messrs. G. L. Pezzi &amp; Co., who have been established since 1865, in
                        addition to their business as Contractors and Builders, carry on the
                        lucrative business of supplying the building trade with paints, papers, and
                        other building materials and requisite.</p>
                    <p>The immediate vendors to and promoters of the Company are Messrs. Barclay,
                        Hinks &amp; Co., of Cairo (hereinafter called "the Vendors"), who have
                        agreed to acquire the said businesses from their respective proprietors with
                        a view to the re-sale thereof to the Company at a profit, the particulars of
                        which appear from the statements hereinafter contained. The proprietors, Mr.
                        T. McClure, Mr. S. Dorling and Mr. G. L. Pezzi. who will be the first

                        future, not only by taking six-sevenths of their proportion of the purchase
                        price, other than the valuation of the stock and plant, entirely in folly
                        paid shares, but they have also agreed, by the undermentioned Agreements (4)
                        and (5) that daring the first five years their salaries as Managing
                        Directors shall not be payable in by a year in which the Company shall not
                        have earned profits sufficient to pay a dividend of 7 percent. on the
                        initial paid-up capital, and have farther agreed to retain a holding of 10
                        000 shares daring their term of office, and to deposit the certificates of
                        such shares with the Company.</p>
                    <p>Both businesses will be taken over by the Company as going concerns as from
                        the 1st day of October, .1905, and the Company will have the benefit of all
                        profit realised from that date. The property to be transferred to the
                        Company will include, besides the goodwills of the two businesses, the
                        benefit of all pending contracts, the benefit of the existing agreements for
                        the business premises, the book debts from the 1st October, 1905, and the
                        office furniture, fixtures and fittings.</p>
                    <p>The purchase price for the sale of the said goodwills, the pending contracts,

                    <p>BAHR-EL-GHAZAL QUESTION.</p>
                    <p> A BELGIAN VIEW. </p>
                    <p>A Belgian writer who is well known through his articles on the Congo
                        contributes to the “Mouvement Geographique’’ a special article embodying the
                        opinion of all the officers who are acquainted with the Bahr-el-Ghazal, and
                        have been interviewed in regard to its econo­mic value. It is a poor, arid,
                        desert region without future, they say, and it would seem that its sole
                        merit consists in the fact that it is watered by the old Nile, the father of
                        rivers.</p>
                    <p>For the past fifteen years the Congo Free State has devoted to its expansion
                        towards the Nile the best of its strength, its ablest officers, and
                        considerable sums of money, exceeding certainly over two million francs
                        annually. To this undertaking is due the disastrous Dhanis Expedition and
                        the rebellion of the Batetela, the repression of which cost so many lives
                        and so large a sum. To it likewise is due the succession of regrettable
                        diplomatic cot diets, first with Franco, then with Germany, and just now
                        with England. Why should all this be ? Of what use to the Congo Free State
                        can be the possession of the morasses and the arid plains of the Babr
                        el-Ghazal ?</p>
                    <p>Moreover, a Brussels newspaper prints the following: "In well-informed
                        circles it is asserted that owing to the ob tinacy of the king, war is
                        perhaps going to break out be­tween the Congolese and Egyptian troops. This
                        shall not be, and we here declare that Prince Albert does in no way share
                        the ideas of the king, his uncle, with regard to the exploita­tion of the
                        Congo. The matter is becoming extremely serious ; it is no good concealing
                        the fact, and hence it is wise to look ahead at once,”</p>
                    <p>The following expo-ition, from the Belgian point of view, of the situation
                        created by the presence of a Congo’ese post in a disputed dis­trict of the
                        Upper Nile region, gives the Bel­gian aspect of the question :</p>
                    <p>The alarmist despatches and articles in Lon­don papers on the subject of the
                        situation of affairs in the Bahr-el Ghazal Province have been read in
                        Belgium with surprise and regret, surprise at so great a storm being raised
                        about a matter that calls for calm and temperate dis­cussion, regret at the
                        British nation being so easily incited against a neighbouring and friend­ly
                        people. There is the Entente Cordiale with France, but, sorely the English
                        people are no going to forget the much older and unbroken Entente with the
                        races of Belgium. It would be easy to answer these sensational assertions by
                        stating that in face of the explicit orders given to the officers commanding
                        the posts in the Lado enclave and on the borders, a collision between
                        Belgian and British representatives is impossible, hot to do so would be to
                        invest them with same of the importance that their authors seek to impart to
                        them. The English public will prefer a single, substantial fact in
                        refutation of these truly absurd allegations. At the moment that they are
                        being asked to believe that a hostile encounter may occur in the
                        Bahr-el-Ghazal, the Congo authorities in Lado are. and have been, receiving
                        their guns and ammunition —in quite reasonable and moderate
                        quantities—across British territory by the Uganda Hail way. The British
                        authorities evidently do not share the appreheraions of the anti-Congo
                        agitators.</p>
                    <p>It is perfectly true that the Bahr-el-Ghazal question still awaits
                        settlement, but it will be a peaceful, and, Belgians do not doubt, an
                        amicable settlement. The means of such an arrangement are clearly provided
                        either by a voluntary reference by the two Governments to the Hague Tribunal
                        or by the putting into practice of Article XII. of the Berlin Act, which
                        specially provides for the mediation of one or morefriendly Powers, and,
                        failing mediation, for arbitration. The statement recently made to the
                        effect that “ King Leopold would accept no arbitration ” is absolutely
                        incorrect, a d the London Foreign Office is, of course, aware that
                        repeatedly since the Bahr-el-Ghazal ques¬tion was first raised in October.
                        1898, his Majesty hag proposed that the matter should be sat mitted to
                        either the Hague Court or to arbitration. It is the British not the Congo
                        Government that “ would accept no arbitra¬tion." If the reader wishes for
                        specific autho¬rity for this statement he will find it in the Congo State’s
                        reply of the 17th of September, 1903, to hia Majesty’s Government’s despatch
                        of the 8th of August of the same year. The following extract from that
                        document is relevant to the point:</p>
                    <p>“ The Government of the State has not ceased for its part to extol
                        arbitration fir inter­national disagreements which admitted of its
                        application. For instance, it would be glad to see the divergencies of view
                        that have arisen about the lease of the territories of the Bahr-el- Ghazal
                        submitted to arbitration.”</p>
                    <p>It seems tons in Belgium that the incidents of the last two years and a half
                        have established the wisdom of that view, and the hope is strongly felt that
                        at last the two Governments will come to some agreement for the settlement
                        of a dispute that has been left too long neglect­ed or, at all events,
                        without a solution. It is not by journalistic polemics that this important
                        matter is to be arranged, and, therefore, I studiously avoid entering upon
                        the controversial side of the question, but by reference to a
                        properly-constituted tribunal or to sd arbitrator Tally invested with the
                        authority to which both Bides will bow. There is, indeed, one other
                        practical alternative, which is, that the British and Congo Governments
                        should come to terms, but this solution is for the present dubious.</p>

                    <head>CAIRO'S GEOLOGICAL MUSEUM</head>
                    <p>One of the results of the development of activity in the Survey Department of
                        recent years, has been the establishment of a geologi­cal museum at Cairo,
                        the catalogue of which, compiled by Mr. W. F Hume, D Sc., A.R.S.M.. F.G.S.,
                        has just been published by the National Printing Department. The Geological
                        Museum, which was opened to public inspection on December 1st, 1901, has
                        been founded with the object of preserving permanent records of the
                        geological products of Egypt in relation to their (1) economic and practical
                        use ;(2) the nature of the minerals and rocks ; (3) the past life- record of
                        Egypt. Bearing this classification in mind, the rooms devoted respectively
                        to these aims are as follows : east room, ground floor, Economic Gallery ;
                        east room, upper floor, Stratigraphical Gallery ; central room, upper floor,
                        Palaeontological Gallery; west room, upper floor, Petrographical Gallery.
                        The west room, ground floor, is at present used as a storage and work room,
                        a curator’s room and laboratory completing the museum. Room 1 is mainly
                        devoted to the building stones, records of un­derground structure obtained
                        in boring opera­tions, days used in pottery, salts of economic value and
                        rocks associated with minerals of value. Room 2 contains a large collection
                        of the invertebrate fossils arranged according to rela­tive age. Room 3
                        should be specially visited, as it contains unique vertebrate remains from
                        the Fayoum. Room 4 contains the mineral and rock collections. The Museum is
                        open from 1st October to 30th April, 8 30 a.m. to 4 p.m May to 30 h
                        September, 8.0 a.m. to 2.0. p.m., except Fridays and Government
                        holidays.</p>
                    <p>In the central ball of the ground floor is the sale room for the Survey
                        Department cata­logues and maps, including the memoirs of the geological
                        survey. The remaining space in the central hall i3 devoted t) an exhibit of
                        fossil silicified trees from the Fayoum. and in the table-case is an
                        interesting series of flint imple­ments from the Fayoum and Nile Valley.</p>
                    <p>The growth of the museum demanded a catalogue and the present compilation
                        should be of great use to all who interest themselves in the geology of
                        Egypt and the Nile Valley</p>

                    <p>“The Sobat is a digression, but it is worth while to take a glance up this
                        wild river, for it courses through a great gems country. We recall a clear,
                        cool morning on that tortuous stream. From the upper deck there is a sudden
                        cry of fil, and up we swarm to see over the top of the long, thick grass
                        which covers the barks and spreads for miles on either hand. We gain the
                        planking and realise that it is something of a shock to get a first sight
                        and a close view of real wild elephants. Yet there can be no doubt about
                        them.</p>
                    <p>“Not a quarter of a mile away humping up above the sea of yellowish-grey, are
                        three ob­jects which look like three huge moving masses of back indiarubber.
                        But indiarubber never moved, never swung and lurched, as these great bodies
                        swing and lurch, never —yes, it is so ; a vast spreading ear was flapped
                        yonder, there goes a trunk sticking straight oat in front of what is a
                        tusker, for the sun had glinted on his ivory !</p>
                    <p>“There is something awesome about these mighty quadrupeds, so unconcerned, so
                        peace able, and yet endowed with strength sufficient to tear a stanchion
                        clean out of the steamer, sufficient to easily, smoothly, indifferently
                        force a way through a thick, tangled growth which exhausts a man in ten min
                        a tee, and swallows him up as though he were a pigmy.</p>
                    <p>“They feel closer to us, and we can see the white paddy birds fluttering
                        about them and perching on their backs, busy after the ticks which ding to
                        and suck at these great coarse, bristle-covered hides. How fast they travel,
                        heads to the wind, taking no notice of ns, lords of the prairie—for what
                        beast can hope to cope with such bulk, such ponderous weight, such terrible
                        tusks, and so marvellous an organ of prehension ?</p>

                    <p>MR. WALTER GREG.</p>
                    <p>The death has taken place, at Assouan, of Mr. Walter Greg, of Lee Hall,
                        Prestbury He was 'born at Bollington in 1851, and was admitted a solicitor
                        in 1875. He became a partner in the firm’ of Messrs. Cunliffe and Greg, of
                        London, in 1880 and bad been head of the firm since 1899. He was also a
                        notary public and a member of the Council of the Manchester Incorporated Law

                        he was also Under Sheriff for Cheshire in 1886 7, and again in 1889-90. Some
                        thirty years ago he was an active member of the Manchester Football Club,
                        and had played in international matches. He had taken a prominent part in
                        the introduction of the game of lacrosse into the Manchester district, and
                        in 1877 played for England against Scot­land. .In the neighbourhood of his

                    <p> THE OPENING UP OF THE HOLY LAND. </p>
                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette</p>
                    <p>Pear Sir,—Iu your issue of the 16th January appeared an article entitled “The
                        Opening up of the Holy Land,” This article has a curiously ambiguous
                        character. On one face of it it looks like one of those deceptive
                        advertisements that are occasionally presented under the guise of an article
                        in order to catch the reader’s eye that has come to torn away instinctively
                        from everything under the shape of an "ad,” so obtrusive has advertising
                        material become in these latter days. On the other face of it there is the
                        pose of the enthusiastic tourist. But whatever may be the real nature of the
                        article, certain statements and certain omissions in it cannot but provoke
                        the most reluctant criti­cism.</p>
                    <p>The author of the article under review states that the Hamburg-American Line
                        has its little steamer on the Sea of Galilee, while, he adds, from Semak on
                        the southern end of the lake the railway will be used for the journey to
                        Damascus. Although the writer is not exactly in a position to judge whether
                        these statements are correct or not, yet be has it from an unimpeachable
                        authority, whose statement gains: strength from the fact that he has very
                        recently been on the spot, that there is no steamer that plies on the waters
                        of the Sea of Galilee, while as regards travelling by rail from Semak to
                        Damascus, it is well-known that the Hedjaz. line from Deraa until that
                        station is not yet quite complete, as far as passenger traffic is concerned,
                        and although the Haiffa-Deraa branch has been inaugurated some time, this
                        has been done in anticipation to invest the event with the honour of the
                        Saltan’s anniversary, and it may, indeed, be a month before the journey from
                        Semak to Damascus by the Hedjaz Railway will be practicable. Indeed the
                        running of the trains from Semak to Haiffa is now very irre-gular. Only a
                        short time ago some passengers had tried the railway between Semak and
                        Da¬mascus and they were left, out at some small halts east of the Jordan,
                        and had to pass the night in hats wherein they suffered consider* able
                        hardships from cold and vermin.</p>
                    <p>There are unmistakable signs in the article showing that if the author
                        thereof is not di­rectly inspired by the Hamburg-American Line, be draws at
                        least inspiration from that group of German patriots who under imperial
                        encouragement are flaunting the idea of Germany’s overruling greatness and
                        its conquering in­fluence especially in Turkey. And as every attempt on the
                        part of Germany at the assertion of its influence abroad has in moat oases
                        been curiously associated with a disparag­ing attack on British rights and
                        feelings, the omissions in the article find an explanation. The fact is too
                        well-known to need more than mere mention, that the pioneer of tourist
                        or­ganisation in Syria and Palestine is the world- renowned firm of Thos.
                        Cook &amp; Son. The writer, be it said from now, has not the least
                        connection with or interest in that firm, but it seems to him, as it must
                        seem to every right- minded person, so unfair, not to say ungrateful, that
                        in writing about the mode of travelling and its development in the Holy
                        Land, a firm that has played the most prominent idle there­in should be so
                        slightingly overlooked. The author of the article goes indeed so far as to
                        attribute things achieved with the assistance of Thos. Cook &amp; Son. to
                        the Hamburg-American Line, when he says that the hotel at Tiberias has been
                        modernized and enlarged by the help of the Hamburg-American Line. It is
                        indeed doubtful whether such a respectable steamship company would care to
                        S9e persons attributing to it achievements that are not its own.</p>
                    <p>The author could have rejoiced just as glee­fully over the initial attempts
                        of the Hamburg- American Line to improve the mode of travelling in the Holy
                        Laud, without overrat­ing so much their importance as to seek to throw even
                        the giant figure of Cook in utter darkness. Is not the Hamburg-American Line
                        indebted in a way to the initiative of Cook, that has been the chief and we
                        may say the first factor in the development of tourism that forms such an
                        important item in the revenue of first class steamship companies like the
                        Hamburg-American Line? Cook may have been guided by no altruistic feelings
                        and humanitari­an motives when he conceived and carried out his magnificent
                        programmes of travel, bat the actual result is there to prove that the good
                        that he has, intentionally or not, caused to the land is incalculable. One
                        may without exagger­ation say that Cook has been one of the that he has,
                        intentionally or not, caused to the land is incalculable. One may without
                        exagger­ation say that Cook has been one of the strongest factors in the
                        introduction of ci­vilization or — to attenuate the phrase — of civilised
                        modes of life and the accompaniment of a certain measure of prosperity. One
                        has but to travel in Syria and in those parts not includ­ed in Cook’s
                        tourist programmes to see the enor­mous difference, not only in the
                        conditions of travel between those parts that are trodden and those that are
                        not trodden by Cook, but also in the general condition of the people and the
                        country.</p>
                    <p>I cannot close these lines without commenting upon the patronising manner in
                        which Germans of imperialist tendencies look upon and speak of Turkey. They
                        seem to regard it already a9 their heritage or on the highway to such a
                        consummation under the aegis of the Kaiser. The author of the article
                        naively de­clares that a considerable improvement in the means of transport
                        in Palestine and Syria has been noticeable since the trip of the German
                        Emperor to Jerusalem in 1898 and that the continued interest he still shows
                        in their advance has induced the Turkish authorities to remove some of the
                        more objectionable inconveniences, and to urge forward the construc­tion of
                        the railways that had been so long projected. The whole thing, especially to
                        a man living in Turkey, is so amusing.—I am, etc.</p>

                    <p>This match, which was played on Thursday, was arranged at short notice, hot
                        nevertheless resulted in a very good game. The combination of the home team
                        told from the start, the forward being well supported by Menzies at
                        centre-half. The visitors, on the other hand, being out of practice, did not
                        settle down to the game at once, with the result that the B.T.C. forwards
                        got away, and from a centre by Mansell on the Tight wing, Harrison scored
                        the first goal. Shortly afterwards Mansell added two more for the homesters.
                        The visitors then got through with a combined rash, bat the goal was
                        disallowed for offside. After half tame the visitors were getting together
                        more, hot the home defence proved equal to the occasion. The home forwards
                        then got to work again, and Harrison scored twice in quick succession. The
                        visitors made several rashes and after game good passing, Marks scored with
                        a hard shot. From the bully with another dash .Marks notched a second point
                        for the visitors just before time. This left the E.T.C. winners by five
                        goals to two. The E.T.C. were represented by : goal, Massey ; backs,
                        Battiseom.be and Templeman ; halves, Bentley, Menses, and Evans forwards,
                        Mansell, Norman, Harrison, Chivers, and Harris.</p>

                        <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                        <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers
                            the accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by
                            which they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange
                            them as accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that
                            none of them are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home
                            there are several things to be considered. To begin with there is the
                            difference in climate between Egypt and the various points at which you
                            may arrive in Europe.</p>
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                            January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so
                            warm as Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more
                            uniformly warm than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt
                            far too early in the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is
                            perfect. The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                        <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent
                            at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on
                            each of the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of
                            Europe.</p>
                        <cb n="3"/>
                        <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                        <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth,
                            Southhampton, London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones
                            are as follows:—</p>

                        <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                            Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines
                            are also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by
                            travellers to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to
                            Alexandria, without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made
                            without change in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                        <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                            Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German
                            Levant line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                        <cb n="5"/>
                        <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by
                            P.&amp;O. Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd
                            Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
                        <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little
                            luggage is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several
                            good and responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed
                            charge to deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                        <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by
                            the fast Mail Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to Brindisi. One of these
                            leaves port Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the
                            Indian <cb n="6"/>mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                        <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                            attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats"
                            having been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to
                            Brindisi. If you are going straight through to England you will find the
                            train waiting at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without

                        <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers
                            which leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to
                            TAORMENA, one of the most charming and popular places on the island.
                            Giardini is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina
                            is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the town is
                            much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                            restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent
                            of Etna and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and
                            Saracenic remains that are found all over the island, are an endless
                            sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a
                            Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by
                            the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be
                            seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                            about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                            delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city.
                            The Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of
                            S. Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The
                            Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also
                            worth a visit.</p>

                        <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every
                            Wednesday during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3
                            days.</p>
                        <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino
                            Co.’s steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave
                            it without wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely
                            places on its bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that
                            takes you to Sorrento [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                        <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can
                            will devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and
                            interesting portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are
                            too well-known to need comment here.</p>
                        <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five
                            hours brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent
                            admiring the City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence
                            itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the
                            local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is
                            the most attractive and fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the
                            Viale dei Colli, one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago,
                            goes winding up through the hills a distance of four miles. The most
                            delightful excursion outside Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its
                            Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is made first by ordinary
                            train from Florence to St. Ellero, thence by cog-wheel railway to
                            Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                            striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                        <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a
                            fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night
                            should if possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile
                            at sunset.</p>
                        <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near
                            Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient
                            half-way house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable
                            and the air and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy,
                            with the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European
                            cities and a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and
                            deliciously cool breezes from the surrounding mountains and the
                            Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                        <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                            gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings,
                            are a constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn
                            in Genoa. Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches
                            containing exquisite marble columns and historical paintings, and the
                            incomparable Campo Santo filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                        <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                        <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                            Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful
                            windows illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and
                            the monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                        <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                            SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal
                            springs, change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are
                            at Salsomaggiore.</p>

                        <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the
                            mostdelightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence
                            of vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart,
                            carriage or bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at
                            every turn. The approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of
                            any other sea port. The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born
                            of the sea, no hills behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of
                            Campaniles appear above the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering
                            town rises like a fairy mirage out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                        <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                            lakes.</p>
                        <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in
                            one-and-a-quarter hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                        <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is
                            very beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                            enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo,
                            Cadenabbia, and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio
                            opposite. The walk from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio
                            is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake
                            Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in
                            two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                            on the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M.

                            is an excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated
                            above the town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings,
                            “Entombment," by Ciseri, and ‘Tho Flight into Egypt,” by Bramantion.</p>

                            Pilatus, Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other
                            excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing
                            scenery on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to

                            from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps is grand; extending from
