                    <head>JUDGES UNDER JUDGMENT</head>
                    <p>The unseating of a member of Parliament must, in most circumstances, be
                        regarded as regrettable, being, as it generally is, the consequence of an
                        infringement of our boasted purity of elections. The unseating of
                            <persName>Mr. Agar Robartes</persName>, the Liberal member for Bodmin,
                        is not nearly so serious a matter, however, as in the remarks made by
                            <persName>Mr. Justice Grantham</persName> in delivering judgment, says
                        the "Evening Standard and St. James Gazette"</p>
                    <p>With <persName>Mr. Justice Grantham</persName> in his present position we
                        have great sympathy. A charge of the greatest gravest gravity - to use his
                        own words - is hanging over his head. He is to be accused by <persName>Mr.
                            Swift MacNeil</persName> in the House of Commons of a dereliction of
                        duty so gross that, if the charge were substantiated, he could hardly
                        affront his own honour by remaining on the Bench. The Government have not
                        noly granted a day for <persName>Mr. MacNeill</persName>'s motion of
                        censure, but have promised to name that day as soon as possible. In such
                        circumstances we can hardly hope that <persName>Mr. MacNeill</persName> will
                        find himself in a minority of one. Doubtless he will find supporters in the
                        lobby, as he has found them in the House supporters who, looking at all
                        things from a party standpoint, are unable to conceive that a judge can keep
                        an impartial mind under political strain. But we trust and believe that a
                        majority of the House will be assured of <persName>Mr. Justice
                            Grantham</persName>'s honesty as we are ourselves; and it must be
                        remembered that when the question has been cleared of its official trappings
                        it is his honesty, not his judgment, which is attacked.</p>
                    <p>Before now we ourselves (continues our contemporary), while never doubting
                        his high sincerity, have had occasion to attack <persName>Mr. Justic
                            Grantham</persName>'s judgment. It has been subject, like that of other
                        judges, to lapses, and the effect of comparatively small errors has been
                        emphasised by <persName>Mr. Justice Grantham</persName>'s incurable habit of
                        "speaking out."</p>
                    <p>The faculty of saying what he thinks bluntly and straightforwardly is often
                        most useful to a judge, but it must be used very carefully if it is not to
                        land the possessor in difficulty. Mr. Justice Grantham spoke out last week
                        at a time when he would have done far better to keep his mouth closed. He
                        had, he declared in a voice broken by emotion, been unfairly treated by the
                        Government. The charge of partisanship was absolutely without foundtion. The
                        time had arrived which was foreshadowed by the late <persName>Chief Justice
                            Cockburn</persName>, when bitter party politicians would abuse judges
                        for not giving judgment in accordance with their political wishes. And so
                        on, ad nauseam.</p>
                    <p><persName>Mr. Justice Lawrence</persName>, who also has the facult of
                        speaking out but uses it with more discretion, was sorry that his brother
                        Grantham had made any allusion to the charge against him. For himself, he
                        had his own conscience to consider, not that of political parties, and for
                        any abuse that might be lavished on him he did not care.</p>
                    <p>It can scarcely be doubted which is the more correct attitue for a judge to
                        assume. He has his own conscience to consider, and, so long as he satisfies
                        that, he must not care for outside criticism.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, the dignity of the Bench will be imperilled if its occupants should
                        follow the precedent of <persName>Mr. Justice Grantham</persName> and begin,
                        in season and out of season, to defend themselves against their crtics. At
                        present they enjoy a wonderful immunity from public censure. The Bar may
                        have its private opinion of the fitness of certain judges for their high
                        office. The members of the Bar may be disposed to think - they would not be
                        mortal if they refrained - that the judge has not grasped their point of
                        view. but so far as the great public is concerned the opinion held of the
                        Bench is so firm that crticism may be said to be almost non-existent. We all
                        believe the judges try to do their duty, and recognising that they are but
                        men, we are not inclined to call them to judgment for their every
                        action.</p>
                    <p>To this happy state of things the judges themselves have contributed by a
                        fine aptitude for keeping silence. It is largely because they do not invite
                        criticism that they rarely suffer it. Secure in their own integrity, they
                        impose confidence on the public mind. How long will this implicit confidence
                        continue if the example of <persName>Mr. Justice Grantham</persName> be
                        followed? We could give it no extended lease on such conditions. A hankering
                        for self-defence, a yielding to the natural but resistible temptation of
                        speaking out on behalf of their own reputation, is calculated to do more
                        harm to the dignity of the Bench than many years' indulgence in the
                        offensive and futile practice of squandering feable jokes. The judge who
                        jokes may save himself. He who is eternally on the defensive is doomed to
                        lose half his strength.</p>
                    <p>Let us hope <persName>Mr. Justice Grantham</persName> will follow the advice
                        he has given to many prisoners, and not do it again. We trust there is no
                        danger of his judicial brethren following in his footsteps, or of the House
                        of Commons failing to let him see that his honour and reputation are safe in
                        the hands of a body of English gentlemen.</p>

                    <p><persName>Mr. H.J.L. Beadnell</persName>, the Corporation of Western Egypt's
                        manager in the Oases, in a note on land in Northern Kharga, says: The
                        cultivable areas comprise alluvial covered tracts of two distinct qualities:
                        (1) first class heavy loam land; (2) lighter sandy land. Where these have
                        been broken up and cultivated before - even so far back as Roman times -
                        excellent crops can be raised the first year. A field of wheat raised on the
                        corporation's property at El Der during the past winter was grown on soil
                        which had lain fallow for at least one thousand five hundred years, and
                        which was, up to the time of sowing, bare desert, absolutely devoid of
                        vegetation of any kind. No manure whatever was used, owing to lack of
                        transport at the time. The ground on which this crow was raised is typical
                        of much of the land in this area, and is in no way a selected plot. The area
                        - comprising about 4000 acres - on which boring operations are now being
                        carried out is, for the most part, covered with a thick deposit of alluvial
                        sandy clay or loam, overlying porous sandstones; the conditions are, in
                        fact, ideal for agriculture. The greater part of these lands has never
                        before been under cultivation, and, being dry, hard and lacking in humus,
                        will probably require on an average three years cultivation to bring them
                        into first-rate condition. "Our first season's operations," <persName>Mr.
                            Beadnell</persName> goes on to say, "show however, that good crops can
                        be raised even from the first sowing, if the land is dressed with only a
                        very moderate amount of farmyard manure. I have no hesitation in saying
                        that, provided with a sufficient water supply for irrigation, these lands
                        will after two or three years cultivation, grow crops of rice, barley,
                        wheat, and probably cotton, equal to any in Egypt and, with facilities for
                        the transport of produce by railway to the Nile Valley, should be easily
                        disposed of at remunerative figures. Land of similar quality in the Nile
                        Valley is worth at the present time upwards of £70 an acre, and prices seem
                        likely to rise still higher. There is every reason to suppose, therefore,
                        that when the time comes for selling it will be easy to dispose of our best
                        class of land at between £30 and £40 an acre, and that of lighter quality at
                        about half that figure. The results obtained during the past year have
                        confirmed my original opinion of the potential value of the lands of
                        Norhtern Kharga from an agricultural point of view. I may mention, also,
                        that a well known Anglo-Egyptian, who visited the Oasis last January,
                        informed me that our first crops were much better than those he had obtained
                        after three years' cultivation on lands similarly reclaimed in the Fayoum;
                        that land he disposed of at £30 an acre and over, and it is now worth
                        probably double that figure." </p>

                        will be strictly applied in the case of visitors to the University.</p>
                    <p>Every visitor must be furnished with a permit of entry which will be viséed
                        at the office of a special official appointed to supervise all visits. A
                        special entrance will be set apart for visitors, who will be accompanied by
                        persons selected by the officials in charge and will not be permitted to
                        visit the University on Fridays. On all other days of the week visits will
                        be permitted between 9 a.m. and noon and between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. Cameras
                        and sketchboards are strictly forbidden.</p>

                        Moslems of the University have a strong aversion, based on Mohamed's
                        prohibition of the representation of living beings, to being photograhped or
                        sketched by chance visitors, especially by ladies, and we consider that
                        their conscientious objections deserve the resepct of members of another
                        faith.</p>

                    <head>BISHOP POTTER ON EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>It will be remembered that Bishop Potter, at the recent dinner of the Pilgrim
                        Society in London, made the statement that "in the streets of Cairo the
                        American Eagle held its tail between its legs."</p>
                    <p>Asked by an American reporter what he meant by that, he replied:</p>
                    <p>"I meant that the only time I ever saw our flag there was when it was used on
                        posters in the street for advertising purposes."</p>
                    <p>Bishop and Mrs. Potter spent the winter in Egypt and they went as far up the
                        Nile as the First Cataract. He said that in Nubia he had an opportunity to
                        study the negro on his native heath. He said that in many of them mental
                        progress never got beyond a certain point, but that there were others who
                        were capable of great development intellectually.</p>
                    <p>"I found a great many changes on the face of Egypt since I visited that
                        country 20 years ago," said the bishop, "but no change in the minds of the
                        people. Lord Cromer said to me : 'You can change the face of the land by
                        railroads and canals and irrigation, and you can lift physical conditions by
                        better government, but you cannot change the mind of the Oriental in a
                        quarter of a century. He will still think orientally.' This is a basic fact
                        which we have to recognize in all our dealings with the Orientals."</p>

                    <dateline><placeName>Tantah</placeName>, Thursday.</dateline>
                    <p>I have spent the greater part of today at the village of Denishwai, where, it
                        was my lot to witness the carrying out of the death sentences passed on the
                        four leaders of the attack on British officers and the flogging of seven
                        others. As you know, eight of the prisoners were sentenced to fifty lashes,
                        but it will be remembered that in my letter of yesterday I mentioned that
                            <persName>Said Suleiman Kheiralla</persName> (No. 15) had been seized
                        with an epileptic fit, and it was certified by <persName>Dr.
                            Nolan</persName> that the man was medically unfit to stand corporal
                        punishment.</p>
                    <p>Arriving at Batanoun shortly before ten o'clock I went along the road which
                        the officers concerned had traversed, but this time the usually quiet road
                        was thronged with those who were on their way to see the sentences carried
                        out. The distance is about eight miles and at frequent intervals one met
                        ghaffirs, not asleep or conversing with the fellaheen, as is their wont, but
                        erect and alert, saluting the officials who passed.</p>
                    <p>After crossing the Bagourieh Canal in a ferry I came across the troops who
                        were to escort the prisoners to Denishwai later in the day. Next, Sersina
                        was passed and the police outpost of Shohoda, full of shawishes charged with
                        guarding those who were about to receive their sentences. This villagers
                        appeared strangely inactive and curious, while groups of women were
                        collected to watch those on their way to Denishwai passing by. Further along
                        the road crowds were sheltering under the trees, talking no doubt of this
                        dreadful affair and its consequences, and staring at the passers by with
                        great interest. The nearer one drew to Denishwai, the greater the numbers of
                        onlookers, police, and ghaffirs.</p>
                    <p>Presently, a black wooden scaffolding was sighted, the village of Denishwai
                        was plainly discernible, and we knew that we were reaching the scene of the
                        attack Fellaheen were collected in immense groups at some distance from the
                        scaffolding and mounted police were riding round every now and then to keep
                        them away. But, these crowds were not formed by the villagers of Denishwai
                        but by the hundreds who had collected from many parts of Menoufieh, for the
                        former were confined within the bounds of the village by a cordon of
                        police.</p>
                    <p>The gallows and the stand to which those about to be flogged were to be tied
                        were within a large area which was roped round. They were almost on the very
                        scene of the attack made on the party of officers on the 13th inst. Outside
                        this area was the tent for the prisoners and another for the preparation of
                        the four dead bodies for burial. <persName>Mr. Machell</persName> was on the
                        scene with <persName>Mahmoud Pacha Shoucri</persName>, Moudir of Menoufieh,
                        and <persName>Mr. Moberley</persName> was directing the erection of the
                        gallows and other details.</p>
                    <p>At one o'clock the prisoners arrived accompanied by police and the British
                        troops. Chained, handcuffed, and bound to each other by connecting anklets,
                        the four who were sentenced to death were seated on a cart preceded by
                        mounted police with Egyptian foot police on either side, and next came the
                        cart bearinig the seven who were about to be flogged, while behind were
                        several detachments of mounted British troops. The prisoners were escorted
                        to the tent by Egyptian police, and the British troops formed a square round
                        the area in which the punishment were to be given.</p>
                    <p>At half past one <persName>Hassan Ali Mahfouz</persName> was summoned and was
                        brought before the Moudir by an escort of police. His sentence was read out
                        and he was bade to say his final prayer, whereupon he exclaimed in a loud
                        voice. "There is but one God and Mohamed is his prophet;" he was then
                        pinioned and taken to the scaffold. Before the noose was tigtened round his
                        neck he exclaimed, "May God ruin the houses of <persName>Mohamed
                            Shedli</persName> (son of the omdeh), <persName>Mohamed Omar</persName>,
                        and <persName>Ahmed Said</persName>," all of whom had given evidence against
                        him. the trap door was opened, and the body fell through and hung until
                            <persName>Ibrahim Hassan Assissi</persName> and <persName>Mohamed
                            Mustapha Mahfouz</persName> had been flogged with fifty lashes previous
                        to receiving one year's imprisonment. The flogging was received by all the
                        seven prisoners with loud goans, and so severe was it, that
                            <persName>Ibrahim Hassan Assissi</persName> exclaimed after three or
                        four lashes that he would rather be hanged than flogged.</p>
                    <p>In such a manner the sentences were carried out; one man was hanged and left
                        with his neck in the noose until two had been flogged, and then the next of
                        the condemned suffered the extreme penalty. Every now and then a loud wail
                        from the women came from the village, but save for this all was strangely
                        quiet. It must be said that the four prisoners went to the scaffold
                        expressing faith in their God and the scaffold expressing faith in their God
                        and [NR] offered the slightest resistance. The dreadful imprecation uttered
                        by <persName>Hassan Mahfouz</persName> was the only remarkable
                        occurrence.</p>
                    <p>A section of the native Press is loud in its attacks on <persName>Ibrahim Bey
                            Helbawi</persName>, whom it accuses of a violent bias against the
                        fellaheen brought up for trial in the Denishwai case. Why the Public
                        Prosecutor should be criticised for having done his best for the
                        prosecution, and for having made a very eloquent speech demanding the
                        infliction of severe punishment on the guilty parties, we cannot understand.
                        Counsel for the prosecution is entitled, and indeed bound, to make the very
                        best of his case. Perhaps the fact that <persName>Ibrahim Bey
                            Helbawi</persName> is of fellah origin and has in the past shown
                        sympathy with part of the Nationalist programme has encouraged his critics
                        to rebuke him for refusing to subordinate his conscience to his political
                        and racial leanings.</p>

                        Final Examination of the College and serve satisfactorily for one year on
                        probation as teachers under the Ministry of Education will receive a Diploma
                        in Teaching, which will be recognised by Government in its regulations
                        concerning pay and appointments as equivalent to the Diplomas of the other
                        Higher Colleges.</p>
                    <p>Subject to satisfactory work and conduct, each student of the Class of the
                        First Year in the College will receive a student's allowance of L.E. 3 per
                        mensem, and each student of the Class of the Second Year a student's
                        allowance of L.E. 4 per mensem.</p>
                    <p>The Ministry of Education hopes through the Course of Training which is about
                        to be instituted to provide teachers qualified for appointment in Secondary
                        as well as Primary Schools. With this object in view, every year at least
                        two of teh students who show most promise of developing into successful
                        Headmasters and Secondary Teachers will be selected, subject to medical
                        fitness, to continue their education and training, at the entire cost of
                        Government, for a further period of two or three years in one of the best
                        Training Colleges in England. On their return to Egypt, such students will
                        be appointed on the permanent staff of the Ministry of Education, at an
                        initial salary of L.E. 12 per mensem (Grade L.E. 12-16), and will
                        subsequently receive preferential consideration in promotion to a higher
                        rate of pay and in appointments as Headmaster, Secondary Teacher, etc.</p>
                    <p>The stuents who are not sent by Government to England for supplementary
                        training on passing the Final Examination will be forthwith appointed as
                        teachers on probation on the permanent staff of the Ministry of Education.
                        During their year's service on probation, which is necessary to qualify for
                        the Diploma, they will receive a provisional salary of L.E. 7 per mensem. On
                        obtaining the Diploma, if accepted by the Medical Board, they will be
                        confirmed in their appointment under Government and placed in the grade of
                        L.E. 12-16, at an initial salary of L.E. 12 per mensem. Students who have
                        obtained the Diploma in Teaching will be considered eligible for
                        appointments as Headmaster, etc., even although owing to medical or other
                        reasaons they have not been sent by Government to England to supplement
                        their training.</p>
                    <p>As regards, subsequent professional prospects, it may be stated that the
                        Headmastership of a Government Primary School at present generally carries
                        with it a salary of L.E. 24-32 per mensem. Headmasters in Government
                        Secondary Schools are paid at the rate of L.E. 600-800 per annum. In several
                        both of the Primary and the Secondary Schools free residential quarters for
                        the Headmaster are further provided. A number of grades of L.E. 16-20 have
                        also been established for teachers in Primary Schools. Other opportunities
                        of promotion are under consideration.</p>
                    <p>It may therefore be stated that the teaching profession, besides being highly
                        honourable as contributing in an important degree to the development and
                        progress of the country, now offers to the earnest Egyptian student and
                        worker a remunerative and satisfactory career. The course of studey in the
                        Khedivial Training College can therefore be recommended with confidence.</p>
                    <p>Applicants for admission to the College must be of Egyptian nationality and
                        must have obtained the Secondary Education Certificiate with English as the
                        principal language during the last four years. Such candidates as have not
                        been in attendance at a Government School during the past school year must
                        further produce a certificate of good character from some reliable person to
                        whom they are personally known.</p>

                    <head>MORE INTRIGUES AT STAMBOUL.</head>
                    <p>From a remarkable message sent from Constantinople by a correspondent of the
                        "Telegraph" it appears that the Sultan's advisers who were responsible for
                        the Tabah affair are now exercising their influence in other directions in
                        support of the pan-Islamic movement.</p>
                    <p>These Arab Shaikhs, who, according to the correspondent, were entirely to
                        blame for the recent frontier trouble, and not Izzet Pacha, represent tribes
                        scattered about North Africa, and are always men of high religious standing.
                        The result is that they are always well received at the Palace, and the
                        Sultan, as Caliph, must pay some attention to their arguments. What their
                        object is it is not quite clear, but it is apparently working in connection
                        with the pan-Islamic movement, and for that reason alone is bound to get
                        support from the Sultan. Some people who have tried to get at the bottom of
                        the matter believe that it is really and truly the outcome of a coalition of
                        the Arab tribes; to secure the Sultan's help, by using the pan-Islamic
                        movement as an instrument, to bring about quarrels between the Powers at
                        present interested in North Africa, and, in the resulting confusion, to set
                        up an Arab State or confederacy, with a Caliph of their own. If this is
                        true, it is plain that the first thing to happen would be that the SUltan
                        would be brought into conflict with the Powers, and would finally get the
                        worst of it. In the second place, once the Arab State was founded, their
                        first objective would be supported by the already rebellious tribes. Of
                        course, it is most unlikely that they would ever come to that point, and
                        only could do so in the event of their having succeeded in bringing about an
                        open rupture between some of the European Powers.</p>
                    <p>I have all along, spoken of the Sultan, because all these matters are worked
                        direct from the Palace, the Porte being left entirely in ignorance until a
                        difficulty arises, and then everything is laid on the shoulders of the
                        Porte, which has to find some means of arranging the matter.</p>
                    <p>This Arab party has no connection with the Senoussi, who keep themsevles
                        apart from all others, and regard the Turks as heretics, and whose chief
                        will never receive the Sultan's envoys, always moving off into the Desert
                        when they appear - in fact, showing very plainly that they will have "no
                        truck" with him at any price. The sheikhs argument with the Sultan are that
                        they are simply acting in a defensive manner, to prevent the Empire from
                        being encroached upon. They only urge the Sultan to occupy certain places,
                        not with a view to the conquest of new territory, but because they are now
                        unoccupied, and in order to prevent them being occupied by others. Thus the
                        Sultan's action would only tend to preserve the status quo. With these wily
                        arguments they have persuaded the Sultan to order expeditions into the
                        hinterland of Tripoli, with the object of occupying several different
                        places. They also intend making another attempt to advnace in the direction
                        of Soloum, which will bring them again into conflict with the English and
                        Egyptians. The other places mentioned are Bilma and Moa, in the district of
                        Kanem, and Barrowa and Jalo, S. of Barce. These will bring them into
                        conflict with the French, who claim that they come under their sphere of
                        influence. I believe they are not actually occupied by the French, but once
                        or twice a year they are visited by dromedary patrolling parties to show the
                        flag. Anyhow, the situation is interesting, and the developments require
                        careful watching. Unfortunately, everything is kept so secret that it is
                        impossible to obtain more than the barest outline. The installation of
                        wireless telegraphy between Tripoli and Asia Minor is most significant, as
                        now direct communication can be made between Constantinople and Tripoli.</p>

                    <p>Played on Wednesdy on the A.C.C. ground. The scratch XI. won the toss and
                        after two wickets had fallen quickly R.B. Maclean hit up 37. Macaulay and
                        Graves, both of whom had a little luck to start with, then added a hundred,
                        Macaulay being sixth out for a very freely hit 89, which included two fives
                        and sixteen fours. Dawson and Dealtry hit freely and the innings closed for
                        253. Blythman and Henley bowled well on the whole. The E.T.C. XI started
                        badly, losing Harrison at 5, but with three down for 39, Henley and Cheesman
                        came to the rescue and scoring very freely, "remained" undefeated till
                        stumps were drawn. Cheesman had some luck, but his innings was very
                        creditable, and Henly, batting far more freely than usual, played very
                        attractive cricket.</p>

                    <head>LA POSTE DU CAIRE</head>
                    <p>D'un de nos confrères du Caire.</p>
                    <p>Le service le plus mal fait du pavs et dont tout le monde ne cesse de se
                        plaindre, c'est bien celui de la poste. Tous mes collegues, ont présenté
                        vainement la défense de la population contre les procédés déploables de
                        cette administration. A leurs protestations, je joins la mienne aujourd'hui,
                        malgré la triste certitude que je ressens, de precher... dans le désert.</p>
                    <p>Il n'est pire sourd que celui qui ne veut entendre. ne trouvez-vous pas, amis
                        lecteurs, que ca proverbe a'applique avec justesse à nos pouvoirs publics
                        que semblent se désintéresser complètement de toutes nos recriminations
                        contre la poste?</p>
                    <p>Il serait temps enfin de faire cesser des abus dont la population est plus
                        que lasse et que la presse a toujours vigoureusement b'âmés.</p>
                    <p>Nos intérêts les plus sérieux sont compromis, nos affaires manquées, nos
                        liens sociaux distendus, nos familles déunies, mille antres conséquences
                        désastreuses résultent souvent de l'incurie de la poste. Je ne crois pas que
                        nulle part au monde, elle suit aussi mal faite qu'au Caire. Tous les jours,
                        il a'y passe de faits inouis du genre de celui que je vais vous citer et
                        dont je connais personnellement le témoin oculaire:</p>
                    <p>Quelqu'un va faire recommander une lettre pour un grand port de l'Afrique du
                        Sud, port achiconnu, car les grands paquebots Marseille Australie y font
                        escale.</p>
                    <p>Ce port u'ayant pas d'homonyme, l'expéditeur avait supposé que son seul mom
                        suffrsait sur l'enveloppe avec la mention "Via Aden". Un élève de sixième en
                        France aurait compris la chose, mais le petits employé de notre capitale dit
                        su Monsieur ahuri: Oui, je sais c'est pour l'Allemagne!!! Quand et comment,
                        pourra t'on faire comprende, aux employés de la poste que les
                        correspondances "via Aden" doivent être expédiées au Sud par Suez et celles
                        via Alexandrie au Nord?</p>
                    <p>Je connais des personnes que sont allees se plaindre du retard de leurs
                        lettres pour le Su-Africain a qui de droit, mais ce "qui de droit" n'a pas
                        empeche que leurs corrspondances adressees au Cap on a Natal ne continuent a
                        etre expediees d'abord en Europe, d'ou elles sont ensuite re expediees; ce
                        qui fait qu'une lettre pour Mozambique ou Madagascar n'y parvient qu'apres
                        un voyage de deux mois. C'est incroyable, mais reel.</p>
                    <p>Les postes constituent en Egypte une source precieuse de revenus pour l'Etat,
                        la plus riche de toutes peut etre et ses recettes ont augmente en
                        remarquable proportion, ces dernieres aunees. Cependant cette administration
                        paye si peu, ou plutot si mal, ses employes, quil serait exagere de
                        pretendre rencontrer parmi eux des connaissances georgraphiques assez
                        etendues.</p>
                    <p>Mais ce n'est pas l'ignorance du personnel de notre poste qui adresse en
                        Chine les plis a destination du Chili, qui cause le pire de nos ennuis.
                        Oersonne n'a le droit de se plaindre du retard des lettres, si elles
                        finissent tout de meme par arriver.</p>
                    <p>Ce qui mecontente tout le monde, ce sont les lettres qui n'arrivent jamais a
                        l'instar de ces rayons partis d'astres si eloignes qui'ils n'atteindront
                        jamais notre astre terrestre. Voila l'enigme que nous refusons d'admettre
                        parce qu'inexplicable.</p>
                    <p>Comment comprendre en effet, qu'une missive expediee du Caire au Caire ne
                        parvienne jamais a son destinataire et que tel cas se reproduise tous les
                        jours? Je ne parlerai pas des cartes postales qui tentent tout
                        naturelleement les amateurs collectionneurs; une belle carte est
                        inevitablement destinee a etre egaree, mais les lettres la correspondance
                        serieuse, indispensable; ce depot sacre que nous conflions au service des
                        Postes avec notre fortune, notre tranquillite l'honneur de nos familles,
                        notre existence meme, quelles mesures prend cette administration pour nous
                        en assureer la propriete et la secret?</p>
                    <p>N'est ce pas inadmissible que ce service continue a waiter le public d'une
                        maniere aussi indecente? La patience a des bornes et il y a longtemps que la
                        notre est a bout. Si un commissionnaire a qui l'on confiait une lettre pour
                        une maison quelconque de la vile avec paiement de sa course, ne remplissait
                        pas fidelement sa mission, on le ferait arreter et condamner probablement,
                        reprimander a coup sur.</p>
                    <p>La Poste seule a doncile droit draconien de faire disparaitre les
                        correspondances qui lui sont confiees?</p>
                    <p>Poser la qustion, c'est la resoudre.</p>

                    <p>Hier, an Stock Exchange, le Consolidé anglais a baissé de non moins de 5/8 de

                    <p>Ici, le marché des valeurs a été, aujourd'hui, moins animé, moins actif
                        qu’hier. Toutefois, les dispositions ne sont pas mauvaises, bien que la

                    <p>Nous détachons d’une lettre de Londres, en date du 19 Juin, les lignes
                        suivantes concernant la situation monétaire:</p>
                    <p>"Les conditions de l’argent se sont avanta-geaiement modifiées. L’encaisse de
                        la Banque d’Angleterre s’est considérablement accru et la proportion de la
                        réserve s’est élevée à plus de 47%. Le taux de l’escompte libre oscille
                        entre 8 3/8 et 3 1/4 pour cent. La situation est donc, sans conteste,
                        meilleure, bien que les disponibilités du marché aient à faire face à
                        l'emprunt irlandais, annoncé pour le 7 Juillet; là tenue du cours du
                        Consolidé anglais en est affectée. Le “Statist” ne prévoit pas une
                        augmentation prochaine des disponibilités et s’attend même à des sorties
                        considérables poor la fin du mois courant.</p>
                    <p>Le Stock Exchange jouit en ce moment d’un repos relatif; c'est l’effet de la
                        morte saison. Là clientèle est devenue rare, et les mouvements des valeurs
                        quelque peu somnolentes ont beaucoup perdu de leur étendue."</p>
                    <p>***</p>
                    <p>On annonce d’Athènes que L’assemblée générale extraordinaire des actionnaires
                        de la Banque du Crédit Industriel de Grèce, tenue samedi passé, a voté à
                        l’unanimité la fusion avec la Banque d’Athènes.</p>
                    <p>L’assemblée extraordinaire de la Banque d’Athènes, qui doit statuer sur le
                        même objet; est fixée comme on sait; au samedi 7 Juillet prochain.</p>

                    <head>THE MAKING OF MODERN EGYPT.</head>
                    <byline>(FROM THE "SPECTATOR.")</byline>
                    <p>Modern Egypt has been fortunate in her historians. Instead of failing a prey
                        to the wandering journalist or the armchair critic at home, she has had her
                        history told by the men who helped to make it, Lord Milner, the late Sir
                        Clinton Dawkins and Sir Eldon Gorst, and now Sir Auckland Colvin, who played
                        a large part at the most critical time in her fortunes. Lord Milner's work
                        was not a consecutive history, but a series of brilliant essays on the main
                        Egyptian problems. Sir Auckland Colvin aims at following closely the order
                        of events, "to tell, in popular terms, the story of the making of modern
                        Egypt under British influence, from its ill-omened commencement, an
                        throughout its early years of difficulty, doubting and disasters, to the
                        triumphant close of the prolonged crisis." The nineteenth century in Egypt
                        was a period of violent changes. The country, which had slumbered more or
                        less since the Roman conquest, found itself suddenly drawn into the
                        maelstrom of world politics. That barbarian of genius, Mohamed Aly, made of
                        it a quasi-independent principality. Abbas and Said, his successors, were
                        commonplace folk, but with Ismail commenced a saturnalia of extravagance. He
                        found the public Debt four millions sterling. After sixteen years of
                        recklessness he left it at one hundred millions,m and of his loans, so low
                        had the credit of the country sunk, the net product barely amounted to half
                        the liability. Bankruptcy was in the air, and with this danger came Arabi's
                        rebellion. When Britain, after restoring order, commuted Arabi's death
                        sentece to banishment, and thereby fatally weakened the Khedive's prestige,
                        she took unwittingly a step which made impossible her retirement from the
                        country. Henceforth her bayonet must guarantee order; and her hands make
                        straight the tangle.</p>
                    <p>Britain's task in Egypt falls under three heads, the fight for solvency, the
                        fight against the Mahdi and his successors for the security of the Nile, and
                        the fight against internationalism. And the settlement of these problems
                        falls under three main epochs financially. The first was from 1883 to 1889,
                        when solvency was the only aim of the Administrations. From 1889 to 1896 the
                        economy was still the main consideration, but much was done in the way of
                        remitting the more burderonsome taxes. After 1896 came the period of
                        construction, when Egypt with a full Treasaury could devote herself to
                        reproductive expenditure, to making dams and building railways, and to
                        revising her whole economic position. The first epoch was the period of
                        trial, and it, too, has three distinct phases. the first was the time of
                        Lord Dufferin's Mission, when hopes were still high, and the rottenness of
                        the fabric had not been realised. The second began with Sir Evelyn Baring's
                        arrival in 1883, and included the Gordon episode, the London Convention, and
                        the International Settlement of 1885. It was a time when the most courageous
                        miht well despair of any good issue from such chaos of perplexities. From
                        1885 to 1889 things were bad enough, but the course had been determined, and
                        ti was possible for the watcher to see light behind the storm clouds. Sir
                        Auckland Colvin is at his best in his narrative of these tangled years. He
                        shows a scrupulous fairness towards men and institutions he is not in
                        sympathy with. Nothing could be better, for example than his sketches of the
                        chief Egyptian statesmen - Nubar, Riaz, and the rest - or his summary of the
                        work of the Caisse. That Cerberus "is still to be found at his old post. But
                        his teeth are drawn, his eyes are dim, his hearing is dull, and his limbs
                        palsied. In a few years, when he dies, as he is doomed to die, of natural
                        decay, the verdict on him will be that he was a faithful watchdog in his
                        youth, a dog in the manger in later life, and in his closing years
                        superfluous." He shows, too, the radical hopelessness of Gordon's scheme for
                        the evacuation of the Sudan, in estimating which we are too prone to forget
                        that Gordon wholly omitted one factor from his calculations, - the power of
                        the Mahdi, which he only realised with the approach of death.</p>
                    <p>The second period was a time of prosaic hard work, during which Britain was
                        fortunately concerned with other things, and left Egypt in the hands of the
                        one man who understood her. But with the third period comes the era of
                        expansion when the seed sown so laboriously begins to bear fruit. That
                        fiscal emancipation must precede administrative imporvement was the first
                        article of Lord Cromer's creed. The departments had to wait until the
                        taxpayer had been relieved of the worst of his burdens. Lord Cromer's work
                        is a fine example of the truth of the prover, festinalente. BEtween the
                        years 1883 and 1889 he had the most heartbreaking task which has, perhaps,
                        ever fallen to the lot of a British statemen. A weaker man would have broken
                        down under the strain, a less wise man would have tried heroic remedies and
                        forced the pace. But Lord Cromer never swerved either from his optimism or
                        his patience, and the man who has faith in Time is rarely betrayed. The
                        whole burden was on his shoulders, for the interventions of Britsh Cabinets
                        were generally ill inspired, as in the extraordinary Drummond Wolff Mission.
                        in Sir Auckland Colvins' pages may be read the tale of the progress first to
                        solvency and then to prosperity of the solow reconquest of the Sudan, and of
                        the gradual loosening of the shackles of internationalism which culminated
                        in the AngloFrench agreement of 1904. The doom of internationalism was
                        sounded when the Caisse, upheld by the Mixed Tribunals, refused to advance
                        part of the cost of the Omdurman Campaign, and the British Government
                        provided the money. The British Treasury does not part with public funds
                        without some prospect of compensation. With the 1904 Agreement, Lord
                        Cromer's steward ship was justified of its works. The history of Egypt and
                        of the Sudan takes on a new character. The plateau has been reached, and
                        progress is a smooth and rapid advance across a level country instead of the
                        laborious struggle up the steeps. Of the man to whom this unparalleled
                        result is due Sir Auckland Colvin has written in eloquent words. "He
                        deserved success, and had ahcieved it; his name passes henceforth into that
                        bright roll of his countrymen which derives its lustre in Eastern history,
                        not from wars or bloodhsed, but from a higher and more noble title; from
                        benefits conferred and contentment assured to alien peoples, through wise
                        administration and the fruitful arts of peace."</p>
                    <p>Sir Auckland Colvin's work should take rank as the standard history of our
                        labours in Egypt. Apart form his skillful arrangement of a large mass of
                        materials , and the accuracy and lucidity of his exposition of intricate
                        questions, it deserves to be read for its literary charm. Few men who have
                        spent their lives in administration, more especially in financial
                        administration, have attained to so admirable a style. Every chapter is
                        enlivened with wit and picturesqueness of phrase, and he has a happy gift of
                        classical reminiscence. He is as much alive to the romance of Egypt as the
                        peripatetic French novelist who sees no other side. Among pages of grave
                        politics it is pleasant to find such a sketch as that of old Zebehr, the
                        slave dealer, whom Gordon asked for as his colleage :-</p>
                    <p>"As we leave behind us the darkness of those evil years, we take away, as a
                        last impression, this is pleasing pastoral picture of Zebehr, retired
                        perforce from the busy cares of manhunting, and spending the evening of his
                        days in the fruitful sunshine of official favour; his sword turned into a
                        pruning hook, and his later years employed as Candide would have had him
                        employ them. We are reminded of that other gentle recluse at Edmonton, 'My
                        name is Reitred Leisure; I am to be met in trim gardens; I grow into
                        gentility perceptibly.'"</p>

                    <p>At the Oxford Commemoration held in the Sheldonian Theatre in the historic
                        City last week, the honorary degree of DCL was conferred upon Lord
                        Milner.</p>
                    <p>His lordship was presented by Dr. Goudy, Regius Professor of Civil Law, as a
                        true type and representative of Oxford culture. having received his school
                        educaiton partly in Germany, he came to Oxford for his academic training,
                        and obtained there the highest honours in the School of Literae Humaniores.
                        In 1897 he was chosen to be Governor of Cape Colony, at a time of great
                        unrest in South Africa. For his great services to the State he had been
                        rewarded by a peerage and other well merited honours. However opinions might
                        differ to the policy of the late war, no one could deny Lord Milner's
                        strenuous and devoted labours on behalf of his country. He did not lose
                        courage in the dark hours of adversity, and set an example to all his
                        subordinates of unremitting attention to duty. Finally Lord Milner had not
                        been unmindful of the muses, having written, among others, a valuable work
                        on "England in Egypt".</p>
                    <p>Others receiving this honour were the Chinese Minister, Wang Tah-Sieh; the

                        HAldane; Sir Horace Plunkett, and Sir John Madden, Chief Justice of the

                    <p>It is stated by the Earl of Meath that the success which attended the Empire
                        Day movement this year was far greater than even its most sanguine
                        supporters ever expected. Some four millions of children have come under the
                        influence of the movement, and an equal number of adults took part
                        throughout the British dominions, actively or as spectators in the
                        demonstration.</p>
                    <p>The Union Jack is the national flag, and the Earl contends that as the
                        reminder of civic responsibility it should occupy a prominent position
                        within and without every schoolhouse. In the United States and in our
                        Colonies the flag is provided by the education authority, but as this is not
                        the case in the Mother country, the Earl of Meath expresses the hope that
                        the public will either by individual effort or by organized subscription
                        raise funds in each parish sufficient to provide the local schools with a
                        suitable flagstaff and large-sized Union Jack.</p>

                    <head>SUGGESTED LEGISLATION</head>
                    <p>A conference of newspaper proprietors called for the purpose of considering
                        the question of the regulation of the publication of news in time of war,
                        was held last week at the Royal United Service Institution, Mr. A.F. Walter,
                        of the "Times," presiding.</p>
                    <p>The chairman said the purpose of the meeting was to consider the question of
                        controlling or restricting the publication of news during a state of war
                        between England and any other Great Power. The main question was as to
                        whether they were prepared to submit to a certain amount of control. In
                        theory they were all for the country first and for their own private
                        interests afterwards. In practice, it might easily happen that whether by
                        inadvertence, or by too much zeal, or by error of judgment, any one of them
                        mihgt do immense harm to the casue of the country and the Empire by the
                        publication of news useful to the enemy. The concealment of important facts
                        was, speaking generally, a policy of great advantage to our Japanese allies
                        in the war with Russia, and in one instance was attended by consequences of
                        the gravest moment. He was personally in favour of the proposed legislation
                        provided that it went no further than their consent gave, and that its terms
                        were clear and satisfactory.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Clifford explained that last November a letter of private inquiry was
                        sent out to some 200 leading editors and proprietors. That letter was issued
                        with the knowledge and consent, if not with the full apporvl, of the
                        Committee of Imperial Defence. The Government considered that legislation
                        was important, if only from the naval point of view.</p>
                    <p>He moved a resolution approving of the action taken by the Newspaper Society
                        in appointing a Committee to confer with the Committee of Imperial Defence,
                        and fully endorsing the priniple accepted by the subcommittee regarding the
                        legislation, dealing with the dissemination of news in war time, and
                        authorising the Newspaper Society to consider any Bill that might be drafted
                        on the subject.</p>
                    <p>Mr. J.S.R. Phillips, in seconding, said that if he were a general in an army
                        he should like to shoot all the newspaper men at the outset of a war, and he
                        shoul dhave then done with one enemy, frequently the more serious.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Fabien Ware suggested that the proposed draft Bill shoul dbe submitted to
                        the Government. He moved an amedment deleting the words "endorses the

                    <p>Mr. Robert Donald seconded, and feared that under the resolution the

                    <p>Mr. C. Arthur Pearson thought that the proposed exceptions were altogether

                    <head>GREECE AND ROMANIA.</head>
                    <p>The cessation of diplomatic relations between Greece and Romania is no
                        unfortunately definite. A White Book has just been published at Athens which
                        shows that the Greek Government did all in its power to remain on good terms
                        with Romania, but that it constatnly met with a spirit of intolerance on the
                        part of Bucharest. Mr. Skouzes has explained in the Chamber the steps taken
                        in the matter. Romania refused to enter into direct negotiations, and also
                        to discuss the qeustion at St. Petersburg. Greece then offered to submit the
                        question to the Peace Tribunal at the Hague, but he Bucharest Cabinet woul
                        dnot hear of it. On the contrary, it took steps to bring about a rupture,
                        and did nothing to prevent the assaults which frequently took place on Greek
                        subjects in Romania. Moreover, the Parliament decided to impose heavy taxes
                        on the subjects of those States which have no treaties of commerce with
                        Roumania, a measure which was directly aimed at the Greek merchants settled
                        in the country. The natural result of these injurious attacks was that
                        negotiations were broken off, and it is difficult to understand why Romania,
                        which under the rule of King Charles has always hitherto acted so wisely,
                        should have deliberately taken up an attitude hostile to Greece over such a
                        trumpery affair as that of the Kutzo-Vlachs. The two little kingdoms are the
                        only make-weight of the Slavs in the Balkans, and they ought to tand
                        shoulder to shoulder and not in opposition, a state of things which can only
                        result in advantage to their opponents. ("Globe.")</p>
