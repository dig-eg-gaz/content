                        <p>MOSCOW. </p>
                        <p>Some one has said that there are only two cities in the world which tall
                            at a glance their people’s history—Moscow and London. The one capital
                            indicates the continuous and peaceful expansion of a people steadily
                            growing into freedom and power, saved by its situation from foreign
                            interference, and with communications open to all the world ; the other
                            is a capital, which slowly straggled into existence as the only position
                            of any strategical value in a country exposed to constant menace, and
                            bearing the soars of many a bitter conflict. It is a city hallowed to
                            the Russian mind as the centre of national resistance to their foes,
                            sacrificed to Tartars, French, and Poles alike, hot rising again with
                            renewed splendour, and dearer for all that it had antlered. Petersburg
                            may be the seat of Government, and the means of communication with the
                            West; but Moscow is the abiding home of Russian sentiment, the local
                            centre round which patriotism gathers. How comes it then that this great
                            city, the centre of the ideals of the most conservative and backward of
                            European nations, has fallen into line with Warsaw, Batoum, Odessa,
                            Riga, and all the other centres of revolutionary rage and now lies prone
                            before the soldiery, who have only overcome the people after a slaughter
                            to which no other European capital in modern history can show a
                            precedent, for the horrors of the Commune were child's play compared to
                            the havoc of carnage that this Christmastide has aeon in the city of the
                            Kremlin 1 </p>
                        <p>The best description of the state of the city <cb n="5"/>last week prior
                            to the collapse of the rebellion ii contained in an article contributed
                            to a London contemporary by Mr. Percival Gibbon, who has gone to Russia
                            to examine the symptom, of the country. He remarks : </p>
                        <p>Wrong, grinding wrong, the effects of autocracy, which are the more
                            murderous the deeper they barrow through the social layers of the
                            nation, the hanger that was the portion of this group of millions, the
                            pain that was the dole of that, the servility and dumbness that were the
                            lot and duty of all, the strife of the instincts of manhood with the
                            need to lira under the ferocious law and lack of law—thaw, and these
                            alone, have made the revolution. Ah I yon may stay your Socialist with
                            words, yon may drug your faddist with arguments, yon may hash your
                            politician with the menace of bayonets; bat aching soul. Of men, sore
                            with injustice, outraged and avid—neither Tsar nor satrap, nor
                            battalions, nor logic, nor right, nor wrong, can avail to withhold them
                            from the fixed goal. That is what rages in Russia today, and the passion
                            of it, the packed force of stored wrath and enlightenment, have stormed
                            Moscow as the Huns stormed the Urals. The tenseness of it is in the air;
                            one breathes the spirit of revolution in the streets. The counsel of
                            instructive years; the cautiousness of the proudest diplomacy, the
                            deliberation of picked learning—these have been swamped, overridden,
                            stamped under, as standing com goes down under a tempest of hail. Moscow
                            the wise, the infinitely patient, the lordly in arts, the kingly in
                            craft, is throbbing with the passion of a fishwife. </p>
                        <p>For generations she has been the stronghold of the traditions of
                            autocracy, of that unbending conservatism which is yet the foundation of
                            the spirit of Russia. She was the bride of the race; St. Petersburg,
                            French and fins; dancing a Russian measure to a foreign fiddle, was no
                            more than a mistress, a servant of acquired tastes and cultivated
                            appetites. But Moscow stood for Russia; she bred the thought that moved
                            the country, shrined the ideals which ail men accepted, and led the
                            leisurely ordered advance of Russia towards the civilization her pundits
                            prescribed for the people. Hers was the index to which men looked in
                            doubt, and the change that has come over Moscow since the revolutionists
                            became openly active will do more to upset the poise of Russian life
                            than all the violences which daily perpetrate themselves throughout the
                            empire. </p>
                        <p>For this reason, Moscow leads no more. It is in the whirlpool with the
                            rest of the flotsam, circling as madly as any. Its society is
                            honeycombed with associations, all eager to be potent, all squabbling
                            over points of doctrine like Spanish monks. This ODB, with a famous
                            scientist for its show member, desires a certain special ouvee of
                            Republicanism; another strives alongside the Constitutionalists; a third
                            squeals for the present Romanoff to be superseded by another. Among them
                            the groups of real workers stand oat like men among pigmies, bat even
                            these divide themselves among a dozen parties, and agree in nothing save
                            that a change is wanted and must be brought about. The complications of
                            interest go down even to the labourers in the market, who will combine
                            for nothing bat stoning the police and marching in noisy procession at
                            the tail of a red flag. </p>
                        <p>What is needed is a man; all agree on that point The time is ripe for the
                            appearance of the Overman, the great personality who shall give this
                            movement a constructive aim to be the complement of its destructive
                            tendencies and instincts. His absence is the one thing that tempts one
                            to doubt the reality of the revolution; hitherto there has never been a
                            great demand for a leader bat a man has been forthcoming, whether a
                            Napoleon or only a Wat Tyler. Today one has bat to shout in the streets
                            of Moscow and one’s followers will come tanning, and yet the man who
                            must be ere Russia can realize her destiny has not transpired. What a
                            glory lies to his hand when he breaks from the crowd to take! What a
                            halo is wreathed for his name when he lets the world hear it! And how he
                            will dragoon Moscow when he comes! How he will handle her till she
                            speaks in a hash and develops hands to what her tongue has hardly dared
                            to name! He will be hard on Moscow. </p>
                        <p>Since those lines were written the Overman has appeared in the shape of
                            shot and shell and 20,000 corpses block the streets of the old Capital,
                            which has exhibited a frenzy of revolution unparalleled even by Odessa
                            or Cronstadt. </p>

                        <p>For some days past a great number of Bedouins have arrived at Alexandria
                            from various districts, bat chiefly from Mariout and Siouf, and have

                            Police, who was watching these proceedings by one of the gunsmith’s

                        <p>A correspondent writes: - As I was walking along the northern side of
                            Caesar’s Camp station yesterday afternoon with a friend I -aw an Arab
                            mule driver ill-treating his mole in a most brutal manner. The cart was
                            half leaded with sand and ODB of the wheels had sunk in the sand, the
                            driver was standing by simply lending no help whatever to extricate it,
                            only beating the poor animal with a stick and his reins about the head
                            in a most on merciful manner ; directly I remonstrated with him he put
                            his shoulder to the wheel and easily extricated it. I spoke to a lady
                            who lived close by and she told me this was an every-day occurrence with
                            various drivers at this spot, unfortunately she had not seen this
                            particular case. I think the driver in question should be severely dealt
                            with, his number is 2931. </p>

                        <p> NOW ON SALE IN CAIRO.</p>
                        <p>Collectors of precious works of art, and especially connoisseurs in lace,
                            may be interested to hear of the presence in Cairo of a lace robe which
                            is said to be without a rival in the world. This is that very robe that
                            was presented by the royal ladies of Paris to the Empress Eugenie and
                            which was worn by her at the historic Khedivial ball on the occasion of
                            the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. After the fill of the Empire this
                            dress fell into the hands of one of the ladies in waiting, and it is
                            only quite recently that stress of circumstances forced its owner to
                            part with it. The price given for it in the first instance by the ladies
                            of Paris was 100,000 francs, and ten years were spent in its making.
                            Experts now value it at £4,000, which was the price paid for one
                            somewhat similar by the present Queen of Italy. Independently of its
                            historic interest the robe is unique in its beauty of design and
                            delicacy of execution. It is of “point d’application" made without join
                            or seam, and is inmost perfect preservation. There is a deep border
                            round the skirt which measures some five yards and the design is
                            composed of alternate panels of flowers and ferns massed together, and
                            groups of the same flowers and ferns on a conventional background. It is
                            a curious fact that this historic work of art should have drifted back
                            to Cairo in the hope of finding a probable purchaser, but perhaps no
                            more certain market could be found, for it was on the occasion of the
                            celebration of the East and West by the Canal which has handed the name
                            of De Lesseps down to undying posterity, and which has changed the
                            politics of the whole world, that this magnificent rote was first worn.

                        <p>During 1905 the Survey Department, which is a branch of the Ministry, of
                            Finance made considerable progress with the Cadastral Survey, and there
                            will only remain a part of Beni-Suef province to survey in 1906. The
                            whole of the cultivated land of Egypt will then have been surveyed on
                            scales of 1 : 4,000 or 1 : 2,500 and all the map sheets will have been
                            printed except those of the provinces of Sharqia and Behera. These two
                            provinces were the first ones to be done at a time when no definite
                            system of survey had been adopted, and they most therefore be
                            re-surveyed before map .beets can be published. Sharqia will be taken up
                            in 1906. </p>
                        <p>The publication of topographical maps on a scale of 1: 10,000 has been
                            pushed on, but as this scale admits of considerable accuracy careful
                            revision in the field is necessary before the maps can be published. </p>
                        <p>In order however that a general map of the cultivated area may be
                            available as early as possible, map sheets on a scale of 1 : 50,000 are
                            being reduced directly from the cadastral survey without further
                            revision. It was anticipated that some programs would have beer made
                            with these in 1905, but the absence of triangulation in the Delta, where
                            much of earlier revenue survey was done without it, has delayed the
                            work. Ten sheets however will very shortly be published, and it is
                            proposed to treat this work as of the first order of importance and to
                            push it forward as rapidly as possible, so that the majority of the 140
                            sheets required will be published in 1906. </p>
                        <p>List year a chain of triangulation was carried across the Eastern Desert,
                            and now two more are in progress, which, when finished will famish an
                            accurate basis for locating mining claims and concessions ; a geological
                            reconnaissance is being made of this area at the same time. </p>
                        <p>In the more precise surveying, benchmarks have been fixed on two lines
                            from Cairo to the sea, and on one cross line ; these are now being
                            levelled and will be completed in 1906. The arrangements for the exact
                            verification of the length, eta, of metallic bars, bar ds, and wires are
                            complete and the investigation of the bass measuring apparatus la in
                            hand and will be carried on throughout the year. </p>

                            reported to have lost their eyesight daring the last ten years from
                            trachoma, when a simple operation would have saved them. The river is a
                            tributary of the Nile and is 289 miles long. </p>

                        <head>THE EMANCIPATION OF EGYPT.</head>
                        <p>To THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
                        <p>Sir, —You have recently reviewed the book published under the above title
                            at each considerable length, that it almost requires an apology to ask
                            that reference should be made to it again in your columns, but there is
                            one point to which I should like to call your readers' attention; and I
                            will be brief. </p>
                        <p>Beyond expressing your dissent from the general trend of the opinions
                            expressed in the book, yon say a good deal in praise of it ; —more
                            perhaps than it deserves. Since your review appeared I have read the
                            book carefully, and I find several passages in it which show “a little
                            rift within the lute.” I will refer to one only : </p>
                        <p>“The congregation of resident foreigners in Egypt, apart from those
                            employed in some official business, are mostly there for no higher
                            purpose than the accumulation of the maximum of money in the minimum of
                            time. All methods are good, so long as they have a substantial pecuniary
                            result." </p>
                        <p>I think that this is a reflection on the European communities in Egypt,
                            which is not justified by fact. There may certainly be exceptions among
                            the class referred to, but in nearly every European colony in Egypt, I
                            could give a long list of families who have lived here from generation
                            to generation, and who have neither the hope, the wish, nor the
                            intention of leaving the country, so long as it continues to offer them
                            the same generous hospitality as in the past, for which they undoubtedly
                            feel grateful to the rulers of this country, past and present. Nor has
                            the advantage been altogether on one side, for these same colonists have
                            certainly helped to maintain with their mother countries those intimate
                            business relations, without which Egypt could never have attained the
                            prosperity it has now reached. </p>
                        <p>It seems strange that the author of a serious book should offer such an
                            uncalled-for insult to the large foreign commercial community of
                            Egypt.—I remain, etc., </p>

                        <p>SYNDICATE TO PROMOTE TRADE.</p>
                        <p>An important movement is being made to deal with the trade of Egypt. Some
                            30 or 40 wealthy and influential manufacturers (British and Colonial)
                            propose forming a syndicate to promote and increase Imperial trade in
                            this country. Under English supervision an efficient staff in Cairo will
                            watch the interests of all industries represented by the syndicate. It
                            is felt by many British manufacturers that their interests have,
                            hitherto, not been sufficiently represented. </p>
                        <p>The growing demands of Egypt now call for vigorous action, and this
                            direct representation in Cairo is a step in the right direction. An
                            advance agent has for the last two months been collecting all possible
                            information likely to help the committee at their meeting in London next
                            February. </p>

                        <head>MERCHANT SEAMEN’S 'XMAS TREAT.</head>
                        <p>Thanks mainly to Admiral Sir Massie and Lady Blomfield the entertainment
                            given to the seamen of the merchant steamers in this port on Friday last
                            was one of the most successful ever given. It was certainly the best
                            attended treat. 300 men sat down to dinner in two relays. The harbour
                            was more crowded than has ever been known at 'Xmas, and as friends of
                            the Home had been more generous than ever some of the sailors of the
                            Norwegian and Swedish timber ships received a special invitation to be
                            present. The room was particularly well decorated and the Nelson signal
                            flags were hung diagonally in two lines across the hall, whilst his
                            famous words, “England expects that every man should do his duty,”
                            confronted the audience above the stage—the “Nelson year” being still in
                            existence. Five long tables were filled with good things, turkeys, hams,
                            roast beef, plum cake, etc. There were many friendly helpers, and
                            amongst others we saw Mr. and Mrs. Gould, Admiral and Lady Blomfield and
                            Mr. Hugh Blomfield, Canon and Mrs. Ward, Miss Christie, Bev. Longley,
                            and Rev. H. and Mrs. Reid. A pretty 'Xmas card was presented by Lady
                            Blomfield to each of the 300 guests and Mrs. Gould gave each a packet of
                            tobacco. </p>
                        <p>After the repast had been done ample justice to the tables were cleared
                            as if by magic and chairs and benches arranged in “serried ranks,” and
                            at 8.30 the concert programme was began. Great difficulties were
                            overcome by the organiser of the concert, Mr. H. N, Blomfield, who lost
                            the help of his friends, the Misses Peel and Mr. E. Peel, through
                            influenza, and Mrs. Bayliss moat kindly threw herself into the breach at
                            the last moment and took the part of Veroniqne at three days’ notice
                            Mrs. Wilson, a new American "star” was also suffering from a chill and
                            her song had at the last moment to be replaced. However, the St. Mark’s
                            choir (which was also much reduced through one cause or another) ran the
                            programme from beginning to end with the exception of the lovely child
                            danseuse, Miss Norah Gedge, who delighted everyone by her fairy grace
                            and real poetry of motion. The following was the programme:— </p>
                        <p>Overture on piano - Miss Brown.</p>
                        <p>Song - “Love, could I only tell thee” -Mr. Byrne. </p>
                        <p>Scarf and Skirt dances - Miss Norah Gedge. </p>
                        <p>Monologue - “Story of a Kiss” - Mr. H. Tookey. </p>
                        <p>Costume duet from “Veronique”- “The Swing Song“ - Mrs. Baylis and Mr. H.
                            Blomfield. </p>
                        <p>Welsh dance - Miss Norah Gedge, </p>
                        <p>Song - "Love the pedlar”. Mrs. Baylis. </p>
                        <p>Comic song from Cingalee- “That’s all right” - Mr. Blomfield. </p>
                        <p>Song - "Asthore” - Mr. Byrne. </p>
                        <p>Monologue - Mr. W. Tookey. </p>
                        <p>Costume duet from “Veronique” . The donkey song - Mrs. Baylis and Mr. H.
                            Blomfield. </p>
                        <p>Comic song from San Toy - “When him go Ladida” - Mr. H. Blomfiold, </p>
                        <p>Two Christmas Carols - St, Mark’s Choir. </p>
                        <p>God Save the King,</p>
                        <p>The overture by Miss Brown was beautifully given. The song, “Love, could
                            I only tell three,” was rendered by Mr. Byrne in his usual artistic
                            style, and his rendering of “Asthore” was also greatly appreciated and
                            an encore was demanded for which he kindly replied with “A Land of
                            Roses.” Mr. Tookey gave an excellent rendering of his song, which very
                            much amused and delighted the sailors. Mr. Hugh Blomfield and Mrs.
                            Baylis carried the evening on their two duets, the “Swing Song” and the
                            "Donkey Song.” Both Mr. Blomfield and Mrs. Baylis showed most careful
                            study and are to be congratulated on their excellent performance, more
                            especially as Mrs. Baylis kindly undertook the part at very short
                            notice. The “Donkey Song” was rendered more effective by the fact that a
                            live donkey was led through the audience, and by some unknown means,
                            placed upon the stage, where Mrs. Baylis, sitting gracefully on the
                            donkey, performed her part of the duet with distinct grace. The singing
                            of two Christmas carols and “God Save the King," by members of the St
                            Mark’s choir, brought a most successful evening to a close. </p>

                            spreading atrocious falsehoods and raising the electioneering cry of
                            anti slavery, while in reality they have not the least intention to

                        <p>Mr. Churchill, in a letter to Mr. l. Zangwill, says that while the Earl
                            of Elgin is bound to recognise the serious difficulties in the way of
                            this foundation of a Jewish colony in East Africa, he will approach the

                            navy department to go out to Manila on the D. D. Dewery, on one of the
                            most1 remarkable cruises of modern times. The D. D Diwery means the big
                            steel floating dry dock now at Solomon’s island in Chesapeake bay, which
                            is destined to dock the largest ships of the American naval force in the
                            far past if this great structure can ever be successfully piloted
                            through four seas, the 14,000 miles lying between Chesapeake bay and
                            Manila bay. </p>
                        <p>Mr. Wood is to live aboard the dock during the voyage. Ha anticipates one
                            of the most pleasant experiences of his life. He will receive $250
                            compensation per month. His vessel will be so stable in the heaviest
                            weather that it might be possible to play billiards aboard, according to
                            some officers, and he will have plenty of good company and solid
                            comforts. There is a permanent crew of eight machinists, engineers,
                            sailors and electricians and firemen and those people are to remain
                            attached to the dock at Manila. On the voyage across they will be
                            reinforced by twenty-two sailors. </p>
                        <p>The sleeping accommodation on the dock are as good as the best on a man
                            of war and there is an abundance of room. Receiving the best of merchant
                            sailor pay, the crew will be abundantly fed, as the ration allowance for
                            the cruise is placed at 60 cents each daily instead of the usual rate of
                            30 cents. There will be small boats and wireless telegraph installation.
                            The navy department is still looking for three operators for this
                            service, offering to pay the men $60 per month and allowances and to
                            send them back from Manila. </p>
                        <p>This comparatively large crew is needed for the purpose of handling the
                            towing lines and operating the pumps and electrical contrivances that
                            keep the deck dry. They cannot steer the great hulk, for no constructor
                            has bean able to devise a rudder big enough to shape a course for the
                            dock which could be safely attached and operated. So the dock is to be
                            held on its course solely by the towing power of the three great
                            colliers, Glacier, Caesar and Brutus, the whole under command of Captain
                            Fullam, United States navy. Each of the colliers will have its own
                            wireless plant so that they may freely communicate with the dock and
                            with each other. The towing line will be one and a half miles long, a
                            length regarded as necessary to guard against sharp strains in a heavy
                            sea and even with this great towing line bits with pneumatic cushions
                            have been placed on the colliers to reduce the chance of breaking the
                            cables, the largest steel ropes in the world. </p>
                        <p>Estimates vary as to the length of time that will be consumed in the
                            voyage, but some of the most competent naval officers believe that the
                            Dewey can be towed at the rate of about one hundred miles a day, and
                            allow about three or four months for the trip via the Suez canal. </p>

                        <p> Owing to the extraordinary development of the port of Alexandria of
                            recent years, much trouble has been caused by the congested state of the
                            harbour. The Government last year made a grant of L.E 206,000 to enable
                            further improvements to be carried out, and since thou a farther big
                            grant has been made for the same purpose. The money is now being
                            expended on gigantic works, which will enormously increase the
                            accommodation of the port. In fact, the coast in the immediate western
                            neighbourhood of the port, from Gabbari to Mex, is now being transformed
                            and in a short space of time it will be the centre of a new port, which
                            will be the scene of as much activity, and the centre of as busy a
                            population, as is the present harbour. The following is a sketch of the
                            chief works now in the course of construction. </p>

                        <head>THE COAL QUAY.</head>
                        <p>The coal quay was only 35 metres broad four years ago and since then has
                            been increased to 90 metres. A still farther extension re obligatory and
                            it is in course of being widened to 150 metres. A new arm is being added
                            to the end of the coal quay in a southwesterly direction, which will
                            accommodate three berths. Two berths will be completed on the main coal
                            quay extension within one month and in three months there will be two
                            other berths finished and ready on the new arm of the quay. As the works
                            proceed more and more new berths will be opened as they are needed. A
                            credit of L E 88.000 was opened for this quay tut this sum Ins almost
                            all been spent as the works for which it was allotted have nearly been
                            finished. Fresh credits will be voted as the need arises. </p>
                        <p>M. Malavel, the chief engineer to the Porte and Lighthouses
                            Administration, to whom this work is entrusted, has invented an
                            excellent system for embankments, which is being followed in these
                            constructions. </p>
                        <p>In order to obtain a solid foundation it is necessary to clear off the
                            mud by throwing down enormous quantities of sand, which, presses on the
                            mud and by mere force of its weight drives the mud away. A dredger is
                            then employed in order to dig out a site for the walls, the foundation
                            of which are nine metres in depth. Then artificial blocks, nine cubic
                            metres square, quarried at Mex, are put down. </p>
                        <p>This method has up to date given excellent results and M. Malavel is to
                            be congratulated on having solved a difficult problem in the, laying of
                            these foundations. </p>
                        <p>The embankments constricted up to now have a superficies of 25,000 square
                            metres, which, taking into consideration the average depth of from 19 to
                            20 metres, makes 500,000 cubic metres of earth removed from the land .
                            between Wardian and Gabbari. </p>
                        <p>The south end of the coal quay is being enlarged 90 metres in order to
                            admit of sufficient space for coal depots at d railway lines from
                            Gabbari station. A credit of L.E. 10,000 has been accorded for this
                            special work. </p>
                        <p>At the end of the coal quay, where the Gabbari quay begins, a store of
                            3,600 square metres in extent is being erected for the storage of oil
                            and fat imports, etc. The building is of masonry with a terrace of beton
                            arme and is supported by a number of columns, also in beton arme. At the
                            end of the store two sheds are being built where lime and cement will be
                            stored. </p>
                        <p>By the semaphore by the side of the, new dock it is intended to construct
                            a quay for embarking and disembarking passengers. In the rear of the
                            semaphore is the quarry whence the material for the erection of the:
                            coal quay was extracted. On the site of this exhausted quarry, for the
                            earth there has now been levelled, the yards for the artificial blocks
                            for the timber quays will be situated. Later on these enormous areas
                            will be occupied by the depots of the timber merchants. </p>
                        <p>The uplands, known by the name of Om el-Koubbebeh, will be levelled and
                            thrown into the sea in order to be utilised for the timber- quays. Some
                            blocks have already been placed in position here. These timber quays
                            will consist of three moles, 120 metres in length and 100 metres in
                            width. Beyond these moles there will be a flat surface, shoot 80 metres
                            broad, where the blocks of timber will be sorted and where there will
                            also be the roads and railway lines. Behind this up to the Mex high road
                            there is to be a large piece of land for the depots of the timber
                            merchants. </p>
                        <p>The above are only some of the items in the great programme now being
                            undertaken by the Egyptian Government in order to increase the
                            accommodation of the port of Alexandria. In our next article we will
                            review the remainder of the works. In the meantime we advise our readers
                            to repair themselves to the scene of enormous activity, which is
                            destined to entirely transform the line of coast that stretches from the
                            Gabbari end of the port if Alexandria westwards to Mex. </p>

                        <head>GREECE OF TO DAY.</head>
                        <p>AN INTERESTING BOOK.</p>
                        <p>We congratulate Mr. Miller on having produced an excellent little book on
                            modern Greece. It is instructive and yet amusing, detailed yet
                            resourceful, and full of picturesque touches and poetic flashes which
                            make it extremely pleasant reading. The author is by no means a mere
                            casual spectator. He has studied many of her racial, political, and
                            social problems with great care, and on many of them he expresses very
                            sound opinions. To begin with he maintains that the theory that the old
                            Hellenic blood and race are extinct is fallacious and in this contention
                            he will, we believe, be supported by the most intelligent modern
                            scholars. As Professor Mahaffy has often pointed oat, the Greeks of
                            modern times have many of the qualities of the ancient Hellenes. We have
                            got to believe that every Greek of the days of Pericles was a genius,
                            but the belief is as false as one which should hold that all the
                            contemporaries of Shakespeare were men of his standard. The average
                            Athenian of Aristophanes’ day was probably, says Mr. Miller, not very
                            different from the present frequenters of the cafes in
                            Constitution-square at Athens. The most marked qualities which ho
                            notices amongst the Greeks of to-day are curiosity, hospitality, and a
                            general democratic tendency. No sooner do you arrive at an inu than the
                            girls of the house come in and ransack your luggage from sheer
                            curiosity. Yet if you are on a little Greek steamer plying amongst the
                            islands and food is not plentiful, the Greek officers will go without
                            their dinner so that you may have yours in plenty. In politics there is,
                            of coarse, great corruption, yet many rich Greeks have grown poor in
                            office. One head of expense arises from the duty of standing godfather
                            to the children of your constituents, and there is a popular statesman
                            in Athens to-day who is said to have a thousand godchildren in Attica.
                            The desire for change is, however, now, as in the days of St. Paul,
                            ineradicable in the Greek. There have been fifty-four Ministries in the
                            last forty-two years and five in the last twelvemonth. No great
                            questions divide parties, and the crises are simply disputes between
                            rival leaders each with a band of followers whom he must appease with
                            the spoils of office. The “spoils system” is in full swing in Greece,
                            and with the very worst results. </p>
                        <p>The modern Greeks have done nothing in literature, and there is but a
                            small market for books. Newspapers are read with the utmost avidity, and
                            Athens boasts almost as many daily papers as London. Jules Verne and
                            Marie Corelli are read in translations, and there is a small number of
                            people who study Byron, Macaulay, end Shakespeare, but moat of the
                            Greeks who read English confine themselves to the daily and weekly
                            papers which come from England. Education is bad, chiefly because
                            schoolmasters go in and out with the Government, and this defect may be
                            the cause of the low standard of literary and academic taste. In this
                            connection we may notice that England still lags behind America-,
                            France, and Germany in her efforts for Greek archaeology. Our British
                            School is starved, and the attempts to raise funds for it in England are
                            not successful. This is a reproach to England which, we hope, will soon
                            be wiped out. Mr. Miller talks pleasantly of society both in the capital
                            and the country, and notices, as all travellers in Greece do, that
                            Turkish customs have not yet died out. The Greek ladies—except the
                            cosmopolitans, who imitate Paris customs—live still in semi-seclusion,
                            some indeed in complete privacy. Hence it comes that the Greek seldom
                            entertains in his own house; and yon may knew a man for months in Athens
                            without even finding out whether he is married or not. As to country
                            life, Mr. Miller rightly deplores the tendency of the modern Greek to
                            desert his fields and hills for the towns. This tendency is very strong
                            in Greece to-day, and is undoubtedly causing physical deterioration. He
                            gives a vivid account of the promontory of Maud, the central prong of
                            the Peloponnesus. Here the descendants of the ancient Spartans still
                            subsist upon their rocky hills — so rocky that it is said there that
                            when God was creating the world the bag containing the stones burst over
                            Mane. Here survive the fierce traditions of the vendetta, the highest
                            code of respect for women, the strictest rule, of unbounded and
                            unquestioning hospitality. Here, too, are rival highland clans, the
                            Campbells and the Camerons of the Peloponnesus, though to-day they fight
                            their battles, rather over municipal elections than over the, ownership
                            of fields or cattle. The account, of this place is most interesting, and
                            reminds one of Lord Carnarvon's travels at the commencement of the
                            Victorian Era. There is, much more on Church, and education, and so
                            forth to attract the reader, but we will lease him to enjoy the book for
                            himself. It has only one possible disadvantage, it will make him long to
                            go to Greece, or—if he has been there before—to go again. </p>

                        <p>“TANNHAUSER.”</p>
                        <p>The present opera company should by this time have accustomed us to look
                            for success in most of their undertakings; yet we confess the inclusion
                            of Tannhauser in the repertoire was a little shaking to our confidence.
                            Nor, we regret to say, were our fears entirely groundless. Yesterday’s
                            performance, though it contained several good features, showed much want
                            of finish and comprehension. The wide difference separating the Italian
                            rendering of Wagner from the German is not merely confined to the change
                            of language nor even to the national characteristics attaching thereto,
                            but lies largely in the fact that the Italians do not partake of that
                            semi-religious “schwarmerei” so faithfully observed in German
                            representations. The audience, too, does not come so muoh with the idea
                            of being impressed and uplifted as with being entertained, or, at beat,
                            diverted. Nevertheless, whether sung in' Italian or German, so profound,
                            so speaking, so true to natural instincts is the music, that let it but
                            be truly interpreted and none can fail to be deeply moved by it. While a
                            previous knowledge of Tannhauser is practically a necessity if its fall
                            beauties are to be followed, yet a slight knowledge of the plot is
                            enough to enable one, through the medium of the wonderfully inspired
                            motifs, to hear, as it were, the very thoughts and impulses of each and
                            every character. We will not deny that last night’s performance to some
                            extent conveyed to us this impression. Maestro Zuccani deserves credit
                            for the manner in which he entered on his strenuous task. He evidently
                            took great pains to work op the production, but there is unquestionably
                            room for much farther improvement, which, we make no doubt, will be
                            instilled into future representations here. One felt it had been
                            embarked upon too light- heartedly and that it was not fully realised
                            that it is one thing to frolic through light Italian opera and another
                            to rise to so big a venture as Tannhauser. </p>
                        <p>The house had evidently assembled in high good humour and vociferously
                            applauded the overture, which had to be encored and. was far better
                            played the second time than the first. The orchestra also did
                            surprisingly well with the Venusberg music, and Signa. Zappilli’s Venus
                            was as charming in execution as in appearance. Sig. Longobardi, as
                            Tannhauser was not at his best, being prevented by a cold from giving to
                            his part all the force which it exacted. He also requires, as we have
                            remarked before, to throw himself with more dash and vigour into his
                            idles. He failed last night to impress us as a man swayed this way and
                            that by tumultuous emotions. In the second scene of this act, the
                            orchestra continued good but was sadly hampered by an unexpressive
                            rendering of the peasant’s song, usually so sweetly fresh. The first
                            appearance of the pilgrims was fairly good, the crescendo and diminuendo
                            being well observed, and the entry of the knights of the Wartburg led
                            the act to a successful finale. </p>
                        <p>Act II. was well interpreted from first to last. To begin with, the
                            Elisabeth of Signa. Giannina Russ was a remarkably fine, display of
                            talent. She mastered her score with apparent ease and fulfilled every
                            requirement. Sig. Nicolay as the Landgrave was properly dignified in his
                            singing and acquitted himself well. At Sig. Amato’s Wolfram we were
                            prepared to wax very enthusiastic; he certainly worked his hardest in
                            this act to fill his part with exactness and sympathy, and need his
                            voice, which is of a very pleasing timbre, to its best effect. But for
                            some unaccountable reason be disappointed us in Act III and might have
                            done more justice to the “Evening Star” romance. The famous march was
                            exceedingly well given by all exponents and the orchestra maintained
                            their standard throughout Act II and did what they could in the
                            following one, which was unluckily a very tame affair. In fact Signa.
                            Russ’s fine singing of Elisabeth’s prayer and the efforts of the
                            orchestra saved the act from comparative failure. Let us draw the
                            curtain of charitable silence on the lamentable collapse of the chorus
                            and finale. It was a pity to have to wait until nearly 1.30 a.m. to
                            witness such a debacle. Once again we raise our voices at the terribly
                            long waits, and if really nothing can be done to remedy this evil, the
                            play should at least commence at an earlier hour. </p>

                        <head>*AN AMERICAN IN EGYPT.</head>
                        <p>Some interesting observations in Egypt are contained in Egypt, Burma and
                            Malaysia by Mr. William Eleroy Curtis, the well-known American newspaper
                            correspondent. Simplicity, rapidity, vividness, and a certain
                            positiveness mark his writings, and have won for him a wide circle of
                            daily readers. He has unusual faculties for observing the surface life
                            of foreign lands, and the ability to marshal his data in good order. His
                            recent look entitled respectively "Egypt, Burma, and Malaysia” is a
                            model of a reporter’s note book in foreign lands. The author conducts us
                            over the usual routes and amid often described scenes. Port Said,
                            Alexandria, Cairo, 'ever new and novel to the oldest traveller,’ the
                            Pyramids, the Sphinx, and the Nile, are of course the main points of
                            interest in Egypt. To add anything new to these old familiars would be
                            impossible; but Mr. Curtis’s view point is at times refreshing. It is
                            out of the common run of description to read that the famous ideal of
                            mystery in stone has 'no more expression than there would be in any
                            sandstone image that has been hit square on the nose by a three hundred
                            pound shot fired from a French cannon and had its features scattered
                            over a square mile of desert.’ </p>

                            Zobeir, qui montait un obeval, s'étant abattu sur la dame Barnob

                    <p> To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                    <p>Sir,—A perusal of the portion of the Financial Adviser’s Note on the Budget
                        published in your issue of the 26th inst. by any one unacquainted with Egypt
                        must leave the impression that the much vaunted prosperity of the country
                        has been greatly exaggerated and that the country is on the brink of a
                        financial catastrophe owing to over-speculation. </p>
                    <p>It is a matter for deep regret that a high Government official should step in
                        and make authoritative statements which, after all, can only be an
                        expression of personal opinion, and however eminent a man may be, he is but
                        human and subject to error. </p>
                    <p>The people who will read the Financial Adviser's Note are practically
                        confined to Egypt and the United Kingdom. In Egypt, owing to personal
                        knowledge of the situation, the effect will not be serious, but in England
                        there is no doubt very considerable importance will be given to the views
                        expressed and it will certainly have the effect of further retarding the
                        flow of English capital into Egypt If the Financial Adviser is correct in
                        his views be doubtless will be rendering a considerable service to the
                        British public by preventing them from investing money in a country verging
                        on bankruptcy, but if on the other hand he is making a mistake the British
                        public who have expended their blood and treasure so freely to reclaim Egypt
                        from the financial ruin and anarchy existing in 1882 will be the only
                        European nation that will not profit by the prosperity of the country.
                        European capital, with the exception of British, is flowing freely into
                        Egypt, and has been doing so for several years past, it will continue to do
                        so in spite of the Financial Adviser’s “note of warning." This, however, is
                        not the point, the question we have to deal with is whether the Financial
                        Adviser is correct in the opinions he so ably expresses in the Budget Note
                        under review. </p>
                    <p>No one for a moment doubts that in giving expression to his views Sir Vincent
                        Corbett is actuated by motives of highest principle and a sincere desire to
                        benefit the public in general, bat let us analyze facts. His Budget, in
                        spite of his efforts to minimise the eloquence of figures, speaks volumes of
                        the growing prosperity of Egypt, for notwithstanding a low Nile flood in
                        1901, and the remission of taxation during the three preceding years of
                        about half a million pounds, the revenue of the year now ending exceeds that
                        of the previous year by about one million pounds, or 7 1/2 %. Sir Vincent
                        Corbett next proceeds to ascribe the increase in the price of necessaries of
                        life in Egypt to the appreciation in value of land and the sudden
                        acquisition of unexpected wealth by large sections of the community; he
                        gives as an illustration a list of certain commodities such as wheat, beans,
                        lentils, etc., quoting the prices the Government paid in 1904 and-1905 for
                        there articles. </p>
                    <p>No clearer proof, than this portion of his note, can be produced to show how
                        an able man can go astray when venturing to express an opinion on subjects
                        with which he is not fully acquainted. Sir Vincent Corbett is not a
                        commercial man, otherwise he would not attribute to the increased wealth of
                        the community the rise in the price of wheat from P.T. 108 per ardeb in 1904
                        to P.T. 128 in 1905 or beans from P.T. 6Q to P.T. 116 and so on through the
                        list of articles which he quotes. The price of wheat in Egypt, like that of
                        every other country, is subject to the law of supply and demand. Egypt does
                        not produce enough wheat fur its own consumption, consequently large
                        quantities of flour are imported. It is the first cost of this flour plus
                        freight, Customs duty, merchants’ profit and all other expenses that
                        regulates the price of wheat in Egypt, no amount of "acquisition of
                        unexpected wealth" would put up the price one piastre per ardeb if a
                        corresponding increase in the price of flour did not take place in the
                        market from which Egypt draws her supplies. To argue the contrary would be
                        to imply that importers of flour into Egypt during 1905, taking the
                        Financial Adviser’s figures, were clearing a profit 0f 25% on the value of
                        every sack of flour they imported plus the profit they were making in 1904.
                        The same arguments applies to each of the other articles quoted in a greater
                        or less degree. In saying this it is not for a moment contesting the fact
                        that the more prosperous a community may be the more if the necessaries as
                        well as luxuries of life it will consume per head of population, but it is
                        maintained that the price of commoditie- which are staple articles of
                        commerce are unaffected by the prosperity of the country in which they are
                        sold, their price being regulated by the world’s supply of the same. In
                        analyzing the imports and exports the Financial Adviser makes the following
                        remarks, i. e, " The fact that during the past two years the imports of
                        merchandise and specie taken together have greatly outbalanced the exports
                        notwithstanding the constant heavy charge for the service of the foreign
                        debt constitutes a phenomenon which calls for reflection. A readjustment in
                        the direction of normal equilibrium most come about sooner or latter and if
                        we are paying for imports with capital provided by the foreign investor this
                        operation, though by no means necessarily unsound at present cannot be
                        indefinitely continued. ” This question of imports as compared with exports
                        is one that has exercised the minds of experts in every country for many
                        generations, and though figures can be made to prove anything one way or the
                        other, the broad fact remains that many of the most prosperous countries in
                        the world, including the United Kingdom, import goods of a much greater
                        value than those they export, consequently the fact that the imports into
                        Egypt are now exceeding the exports may be taken as a proof that the
                        prosperity of the country has come to stay. </p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>Under the heading of "Speculation in Egypt” the Financial Adviser sounds a
                        note of warning which he admits, coming from one in his position, will carry
                        more weight than if pronounced by an ordinary individual. He doubtless
                        expresses his honest convictions, but it is a pity that he should have
                        allowed himself to make such a sweeping pronouncement on a subject with
                        which, to his honour be it said, he evidently is unacquainted. Sir Vincent
                        Corbett is unquestionably confusing speculation with gambling ; where the
                        latter begins, and where the former ends, no one has been able to define for
                        the one runs so much into the other that it is impossible to separate them,
                        and yet they are quite distinct. Speculation is the very breath in the
                        nostrils of all commercial enterprise ; take away speculation and where
                        would our great engineers be who plan and carry out great financial
                        enterprises? They may plan railways and bridges, steamboats and factories,
                        but without the speculator behind them to supply the sinews of war in the
                        shape of £ s. d. how many of such works would be carried out? And how far on
                        the road of civilisation would the world have advanced? Unfortunately, where
                        there is speculation there gambling will also come in, but it would he as
                        wise to condemn the whole system of banking because cheques are often forged
                        as to make a sweeping condemnation of speculation because men make use of it
                        to gamble. Having said so much let us now see if gambling really exists in
                        an excessive degree in Egypt. </p>
                    <p>The only serious gambling is that of the Cotton Bourse, bat it is nothing in
                        proportion as compared with legitimate cotton speculation to what exists in
                        the cotton markets of Liverpool and New-York. This gambling in "futures" has
                        existed for many years, and though efforts have been made in many countries,
                        no legislation that human ingenuity can devise has been able to stop it. </p>
                    <p>Turning to stocks and share, though people make and lose money in buying and
                        selling there is nothing approaching the gambling that takes place in the
                        stock and share markets of other co entries for the reason that there is no
                        "term market” in Egypt ; here and there a broker may arrange with a client
                        as a special agreement to carry for him a number of shares for the end of
                        the month bat there is no regular "settling days” with fixed rates of
                        “Contago" and all the machinery that has been specially devised to enable
                        men with a limited command of ready cash to boy and sell thousands of
                        shares, whereas in Egypt with the same means at their disposal they can only
                        deal in hundreds. No one can bay more shares than he can carry for the
                        simple reason that no Bank in Egypt will advance more than 70 to 80 % of the
                        market value on dividend-paying shares and nothing on shares of companies
                        that have not yet paid a dividend. This fact demonstrates the soundness of
                        the financial position of Egypt, for it is no exaggeration to state that at
                        least 80 % of the capital of all the better established Egyptian public
                        companies, including the National and Agricultural Bank, is held by Egyptian
                        shareholders, and practically the whole of the capital of all the new
                        companies on which the hanks have made absolutely no advances has been found
                        by Egypt. </p>
                    <p>The most important point, however, in Sir Vincent Corbett’s note of warning,
                        and the one that will have the most repellent effect on he British
                        capitalist, is his statement that values of land "have been forced up to
                        levels which even prospective results can hardly prove to be remunerative,’’
                        Is this so? What is the value of land? Taking agricultural land first, the
                        answer to the latter question that would probably be glibly given is that
                        the maximum value of land is reached when it becomes a 5% investment.
                        Agricultural land has not yet reached the 5% limit in Egypt except in rare
                        cases, but even if it had what holds good in other countries do-a not
                        necessarily apply to Egypt at present, nor will it for ma- y years to come,
                        for the fellah, now that he has been emancipated from the money lender and
                        tax collector, has a larger income than his frugal expenditure demands, for
                        his savings he has absolutely only two investments, one to dig a hole in
                        some secret corner of his house and bury his money, the other to purchase
                        land ; the former of course brings him no return whatever, the latter may
                        bring him in £3, £5, or even £10 per feddan per annum according to quality
                        of soil, etc. He does not know nor does he pare anything about per cent. per
                        annum, but what he knows and what he particularly cares about that the more
                        feddans of land he owns the greater will be his importance in the eyes of
                        his fellow-villagers and the greater the respect he will receive at their
                        hands, consequently as the fellah’s prosperity increases the value of
                        agricultural land will increase in the same proportion and this for several
                        generations to come until the fellaheen of Egypt are sufficiently educated
                        to seek other and more remunerative investments. To say that the value of
                        agricultural land in Egypt has reached its maximum is to state that the
                        prosperity of the fellaheen has also reached its maximum, whereas no one,
                        not even the Financial Advisor, will dispute the fact that much as the
                        fellah has so far prospered his prosperity of to-day is nothing to what, it
                        will be to-morrow. Turning to building lands in the chief towns of Egypt,
                        which have been subject to such enhancement of value of late, we have not
                        only Sir Vincent Corbett but many others with him paying that speculation
                        has forced up prices far above the r proper value. Is this so 1 The only way
                        of testing this fact is to compare the value of building sites in Cairo and
                        Alexandria with towns of similar size and importance in other countries ; if
                        this is done it will astonish them to find that even at the present supposed
                        inflated values the price of building sites both in Cairo and Alexandria are
                        lower and in fact in many cases less than half what they are in similar
                        situations in towns of lets importance. This may sound incredible but a
                        little enquiry </p>

                    <!-- Unedited Text -->
                    <p>can establish the point. The fact is also easy of explanation. For many years
                        the attention of the moneyed class in Egypt has been concentrated on
                        agricultural land over which large and rapid fortunes have been amassed,
                        also the large number of old houses with huge gardens and open spaces that
                        have been available for building purposes have kept the supply of building
                        sites well in excess of demand, hence the increase in value until quite
                        recently was in no way commensurate with the increased prosperity of the
                        country. During the last year or two the Government having stopped the sale
                        of all available agricultural lands, the attention of the public has been
                        diverted to building sites and there has been a rash to secure the same.
                        Naturally prices have run up but even now they are low compared with the
                        rental value of house property. In conclusion it cannot be too strongly
                        urged that officials in a position to make "ex cathedra" statements cannot
                        be too careful to confine themselves to absolute indisputable facts, or
                        there is no doubt that the constant sounding of “notes of warning” by Lord
                        Cromer in his annual reports, though actuated by the highest motives of
                        statemanship, has so far had the effect of keeping much English capital out
                        of Egypt, to the benefit of foreign countries, and now Sir Vincent Corbet’a
                        Budget Note will have the effect of still farther repelling it. The fact of
                        the matter is that our administrators, unable to bring themselves to regard
                        the extraordinarily successful results which their able and impartial
                        administration has achieved, as permanent, are seeking for an explanation
                        which they can only find in the "Speculation Bogey.”—I am, Sir, a sincere

                        of poetry by the well known humorist “Wilhelm Busch" I found a few lines

                        that I found one difficulty which is that the little fable has no title. </p>

                    <p>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</p>
                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
                        vitality—vigour--</p>
                    <p>VITAL STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY</p>
                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night
                        succeeds the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the
                        celebrated life-reviving tonic</p>

                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be

                        essence, which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had
