                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed
                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.

                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the
                        world. Also the tower or palace, the scene of “Othello'' and of Ford's

                    <head>EGYPTIAN COTTON IN ALGERIA. </head>
                    <p> Experiments in the cultivation of cotton in various French Colonies are at
                        present being carried out by "L'Association Cotonnière Co. 'oniale," which
                        was founded in 1903 with a view to encourage cotton cultivation in French
                        Colonies, and ensure an adequate supply of raw material for the cotton
                        industry of France. In Algeria especially the cultivation of cotton is being
                        eagerly prosecuted. In certain districts there possessing climatic
                        conditions similar to bose of Egypt, the experiments point to the likelihood
                        of the successful cultivation of Egyptian cotton. Of the several varieties
                        tried, Yannovitch, Abassi, and Mitafifii have been found the most promising.
                        The Yanovitch variety, which is the most valuable, has been grown with some
                        success in the province of Oran. The Abassi variety, which is the most
                        rapidly maturing, has been successfully cultivated in portions of Mostagenen
                        ; Brown | Egyptian or Mita Fifi cotton has been cultivated here and also in
                        Cbéliff ; this variety is the hardiest of the Egyptian cottons. The American
                        cottons experimented with have been somewhat less productive. "Louisiana"
                        and "Mississippi" grow well, but as the cotton produced is of much lower
                        value than the Egyptian cotton it is likely that greater attention will be
                        directed to the cultivation of the latter varieties. </p>
                    <p> It is likely that the planters will concentrate their efforts upon the
                        cultivation of varieties of Egyptian cotton, particularly Yablonovitch and
                        Mitafifi, and it is suggested that by hybridisation, types of cotton may be
                        obtained, suited to the climatic conditions of the country. The cultivators
                        have been advised in Algeria to follow the methods adopted in Egypt, where
                        sowing is completed by the end of March and the cotton is harvested by the
                        end of October. In Algeria, the harvesting is completed a little later,
                        generally by about the middle of November. </p>
                    <p> In 1905, 7,055 lb. of Algerian cotton were sold at Havre, and in 1906, the
                        amount bad increased to 27,240 lb. It is anticipated that the area under
                        cultivation will be greatly extended during the present year, and there is
                        every probability of a large increase in the amount of cotton produced.</p>

                        had, up to the time of writing, been found. </p>

                    <head>Pierre Lotis Mummies</head>
                    <p>Pierre Loti, the favourite French novelist, has obtained a new acquisition to
                        his weird and wonderful collection of Egyptian mummies. It is, says "PT.O.",
                        that of a young princess, with gilded face, almost as expressive under its
                        mask as it must have been in life. This mummy, which is one of the best in
                        the collection, accentuates in his study the smell that creeps from a
                        winding sheet when a mummy is half murolled." Loti's grievance is that his
                        servants will not move or touch his mummies under any circumstances. "Only
                        think!" he says, "pet one of my servants :world touch this beautiful young
                        woman. They are superstitious about the dead-1 had to carry her upstairs
                        myself. And, would you believe me, as I reached the landing it suddenly
                        flashed through my mind that I was carrying a corpse. I seemed to feel the
                        chill of the dead breast penetrate my own." Noticeable among the other
                        embalmed bodies of dead and gone Egyptian in Loti's study is that of a
                        little three year old girl, who stares down with sight less eyes on her

                    <p>LONDON, Friday. Mr. Benazet, speaking in the French Chamber, complained that

                        the brusque departure of Mr. Lambert, which precludes any diplomatic attempt
                        to secure the nomination of another Frenchman to the post. Mr Pichon has

                    <p> LECTURE BY MR. J.M. ROBERTSON, M.P. </p>
                    <p> Last week in the Liberal Club, Newcastle, Mr. J.M. Robertson, M.P., lectured
                        on the anb- the object of Egypt. Mr. Alfred Hewson presided. </p>
                    <p> Mr. Robertson said there should be a moral coherence between the foreign and
                        the home policy of any progressive nation. We first went into Egypt to
                        secure the regular payment of Egyptian debts to European boudbolders. He
                        would never admit that our nation had a right to do such a thing We got
                        gradually entangled more and more in Egypt. However, we were there. It must
                        not be supposed that he was proposing any policy of shuttle He perfectly
                        recognised that once we were in a country of that kind as administrators, to
                        leave suddenly would probably do more harm than any other course they might
                        take. We were in Egypt for finance. Lord Cromer had efficiently co-operated
                        with the great engineers who had been the means of improving still further
                        the wonderful natural resources of Egypt by the really scientific management
                        of the water supply But had they made out a final case when they said they
                        had financed the country well, and added to her material productivity! The
                        percentage of illiterates in the population was very high. There was no
                        ideal of moral progress as compared with the raising of the material facili,
                        ties. Indeed, the, the material prosperity had been the means of degrading
                        and lowering and worsening the people of Egypt. There could be no ultimate
                        defence of rule in India or Egypt until they could say that they were
                        raising the people in the scale of humanity as well as putting more money in
                        their pockets or food in their stomachs. The people were exploited by the
                        bond-holders, who were to say what small fraction should go to education At
                        this moment, it was impossible for any Egyptian to secure scientific
                        instruction in agriculture -- which was the principal industry of the
                        country- in his own language. It was impossible for any Egyptian to secure
                        scientific instruction in any science in his own language. He was told time
                        after time that the present system of education, the teaching of science
                        through English, taught the natives peter Bngglish nor science. They were
                        teaching the unknown through the slightly known. He admitted that wonderful
                        things had been done in the schools, but be pointed out that this did not
                        mean that the boys had thoroughly mastered 'English. We had been going on a
                        wrong tack as regarded education. In every department of the civil service
                        under Lord Cromer the English element had been increasing and the native
                        element was being depressed. We heard a good deal in this country about
                        sedition in Egypt; but we did not hear of the daily insults heaped by
                        newspapers upon the Egyptians by telling them that they were incompetent aud
                        inferior, The administration in Egypt was more auto cratic than that of
                        Russia. Sir Edward Grey, in answer to a question by Dr. Rutherford, said
                        they could not teach the art of government. Then there was no excuse for not
                        beginning at once to give the people some little experience in
                        self-government. They might keep the dividends, keep the hold on the army
                        and on the Suez Canal; but, in the name of justice, of common sense, and of
                        Liberalism, we should set up a progressive policy, and give the people of
                        Egypt a little more of government experience, by which alone could we make a
                        real nation.</p>

                        forward, and its interior is a masterpiece of decorative art The walls are
                        of a white ground with a panelling of delicate green, and the ceiling, lofty
                        enough to give the saloon a feeling of space seldom to be met with on river
                        going stenmens, is of white organised woodwork which harmonizes well with
                        the general tone of the whole, while the farni. ture of famed oak completes
                        the perfection of the idea. A very marked feature of improvement is to be
                        found in the fact that the front age of the saloon is made of plate glass,
                        thus enabling the passenger to retain their view of the country which they
                        are approaching even while at meals, and another departure which has been
                        made from the lines usually followed in the fitting of boats of this class
                        is likely to meet with immediate appreciation, inasmuch as each table is
                        supplied with its own portable electric lamp. The saloon is sufficiently
                        large to seat eighty passengers if necessary, and we will be very much
                        surprised if it is not called upon to contain its full complement, so soon
                        as the boat becomes to be well-known to the passengers to Upper Egypt</p>
                    <p>At the after end of the saloon there is a passage running across the boat
                        from port to starboard, communicating direct with the galley by a lift, and
                        the passengers will thus receive their food at practically the same heat as
                        when it left the cooking range</p>
                    <p>Still further aft there are large single cabins, surpassing in their luxury
                        and comfort anything which has hitherto been seen in Egypt, or for that
                        matter in any other river steamer service that we know after. Hackcorbin is
                        more like the well-fitted room in a comfortable dwelling house than a cabin
                        on board a steamer A large wardrobe, a folding table, &amp; marble-topped
                        washstand containing numerous drawers, a comfortable armchair, and a spring
                        bed are the chief articles of furniture which these cabins contain, and in
                        addition to the ordinary plane glass panes, each window is also fitted with
                        a vene. tian shutter and a pane of ground-glass.</p>
                    <p>At the after-end of the boat a smoking saloon runs nearly the whole beam of
                        the ship, and this again is well fitted with every regard to both taste and
                        comfort. Card and writing tables, Lenticing chairs and lounges are placed
                        about the saloon, but here, as in all other places, there is not the
                        slightest suspicion of crowding, the famitore being in perfect proportion to
                        the space which is allotted to it. A small bar communicates with this room,
                        and there is also a lavatory adjoining. Indeed one need never enter one's
                        cabin for the purpose of washing | ones bands, lavatories being plentiful at
                        every point on each of the deeks.</p>
                    <p>The goun papion way to the lower deck is of the design usually followed on
                        the P&amp;O. stenders, and it is unquestionably the only river steamer that
                        offers sufficient head room to a tall man to descend without risk of damage
                        to his head. The first cabins on this lower deck | are four berthed and
                        intended for the use of European servants, but further aft there are Thuge
                        double berth cabins ; indeed cabin hard| ly describes them for they are
                        really far more like saloons, and the luxuriance of appointments is fully
                        sustained. Here also nothing has been forgotten, an electric light button is
                        to your hand upon entering the cabin and another is placed at the bed head.
                        The cabins are well lighted and airy. In short they are perfection, and on
                        this |deck there is a dark-room for those who wish to do their own
                        photography, and there are also a certain number of single berth cabins, But
                        the acme of luxury is attained on the top deck where are situated the
                        "cabins de luxe' these suites comprising &amp; sitting room and lavatory in
                        addition to the usual bedroom, and it is hard to imagine a more delightful
                        way of spending ones time in Egypt than to drowse away the hours in such
                        quarters as this on the bosom of the gently flowing Nile. There are tour of
                        these suites, the drawing room oven paying the space immediately forward and
                        the green panelled' walls of the dining saloon are repeated here, though
                        with a slight difference of design more suited to the nature of the room,
                        and a carpet of scarlet gives a wonderful effect of light and contrast which
                        is not unpleasing.</p>
                    <p>Though the actual beam of the boat is given at 80 feet it must exceed that by
                        a good additional ten feet where amidships large open space has been left
                        free from cabins *This will naturally be the entertainment ground of the
                        steamer also; we noticed "bull" - and other games in the vicinity, and a
                        piano e also proclaimed the nature of the place.</p>
                    <p>Behind this space there are numerous other a single cabins. To describe them
                        would be only elibe to repeat the praise which has been bestowed upon the
                        others, for as we have already 1 lisaid, nothing that is cramped or mean ha
                        Je been permitted to enter into the scheme of things at all, </p>
                    <cb n="4"/>
                    <p>At either end of the boat there are Tongues for who those prefer the more
                        silent spots, and the forward and Messrs Cook have taken the wise, s
                        precaution of fitting a plato glass screen, which can be opened or closed at
                        desire. This idea will be greatly appreciated during the colder evenings,
                        when, without it, it would be impossible to remain out on deok at all. The
                        scheme of color with which the boat is decorated is most fascinating in its
                        effect, white grounding with dark green relief being the base of all the
                        decoration, and altogether it may truly be said that the "Egypt" is a
                        floating palace, and we wish her every success on her maiden voyage which is
                        advertised to be made to-tomorrow. </p>

                        K.S.C, team had never played together before and were therefore considerably
                        handicapped. They ought, however, to have made a better fight. Mr. Napier
                        made one brilliant ren, scoring their only goal. The Gaards played good polo
                        and kept their places. </p>

                        the 60th only just managed to save their goal on several occasions. Just as
                        the bell rang the Dragoons hit through. From the throw in Mr. Bowen dashed
                        away up the ground and scored a beautiful goal, Another was soon afterwards
                        added by Capt. Nixon. Towards the end of the third chukker Capt. Holland
                        unfortunately bad a bad fall and broke his collarbone, bis pony coming down
                        with him. Mr. de Calry took bis place and the game was resumed. The third
                        ohukker the 60th scored goal thus bringing the score to 3 to 2. lo the 4th
                        chukker the 60th were the attacking part and a brilliant ran by Capt.
                        Johnson ending up with a fine shot through the goal brought the score to 3
                        to 2. During the last 8 or 4 minutes play the 60th made strenuous efforts to
                        equalise but without success. The tournament will be continued to-day. </p>

                    <head>Industrial Building and Commercial Company of Egypt Limited</head>
                    <p> Au moment où tout le monde discute de la situation de cette société, nous
                        avons eru intéressant de mettre sous les yeux de nos lec teurs quelques
                        explications que nous avons demandées à la Direction. Nous les reproduisons
                        telles quelles sans commentaires de notre part et à simple titre de
                        renseignement, sous la responsabilité de la direction qui nous les a
                        fournies. </p>
                    <p> L'Industrial, Building and Commercial Com pany of Egypt Limited, appelée
                        communément Karam du nom de son principal promoteur, été formée en février
                        dernier au capital de £ 500.000, en 499,375 actions de £ 1 et 12,500 parte
                        de fondateur de 1 shelling. Mais il n'a été émis que 299.375 actions. </p>
                    <p>Aux termes mêmes du prospectos d'émission 50.000 actions ont été allouées à
                        M.Karam 25000 a M. Campos et 8000 à M. Scilipoti, er tout 83000 actions
                        revenant aax promoteure pour apports divers à la société.</p>
                    <p> Il restait 216,375 actions dont le premier versement de 10 shellings a été
                        intégralement encaissé. Quant au deuxième versement, 110,000 actions environ
                        sont restées libérées seulement de 10 shellings, soit un déficit de 55000
                        livres environ sur lesquelles l'administration était en droit de compter. De
                        ce qui précède il résulte que la société a encaissé environ 163,000 livres. </p>
                    <p> Sur ce chiffre, toujours pour apports faits à la société, M. Karam a reça £
                        40000 au comp tant, M. Campos £ 22000, M. Mattioli £ 5400, M. Soilipoti £
                        8700, ce qui avec les £ 8000 de frais généraux de constitution fait un total
                        de £ 84000. Quand on aura ajouté à ce chiffre £25000 pour la construction de
                        la scierie du Caire, le capital immobilisé dans le fonds de roulement et les
                        dépenses faites à la plâtrière du Mariont, on comprendra que le conseil
                        d'administration n'a pas de fortes disponibilités et que s'il vent donner
                        plus d'envergure à ses affaires, il est obligé, comme il est en train de le
                        faire, d'exercer une pression sur les actionnaires en retard du dernier
                        versement. </p>
                    <p> D'autre part, on conçoit partaitement que oes derniers refusent de complèter
                        leur sold de 10 shellings, quand ils peuvent acheter en place à 5 shellings
                        des titres complètement libérés. </p>
                    <p>Ceci dit, entrons dans quelques détails su "les affaires de la société. </p>
                    <p> Où le manque d'argent entrave le plus le intérêts de la Klam, c'est à la
                        platrière de Mariont, qui n'a pu être mise en exploitation faute de
                        capitaux. Il paralt, cependant, d'après un rapport très minutieux du conseil
                        d'administration, que le gisement contient une réserve de plâtre de un
                        million et demi de tonnes. Des techniciens comme MM. Daujat, Tivoli et
                        d'autres qui se sont rendus sur les lieux sont revenus émerveillés tant de
                        la quantité que de la qualité du platre. On a déjà båti la maison de la
                        direction et des maisons ouvrières et on est en train de faire construire
                        une ligne de garage entre la station de Garbagnat et l'em placement de la
                        future usine. La société n'at tepd que d'avoir les fonds nécessaires pour
                        exploiter le précieux gisement. </p>
                    <p> Bien que ce ne fut pas dans son programme la société acheta de M. Campos
                        environ 100.000 pios carrés de terrains, situés à Ramleh en plasieurs
                        parcelles à Khedivah Palace, Zahrieh, etc. La valeur de ces terrains a été
                        entièrement garantie à la société par M Karam, qui en a endossé toute la
                        responsabi lité. Le conseil a l'intention de revendre ces terrains avec un
                        bénéfice ou d'y élever des villas qu'elle vendra ensuite. De cette façon
                        elle assurerait à son personnel de cons truotion un ouvrage continu et
                        régulier, même dans les intervalles de calme passager. </p>
                    <p> Les constructions confiées à la société dans la ville d'Alexandrie sont
                        assez nombreuses pour que la direction espère retirer de cette branche des
                        profits appréciables. La Société est restée, entre autres, adjndicataire de
                        la construction des écoles du Gouvernement à Moharrem Bey pour un chiffre
                        qui atteindra probablement 100.000 L.E. Actuellement elle transforme
                        l'ancien local de la Compagnie du Gaz pour en faire le nouveau siège du
                        Comptoir Financier et Commercial. </p>
                    <p> Pour travaux professionnels de son bureau technique, à savoir projets,
                        devis, expertises etc. la société a déja réalisé de 450 à 500 livres. </p>
                    <p> La scierie mécanique, achetée de M. Scilipoti au Gabbari est en pleine
                        activité. Le bénéfice ne peut être évalué avant d'avoir procédé à
                        l'inventaire, ce qui demande du temps. Mais l'administration estime d'ores
                        et déjà que cette entreprise donnera de beaux rendements, puisqu'on a été
                        obligé dernièrement de refuser des commandes, le maximum des moyens de
                        production étant atteint. Une autre scierie mécanique plus importante sera
                        bientôt inaugurée au Caire sur un terrain que la société a acquis dans ce
                        but près du pont de Gamrah Les machines sont déjà installées et il manque
                        peu de chose pour mettre l'usine en marche. </p>
                    <p> Vous le voyez, ajoute notre interlocuteur, toutes les branches que la
                        société a pu mettre en exploitation paraissent appelées au succès. Ce n'est
                        que faute par certains actionnaires en retard d'avoir versé leur solde que
                        l'administration se trouve paralysée au point de vne pécuniaire, en ce qui
                        concerne par exemple la plâtrière du Mariout et le département constructions
                        du Caire qui a do suspendre ses travaux, faute de fonds. Aussi le conseil se
                        proposetil d'appliquer aux actionnaires récaloitrants les règlements des
                        statuts,aux termes desquels leurs actions reviendront à la société qui
                        pourra les considérer comme des actions à réemettre et le montant versé sera
                        acquis à la Société. En aùpposant qu'il y ait 110.000 actions dans o cas, la
                        capital social se trouverait de la sorte réduit à £190,000 contre lesquelles
                        la société <cb n="1"/>dieposerait d'une réserve de £65.000. -A l'article
                        terrains Campos nous avons omis de dire qu'un lot a déjà été vendu à
                        l'Egyptian Hydraulic Stones Co. avec un bénéfice de £1500, ce qui représente
                        40% de profit sur la superficie vendue. </p>

                    <p>Aujourd'hui d midi</p>
                    <p> L'annonce que la Banque d'Angleterre ne réduirait pas son taux d'escompte à
                        cause de la demande d'or américaine a eu sa répercussion sur notre place où
                        l'on s'attendait généralement, à cette réduction pour aider à la treprise.
                        Comme bier la corbeille est morne ; on ne fait rien ou à peu près, au point
                        qu'une demande ou une offre insignifiantes suffisent occasionner des
                        oscillations disproportionnées,, fente de contrepartie. En somme, c'est un
                        marché restreint, sans rien de saillant. IL y a eu quelques affaires en
                        Agricole, Delta Light, Daïra et Union Foncière. L'Aboukir, qui était
                        demandée sans vendeurs et vela depuis quelques jours, était offerte
                        aujourd'hui. Les valeurs égyptiennes cotées à Paris sont calmes. Une offre
                        de Urbaine a ramené le cours de ce titre de 3 7/16 à 8 1/4. Bref, l'ensemble

                    <p> D'un confrère de Londres : </p>
                    <p> Je manquerais à mes devoirs de chroniqueur, si je ne vous signalais
                        l'augmentation du capital, de £20,000 à £40,000, de la "Société des
                        Etendards,” fondée à l'usage de notre confrère Mustapha Kamel pacha. Il est
                        inutile de vous dire que le pacha s'est dispensé de soumettre à
                        l'approbation des actionnaires le bilan, qui doit révéler, sans aucun doute,
                        un véritable désastre. Mais quoi ! un tel bilan présente-t-il au point de
                        vue financier un intérêt quelconque? Mustafa a préféré en relater les effets
                        moraux. Il a conté à l'assemblée ses exploits et le succès de ses journaux
                        en Europe (sic). </p>
                    <p> Voilà donc comment, à défaut de dividende, les actionnaires des “Étendards"
                        ont été payés par de belles paroles! </p>

                            been agreed upon, that is a visit of the Russian squadron to Italy for
                            the first time in 5 years. This assumes a special interest considering
                            the strained relations between the two countries after the Tsar
                            abandoned the idea of returning the visit paid to him by King Victor at
                            St. Petersburg Indeed this visit may be the prelude to the Tsar coming
                            to the Eternal City. The squadron is composed of the men of war
                            "Tsarevitch," "Slavo," and "Bogatir," having on board Russian cadets.
                            They will arrive in Genoa on January 3rd, and remain there until the
                            10th, going after to Spezia. The Admiral, superior officers, and a
                            certain number of cadets will come to Rome, where they will be received
                            by the King, and in whose honour Admiral Mirabello, Minister of the
                            Navy, and M. Muravieff, Russian Ambassador, to whose ability is due the
                            re-establishment of cordial relations between the two countries and the
                            conclusion of a commercial treaty, will give several entertainments.</p>
                        <p>From Spezia the Russian squadron will go to Biserta, returning from there
                            to Naples in the middle of February and sailing afterwards for
                            Gibraltar.</p>

                        <p>Berlin, December 5. The sitting of the Reichstag was suspended yesterday
                            after a stormy scene in consequence of Herr Paasche, the
                            National-Liberal leader, attacking the Government in connection with the
                            army scandals. It is stated that Prince von Buelow has threatened to
                            resign.</p>
                        <p>The official "Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" says that it is hopeless
                            to conduct parliamentary business if the coalition parties continue to

                            M. Lambert in Cairo, declared that Great Britain out of friendship for

                    <p>The second ordinary general meeting of the Anglo-Belgian Company of Egypt,
                        Limited, was held on the 28th Nov.at the Cannon-street Hotel, under the

                    <p>The Secretary (Mr. G.T. Broadbridge, P|F.C.I.S.) having read the notice
                        calling the meeting and the auditors' report.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman, in the course of an exhaustive speech, said: Although you will
                        have seen from the report that there is no question of paying a dividend at
                        the present moment nevertheless your directors have considered it advisable
                        to call a meeting now, instead of waiting to close the books at the end of
                        the year, when we should probably have been able to put a more attractive
                        report and profit and loss account before you. This company was
                        incorporated, as you are aware, on March 3, 1906, as an English company, the
                        nominal capital being £1,000,000 in 200,000 shares of £5 each. The
                        prospectus of the company, offering 100,000 of these shares for
                        subscription, was dated March 6, 1906. The total number of shares allotted
                        to date is 70,000, which has produced, £346,680 108. working capital. As you
                        know, the company has acquired a controlling interest in the Fayoum Light
                        Railways Company (an Egyptian company), which railway is situated in the
                        Payoum Province, near Cairo, and is about 168 kilomètres equal to about 108
                        English miles in length. As you may remember, this concession gives the
                        monopoly ot light railways in the Fayoum Province-one of the most fertile in
                        Egypt, and one in which a great development is taking place. The controlling
                        interest which we possess consists of holding in the railway company
                        sufficient of its shares and obligations to be able to control its business
                        management (about four-fifths of the whole), and, apart altogether from
                        possessing the control of the railway company's capital, we also have the
                        control on the board of that company. As your chairman, I also hold the
                        office of president of the railway company, and another of your directors
                        (Monsieur Freson) is the vice-president, whilst still another (Monsieur
                        Florent Lambert) is also on the board of the railway. I may mention that we
                        have on the railway board English and Belgian gentlemen who have great
                        experience and success in the management of light railways, whose expert
                        advice is therefore of inestimable value.</p>
                    <p>As you were informed in the prospects, and again at our statutory meeting of
                        last year, the condition of the railways company when we took it over left a
                        great deal to be desired ; in fact, nothing could be more severe than the
                        strictures passed upon the old administration of that company by Lord
                        Cromer, in his report of last year. The carrying out of the programme of
                        reform necessarily required a considerable amount of time and the
                        expenditure of a considerable sum of money. You will be pleased to know that
                        when I and one of your directors (Monsieur Freson) went to Egypt last
                        winter, to negotiate with the Government regarding modifications in the
                        concession which we had requested, we were able to satisfy the Government
                        that their requirements with regard to the conduct of the company had been
                        given effect to, with the result that the modifications asked for by us have
                        now been granted. I should also tell you that we have obtained the advantage
                        of postponing the date at which the Government has the right to purchase the
                        line ----some three years. We have made great strides towards putting the
                        undertaking upon a thoroughly good and effective basis, which will mean
                        increased profits in the future. At the general meeting of the railways
                        company held in Cairo, on February 25 of this year, we bad the satisfaction
                        of reporting that not only had we expended large sums in carrying out the
                        major part of our programme, but that, for the first time in the annals of
                        the company, interest had been paid in cash, and a resolution? was passed at
                        that meeting authorising the directors to pay during the current year the
                        coupon on the debentures which still remained in arrears.</p>
                    <p>Having given figures as to the actual work ing of the railway, showing
                        increased traffic receipts and a reduction of the ratio of the working
                        expenses, the Chairman said that be had no hesitation in saying that, in his
                        opinion and that of the management of the railway company, they would not
                        regret the acquisition of that company's control. Proceeding, be said : I do
                        not think I can do better, by way of illustrating to you the progress that
                        has been made since we took over the control, than quote to you from the
                        report made by Lord Cromer in the Blue-Book issued before his retirement, in
                        which he reports to the Foreign Office here as follows: "There are now 1,145
                        kilomètres of agricultural railways open in Egypt. All the three companies
                        concerned seem to be doing well. Notably, there has been a great improvement
                        in the management of the Fayoum lines, upon whose administration I have
                        animadverted in previous reports. European agency has been introduced into
                        the management, with the result that in 1906 the working expenses were L.E.
                        4,000 less and the net earning L.E. 6,000 more than in 1906." I may remark
                        that we feel somewhat proud to have had such a commendation passed upon our
                        management from such a high authority. Having such a stake in the Fayoum
                        Railway Company, it was, of course, to our manifest interest to push that
                        concern ahead as much as ever we could, and to do that it was necessary to
                        provide it with the means of adding to its rolling stock, locomotives,
                        &amp;c., and we therefore entered into a contract with the railway company
                        to make them a loan of £82,000, <cb n="3"/> with interest at the rate of 6
                        percent per annum and this loan will be redeemed by the railway company by
                        the creation of a sinking fund We are of opinion that this loan is an
                        excellent investment, not merely from the rate o interest earned (and which
                        is regularly paid but principally from the fact that this financing is
                        enabling the railway company to augment its rolling stock and locomotives,
                        and general overhaul its permanent way and other important matters which, to
                        a progressing con cern, as a railway ought to be, is an important factor. In
                        addition to this loan which we have made to the railway company, it i
                        further indebted to us in the sum of £28,51188 being a debt taken over by
                        this company included in the purchase price paid for the shares and
                        obligations of the railway company Particulars as to our land and properties
                        are count you will see set forth in the balance sheet. One purchase of land
                        which we have made consists of 10,612 square metres a Shoubrah. We have had
                        this land divider into 22 plots, and recently, in the midst of the most
                        acute stage of the financial crisis in Egypt, we disposed of one of these
                        plots at al exceedingly good profit. It we dispose of the other plots on
                        this estate with a profit of one half that made on the plot already sold,
                        thi whole transaction would result in a profit of between £12,000 and.
                        £15,000 ; but we had originally intended to erect villas upon thi plots, and
                        if the condition of Egyptian affair permits our adhering to this policy, the
                        profit to the company should be on a far larger scale </p>
                    <p>With regard to the profit and loss account you will observe that there is
                        shown a net profit of £2,311 16s. 8d., and I cannot help thinking that this
                        is an exceedingly satisfactory position to arrive at when, as I have stated
                        earlier in my remarks, all our properties have been taken an oost, and when
                        it is borne in mind that during the last few months of the winter season-ati
                        time when we expected to release at least some of our purchases-Egyptian
                        affairs passed through a most acute financial crisis. You will have noticed
                        from the directors' report that the sum of £7,044 49. 4d., interest on the
                        company's Fayoum obligations for the year 1904-5, being the date previous to
                        which the company acquired such obligations, has beer written off
                        preliminary expenses, instead of being taken into profit and loss. In
                        adopting this course the directors were supported by the company's legal
                        advisers. I should observe that the accrued interest on the Fayoum
                        debentures coupons for 1907 does not appear in the accounts, and therefore
                        our position is really better than it appears from the same by some £2,035.
                        To refer once more to our land acquisitions, our representatives in Egypt
                        had the same valued by two local firms of experts, with the object of
                        ascertaining from their value. tion whether what we had acquired had
                        depression. coated or appreciated. One valuation showed a depreciation of
                        £9,800—or only of about 5 per cent.-while the other showed an appreciation
                        of £7,580. To set your minds at rest on this point, and to prove to you that
                        we have sustained no loss in our investments in this direction. I would like
                        to tell you that in our opinion the valuations were pessimistic, and we are
                        confirmed in this opinion by the fact that since the valuation in question,
                        or, rather, whilst the valuation was actually taking place, we sold a
                        portion of one of our properties at nearly double the price put upon it in
                        the said valuation. And again, two months ago we received an offer for the
                        exchange of a portion of another of our properties against some agricultural
                        land upon a basis that would pay the price of the property in question 75
                        per cent. higher than that put upon it in the valuation. I now beg to move :
                        "That the report and accounts as at July 31, 1907, be adopted." </p>
                    <p>Mr. G. Carlier seconded the motion, which was carried unanimously. Messrs.
                        Russell, Kerr and Wyatt were reappointed auditors, and a vote of thanks to
                        the chairman, moved by Mr. Bird and seconded by Sir Thomas Pile, concluded

                    <head>British Slaves in Turkey</head>
                    <p>A Quaint Request</p>
                    <p>A bequest by Mr. Thomas Betton, a wealthy ironmonger who died in 1724, of
                        one-half the residue of his estate to the Ironmongers' Company, to be
                        devoted to "the redemption of British slaves in Turkey or Barbary," was the
                        subject of considerable discussion before Mr. Justice Swinfen Fady in the
                        Chancery Division last Thursday. For over a hundred years after the death of
                        the testator large sums were employed in carrying out his wishes, the last
                        payment being made in 1825. The income being then much more than sufficient
                        for the object in view, a scheme for the management of the fund was
                        formulated in Chancery. The scheme to which the present litigation applied
                        was established by the Charity Commissioners, who, under the powers
                        conferred upon them by the Board of Education Act, 1899, decided that the
                        money should be applied for educational purposes. The Ironmongers' Company,
                        what are the trustees of the fund, appealed against the scheme on the ground
                        that its effect was to devote permanently to educational purposes <cb n="4"
                        />trust money bequeathed for the redemption of British slaves. The full
                        terms of the bequest were: "I give and bequeath the rest and residue of my
                        estate wheresoever and whatsoever to the Worshipful Company or Corporation
                        of Ironmongers of the City of London and their successors, making them my
                        executors upon this special trust and confidence in them reposed, that is to
                        say that they do with all convenient speed that may be after my decease
                        place my estate out at interest upon good securities, positively forbidding
                        them to diminish the capital sum by giving away any part thereof, or that
                        the interest and profit arising be applied to any other use or uses than
                        hereinafter mentioned and directed, namely, that they do pay one full half
                        portion of the said interest and profit of my whole estate yearly and for
                        every year for ever unto the redemption of British slaves in Turkey or
                        Barbary, one full tourth-part of the said interest and profit yearly, and
                        every year for ever unto charity schools in the City and suburbs of London
                        where the education is according to the Church of England, in which number
                        that in this parish is to be included, and not giving any one above £20 per
                        year, and in consideration of the said Ironmongers' Company's care and pains
                        in the execution of this my will the other one-fourth part of the said
                        interest and profit yearly and for every year for ever to the uses
                        following, namely, £10 a year to such minister of the Church of England as
                        they shall from time to time enjoin in their hospital for performing the
                        Divine service and other duties belonging to the Holy Order, and the remains
                        unto necessitated decayed freemen of the said Company, their wives, and
                        children not exceeding £10 a year to any family." </p>
                    <p>Mr. Justice Swinfen Bady asked if there was now no British subject held in
                        captivity under Moslem rule. Mr. Eve, K.C. - At the present moment there may
                        be a quarter where the fund would be extremely acceptable, and might be
                        applied as the testator contemplated. | Mr. Justice Swinfen Eady held that
                        the scheme of the Charity Commissioners did not in any way restrict or alter
                        the object of the charity, or prevent the fund at some future time being
                        applied under some different or altered scheme to other than educational
                        purposes if circumstances should arise rendering that course expedient. </p>
