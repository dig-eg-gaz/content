<head>SPEECH BY LORD CROMER.</head>

<head>THE CONDITIONS OF EGYPT'S

PROGRESS.</head>

<head>(Special Cable to the Gazette.)</head>

<p>London, June 30.

The Earl of Cromer has received the honorary

freedom of the Skinners’ Company. His lord-

ship, in replying to. the toast of his health,

declared that the Anglo French Agreement

had been of unmixed benefit to all who had

to deal with the local affairs of Egypt and

wore now relieved from the constant friction

and annoyance that haul marked the past.

The story circulated in the Press to the effect

that representations had been made to H.H.

the Khedive as to the presence of British

troops in Egypt was purely mythical. Four

conditions were necessary to secure the uniform

progress of Egypt : first, no hurry; second,

that Egyptian affairs should be kept outside

the domain of British party politics ; third,

that the utmost care should be taken not to

force Western ideas and exotic institutions

upon the Egyptian people before the country

was ripe for their assimilation; fourth, that

Egypt should continue in the future as in the

past to be governed in the interests of the

Egyptians themselves.</p>

<head>THE S.S. “ST. KILDA.”</head>

<head>CREW LANDING AT PORT SAID</head>

<head>INTERVIEW WITH CAPTAIN.</head>

<head>HOW THE VESSEL WWAS SUNK.</head>

<head>(From our owmn Correspondent.)</head>

	<p>Sfiez, Friday.

As I advised yon this morning by wire, I

proceeded on board the Russian cruiser

“Dnieper” (ex “St. Petersburg”) In order to

interview the crew of the sunken British

steamer “St. Kilda,” but the officer on duty

absolutely refused tO allow me to see any of

the British offCoers, saying that it was strictly

forbidden. He added at the same time that

they would probably oe landed at Fort Said,

I understand, however, that the S.S. “St.

Kilda” left Hongkong for Yokohama on the

4th June, with a cargo of rice, cotton, and

hemp, and when 40 miles out she met the

Russian Cruiser "Dnieper,” which signalled to

her to stop. A "prize crew was subsequently

put on board, and next- day, when the crew

had been removed, the cruiser sank the “St.

Kilda” after firing ten shots. All the personal

effects belonging to the crew were lost. 41 of

the Chinese crew belonging to the “St Kilda”

were transferred to the Dutch steamer “Flores”

and landed at Singapore, while the British

officers were retained and brought here.

It is remarkable that' the “Dnieper,’’ in spite

of the long voyage and the heavy seas she en-

countered, has the appearance of having been

recently drydocked. She is heavily armed with

large and small machine guns, and fitted with

wireless apparatus. She is also flying the naval

flag. J

At about 9.30 a.m. to-day the Russian com-

mander paid an official call on the commander

of the British battleship "Canopus,” which was

duly retamed. The same offcoial calls were

exchanged later on between the battleship

“Goliath,” which arrived at 10.30 a.m., and

the “Dnieper.”

The battleship “Goliath” was reported by

the “Canopus” as approaching Suez at 7 a.m.,

>eing in wireless communication with her.

Finally the battleship "Canopns” entered

the Canal at i 1.15 this morning. *

The "Goliath” left at 1.40 this afternoon,

and the “Dnieper” at 1.55 for Port Said, where,

!, understand, she will take in about 300 tons

of ooal, not having taken anything at this

port.</p>
<div type=“item”>

<p>(From our own Correspondent.) ,

Port Said, Saturday.

After considerable difficulties had been put

in my way I at last obtained an interview

with Captain Jones, of the S.S. “St. Kilda.”

Captain Jones states that' the “St. Kilda”

left Hongkong on Jane 2 last. The Europ%p

crew refused to proceed to Japan and were

lauded at Hongkong on Jane 3 and impri-

soned. A Chinese crew was shipped and

the "St. Kilda” sailed for Yokohama on the

same day.

'On Jane 4 theRassian cruiper “Dnieper”

stopped and.captured the “St. Kilda,” putting

a prize orew on board. The ships proceeded at

a speed of nine knots in oompany into deep

water and at 6 a.m. on the 5th Jane an un-

successful attempt was made to sink the

“St. Kilda” by means of dynamite, after

the crew had been taken off. The Russians

then opened fire with their quick-firers and

sank the captured vessel with 16 4.7 inch

projectiles at 10 a.m.

The “St. Kilda” was bound from Rangoon

to Yokohama with a cargo of rice, cotton, and

sugar. The “Dnieper” had been warned of

her departure by Russian agents at Hong-

Jcong. After the vessel had been sank the

Chinese crew were put on board the S.S.

“Flores,” bound for Singapore.

The prisoners, who were thirteen in number,

were well treated on the “Dnieper,” being each

allowed a cabin and having perfect freedom

of movement abont the decks.

The commander of the “Dnieper”' refused

to receive the visit of the captain of H.M.S.

•’Lancaster” this morning. The Russian cruiser

carries eight 4.7q.f. -guns and 27 pieces of

smaller calibre ; she is bound for Liban and

the prisoners have received orders to disembark

at Port Said to-night.	.</p>

<head>DANGEROUS GAMINS.<head>

<p>We wish to call the attention of the autho-

rities to the dangerous use of catapults in the

streets by European and Arab boys. These

gapiins appear to be supplied with up-to-date

weapons, and samples of their ammunition

which we have seen look most formidable,

small bolt heads and chopped iron bars being

the pattern most in favour. Every evening

parties of boys may be seen in the quieter

streets, especially in the Moharrem Bay quarter,

shooting at the small birds whioh settle on the

tamarisks planted'by the road. We imagine'

that the use of catapults on the public roads is

forbidden, and there can be no doubt about the

i'legality of their nse when missiles are fired

into gardens with disastrous consequences to

windows and grave risk to the eyesight of

those who happen to be in the line of fire.

Even the Mohamed Aly-sqnare is rendered

unsafe : the windows of St Mark’s Church

have repeatedly been broken by stones and

lamps of iron. Mr. Casimatis, of the Anglo-

Egyptian Bank, whom is also in charge of part

of the business administration of the church,

has made an interesting collection of ammnni-

tion fired into the windows and has captured

two of the culprits, whom he handed over to

the police—without any obvious result. This

morning the bowab of the church^w^s struck

on the left side of the face by a stone from a

! catapult which infiioted a very nasty wonnd.

Had the missile struck the unfortunate man

an inch higher he would probably have lost

the sight o^one eye. We hope that the autho-

rities will take steps to render the repetition

1 ot the offence highly dangerous to the offenders.</p>

<p>This new company, founded last year, hopes

to inaugurate the Port Said to Matarieh

branch of its service across Lake Menzaleh

about the middle of October. The Matarieh

to Damietta section will also be completed

soon after, dredging operations being now

hastened for that purpose. The distance

between the former two places is some 28

kilometres, and the same distance separates;

Damietta from Matarieh, where the lake service

works in conneotion with the passenger trains

of the Compagnie des Chemins de for de la

Basse Egygte to Mansonrah and at the latter

town in coincidence with those of the Sta’e

Railways.	c

In October therefore there will be a through

service between Cairo and Port Said by rail-

way and passenger steamer. For the latter

traffic there are two stern-wheelers for passen

gers besides two togs and six lighters for

the freight traffic. All these were constructed

in England, brought oat in sections, and put

together at Karpati, near Port Sail, by the

Anglo-American Nile Steamer Co., who have

entered into a contract to work the lines of

the Menzaleh Canal and Navigation Company

for two years from the date of inauguration.

The steamers have good accommodation each

for a certain number of first and second class

<p>THE DANGER

(Continued.)—^

-The great line that runs tike an artery

rom Constantinople to Konieh is to be carried

on across the Taurus to branch off eastward

to Bagdad and Koweit, southward to Aleppo

and the Syrian system, is a military line par

excellence. Its two branches will one day aid

the German Empire to strike Britain in Aria

and Afhoa. German diplomacy in Turkey has

never ceased to keep the question of Egypt

and Arabia alive and to suggest the possi-

bility that a new Turkish army may

day inflict on Britain the Btroke of Exoatibnr, \

from whioh there is no recovery, cleaving in 1

twain the Empire withont the slightest inter

ference on the part of the fleet on whioh

England’s hopes are centred.

The Turko-German Staff aima at nothing

less than an immediate advance on Egypt

by an overwhelming Ottoman army, should

war unhappily break out between Germany

and Great Britain after the comply., 0f

the Ottoman strategic tines. The snooessof

the invasion would involve the suppression of

the Mixed regime, the substitution of a dele-

gate of the Soltan for our enlightened Sovereign

and his British friends and advisers, while the

direoting power—which wonta not

its position too strongly -» would be the

German Empire. “ Delenda eat Carthago ”

and “ Unsere Zukonft liegt am Wasser"

have an identical meaning in Germany. Her

chief continental rival has been beaten down at

Mukden and Tsusima by her adversary’s ally,

and the Turkish. alliance. originally d—

<head>FAYOUM LIGHT RAILWAY CO.<head>

<p>A correspondent writes:—Apropos of acc

cidents on this railway, they are of almost

daily occurrence now. On Friday last the

Nesleh engine broke down as it was about

to leave for Fayoum ; another engine was

sent, bat never reached its destination, and

as no other was available passengers and

train had necessarily to wait until one of

the other branch trains arrived at Fayoum,

when -that engine was sent and succeeded

in returning home with its unfortunate com-

panions “hoars late.”

The Shawashna train on the same day

was never seen at Fayoum. A few days ago

a funeral party ordered a "special” for 3 p.m.

for Daire el Azab; they arrived and had to

sit in the train in the broiling afternoon

sun until 5.30 p.m., when the engine from

Lahoon took the train. No other was available.

Last year the traffic receipts were published

pretty regularly and always showed an increase.

It would interest many to know' why they

are now suppressed, as LE. 300 a month

will not cover the decrease of receipts, and

from what can be gathered it is likely to

be still more. It really is time the public

were better served and these directors were

that the native who is “running the show” at
