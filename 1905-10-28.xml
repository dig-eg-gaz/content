                                    <head>THE WAKFS SCHOOLS</head>
                                    <p>In his recently published report on the Wakfs Administration
                                        Harari Pasha makes some interesting remarks on the schools
                                        and kuttabs dependent thereon, and on the effect of the
                                        reforms introduced by the Ministry of Public Instruction,
                                        which has of late years taken over the administration of
                                        these estab- lishments. Although the level of efficiency has
                                        risen since these reforms were intitiated, the instruction
                                        received by the children is of so elementary a character
                                        that they are not likely to be fitted thereby for a
                                        commercial or professional career, or for the public
                                        services. In 1901 Harari Pasha, realising the impos-
                                        sibility, for the time at least, of effecting any very
                                        general improvement, introduced a system of selecting the
                                        pick of the boys taught in these schools and giving them a
                                        professional apprenticeship in the railway workshops, the
                                        Boulac Arsenal, and other Government tech- nical
                                        establishments. The apprentices spent half their working day
                                        at the Wakfs schools and half at the State workshops, but it
                                        was soon found (in 1904, to be exact) that the pupils were
                                        too young to stand the fatigue of mani- pulating heavy
                                        tools, etc., the Wakfs regula- tions forbidding boys over 14
                                        years of age to remain at the kuttabs, and that their school
                                        work suffered. Other boys made the mistake, common in Egypt,
                                        of imagining that a little learning had made them experts,
                                        and promptly took service under masters for a low salary,
                                        leaving school and work- shops alike. These young paragons
                                        were pro- bably soon taught by their employers to form a
                                        more exact estimate of their own powers, but by the time
                                        they had learnt that lesson they could not profit by it. At
                                        present apprentices who have given proofs of competence are
                                        given certificate signed by the heads of the technical
                                        establishment where they work, and can then remain, if
                                        wanted, at these establishments or seek work elsewhere.
                                        Employers will probably seek work elsewhere. Employers will
                                        probably have the sense to select employers from among the
                                        holders of such certificates whenever pos- sible, and if the
                                        experiment be persisted in, the public will be the gainer.
                                        It is to be hoped that both the Wakfs Administration and the
                                        Ministry of Public Instruction will see fit to continue and
                                        to extend the experiment, which cannot be abandoned without,
                                        depriving a number of boys of the chance of bettering their
                                        position and becoming skilled workmen. In these days when
                                        every young Egyptian seems to aim at becoming a doctor, a
                                        lawyer, a State employe, or a speculator, technical
                                        knowledge and efficiency are two of the chief de iderate of
                                        the country.</p>

                                    <p>The officials of the Ministry of Communica- tions, which is
                                        connected with the Administra- tion of State railways, have
                                        s track, as also the officials of the Congress of Zemstvos
                                        in the city and provinces. The Social Democrat leaders have
                                        organised the sale of rifles and cartridges to the
                                        strikers.</p>
                                    <p>Remarkable scones have taken place at Karkoff. 3,000 students
                                        held the University for two days, erecting barricados. Arms
                                        were obtained and distributed. Eventually a com- mittee for
                                        the public safety was formed which negotiated the Bartender
                                        of the University, on condition that the students should
                                        leave the barricades unarmed, but exempt from arrest or
                                        prosecution. (Reuter)</p>

                                    <p><persName>General Trepoft</persName> has issued a stern
                                        warning in which he says that he will nip the disorders in
                                        the bud. He has ordered the troops and police to suppress
                                        any outbreaks with ball cartridge without hesitation.</p>

                                        chemists, and lawyers, have decid- ed to strike until a
                                        Constitutional Assembly be summoned.</p>
                                    <p>It is stated that 50,000 professional men are involved, and
                                        the effect will be most disas- trous if the strike last.</p>
                                    <p>Martial law has been proclaimed at Karkoff, but the strike
                                        movement is making headway without disturbances. Fresh
                                        provisions are at exorbitant prices here, and the garrison
                                        has been placed on short rations. (Reuter)</p>

                                        have been issued here and elsewbere. A strike has broken out

                                        some remarkably good articles on the moral training of

                                        sadly needed.</p>

                                    <p>Wedding Party Attacked. — A serious affray recently occurred
                                        near Lahoon, where a certain <persName>Mohamed El
                                            Khawly</persName>, <persName>Sheikh of Nahier el

                                            Mohamed</persName>, headed a band of rogues and vaga-
                                        bonds and attacked <persName>Awad Niad</persName>, in whose
                                        house a wedding party was rejoicing. The gang broke into the
                                        festivities at a late hour of the evening and fell upon the
                                        wedding party with nabouts, beating all who came in their
                                        way in a most savage manner. The markaz authorities were
                                        informed at once, and the mamour, with a force of policemen
                                        and ghaffirs, arrived and dispersed the aggressors, though
                                        not before forty persons had boon injured. Some of the gang
                                        were caught by the police on their arrival, and by the close
                                        of the following day all were in gaol.</p>

                                        almost reached an agree- ment on the subject of the
                                        alterations which the latter Government wishes to make in
                                        certain clauses of the treaty of commerce existing between
                                        the two countries. <placeName>Greece</placeName>, it is
                                        said, will allow gambling houses kept by Greek subjects to
                                        be freely entered by the re- presentatives of the Egyptian
                                        authorities. Our Greek contemporary "Phos" adds that to
                                        avoid any regrettable incidents a complete list of these
                                        houses will be drawn up by the Greek consular authorities.
                                        As to the question of hashish cultivation in Greece, it
                                        seems that the complaints of the cultivators of the Indian
                                        hemp, from which the drug is prepared, have made good their
                                        objections to the suppression of its cultivation in Greece,
                                        and that the Hel- lenic authorities have been compelled to
                                        adopt a compromise by which the growers will have to pay a
                                        heavy tax on all hashish produced. Well, “half a loaf is
                                        better than no bread.”</p>

                                        <p>Two interesting stories reach us from
                                                <placeName>Cairo</placeName> which show the need of
                                            reform in the procedure of the Mebkemeh courts very
                                            clearly.</p>
                                        <p>The first concerns the old Continental Hotel buildings in
                                            the <placeName>Sharia Kaar-el-Nil</placeName>, which
                                            belonged to the late Sioufi Pasha. On his decease some
                                            two or three years ago they passed under the control of
                                            the Mebkemeh, whilst the son and heir only enjoys the
                                            income for life. A short time back one of the English
                                            companies lately established in <placeName>Egypt
                                            </placeName>offered to rent the whole block of buildings
                                            on a 12 years lease and to spend a large sum in
                                            improvements and making rows of shops right round, at
                                            the same time increasing the present rental by £2,000 a
                                            year. After long negotiations' the Cadi has finally
                                            decided that ho cannot grant a longer lease than three
                                            years, which is, it appears, the longest the Mehkemeh
                                            Shariah allows on this class of property. The result has
                                            been that the company have withdrawn their offer. The
                                            second case is that of a poor widow who owns 1,100
                                            eqoare metres ot land in a commanding position in the
                                            Bab el-Louk quarters, and on which there is an ancient
                                            and tumble-down building, the rent of which barely
                                            suffices for the needs of the woman and her family. As
                                            the property is required for improvements and has been
                                            offered £8 a square metre the site. She asked the
                                            Mehkemeh to dispose of the land and invest the proceeds
                                            in other property which would give a far better return,
                                            but the Cadi re- plied to the poor woman’s petition that
                                            the site could not be alienated. As the owner has not
                                            enough means either to improve the building or to pull
                                            it down and erect another, it must remain in its present
                                            tumble- down condition, and the widow must content
                                            herself with the pittance she now draws as rent until
                                            such time as the ancient building crumbles away.</p>

                                            the hundreds of tourists who came to
                                                <placeName>Egypt</placeName> and made
                                                <placeName>Port Said</placeName> their port of
                                            disembarkation, on account of the scanty accommodation
                                            which the railway station offered to them. Everything
                                            that was possible was done to make passengers, — who had
                                            often to wait a long time for the departure for the
                                            train,—comfortable, and many of them will have pleasant
                                            recollections of being ushered into the cosy office of
                                            the indefatigable super- intendent, <placeName>Mr. W.
                                                Watson</placeName>, who strove so effectually
                                            against the thousand and one dif- ficulties which beset
                                            him.</p>
                                        <p>But one small office does not suffice to shelter eighty
                                            people or more from the wintry blasts of <placeName>Port
                                                Said</placeName>. The Railway Administra- tion has
                                            spent a very large sum of money over this temporary
                                            station ; a large shed has been erected for passengers'
                                            luggage ; more commodious sheds have been erected for
                                            the in-coming and out-going goods ; a wooden pallisade
                                            protects the departure platform, and a splendid buffet
                                            has been built, but it has not been thought necessary to
                                            provide any other accommodation for passengers. Last
                                            year even the buffet was not completed, and one could
                                            witness numbers of people sitting on the cold, draughty
                                            platform with but a box for a seat. We are glad to learn
                                            that now the conditions are somewhat ameliorated, and
                                            that the International Sleeping and Restaurant Car
                                            Company are going to open the buffet on the 1st
                                            November, but we fear that more cannot be done, as far
                                            too much has, in our opinion, already been spent over
                                            this tempe- rary station, and we cannot suggest or en-
                                            courage further expenditure.</p>

                                                version of a well-known quotation that comes to mind
                                                when we read in our Turkish contemporary, "Shevrai
                                                Ummet,” that no nation respects the Arabs more than
                                                the Turks, and that no Ottoman soldier but feels a
                                                qualm at the very completeness of the victory over
                                                tho Imam Yahza. Our con- temporary is, however, on
                                                safer ground when it remarks that the rebellion in
                                                the Yemen is a natural and inevitable consequence of
                                                mis- government, and asks when the warring elements
                                                of the Turkish Empire will be united by education
                                                and a common patriotism.</p>

                                            <p>Those who hoped that the Prince and Prin- cess of
                                                Wales would pay a visit to the town of
                                                  <placeName>Port Said</placeName> have been doomed
                                                to disappoint- ment, as their Royal Highnesses have
                                                not quitted the harbour for a single moment. Great
                                                interest has been evinced on the part of the
                                                population in the visit of the Heir- Apparent, and
                                                large crowds watched the arrival of the British
                                                warships from the quays. As the Renown steamed
                                                slowly into the harbour H.R.H. the Princess of Wales
                                                was seen to take a number of snap-shots of the
                                                various points of interest, in which occupation she
                                                was assisted by one of her ladies-in waiting.</p>
                                            <p>As soon as H.M.S. Renown had moored H.R.H. the Prince
                                                of Wales, who was on the upper bridge, retired to
                                                his private saloon in order to reoeive the officials
                                                who went on board to welcome him, the first of whom
                                                was <persName>Mr. D. A. Cameron</persName>, H.B.M.’s
                                                Consul, who remained on board for half an hour. He
                                                was followed by <persName>Major Watson,
                                                  A.D.C</persName>. to the Khedive, representing his
                                                  Highness,<persName> Mr. Doyen</persName>, of the
                                                Suez Canal Company, the police commandant, and a few
                                                others.</p>
                                            <p>Subsequently <persName>Major Watson</persName>,
                                                  <persName>Captain Tot- tenham (H.M.S.
                                                  Lancaster)</persName>, <persName>Captain
                                                  Wemyss</persName> (H.M.S. Suffolk), and
                                                  <persName>Commander Bruen</persName> (H.M.S.
                                                Surprise) had the honor of dining with their Royal
                                                Highnesses.</p>
                                            <p>Shortly after 9.30 this morning the Prince and
                                                Princess of Wales, with a few of their suite, left
                                                H.M.S. Renown and proceeded direct to the Surprise,
                                                where they remained till nearly 5 p.m. During the
                                                morning the ship's band played, and continued to do
                                                so until lunch was served.</p>
                                            <p>This evening the Prince and Princess will go on board
                                                H.M.S. Lancaster, and the Prince is expected to ring
                                                the silver bell which was presented to the vessel by
                                                the ladies of Lan- caster a few weeks ago. Later in
                                                the evening the Royal party will probably visit
                                                H.M.S. Suffolk. H.M.S. Powerful arrived here at 2.40
                                                p.m. to-day and is moored at black buoy No. 7.</p>
                                            <p>The Renown and Powerful are expected to leave between
                                                8 and 9 to-morrow morning.</p>

                                            <p><placeName>Port Said</placeName>, Saturday.</p>
                                            <p>Last night a reception and dinner, followed by a
                                                ball, were given on board H M.S. Power- ful, which
                                                sailed at 7.30 to-day. The Royal party returned to
                                                H.M.S. Renown at midnight. As stated by me
                                                yesterday, the Prince of Wales rang the silver bell
                                                on board H.M.S. Lancaster.</p>
                                            <p>H.M.S Renown sailed at 6.30 to-day on her way to
                                                India. H.M.S. Lancaster left for Malta at nine, and
                                                the Surprise leaves for the same destination
                                                to-morrow, to be followed by the Suffolk on
                                                Monday.</p>
                                            <p>The Royal party are due at Port Said again, on their
                                                return from India, on April 29, with the same escort
                                                of vessels as they have left with.</p>
                                            <p>All the ships in the harbour were decorated
                                                yesterday.</p>

                                            <p>A resident of the Lebanon who has just arrived here
                                                informs us that the Ottoman Government intends to
                                                establish four schools in the Lebanon, one in the
                                                Meton district and three in the district of Shouf.
                                                Two of these are to be boarding schools, and Arabic,
                                                French, and Turkish are to form part of the
                                                curriculum. <persName>Muzaffar Pasha</persName>, the
                                                present un- popular Governor of the province, has
                                                urged the Turkish Government to open elementary
                                                schools in the Lebanon, on the ground that its
                                                people receive their education from British, French,
                                                Russian, and American sources, and are consequently
                                                inclined to support any Power rather than Turkey.
                                                The new Turkish schools are intended to create a

                                            <p>It is announced (says the “Times”) that the Egyptian
                                                Government is making farther pro- vision for
                                                extending the pilgrim camp at Tor. A credit of
                                                £10,000, in addition to former sums, is being
                                                allotted for this object, and the erection of new
                                                buildings in the encampment is reported to be making
                                                good progress. Many of the sufferings formerly
                                                endured by the poorer pilgrims will now be greatly
                                                alleviated, if not entirely removed. The necessity
                                                for these extensions is apparent from the fact that,
                                                whereas on the establishment of the quarantine camp
                                                at Tor the number of pilgrims passing through
                                                totalled 13,000, the caravans are now bringing some
                                                40,000. This number naturally includes only those
                                                pilgrims coming from the north and west. Those
                                                travelling from India and still farther east undergo
                                                quarantine at the Turkish station on

                                                is being paid to the sanitation of the new ex-
                                                tensions, and the most scientific arrangements,
                                                compatible with the circumstances of the place, are

                                                Calabrian earthquakes, was a great success, though

                                                auspices it was held, was not as general as it might
                                                have been, and the house was not so full as we
                                                should have liked to have seen it. Messrs. J. W.

                                                which was composed by himself; we are sorry that
                                                want of space prevents us publishing this
                                                appropriate and well-written verse, which sings the
                                                praise of Charity. At the conclusion of the prologue
                                                  <persName>Mr. Congdon</persName> waved a large
                                                Italian flag and was greeted with rounds of
                                                applause, and as the band struck up the Italian
                                                national anthem the whole audience rose to their
                                                feet. <persName>Miss Gertrude Simpson</persName>
                                                then sang Sullivan's well-known ‘Orpheus with his
                                                Lute”; <persName>Miss Simpson</persName> has a high
                                                soprano voice which is well-trained and sang
                                                excellently, finishing with a perfectly clear high b
                                                without the slightest strain. Next came a pianoforte
                                                solo by <persName>Mlle Schall</persName>, who played
                                                "Les Soupirs" very well, and Mr. J. Mattalon
                                                followed with the well-known oper- atic air "Donna
                                                non vidi mai" from Manon Lescaut. <persName>Mr.
                                                  Mattalon</persName> has a very pleasing voice and
                                                is a good musician, and his inter- pretation of the
                                                air delighted the audience. Herr Carl Goetz then
                                                sang "Tom de Reimer," by Mendelssohn, in which he
                                                was beard to advantage. A military and descriptive
                                                sketch entitled "The Royal Fusiliers" was next
                                                played by <persName>Mr J. W.</persName> and
                                                  <persName>Miss Laulie Congdon</persName> ; the two

                                                pensioner and his little granddaughter, and the old
                                                man sings a story of "Uncle Fred's” bravery, which
                                                ended in death, during the Crimean war. Though quite
                                                a child <persName>Miss Congdon</persName> played her
                                                part unfalteringly and with feeling, and
                                                  <persName>Mr. Congdon</persName> gave a most
                                                realistic description of his "brother’s” brave

                                                the grand aria from Tosca and held the audience
                                                enraptured. In all, <persName>Signor
                                                  Mariani</persName> sang three songs, but this was
                                                deemed far too little and he was most
                                                enthusiatically applauded. He is the possessor of a
                                                beautiful tenor voice and is a true artiste, his
                                                rendering was faultless and his every noti was
                                                followed and thoroughly appreciated by all.</p>
                                            <p>In the second part of the programme, which was opened
                                                by the band with di Capua's “I Berasglieri" and the
                                                intermezzo from Cavalleria Rusticana, two artistes
                                                appeared whom we had not heard in the first part,
                                                Messrs. Everard and Wood. <persName>Mr.
                                                  Everard</persName> played Beethoven’s "Moonlight
                                                Sonata,"in which he showed him- self a thorough
                                                master of the pianoforte and a born musician, and we
                                                hope we shall have further opportunities of hearing
                                                him. Mr. Wood, who is the bandmaster of the Rifle
                                                Brigade, is well-known to Cairo as a musician and
                                                thoroughly sustained his reputation with his
                                                renderings Moszkowaki’s Spanish dances played as a
                                                violin solo. The concert was brought to a conclusion
                                                shortly after eleven with the Italian and Khedivial
                                                national anthems and "God save the King.” Those who
                                                took part are deserving of great praise for the way
                                                in which they contributed to the suc- cess of the
                                                evening, which we feel sure would have been even
                                                greater had there not been the counter attraction of

                                                general meeting were read and duly approved, and
                                                office-bearers for the new season were then elected.
                                                The <persName>Rev. H.P. Reid</persName> was

                                                vendredi dernier toute la semaine s’est ressentie de
                                                ceste accentuation de la tension monetaire. Aussi
                                                assistons-nous depuis samedi a une suite
                                                ininterrompue de baisses jusqua ce matin ou comme
                                                c’est l’habitude apres des fluctuations exagerees,
                                                une petite reaction en hausse s’est produite en
                                                depit de l’augmenta- tion du taux prive d’escompte
                                                de 4 a 4 1/8, Ii n’en est pas moins vrai que la
                                                speculation reste perplexe et semble attendre que la
                                                situa- tion monetaire se soit eclaircie pour
                                                s’engager dans de nouvelles affaires, Et en cela
                                                nous ne prouvons que l’approuver. Si, en effet, la
                                                Banque d’Angleterre est obligee d’augmenter encore
                                                son taux d’escompte, une nouvelle baisse sir toutes
                                                les valeurs est inevitable.</p>

                                                les banques locales qu’il faut attribuer le marasme
