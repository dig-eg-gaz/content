          <p>The project of the great Belgian capitalist, M. Plmpain, for a new line to Matarieh has
            been practically approved by the Egyptian Government. This new electric line will start
            from the Djellal Buildings, at the corner of the Bouloc road, and will follow the Abbas

            taking some steps to ameliorate the condition of that town. The Tanzim Department, on
            the initiative of Mr. Arnold H. Perry, Under Secretary of State, has already begun the
            embellishment of the town by planting trees, extending the electric light installation,
            and laying down hew roads. We understand that some of the so-called squares, which are
            now in their primitive state of desert, are to be laid out. Now that Helouan is under
            the direct protection of the Ministry of Public Works, the inhabitants are in hopes that
            the water supply will be improved by the long-desired filter beds, and it is believed
            that by next season Helouan will have an excellent supply of paré filtered water </p>

          <p>Mr.C. Ronzevalle gave an interesting concert on Saturday night at the Grand Continental
            Hotel He was ably assisted by Mr. Léon Ronzevalle, whose two performances on tho 'cello
            were much appreciated, and by Mrs. Nolan, whose harp solos, "Autumn" and "watching the
            Wheat" were most astically received. Mr. Ronzevalle gave us no less than 11 songs and
            met with considerable success : his voice, if not very powerful, is clear and of a very
            agreeable timbre, and in the mezza-voce and piano passages he showed admirable technique
            and finish. We only wish to criticize one point, vix., the arrangement of the program.
            The transition from Some Day," with its religious sentiment, to one of Planquette's
            songs, and from the fine "Ave Maria" composed by the singer to his Turkish love song
            "Béuim halym," struck us as being a little too abrupt. The arrangement of the Caneton
            Espanola also struck us as being less successful more commonplace in fact than that of
            "Boftah Hindi" and "Bénim halym,' where the composer shows a thorough knowledge of how
            to introduce the Oriental colour into European music without in any way exaggerating it.

          <p>Port said, Saturday. Mr. and Mrs. Terence Ramsdale, who have come from Alexandria and
            Cairo and are on their way to Bombay, gave a variety entertainment at the Eldorado
            Theatre last night Unfortunately, the entertainment had not been sufficiently
            advertised, and many people were unaware that these well-known artistes were in the
            town. The hall was in consequence not so crowded as it would otherwise have been, but
            those who were present fully appreciated Mr. and Mrs. Ramsdale'a efforts to amuse them
            For a space of more than two hours they kept the ball rolling with barely - a- minute's
            interval between the pieces, and never once got out of touch with their audience. Mrs.
            Ramsdale, who has a remarkably pure and clear voice, charmed the audience with her
            excellent rendering of ''The Star of Bethlehem," and was no less successful in her
            lighter efforts, namely, "Little Mary," "She reads the London papers every day," and
            "Keep off the Grass." Mr. Ramsdale evoked great admiration by his versatility, and kept
            the audience convulsed with laughter at the original patter which he introduced into his
            songs. His American tap boot dance drew forth rounds of applause. The entertainment
            included a sketch entitled "The Wild Hùssara" or "A Love Strategem," in which Mrs.
            Ramsdale took the rôle of Nancy, the mistress of the inn, who, although she loved Samuel
            stammere, did not wish to be too easily won. Mr. Ramsdale played the dual part of Samuel
            Stammers and Sergeant Major Blunt, and it was difficult to imagine that these two parts
            were being played by the same man, so excellent was the make-up and perfect his
            portrayal of the two widely different characters </p>

            banquet over which Mr. J. Morley presided, was the action he took in connection with the
            Saez Canal shares. It was in 1876 that, acting on the information which had come into
            his possession as an editor, he wont to Lord Derby, then Foreign Secretary, and warned
            him that tho Khedive's shares, which were private property, were about to pass into the
            bands of a French syndicate. The Foreign Minister could not believe that an editor,
            however influential, could have secured information of which the British Consul at Cairo
            was ignorant. </p>
          <p>The difficulties of the situation were obvious. The only way to set the matter at rest
            was to make direct inquiries of the Khedive. It there was no truth in the story the
            result of the interrogatory might be to put the idea of selling the shares into the
            Khedive's bead. This position was put to Mr. Greenwood, but he urged the sending of a
            telegram to our Consul. It was sent To quote Mr. Greenwood's own modest words : "It
            instructed Colonel Stanton to go immediately to the Khedive and put the question
            point-blank. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister would be seen, and Lord Derby's visitor might
            call next day to bear the reply from-Gairo. It is enough to add here that on the receipt
            of the answer the purchase for England was taken up, and went to a speedy conclusion." </p>

          <p>FE xercice 1904</p>
          <p>Les résultats de la gestton afin 1903: ac cusaient un déficit de L. BE. 5124 qui a été
            con- vert par une recette extraordinaire provenant de la vente des. matériauz da
            Domaine. Les r@puliats &amp;-fin 1904 accusent un-surplas net-de recettes de L.E. 848,
            se décomposant comme suit-: Bénéfice de la vente de la Biére L.E. 8 695, de la Glace
            L.E. 1.613 et de Produits divers LE. 48, soit un total de bénéfices de L.E; 5.356. Il y
            a liea de déduire de ce béné- fice les frais d' Administration, L.E. 1.692, et Ja charge
            d ii teéréis des dettes hypothécaires, L.E. 2.821, soit au total LE. 4.513. Le bénéfice
            net est done de L.E. 843.</p>
          <p>Le montant des ventes de biére quis élevait a LE. 11.436 en 1903 aatteint L.E. 16.455
            en 4904, soit une augmentation de L.E. 5.019. Le Stock er Cave, qui était de 4.269
            hectolitres en 1903, a atteint 4.559 hectolitres en 1904.</p>
          <p>La recette brute de la Glace qui s'est élevée a LE. 2.889 en 1903, a atteint L.E. 3.282
            en 1904, soit un surplus de L.E. 393.</p>
          <p>Le prix des terrains de Ja société a été es timé &amp; P.T. 25 le metre. Malgré cette
            estima- tion réduite, la plus value du Domaine accuse un excédent de L.E. 15,467 qui a
            permis d'a- mortir entiérement tous les apports (L.E. 7.715), une partie considérable
            des frais de ler Etablissement, du Matériel roulant, des dépen- ses extraordinaires
            provenant des exercices an- térieurs. Une somme de L.E. 1.149 représen- tant des
            créances douteuses et irrecouvrable: provenant-de 1902 a été enlevée de l'actif. I reste
            encore une somme de L.E. 2.000 qui est portée &amp; la réserve. En y ajoutant le solde
            des réserves précédentes, la société a une réserve totale de L.E. 3.187.</p>
          <p>Le 25 novembre dernier la société a fait-une émission de 500.000 francs d'actions
            portantle capital A 2.000.000. Cette ¢mission faite au prix de frs. 108 l'Action
            nominale de 100 franas a été couverte plusieurs fvis.</p>
          <p>La société doit encore une somme totale de Livres 25.000 de Créances hypothécaires cou-
            tant une charge de 50.000 francs environ. Dans sa séance du 17 Mars 1905 le Conse a
            décidé de faire une émission de francs 850.000 d'obli- gations hypothécsires rapportant
            5 { et émises &amp; 95 % &amp; amortir en 20 ans, destinées a payer les créanciers
            hypothécaires et &amp; constituer un fonds de rotflement.</p>
          <p>Comme l'amortissement ne doit commencer qu'en 1908, les 3 prochains exercices n'auront
            &amp; supporter qu'une charge de L.E. 1.640 au lien de L.E. 2.820. Il vant, en eftet,
            mieux ré- gler de ia sorte la situation, platét que de vendre des terrains disponibles
            appelés &amp; une plus value certaine d'ici &amp; quelques années, par suite de
            l'extension de la ville de ce cété. La Caisse des Propriétaires de Bruxelles vient de

            each, aud afterwards went over the exhibition</p>
          <p>ascompanied by Judge Sanders and some other members of the committee, to whom his
            Highness was pleased to express his great satisfaction-at the evident signs of progress

          <p>Yaco') Pasha Artin, Protessor Schweinfurth, and Mr. Foaden came specially from Cairo to
            attend the show. To come to the show itself; the centre the ball-room which most of the
            specimeig were grouped, was oc- cupied by a large collection of caladiums</p>
          <p>iD</p>
          <p>rarest</p>
          <p>ielongmg to Mr. Zervudachi, on which the only criticism oue might make would be to say
            that though the leaves were large they were not sutticiently variegated. Cer- tainly the
            most difficult exhibit for the judges tu aecide upou in the groups of pot plants, were
            the three collections of Begonia Rex. H.H. Prince Toussoun won the</p>
          <p>ilver medal, and Mme Debbase and Hussein</p>
          <p>Bey Riaz were each awarded a bronze medal. The whole of the east side of the room was
            taken up by a large group staged by Mr. Zervudachi. 'This group contained several fine
            specimens of Anthuriums Dras- caenas, and had a magnificent centre of gloxi- ts. 'his
            year there was only one group of terns, belonging to Mr. Zervudachi, but it was so large
            that it took up the whole of one side of the roum. In the first tent there were three
            large collections of palms, which occupied over 30 metres of space, and in front ot them
            there were three collections of gera- niums, each of which must have contained several
            huudreds of plauts. The large groups of aunuals, each of about 500 pots, were much
            admired. That oF J udge Sandars was designed in the form of a garden and was noticeable
            for the inclusion of a uumber of pots of Lobelia ''enuor, which is a novelty in Egypt.
            There were three gruups of show pelargoniums, the first prize being taken by Mr.
            Benachi, who staged some well-grown plants, espe- cially a white variety named after
            Lady Cromer. Before leaving the section . of pot plants we should like to congratulate
            the committee upon the order in which the various groups were arranged, and especially
            upon the grass borders which helped so much to set olf the plants. 'The bandsome objet
            d'art otiered by Prince Hussein Pasha Kamel was ou view ciuse te the exhibit of M.
            Zervudachi, who won it; Judge Sandars, keing second, was awarded a silver medal. The
            latter also won the prize for the best rose in the show, which Wasa specimen of Maman

          <p>Mr. Jacut des Combes staged some fine pausies, and Mr. Percy Carver showed a good
            cullection of sweet peas, though perhaps not so fiue as has sometimes been seen. Mr. H.
            Seffer showed a large collection of amarillis and gladiolus, which both obtained first
            prizes.</p>
          <p>'The silver medal of the Royal Horticultural Society ot Loudon was won by M.
            Zervudachi, and the bronze medal, given by the same society, by Prince Omar
            Toussoun.</p>
          <p>There were no less than eight tables decorated by ladies, consequently the room
            allotted to tliem was quite full. Mrs. W. R. Williams, who took the first prize,
            arranged her table very( graceful:y with eschscholtxia aud white daisiès placed in white
            vases. Miss icwat cane next with a pretty arrangement Ci yélluw roses. There were two
            equal thirds, Miss G. Atkin, who chése red roses, and Miss G. Allen, who hed quite an
            original idea which repies enkal water with a mirror in the centre surrounded by
            miniature rockeries and green grasses. Miss Enna Anderson obtained a notice of 'highly
            commended' for a graceful table of shell pink roses and pink candleshades.</p>
          <p>There were only four vases of roses. Miss Allen, who won the-first prize, carried out
            the very effective idea of placing her exhibit in a rough basket. Miss Hewat obtaned
            second prize for some light pink roses. Mrs. John Ross made an effective arrangement of
            white flowers other than roses, and Miss G. Atkin gained the second prize for an
            artistic arrangement of palm leaves and nasturtiums. The silver medal for a large
            collection of potatoes was 'gained by M. Monfront, but on the whole .there were not many
            amateur exhibits o vegetables, the most worthy of remark 'being Mrs. Watson's peas and
            Mrs. Rich- mond's collection of five distinct kinds,</p>

          <p>M. André, a landscape gardener from Paris, showed several plans of the gardens which he
            is* designing for. the Khedivial family in Cairo, and also plans of what he proposes
            should be done for' the new parks of Alexandria.</p>

          <p>Refreshments were served on the terrace and many of the visitors lingered for some time
            at the tables listening to the strains of the band of the 2nd Royal Berksbire Regiment,

          <p>THE POLICE AND CRIME.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>To THE Epiror oF THE EGyPTIAN (GAZETTE.</p>
          <p>Sir,—In a recent issue of your paper you had an article on the methods employed in
            Egypt to ensure the diminution of the number of crimes, not of crimes committed, but of
            crimes reported. I should like to add my testimony to the evidence before you that these
            ods are not confined to the Moudirieh of Assiout.</p>
          <p>By reason of the b¥idge, Nag-Hamadi is &amp; locality famous for the number of corpses
            re- trieved from the river, for either they get hung up in the pontoons, or at least
            they are seen by the watch. The other day it appears that the police were notified that
            a woman had disap- peared from Dechna and were asked to watch for the body coming down
            the river. The police communication was as follows: "lf you see a corpse at the-bridge,
            say nothing ; If it catches, set it adrift again." Owing to the presence of a European
            when the corpse did catch, the police programme was not carried out, to the great
            annoyance of the police officer, who is debited with another undiscovered crime. -</p>
          <p>The inference drawn in your article that this game of beggar my neighbour played by the
            police is in part due to the system of fining for untraced crimes seems justifiable. But
            think what the results would have been had there been instead a bonus for crimes
            discovered !</p>
          <p>In the particular case I quote above, I fancy we have not heard the end of the
            matter,as the P.O. 4n his distress vented his wrath upon a French lady who was standing
            by and had been instrumental in (excuse the phrase) "upsetting his apple cart." —I am,
            etc.</p>
          <p>Horativs Coctss.</p>
          <p>Nag Hamadi, April 14.</p>

          <p>AN INSTITUTE FOR CAIRO.</p>
          <p>To tHe Epiror oF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
          <p>Sir,—In reference to the latter part of Mr. Marsh's letter in your issue of to-day, I
            fear Mr. Marsh must have written the letter when a little excited, as I made him an
            apology for having made a mistake, and not for having circulated a false statement to.
            his injury, of which anybody who knows me, is aware that I am incapable. Moreover, my
            apology was quite spontaneous and not at all a forced one. As soon as I found out I was
            wrong, I wrote to Mr. Marsh to express to him the deep regret it caused me. I was
            unaware until I saw Mr. Marsh afterwards, that he had laid the matter before the
            Consul.</p>
          <p>I may add that in my letter of the 10th I did not in any way wish to cast a stigma upon
            Mr. Marsh's management of the Russell Soldiers Home. He receives his orders from
            Scotland and carries them out. This letter has bean shown to him, and I should not be
            surprised if he confirms what I say. — I am, etc.</p>
