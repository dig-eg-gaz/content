                  <p>Constantinople, April 10.</p>
                  <p>M. Maximoff, Russian Diplomatic Agent at Cairo, is expected to arrive here this
                    week. He intends to spend a few weeks in Constantinople before proceeding to
                    Cettigne, to take up his new post M. Poppe, councillor of the French Embassy
                    here, leaves to-day for Paris, where he is to be married to Mlle Prévost, sister
                    of M. Prévost, of the French Diplomatic Service in Egypt. M. Poppe will return
                    here with his bride next month. The French Embassy here has applied to the
                    Sublime Porte for the exequatur for M. Davona Takla, appointed French
                    Vice-Consul at Assouan. A batch of German tourists arrived here last week, on
                    their way to Palestine, whence they will return by way of Egypt There was a
                    great run last week on Credit Foncier Egyptien bonds, the old issue going up to
                    350 frs. and the new issue to 278 frs. The stock of bonds at the Imperial
                    Ottoman Bank was exhausted, and the bank had to telegraph to Alexandria for

                  <p>Mr.C. Ronzevalle gave an interesting concert on Saturday night at the Grand
                    Continental Hotel He was ably assisted by Mr. Léon Ronzevalle, whose two
                    performances on tho ’cello were much appreciated, and by Mrs. Nolan, whose harp
                    solos, “Autumn” and “watching the Wheat” were most astically received. Mr.
                    Ronzevalle gave us no less than 11 songs and met with considerable success : his
                    voice, if not very powerful, is clear and of a very agreeable timbre, and in the
                    mezza-voce and piano passages he showed admirable technique and finish. We only
                    wish to criticize one point, vix., the arrangement of the program. The
                    transition from Some Day," with its religious sentiment, to one of Planquette’s
                    songs, and from the fine “Ave Maria" composed by the singer to his Turkish love
                    song “Béuim halym,” struck us as being a little too abrupt. The arrangement of
                    the Caneton Espanola also struck us as being less successful more commonplace in
                    fact than that of “Boftah Hindi” and “Bénim halym,’ where the composer shows a
                    thorough knowledge of how to introduce the Oriental colour into European music
                    without in any way exaggerating it. </p>

                  <head>ENTERTAINMENT AT PORT SAID</head>
                  <p>Port said, Saturday. Mr. and Mrs. Terence Ramsdale, who have come from
                    Alexandria and Cairo and are on their way to Bombay, gave a variety
                    entertainment at the Eldorado Theatre last night Unfortunately, the
                    entertainment had not been sufficiently advertised, and many people were unaware
                    that these well-known artistes were in the town. The hall was in consequence not
                    so crowded as it would otherwise have been, but those who were present fully
                    appreciated Mr. and Mrs. Ramsdale’a efforts to amuse them For a space of more
                    than two hours they kept the ball rolling with barely - a- minute’s interval
                    between the pieces, and never once got out of touch with their audience. Mrs.
                    Ramsdale, who has a remarkably pure and clear voice, charmed the audience with
                    her excellent rendering of ’’The Star of Bethlehem," and was no less successful
                    in her lighter efforts, namely, “Little Mary,” “She reads the London papers
                    every day," and “Keep off the Grass." Mr. Ramsdale evoked great admiration by
                    his versatility, and kept the audience convulsed with laughter at the original
                    patter which he introduced into his songs. His American tap boot dance drew
                    forth rounds of applause. The entertainment included a sketch entitled “The Wild
                    Hùssara” or "A Love Strategem,” in which Mrs. Ramsdale took the rôle of Nancy,
                    the mistress of the inn, who, although she loved Samuel stammere, did not wish
                    to be too easily won. Mr. Ramsdale played the dual part of Samuel Stammers and
                    Sergeant Major Blunt, and it was difficult to imagine that these two parts were
                    being played by the same man, so excellent was the make-up and perfect his
                    portrayal of the two widely different characters </p>

                    service, as Omdeh, on the Assouan Moudiriah Council the General Assembly, and

                  <p>One of the most important events in the journalistic career of tho veteran Mr.
                    Frederick Greenwood, whose seventy-fifth birthday recognized few nights ago by
                    the banquet over which Mr. J. Morley presided, was the action he took in
                    connection with the Saez Canal shares. It was in 1876 that, acting on the
                    information which had come into his possession as an editor, he wont to Lord
                    Derby, then Foreign Secretary, and warned him that tho Khedive's shares, which
                    were private property, were about to pass into the bands of a French syndicate.
                    The Foreign Minister could not believe that an editor, however influential,
                    could have secured information of which the British Consul at Cairo was
                    ignorant. </p>
                  <p>The difficulties of the situation were obvious. The only way to set the matter
                    at rest was to make direct inquiries of the Khedive. It there was no truth in
                    the story the result of the interrogatory might be to put the idea of selling
                    the shares into the Khedive's bead. This position was put to Mr. Greenwood, but
                    he urged the sending of a telegram to our Consul. It was sent To quote Mr.
                    Greenwood's own modest words : “It instructed Colonel Stanton to go immediately
                    to the Khedive and put the question point-blank. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister
                    would be seen, and Lord Derby’s visitor might call next day to bear the reply
                    from-Gairo. It is enough to add here that on the receipt of the answer the
                    purchase for England was taken up, and went to a speedy conclusion.” </p>
