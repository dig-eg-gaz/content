                            here this week. He intends to spend a few weeks in Constantinople before
                            proceeding to Cettigne, to take up his new post. </p>

                    <p>Mr.C. Ronzevalle gave an interesting concert on Saturday night at the Grand
                        Continental Hotel He was ably assisted by Mr. Léon Ronzevalle, whose two
                        performances on tho 'cello were much appreciated, and by Mrs. Nolan, whose
                        harp solos, "Autumn" and "watching the Wheat" were most astically received.
                        Mr. Ronzevalle gave us no less than 11 songs and met with considerable
                        success : his voice, if not very powerful, is clear and of a very agreeable
                        timbre, and in the mezza-voce and piano passages he showed admirable
                        technique and finish. We only wish to criticize one point, vix., the
                        arrangement of the program. The transition from Some Day," with its
                        religious sentiment, to one of Planquette's songs, and from the fine "Ave
                        Maria" composed by the singer to his Turkish love song "Béuim halym," struck
                        us as being a little too abrupt. The arrangement of the Caneton Espanola
                        also struck us as being less successful more commonplace in fact than that
                        of "Boftah Hindi" and "Bénim halym,' where the composer shows a thorough
                        knowledge of how to introduce the Oriental colour into European music
                        without in any way exaggerating it. </p>

                    <head>ENTERTAINMENT AT PORT SAID</head>
                    <dateline>Port said, Saturday. </dateline>
                    <p>Mr. and Mrs. Terence Ramsdale, who have come from Alexandria and Cairo and
                        are on their way to Bombay, gave a variety entertainment at the Eldorado
                        Theatre last night Unfortunately, the entertainment had not been
                        sufficiently advertised, and many people were unaware that these well-known
                        artistes were in the town. The hall was in consequence not so crowded as it
                        would otherwise have been, but those who were present fully appreciated Mr.
                        and Mrs. Ramsdale'a efforts to amuse them For a space of more than two hours
                        they kept the ball rolling with barely - a- minute's interval between the
                        pieces, and never once got out of touch with their audience. Mrs. Ramsdale,
                        who has a remarkably pure and clear voice, charmed the audience with her
                        excellent rendering of ''The Star of Bethlehem," and was no less successful
                        in her lighter efforts, namely, "Little Mary," "She reads the London papers
                        every day," and "Keep off the Grass." Mr. Ramsdale evoked great admiration
                        by his versatility, and kept the audience convulsed with laughter at the
                        original patter which he introduced into his songs. His American tap boot
                        dance drew forth rounds of applause. The entertainment included a sketch
                        entitled "The Wild Hùssara" or "A Love Strategem," in which Mrs. Ramsdale
                        took the rôle of Nancy, the mistress of the inn, who, although she loved
                        Samuel stammere, did not wish to be too easily won. Mr. Ramsdale played the
                        dual part of Samuel Stammers and Sergeant Major Blunt, and it was difficult
                        to imagine that these two parts were being played by the same man, so
                        excellent was the make-up and perfect his portrayal of the two widely
                        different characters </p>

                        the notables—of the province. </p>
                    <p>One of the most important events in the journalistic career of tho veteran
                        Mr. Frederick Greenwood, whose seventy-fifth birthday recognized few nights
                        ago by the banquet over which Mr. J. Morley presided, was the action he took
                        in connection with the Saez Canal shares. It was in 1876 that, acting on the
                        information which had come into his possession as an editor, he wont to Lord
                        Derby, then Foreign Secretary, and warned him that tho Khedive's shares,
                        which were private property, were about to pass into the bands of a French
                        syndicate. The Foreign Minister could not believe that an editor, however
                        influential, could have secured information of which the British Consul at
                        Cairo was ignorant. </p>
                    <p>The difficulties of the situation were obvious. The only way to set the
                        matter at rest was to make direct inquiries of the Khedive. It there was no
                        truth in the story the result of the interrogatory might be to put the idea
                        of selling the shares into the Khedive's bead. This position was put to Mr.
                        Greenwood, but he urged the sending of a telegram to our Consul. It was sent
                        To quote Mr. Greenwood's own modest words : "It instructed Colonel Stanton
                        to go immediately to the Khedive and put the question point-blank.
                        Meanwhile, the Prime Minister would be seen, and Lord Derby's visitor might
                        call next day to bear the reply from-Gairo. It is enough to add here that on
                        the receipt of the answer the purchase for England was taken up, and went to
                        a speedy conclusion." </p>

                    <p>Après ce que nous venons de dire, on croira peut-être que nous sommes
                        contraires à la spé- culation d'une façon absolue. Non,nous sommes
                        simplement ennemi de l'exagération dans ses agissements, mais, en même
                        temps, nous la considérons comme presque une nécessité qui s'impose, surtout
                        dans un pays producteur comme le nôtre, et ne fût-ce que comme un modérateur
                        aux tendances naturelles du négo ciant exportateur, dont l'intérêt consiste
                        à acheter le meilleur marché possible. En agissant avec un peu de modération
                        et dans les limites du raisonnable, la spéculation maintiendrait l'article à
                        sa véritable valeur et sans entraver le consommateur tout en laissant au
                        négociant le moyen d'opérer avec une marge suffisante, elle aiderait d'une
                        manière effective le producteur à tirer, suivant les circonstances, le
                        meilleur parti possible de sa marchandise. Elle élimi nerait aussi peut-être
                        entièrement le risque aux agences de voir encore une fois toutes leurs
                        ressources immobilisées chez les clients qui, à la suite des grosses pertes
                        subies cette année, se sont trouvés réduits à demander du répit pour le
                        règlement de leurs différences.</p>
                    <p>La place d'Alexandrie a donné, à plus d'une reprise, la preuve de sa bonne
                        foi et de sa solidité, mais cela n'est pas une raison pour la mettre à de
                        trop rudes épreuves, d'autant plus que le secours qui relèvera la place
                        cette fois, au point de vue spéculation, viendra en grande partie,
                        probablement, du côté de cet élément que l'immigration nous a amené ces
                        dernières années, élément ardent et hardi au jeu mais encore novice du pays,
                        et qu'il ne faudrait pas trop stimuler ou encourager si l'on ne veut pas
                        finir par un désastre irréparable. (Extrait du Bulletin de la Chambre d'e

                    <p>Exercice 1904</p>
                    <p>Les résultats de la gestion à fin 1903 aocusaient un déficit de L.E 5124 qui
                        a été cou vert par une recette extraordinaire provenant de la vente des
                        matériaux du Domaine. Les résultats à fin 1904 accusent un surplus net de
                        recettes de LE. 843, se décomposant comme suit: Bénéfice de la vente de la
                        Bière LE 8 695, de la Glace L.E. 1.613 et de Produits divers L.E. 48, soit
                        un total de bénéfices de L.E. 5.356. Il y a lieu de déduire de ce béné- fice
                        les frais d'Administration, L.E. 1.692, et la charge d'intérêts des dettes
                        hypothécaires, L.E. 2.821, soit au total L.E. 4.513. Le bénéfice net est
                        donc de L.E. 843.</p>
                    <p>Le montant des ventes de bière qui s'élevait à L.E. 11.436 en 1903 a atteint
                        L.E. 16.455 en 1904, soit une augmentation de L.E. 5.019. Le Stock er Cave,
                        qui était de 4.269 hectolitres en 1903, a atteint 4.559 hectolitres en 1904.
                        La recette brute de la Glace qui s'est élevée à L.E. 2.889 en 1903, a
                        atteint L.E. 3.282 en 1904, soit un surplus de L.E. 393.</p>
                    <p>Le prix des terrains de la société a été estimé à P.T. 25 le mètre. Malgré
                        cette estimation réduite, la plus value du Domaine accuse un excédent de
                        L.E. 15,467 qui a permis d'amortir entièrement tous les apports (L.E.
                        7.715), une partie considérable des frais de 1er Etablissement, du Matériel
                        roulant, des dépenses extraordinaires provenant des exercices antérieurs.
                        Une somme de L.E. 1.149 représen tant des créances douteuses et
                        irrecouvrables provenant de 1902 a été enlevée de l'actif. Il reste encore
                        une somme de L.E. 2.000 qui est portée à la réserve. En y ajoutant le solde
                        des réserves précédentes, la société a une réserve totale de L.E. 3.187.</p>
                    <p>Le 25 novembre dernier la société a fait une émission de 500.000 francs
                        d'actions portantle capital à 2.000.000. Cette émission faite au prix de
                        frs. 108 l'Action nominale de 100 franes a été couverte plusieurs fois.</p>
                    <p>La société doit encore une somme totale de Livres 25.000 de Créances
                        hypothécaires cou- tant une charge de 50.000 francs environ. Dans sa séance
                        du 17 Mars 1905 le Conseil a décidé de faire une émission de francs 850.000
                        d'obli gations hypothécaires rapportant 5% et émises à 95% à amortir en 20
                        ans, destinées à payer les créanciers hypothécaires et à constituer un fonds
                        de roulement.</p>
                    <p>Comme l'amortissement ne doit commencer qu'en 1908, les 3 prochains exercices
                        n'auront à supporter qu'une charge de L.E. 1.640 au lieu de L.E. 2.820. Il
                        vaut, en effet, mieux ré- gler de la sorte la situation, plutôt que de
                        vendre des terrains disponibles appelés à une plus value certaine d'ici à
                        quelques années, par suite de l'extension de la ville de ce côté. La Caisse
                        des Propriétaires de Bruxelles vient de prendre ferme toutes ces obligations
                        au prix de 475 francs, le titre de 500 francs,</p>

                    <p>Disponible-Grâce à la hausse des contrats, le disponible a été soutenu dans
                        l'ensemble, mais les transactions sont restées modérées, les acheteurs ne se
                        soumettant pas aux prétentions des vendeurs ou moins justifiées par la

                    <p>Récolte actuelle. Après avoir été à 13 5/8; le mai avait reculé à 13 7/32
                        sous le poids des réalisations; mais hier de nouveau sur les grosses
                        expéditions de la semaine, il est remonté jusqu'à 13 3/4. Le parti de la
                        hausse, encouragé, semble décidé à pousser encore le mois qu'il vise; la
                        réussite cependant ne paraît probable que si le découvert en Europe est
                        important, car, pour ce qui est de notre place, les vendeurs en blang
                        semblent s'être rachetés. Le déport sur juillet est maintenant de 17/32.</p>

                        13-5/8 à 21/32.</p>
                    <p>Graines de coton</p>
                    <p>Disponible. La semaine a été calme avec des cours variant autour de 52 1/2 ;
                        mais avec la hausse des contrats, la semaine finit à 53 1/2.
                        Franco-Station.—Sans affaires.</p>
                    <p>Contrats.-Nouvelle récolte. De temps à autre une affaire, mais au fond le
                        calme domine quoique la rareté des vendeurs maintienne les cours fermes.</p>
                    <p>Récolte actuelle.-L'entrain général du marché a fini par se faire sentir sur
                        la graine, et comme l'Europe ne s'est pas montrée récalcitrante à la
                        reprise, la tendance est plutôt encourageante pour les détenteurs de
                        contrats. Affaires très limitées.</p>

                        ball-room which most of the specimeig were grouped, was oc- cupied by a
                        large collection of caladiums</p>

                    <p>ielongmg to Mr. Zervudachi, on which the only criticism oue might make would
                        be to say that though the leaves were large they were not sutticiently
                        variegated. Cer- tainly the most difficult exhibit for the judges tu aecide
                        upou in the groups of pot plants, were the three collections of Begonia Rex.
                        H.H. Prince Toussoun won the</p>
                    <p>ilver medal, and Mme Debbase and Hussein</p>
                    <p>Bey Riaz were each awarded a bronze medal. The whole of the east side of the
                        room was taken up by a large group staged by Mr. Zervudachi. 'This group
                        contained several fine specimens of Anthuriums Dras- caenas, and had a
                        magnificent centre of gloxi- ts. 'his year there was only one group of
                        terns, belonging to Mr. Zervudachi, but it was so large that it took up the
                        whole of one side of the roum. In the first tent there were three large
                        collections of palms, which occupied over 30 metres of space, and in front
                        ot them there were three collections of gera- niums, each of which must have
                        contained several huudreds of plauts. The large groups of aunuals, each of
                        about 500 pots, were much admired. That oF J udge Sandars was designed in
                        the form of a garden and was noticeable for the inclusion of a uumber of
                        pots of Lobelia ''enuor, which is a novelty in Egypt. There were three
                        gruups of show pelargoniums, the first prize being taken by Mr. Benachi, who
                        staged some well-grown plants, espe- cially a white variety named after Lady
                        Cromer. Before leaving the section . of pot plants we should like to
                        congratulate the committee upon the order in which the various groups were
                        arranged, and especially upon the grass borders which helped so much to set
                        olf the plants. 'The bandsome objet d'art otiered by Prince Hussein Pasha
                        Kamel was ou view ciuse te the exhibit of M. Zervudachi, who won it; Judge
                        Sandars, keing second, was awarded a silver medal. The latter also won the

                    <p>Mr. Jacut des Combes staged some fine pausies, and Mr. Percy Carver showed a
                        good cullection of sweet peas, though perhaps not so fiue as has sometimes
                        been seen. Mr. H. Seffer showed a large collection of amarillis and
                        gladiolus, which both obtained first prizes.</p>
                    <p>'The silver medal of the Royal Horticultural Society ot Loudon was won by M.
                        Zervudachi, and the bronze medal, given by the same society, by Prince Omar
                        Toussoun.</p>
                    <p>There were no less than eight tables decorated by ladies, consequently the
                        room allotted to tliem was quite full. Mrs. W. R. Williams, who took the
                        first prize, arranged her table very( graceful:y with eschscholtxia aud
                        white daisiès placed in white vases. Miss icwat cane next with a pretty

                        chése red roses, and Miss G. Allen, who hed quite an original idea which
                        repies enkal water with a mirror in the centre surrounded by miniature
                        rockeries and green grasses. Miss Enna Anderson obtained a notice of 'highly
                        commended' for a graceful table of shell pink roses and pink
                        candleshades.</p>
                    <p>There were only four vases of roses. Miss Allen, who won the-first prize,
                        carried out the very effective idea of placing her exhibit in a rough
                        basket. Miss Hewat obtaned second prize for some light pink roses. Mrs. John

                        <head>THE POLICE AND CRIME.</head>
                        <p>To THE Epiror oF THE EGyPTIAN (GAZETTE.</p>
                        <p>Sir,—In a recent issue of your paper you had an article on the methods
                            employed in Egypt to ensure the diminution of the number of crimes, not
                            of crimes committed, but of crimes reported. I should like to add my
                            testimony to the evidence before you that these ods are not confined to
                            the Moudirieh of Assiout.</p>
                        <p>By reason of the b¥idge, Nag-Hamadi is &amp; locality famous for the
                            number of corpses re- trieved from the river, for either they get hung
                            up in the pontoons, or at least they are seen by the watch. The other
                            day it appears that the police were notified that a woman had disap-
                            peared from Dechna and were asked to watch for the body coming down the
                            river. The police communication was as follows: "lf you see a corpse at
                            the-bridge, say nothing ; If it catches, set it adrift again." Owing to
                            the presence of a European when the corpse did catch, the police
                            programme was not carried out, to the great annoyance of the police
                            officer, who is debited with another undiscovered crime. -</p>
                        <p>The inference drawn in your article that this game of beggar my neighbour
                            played by the police is in part due to the system of fining for untraced
                            crimes seems justifiable. But think what the results would have been had
                            there been instead a bonus for crimes discovered !</p>
                        <p>In the particular case I quote above, I fancy we have not heard the end
                            of the matter,as the P.O. 4n his distress vented his wrath upon a French
                            lady who was standing by and had been instrumental in (excuse the
                            phrase) "upsetting his apple cart." —I am, etc.</p>

                        <p>To tHe Epiror oF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
                        <p>Sir,—In reference to the latter part of Mr. Marsh's letter in your issue
                            of to-day, I fear Mr. Marsh must have written the letter when a little
                            excited, as I made him an apology for having made a mistake, and not for
                            having circulated a false statement to. his injury, of which anybody who
                            knows me, is aware that I am incapable. Moreover, my apology was quite
                            spontaneous and not at all a forced one. As soon as I found out I was
                            wrong, I wrote to Mr. Marsh to express to him the deep regret it caused
                            me. I was unaware until I saw Mr. Marsh afterwards, that he had laid the
                            matter before the Consul.</p>
                        <p>I may add that in my letter of the 10th I did not in any way wish to cast
                            a stigma upon Mr. Marsh's management of the Russell Soldiers Home. He
                            receives his orders from Scotland and carries them out. This letter has
                            bean shown to him, and I should not be surprised if he confirms what I
                            say. — I am, etc.</p>
