          <p>M. Maximoff, Russian Diplomatic Agent at Cairo, is expected to arrive here this week.
            He intends to spend a few weeks in Constantinople before proceeding to Cettigne, to take
            up his new post M. Poppe, councillor of the French Embassy here, leaves to-day for
            Paris, where he is to be married to Mlle Prévost, sister of M. Prévost, of the French
            Diplomatic Service in Egypt. M. Poppe will return here with his bride next month. The
            French Embassy here has applied to the Sublime Porte for the exequatur for M. Davona
            Takla, appointed French Vice-Consul at Assouan. A batch of German tourists arrived here
            last week, on their way to Palestine, whence they will return by way of Egypt There was
            a great run last week on Credit Foncier Egyptien bonds, the old issue going up to 350
            frs. and the new issue to 278 frs. The stock of bonds at the Imperial Ottoman Bank was
            exhausted, and the bank had to telegraph to Alexandria for 1,000 of the new issue </p>

          <head>MR. RONZEVALLE’S CONCERT</head>
          <p>Mr.C. Ronzevalle gave an interesting concert on Saturday night at the Grand Continental
            Hotel He was ably assisted by Mr. Léon Ronzevalle, whose two performances on tho ’cello
            were much appreciated, and by Mrs. Nolan, whose harp solos, “Autumn” and “watching the
            Wheat” were most astically received. Mr. Ronzevalle gave us no less than 11 songs and
            met with considerable success : his voice, if not very powerful, is clear and of a very
            agreeable timbre, and in the mezza-voce and piano passages he showed admirable technique
            and finish. We only wish to criticize one point, vix., the arrangement of the program.
            The transition from Some Day," with its religious sentiment, to one of Planquette’s
            songs, and from the fine “Ave Maria" composed by the singer to his Turkish love song
            “Béuim halym,” struck us as being a little too abrupt. The arrangement of the Caneton
            Espanola also struck us as being less successful more commonplace in fact than that of
            “Boftah Hindi” and “Bénim halym,’ where the composer shows a thorough knowledge of how
            to introduce the Oriental colour into European music without in any way exaggerating it.

          <head>ENTERTAINMENT AT PORT SAID</head>
          <p>Port said, Saturday. Mr. and Mrs. Terence Ramsdale, who have come from Alexandria and
            Cairo and are on their way to Bombay, gave a variety entertainment at the Eldorado
            Theatre last night Unfortunately, the entertainment had not been sufficiently
            advertised, and many people were unaware that these well-known artistes were in the
            town. The hall was in consequence not so crowded as it would otherwise have been, but
            those who were present fully appreciated Mr. and Mrs. Ramsdale’a efforts to amuse them
            For a space of more than two hours they kept the ball rolling with barely - a- minute’s
            interval between the pieces, and never once got out of touch with their audience. Mrs.
            Ramsdale, who has a remarkably pure and clear voice, charmed the audience with her
            excellent rendering of ’’The Star of Bethlehem," and was no less successful in her
            lighter efforts, namely, “Little Mary,” “She reads the London papers every day," and
            “Keep off the Grass." Mr. Ramsdale evoked great admiration by his versatility, and kept
            the audience convulsed with laughter at the original patter which he introduced into his
            songs. His American tap boot dance drew forth rounds of applause. The entertainment
            included a sketch entitled “The Wild Hùssara” or "A Love Strategem,” in which Mrs.
            Ramsdale took the rôle of Nancy, the mistress of the inn, who, although she loved Samuel
            stammere, did not wish to be too easily won. Mr. Ramsdale played the dual part of Samuel
            Stammers and Sergeant Major Blunt, and it was difficult to imagine that these two parts
            were being played by the same man, so excellent was the make-up and perfect his
            portrayal of the two widely different characters </p>

          <p>One of the most important events in the journalistic career of tho veteran Mr.
            Frederick Greenwood, whose seventy-fifth birthday recognized few nights ago by the
            banquet over which Mr. J. Morley presided, was the action he took in connection with the
            Saez Canal shares. It was in 1876 that, acting on the information which had come into
            his possession as an editor, he wont to Lord Derby, then Foreign Secretary, and warned
            him that tho Khedive's shares, which were private property, were about to pass into the
            bands of a French syndicate. The Foreign Minister could not believe that an editor,
            however influential, could have secured information of which the British Consul at Cairo
            was ignorant. </p>
          <p>The difficulties of the situation were obvious. The only way to set the matter at rest
            was to make direct inquiries of the Khedive. It there was no truth in the story the
            result of the interrogatory might be to put the idea of selling the shares into the
            Khedive's bead. This position was put to Mr. Greenwood, but he urged the sending of a
            telegram to our Consul. It was sent To quote Mr. Greenwood's own modest words : “It
            instructed Colonel Stanton to go immediately to the Khedive and put the question
            point-blank. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister would be seen, and Lord Derby’s visitor might
            call next day to bear the reply from-Gairo. It is enough to add here that on the receipt
            of the answer the purchase for England was taken up, and went to a speedy conclusion.” </p>

            La spéculation, au sens absolu du mot, a toujours existé, car, on conmdérunt ken les
            choses, le négociant qui achète use marchandise dans l’sspoir de la revendre par la
            suite, par les siée* qu’il court, tait en somme on peu de spéculation -, seulement, an

            énorme mitre la spéculation réfléchie! modérée et limitée out noyons de la personne qui
            s’y engage et celle qui dégénéra, devient effrénée .et finit en ne laissant que dm
            ruinas et dm catastrophes derrière elle. De par son existence oommamiale, Alexandrie a

            délai que nous désignerons par les mbta jeu pur et simple, s’eet introduit petit é petit
            et a pris droit de cité. Et si Paris, Isverpool New-York, Chicago, etc., etc., ont eu

            préparer le • terrain é oe formidable réveil de la spéculation qui a commencé vers 1898
