                    Mr. Najem Houry, Managing Director of Cyprus Hotel Co., Army Contractor,
                    Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia (on Railway) to
                    Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin Cathedral (now a mosque)
                    begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with other ancient ruins and the
                    Venetian fortifications, the finest in the world. Also the tower or palace, the
                    scene of "Othello'' and of Ford's "Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus
                    in the winter months is delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                    <head>Egypt and the Sudan</head>
                    <p>Commenting upon Sir Eldon Gorst's visit to the Sudan the Standard" says : Sir
                        Eldon Gorst, who is returning to Cairo after bis brief tour of inspection in
                        the Sudan, bas bad an opportunity of seeing something of the latest
                        developments of that interesting territory. It is perhaps needless to say
                        that the high political significance attributed to the visit by the
                        anti-English journalists of Cairo exists only in the imagination of those
                        ingenious persons. These astute critics, who bave lately been endeavouring
                        to persuade their readers that the Sudan is a crushing and onprofitable
                        burden upon Egypt, have been suggesting that Sir Eldon will inaugurate an
                        ora of drastic economies for the upper country. Some of them even went so
                        far as to hint that in this enterprise the British Consul-General was to
                        receive the active assistance of the Under Secretary for the Colonies, and
                        that the two statesmen would have an opportunity of conferring on these
                        matters on the Upper Nile. Nothing of course could be more ridiculous.
                        Neither Egypt nor the Sudan comes, in the smallest de ree, within the
                        Under-Secretary's "sphere of influence." At Khartum Mr. Winston Churchill
                        was received with the courtesy which in that pleasant and hospitable capital
                        is often extended even to less distinguished guests; but his visit had no
                        more official oberacter than that of any other traveller who happened to be
                        passing through on his way down from the equatorial regions, and both Mr.
                        Churchill and his hosts took care to do nothing which could lead to
                        misconception on this point. As a fact, the Under Secretary for the Colonies
                        bad goitted Khartum before Sir Eldon Gorst had left Cairo ; and though they
                        passed one another on the journey they could certainly have had no
                        facilities, even if such had been sought, for the discussion of political
                        affairs Apart from this myth, there is no reason to suppose that any
                        immediate change in Sudan policy is contemplated or any serious revolution
                        in the relations, financial and orber, which link the Anglo-Egyptian
                        condominium to the Khedivial Government. The situation, so ably sum. marised
                        in the last of Lord Cromer's great series of Reports, is not for the present
                        likely to be modified in its main lines. But bere, as elsewbere, Sir Eldon
                        Gorst has been anxious to render bimself familiar with all the details of
                        administration, not so much with the idea of correcting the work of his
                        predecessor as of extending and amplifying it, and adapting it where
                        necessary to exigencies which were not contemplated during the years when
                        Lord Cromer was rebuilding the fabric of orderly administration throughout
                        the Nile Valley. In the Sudan, even more than in Egypt, the problem is one
                        of developing by administiative means the resources of the country That the
                        vast territory, in spite of its tracts of arid waste and inbospitable
                        desert, contains the possibililies of immense agricultural wealth is the
                        assured belief of all who know something about it. Irrigation; population,
                        and communication are its three prime requisites. Next, of course, after
                        that repression of rapine and violence which the Anglo-Egyptian arins have
                        secured. The first and second of thee two great needs cannot be supplied,
                        other difficulties apart, until progress has been made with the third. The
                        Sudan, like the Britain of the Roman poet, has been penitus toto divisum ab
                        urbe : too long cut oft from the stream of the world's commerce, and
                        accessible only by the long, narrow thoroughfare that leads from the
                        Mediterranean by the Nile sud over the cataracts and through the desert. By
                        that difficult and devious track, on the decks of sailing boats and river
                        steamers, and on the backs of camels, such heavy articles as machinery and
                        building plant have been conveyed with infinite labour into the heart of
                        tropical Africa. But for modern commeree the route is far too slow and too
                        costly. From the beginning of our occupation of the terrirory it has been
                        seen that the Sudan, if it is to make full use of its agricultural
                        capacities, must be placed in direct communication with the Red Sea. During
                        the last year and a half this aim has been achieved. The railways from the
                        Atbara, near Berber, to Port Sudan, few miles from Snakin, is the worthy
                        complement of the work of Lord Kitcbener and Sir Percy Girvuard when they
                        carried the line across the desert from Wady Halfe, and so placed Khurtum in
                        contact with Europe and the Nile Delta From the mercantile point Tof view,
                        the Port Sudan railway, is even more valuable. Sir Eldon Gorst, whose tour
                        in. cluded a trip over the new line and an ex amination of its outlet, can
                        bardly fail to bave been surprised at wbat be saw. In the sbort space of two
                        years and a half he will have found that the engiveers of the Sudan
                        Government have bridged the old caravan route to the sea by a railway, on
                        which one can travel in all the height of modern luxury ; and at the
                        terwious they have laid something more than the foundation of a first-rate
                        modern port and trading town on what thirty years ago was a stretch of
                        uninbabited foreshore. At Port Sydan tbe Consul General saw the plans of

                        warehouse, steam cranes, coal lifting machinery-all the appliances of brisk
                        and enterprising trade. Port Sudan, with its fine harbour and its open
                        channel, navigable at all hours and in all tides, may become one of the
                        notable commercial entrepots of the world. Sooner or later it seems
                        inevitable that the trade of North Eyoatorial Africa must flow through its
                        gates. Meanwhile, it has brought the Sudan into almost startling coutignity
                        with the main centres of the world's industry and population. A passenger
                        travelling by this route can reach Khartum eight days after leaving London,
                        without suffering the smallest discomfort or inconvenience en route ; a load
                        of cotton, grown on the Sudan plantation, can be raileal to the Red Sea and
                        shipped to the docks at Salford without breaking bulk and in a space of time
                        which will compare very favourably with the transit from most other centres
                        for the supply of the fibre. By an audacious flank attack, the isolation of
                        Central Africa has at length been broken down, and the results of the
                        movement, though they may not be realised so quickly with its leaders
                        anticipate, must oveatually be remarkable. </p>

                        the exclusion of Sheikh Rasi from the Khedive's Coreception at Abdeen Palace
                        does n3t call for any further detailed obeervations. The ovent He was
                        certainly regrettable in that it may CRUSO e certain amount of feeling in

                        On the other hand the authorities were left to ohoice in the matter and it
                        was undoubtedly due to the Sheikh's own want of tact that he should have
                        brought himself into such an unpleasant position. The reforun of Al Azhar,
                        on which this inci dent hinges, is one of the great problems apon which the
                        Moslem world appear to be some what, divided. In all cases where religious
                        questions are involved there will over be two parties, those who are in
                        favour of keeping things they are, and those who desire to move with the
                        spirit of the times. Such diver gencies necessarily lead to a great deal of
                        bad blood for there is no more fruitfulsoil for acrimonious hostilities than

                        merged in that of Al Athar. All Moslem education must under existing
                        conditions bave a religious basis. Therefore it would be a fatal step, in
                        the present backward condition of the Egyptian people, to concentrate all
                        the elements of progress in order to found New University, thus leaving the

                    <head>French Deputy On Egyptian Nationalism.</head>
                    <p>Mr. Maurice Barrès, the Deputy and Academician, who has just returned from
                        Egypt, has made the following statement to a repre sentative of the "Belair"
                        respecting the Nationalist agitation in that country, a summary of which
                        appeared in our special cable of the 17th. "In the existing condition of
                        affaire no Egyptian could seriously desire the disappear ance of European
                        advisers. If England were to retire, and if she were not succeeded by France
                        or some other European nation, the result would be return to anarchy. This
                        would be felt as intolerable by the fellabs, who are bow acoustomed to
                        justice and equity, which are, if you like, of a relative character, but
                        still very appreciable, if only in the coll setion of taxes. There is,
                        however, a very strong Nationalist sentiment in the hearts of the
                        natives--that is to say their religious feel. ing and their attachment to
                        Islam. Toleration is a natural gift of the Egyptian Mahomedians; but if they
                        considered that offence bad been done to their religion, their feeling
                        against the foreigner might become really active and even dangerous. Thus
                        you see how Egyptian Nationalism is at the same time a very genuine feeling
                        and one without any precise political object."</p>

                        to and really does eclipse all. The arrangements were ou an elaborate scale
                        and the comfort of the guests had received the fullest consideration. The
                        approaches were enclosed in Arabic tentage while the balcony was transformed
                        into a sitting out apartment and looked very comfortable decked with bunting
                        and evergreen. The ball room itself was tastefully decorated, indeed better
                        than we have yet seen it with flags and palms, while the chain like array of
                        oriental lanterne lent additional charm to the pro ceedings. Some 200
                        persons accepted the committee's invitation amongst whom we noticed Macauley
                        Bey and Mr. and Mrs Trevithick. The string band of the King's Own Soottish
                        Borderers played an excellent programme of music under the direction of

                        shareholders of the above Company, suggests a question which in these as
                        difficult times, should be of very general ni interest The Company referred
                        to is, I believe, y constituted under Egyptian Law and your be
                        correspondenta state its object is the purchase ter and improvements of land
                        in Egypt for resale; they further state that the Directors have cht invested
                        in Cyprus sum not expected to on. exceed 2160,000. It appean to me that if
                        the Di Company is an Egyptian one its sphere of action for limited
                        responsibility is confined to Egypt alone, unless it is clearly stated in
                        ita decree of incorporation, that its objects are of wider range than that
                        stated in the letter above referred to. If I am right in this supposition no
                        special resolution of general meetings, ordinary or extraordinary, can
                        change this or subject to Egyptian law of limited responsibility, any
                        transactions undertaken outside this country, and any agch business would be
                        done on the personal responsibility of the directors. It is only right that
                        this should be so, for otherwise any shareholder might find that his noney,
                        which he had subscribed with the understanding that it should be invested in
                        this country, more or less under his own supervision, was being spent in the
                        middle of Ho the desert of Sabarah, or in some equally remote place, from
                        which it might not be ensy to recall it. It is quite probable that some of
                        your readers may be able to give some information on this subject. I only
                        ask for it on general grounds, and not especially er with reference to the
                        company above referred to. I remain, yours truly, Observer.</p>

                        arguments of our local financiers, who imagine that a loan of two millions
                        will materially relieve the present situation. The situation is clearing of
                        itself, only this process must take time and it will be far clearer
                        afterwards, if the Government does not try to bolster up a false position.

                    <p>The negotiations, which have been continuing of late between the Egyptian

                        at, which will free the Egyptian Estates from its embarrassing purchase. The
                        final approbation will be given at an extraordinary general meeting of the
                        shareholders of the George Nungovich Hotels Company, which will be convened
                        at once after the agreement bas been arrived at. If it is decided to
                        sanction the arrangement as to the retrocession of the hotel, no new hotel
                        will be bailt by the company to take the I place of the Savoy Hotel as was
                        originally intended after the hotel had been disposed of to the Egyptian

                        London, it is merely an Egyptian joint stock company (société anonyme),
                        which does not fulfil the conditions imposed by Egyptian law to ensure its
                        validity. The Shareholders in I question, who bold some 1,000 shares ask
                        that an official liquidator be appointed, and that the board be dissolved.
                        It will be remembered that the company was formed scarcely a year ago, in

                    <p>Mme Magne's "Carmen" was triumph o personality and interpellation : it proved
                        how a really clever gifted artiste can transform herself at will into the
                        most varied and conflict ing parts. In the first act she was the flaunting,
                        bold, hande me factory girl bogdiling her brigadier for the sheer fun of so
                        doing and by the mere contrast ber dovilry to the purity of the pale ooy
                        Micaela. In the lon she was the gipsy, queen among ber sunggling tavern
                        baunters, just decently grateful to the released prisoner, but far more
                        excited by the bold toreror. Theo two acts were triomph. for ber every
                        glance and movement The third at is I venture to believe, impossible for any
                        bat Spaniards or a very, very fow Italians and Mme Magno is neither : and to
                        me there seemed a touch of convention of adaptation, rather, of the part.
                        But the last act again brought out her full powers. Her adoration for
                        Escamillo, her annoyance with Don José and contempt for bis despair, her
                        fright and rage at the danger, and then her death, those were consummate.
                        Two particular features, the quick desperate quiver of her hands as sho
                        retreated from him searching escape in vain, and her scream for Becamillo,
                        heldur entranced, awe-struck, rather. It was a great performance needless to
                        say, the music was AS child's play to her, not a shade of its cold, cynical
                        subtelty escaped her, and she gave the fullest meaning to every intonation.
                        Unusual especially was ber singing when with the chorus, never drowned by
                        it, yet never overpowering it. It was remarkablo. M. Soubayran, was better
                        than usual as Don José, especially at the end. Some of his higher notes were
                        most telling. M. Gorins was also gond, and deserved bis encore for the
                        Toreador,' thongh be forced bis voice a little, it seemed, to obtain the
                        effect. Mlle Talbert was admirably clear and correct M Micaela. The part
                        suited ber and showed that she has an excellent sympathetic voice. The
                        chorns were most adequate. Their acting, as well as their singing, was
                        convincing and showed to better advantage, had their conductor realised more
                        thoroughly the character of Bizet's music. It is a wonder that Carmen musio,
                        torre fascinating every time one bears it, subtlo, unique, daring,
                        absolutely decisive, the production of a real and unusual personality. M.
                        Baron missed the clear, fire and sparkle of it, the crafty, 'diablerie' (the
                        only word) the whole varied strength that distinguishes Bizet from all
                        others. Yet it "went" all the same. The collective power of the singers
                        achieved the result and Madame Magne crownedit. </p>

                    <p>The only two items in last Sunday's concert which one can mention with

                        all too short, slas, was his part, but it was instinct with the dignity and
                        beauty of the music, admirable for tone resonance and absolute certainty.
                        For the rest the orchestra were sheep without a sbepherd, burried headlong
                        through the Bach into the Massenet, and thence into the beginning of the
                        Saint Saëns, without breathing space until the violia solo bawan. Such
                        aliwht continuity and interpretation as appeared was, all through, thanks to
                        the leader of the violins. The conductor evidently was unable to deal with
                        the programme. One would gladly have passed over the whole episode in
                        silence but this attempt of the Society to start organised music in Cairo is
                        so important, that one cannot allow their efforts to be wholly wasted, They
                        have drawn up splendid programmes, and they have procured the services of an
                        admirable orchestra. If the conductor cannot lead the orchestra or interpret
                        the music, he should be left to such pieces and operas as are within bis
                        scope. It w yuld be fatal to encourage throngh mere indul. gence a delusion,
                        the results of which would discourage all music lovers from further
                        attendance or efforts I hear that M. Massio, a famous violinist and
                        musician, is in Cairo, and that he may be induced to conduct at the last
                        four concerts. It is most earnestly to be hoped that he will consent so to
                        do. Since writing this I hear, that M. Massie bas consented to conduct the
                        next concert. It is just possible the date may have to be changed to

                        serving in the "Hastings," stationed in the Mediterranean, wben difficulties
                        arose between the Porte and Mebemet Ali, which resulted in 1840 in the
                        British undertaking operations of the coast of Syria The "Hastings" was
                        ordered to the scene of action, and on September 15 he took part in the
                        capture of Batroon. He was next employed in the distribution of arms to the
                        Maronites, and in October was present in the barge of the "Hastings" at the
                        destruction of mine designed to blow up the eastern fort of Beirut. This
                        brilliant exploit was carried out successfully under the direction of
                        Commander Henry Worth, with the loss of one midshipman of the ship. For bis

                    <head>THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AFFECTED THE BUSINESS - A QUICK RETURN. </head>
                    <p>The second ordinary general meeting of the Commercial, Industrial and Land
                        Company of Egypt, Limited, was held yesterday, at Salis. bury House,
                        London-wall, EC, Mr. Scott Linge, J.P., occupying the chair. The Secretary
                        (Mr. Alfred Banbury) having read the notice convening the meeting, the
                        report of the auditors was read by their representative, Mr. Shaw The
                        Chairman saids On rising to move the adoption of the report and balance
                        sheet my first duty is to express my regret at the absence of Sir Richard
                        Temple, the chairman of the company, who is away on the Continent and enable
                        to get back in time to attend the meeting in those circumstances the
                        directors beve done me the honour of asking me to preside at this general
                        meeting of the company and to move the adoption of the report and balance
                        sheet. I will turn at once to the accounts, as exhibited in the balance
                        sheet. The accounts of the company and of the business conducted in Egypt
                        have been audited by Messrs. Russell, Kerr and Wyatt, who are Chartered
                        Accountants of London and Cairo, and they present this balance sheet, with
                        the certificate attached thereto. I would rather in detail to the items of
                        the account as follows. The authorised hospital of the company is £300,000
                        of that there was issued originally 157,701 ordinary shares and 5,000
                        deferred shares; but it will be within the knowledge of gentlemen who have
                        followed events in Egypt that very shortly after the formation of this
                        company . period of financial crisis and industrial depression commenced in
                        that country, which was not without disastrous results to this company; and
                        one of the consequences of that state of affairs was that the directors in
                        the interests of the company, owing to the non-payment of the calls which
                        had been made from time to time on the shares, were compelled to forfeit a
                        very large number of the primeval allotments, the figures in question being
                        58,724 ordinary shares, representing £58,724 of capital. Io respect of those
                        shares, however, there have been certain payments made, and to the extent of
                        some monto the company reaped the benefit, and you will obaryo that there is
                        an item of hodount of $10,889 18., representing the count the company
                        received in respect of those shares which were afterwards forfeited. There
                        appears on the statement of capital account the regrettable fact that £8,808
                        18. is in arrear now in respect of calle des apor shares issued. No steps
                        have, so far, boon. taken in connection with those shares : but it is
                        obvious that unless within a very reasonable time the holders of those share
                        fulfil their obligations to the company, it will be the day 1 of the
                        directors to forfeit thou shares also. and the parties who have paid curtain
                        goms in respect of them will thereby love their interest in the company. The
                        reason why there has been difference made between cortaid 10 tions of the
                        shareholders is that looks who still remain on the books of the company in
                        respect, of shares not paid ap have paid larger pro: portion of their
                        indebtedness to the company than those whose shares have already been for,
                        feited. The result of the notion taken by your board is that the amount of l
                        ed capital at the present time is £95,173 76., that being, made up by shared
                        which are made at fully. paid and in respect of the date offered for
                        subscription and subscribed for in cash, Then the sundry creditors, a set
                        out in the balance sheet, amount to £86,876 76 ; that item is a very heavy
                        one, and reference to it will have to be made in the subsequent remarks that
                        it will be my duty to submit to you. The balance carried to the credit of
                        profit and loss amounts to £7,710 28 On the assets side of the balance sheet
                        stock in hand, work in progress, and work completed but not delivered
                        amounts to £76,599 9s. 3d. Sundry debtors and bills receivable, less reserve
                        for bad debts, stand at £71,078 12s. 4d. In arriving at that figure care has
                        been taken, I am informed by the auditors, to investigate the stability of
                        the varibus accounts, and in arriving at this ulti mate net figure they have
                        taken the precaution to set wide what, in their opinion, in Mufficient
                        reserve fund to allow for any bad debts which may recrue. Accounts paid in
                        advance amount to £2,269, and that item called for no remark. Buildings,
                        plants, and machinery, less depreciation, amount to £5,630 198. 2d. office
                        furniture and fittings, London and Egypt, le-s depreciation, £984 169, 10d.,

                        amounts to £9,475. Then there is good Will of the business of R. Kuster and

                        to some extent &amp; personal explanation---that subsequent to the formation
                        of the company, and after it had gone to allotment, I was invited by your
                        directors to join the board, under the articles of association, as an
                        additional director, and, if I may say so, I think one of the reasons which
                        induced your directors to take that step was that I was introduced to them
                        as a commercial man having knowledge of commercial affairs, and in that
                        respect likely to be of some assistance to them in the conduct of the
                        affairs of the company. In that connection it became my duty to investigate
                        as far as possible the conditions and circumstances under which you were
                        working, and I found, in effect, that only two options of those recited in
                        the original prospectus were dealt with by your directors; the others were
                        rejected for various reasons. It was within the discretion of the directors
                        to determine which options they should exercise, and it was their bounden
                        duty | to investigate, so far as lay in their power, the value of the
                        options to the company, if exercised, and also to take into consideration
                        the financial condition of the company, and having regard to the critical
                        condition which existed at that time iu Egypt, I am bound to say that |I
                        think the directors exercised a very wise discretion in not entering into
                        any further options than those to whom they were already committed, because
                        a somewhat abnormal state of affairs had arisen, apart from the conditions
                        in Egypt, owing to the fact that a saisio bad been placed on the funds of
                        the company in Egypt in connection with a misunderstanding -we will call
                        it--between the company and certain parties who had give the options in
                        alluded in the original prospectus. This was a difficult matter to bendle;
                        but your board was able, by taking an energetic and somewhat costly step, to
                        relieve the company of the saisie placed on the funds and liberate the weepy
                        then lying in Egypt. They then directed their attention primarily to the
                        development and organisation of the industrial business which they had
                        acquired that being the business of R. Kustor and Co., well-known, well-cota
                        blished, and favourable undertaking carrying on business in connection with
                        iron work very largely, supplying girders and similar articles to
                        contractors, and also minor articles which could be classed under the head
                        of ironmongery. Mr. Walker Ablitt was the proprietor of the business in
                        question, and, in the terms of the contract for sale, was appointed manager
                        of the business of Kaster and Co. in Egypt for a period of five years. Mr.
                        Ablitt had a solo charge of that business prior to the formation of the
                        company, and he took payment for the Assets of the undertaking, in
                        accordance with the contract for sale, in shares of the company. In that

                        further, but bareIy to point out to the shareholders that the board is
                        determined that everything possible that ona be done shall be done to make
                        the bad issues in Egypt a spoonful and a paying one, and we look to Me

                        the company, at any este, shall be worked in a Inapper within ita mends, and
                        not driven into a position of financial danger by ill-considered and not
                        thoroughly thought out action on the part of the management. Now, the other
                        option which was exercised by the board yw in respect of freehold land in
                        Cairo, which did not belong to Kester's business, but we mociated with it to
                        the extent that it belonged to certain people in trust, and the buildings,
                        or the main business of Kaster and Co, carried out on the land in question.
                        By the toto of the option at a fortunate time the company was able to
                        achieve a very popsidetablo pruft on reale, and practically the profit which
                        is carried to the credit of profit and los account crgo from the heroise of
                        that option, because you will observe io timing to the polite and loss
                        count, that the amount of profit origin from the business of Messrs. R.
                        Kuster and Co. for the your under review ww $694 only. The profit accruing
                        09 the exercise of the option of the rengle of land at Boulao was £14,915
                        80. Td. I should men Lion, in this connection, that the resale which took
                        place wasabjeet to the terms of a contract ropited this the purchase
                        consideration was to be paid in inglegents, and up to the present time in
                        toopoot of the total puroboro, price, the com of £45,000 has been received,
                        there remain ing is round figor $60,000 still to be paid. Thadi however, is
                        not all to be paid to us because the land in question was subject to a very
                        considerable mortgage It was taken over by the purchaser, and obey undertook
                        to redeem the mortgage in the terms of the contract for sale. Therefore,
                        although the profit has been earned upon the sale of the land, it has not
                        yet been received into the coffers of the company, and the deal cannot be
                        considered complete until the whole of the probase confidential is paid. The
                        property has not been transferred to the purchasers, and remains poder the
                        control of the company. We are therefore in this position : that we have
                        sold the land at an agreed price, and, in respect of the purchase price, we
                        have received £25,000, 80 that our position in this connection is secure.
                        But, as I said before, we cannot definitely determine that we have received
                        this profit dotil the whole of the purchase price has been paid, and having
                        regard to these circumstances, having regard to the position pé effein in
                        Egypt and to the amount of money involved in Kaster's business it was deemed
                        wise on the part of the directorate not to distribute any of the profits,
                        but to carry them forward to the credit of parotid and lows account, and
                        with that action live true to think any reasonable and conservative member
                        of the company will agreo, I should mention that the auditors' report calls
                        attention to the amount of $6,49 1s, 7d. As 'principally representing the
                        balance of pools looted debts of Meers R: Kuster and Co wat Jono 30, 1906.
                        We understand that these debts are guaranteed by your mooger in Psypt." The
                        explanation of that clause in the auditor's report is very simple, and I can
                        briefly stato it as follows: At the time the puroba a made from Mr. Ablitt,
                        of Messrs. Kuster and Co, be pustrentwort that the book debts appearing on
                        the balance sheet then prepared should be collected on behalf of the
                        company. And at the end of 1007 we found that this Amount of the old book
                        debts had not been collected or approximately. There was some other item' in
                        the accounts; but, broadly speaking it represents that fact, and therefore
                        we had arrived it in range with Mr. Ablitt whereby we could endeavour to
                        settle up the back reckoning as on June 30, 1907. Mr. Ablitt, in respect of
                        his purchase consideration, bad bostado comodo non be of fully-paid share in
                        the company and the question is ideal with this amount while bit Bed
                        guaranteed. In the guarantee itself in the contract for male there was no
                        specific time within which Mr Ablitt was to pay up their uncollected old
                        dabu, said there was scheme suggested whereunder to settle the old
                        outstanding account forfeiture of certain of the shares which had been
                        issued to Mr. Ablitt should be made ; but we are not satisfied that that is
                        quite in accordance with the law, and in the meantime, at any rate," that
                        matter must and over for further consideration. They are undoubtedly good
                        debts to the company, Loomuse we buvo Mr. Ablitt's guarantee, and in report
                        of that guarantee we are totaled • certain number of stringed shares which

                        14.security for the amount of ibo outstanding accounts. Now, that is briefly
                        the position of the company, and the futgro of the undertaking will depend,
                        entirely upon the successful, overgetic, and Careful. Ornament throb in
                        Egypt. We cannot expect a repetition of the fortunate circumstance of the
                        wise of an option on Land and the role of it, and we shall have to be
                        dependent for the proventy i at any itate -upon the income earned by the
                        business of Kuster and Co., for the provision of return upon the capital of
                        the company Therefore that point is one of great anxiety to the board, and
                        one which must be dealt with in careful and proper manner if we are going to
                        see any satisfactory return apon, the Amount of capital invested in this
                        company. According to the terms of the articles of association, the board of
                        the company are entitled to do opt directors within a certain period, and
                        the tenure of office of any director no oo opted is to bo till the next
                        general meeting. It therefore becomes my duty as a co-opted member of the
                        board to submit myself for re-election to the shareholders of the company,
                        and it lies in their hands to determine whether or not in their opinion it
                        is desirable, in the interests of the company, that I should continue as a
                        member of the board. All I can say is that, having familiarised myself with
                        the nature of the undertaking, and with the character of the business which
                        has been acquired, I have little hesitation in saying that it has elements
                        within it of very considerable value, which, if properly handled, will
                        result in a steady, although not an exaggerated, retour upon the capital of
                        the company which has been invested, and so long as I have the confidence of
                        the shareholders, and remain a director of the company, I shall do all that
                        lies in my power towards that end. I have now pleasure in moving the
                        adoption of the report and balance sheet which have been presented to you.
                        (Applause.) Colonel A. M. Harington Bey seconded the motion. Mr. Monikland
                        said that he observed on the balance sheet that the issued capital consisted
                        of 157,701 ordinary shares. He wished to ask how many of the shares were
                        subscribed for by the public, and how many were issued to the vendors or
                        others ! - The Chairman replied that 104,000 were originally subscribed for,
                        and the balance was issued as fully paid. Mr. Mogkland said that in the
                        prospectus it ww stated that the vendor company was the Westminster
                        Industrial and Pidance Developments, Limited, which by an agreement, dated
                        April 20, 1906, agreed to sell the options for a sum of £14,000, payable as
                        to £10,000 in fully paid ordinary shares, and a to the balance of £4,000 in
                        fully paid deferred shares. By the same agreement the vendor company agreed
                        to pay all the costs of the preliminary agreements, and the memorandum sod
                        articles of association, "and generally, all the preliminary expenses
                        whatsoever," for Is further sum of £10,0 0, £9,000 in cash and £1.000 in
                        fully paid dolorredi shares. By a third Agreement she vendor company was to
                        receive 4.000 in oasb-to pay for the underwriting. He calculated the ligorou

                        that Mr. Monkland referred to the prosperous and pointed to contain higures,
                        amounting to $98.000, and called atbeutiort to the thot that the figures
                        shown in the balatie-shoutkuodot ed to $30, 193. The explanation of the
                        matter was this: the first leem of £15,000, which apported in the prospectus
                        "28 214,000, hud boon ingro good by payment trider contract of £1,000 in

                        that it was not mentioned on the propostas. Ti Obairman stated that it was
                        mentioned on the prospectus, Mr. Á Bolaland asked if the payment was made to
                        the Westminster Industrial and Finance Developments Company. The Chairman:
                        No; it was payment made in connection with that option. Mr. Mopkland: Do you
                        mind telling me to whom it was paid ? The Chairman: You are a lawyer, I take

                        21,000. As regards the £1,193 10s. 8d, which is an increase of the second

                        prosper Mr. Monkland remarked that the words to the prospectus, "and
                        generally all the preliminary expenses whatsoever," did not mean what they
                        appeared to mean. It said: "All stamps, fees, and legal exp . And go.
                        perally all the preliminary expenses whatsoever." Who knew nothing about
                        stamp duties and transfer, but one was led to believe that they were going
                        to pay everything out of that £28,000. The Chairman: As a matter of fact
                        those items were adjudged, at the time the matter was settled, not to be
                        included in the contract. I have not gone into this question personally,
                        because it was an accomplished fact at the time I joined the board, and I
                        assume that the directors of the company were properly cad legally advised
                        as to their obligations in regard to the comet, and this was the decision
                        they arrived at after ouob advice. Mr. Monkland and that he was blaming
                        anybody; all he was taking for w for information. The Chairman : As to the
                        amount of me which the company possessed at the moment, the amount in London
                        was, approximately, | £ 1,800 and in Egypt, according to Mr. Ablitt, they
                        had about £500. Mr. Monkland remarked that he supposed that was all the
                        money which the company bad in the world, excepting what they might expect
                        to get from trading The Chairman said that he had already explained that
                        there were considerable amounts still due from an important company in
                        connection with the purchase of the land. Of course, be quite agreed that if
                        they continued to apuud £8,000 overy from west ham, and only cried 4500,
                        they would soon be in bankruptcy. He did not know, however, whether: Ma
                        Monkland had been a shareholder since the inception of the company; but if
                        not, it would be of value to tell him that the 100st abnormal state of
                        things arose in this company which required the expenditure of an enormous
                        amount in order to set things right. le the earlier stages of the company
                        the directors were face to face with lawsuit in Egypt which threatened
                        immediate disaster, and it was found secondary to taking steps to remove
                        that condition of things, which was a costly matter to the company. of that
                        expenditure of £8,000 be thought they might safely say that £5,000 of it was

                        particulars of the various items included in the £8,004, and pointed out
                        that the expenses incidental to the removal of the ssisie in Egypt snouted
                        to £3,059 aod the payments to managing directors to £1,615. Ho had omitted
                        to state in his preliminary remarks that a chango had been made in the
                        constitution of the board. At its inup time there was a managing director
                        appointed at potential salary, but era gements bad since boonsgade in the
                        dirootlon of economy. Mr Mookland observed that, deducting the abnormal
                        expenditure, the cost of running the concern appeared to him to be about
                        £8,600 a year. Mr. Monkland observed that, having regard to the whole of the
                        circumstances of the company and its trading, the stook, Amounting to
                        £76,00, was exceedingly high." He thought the shareholders would like to
                        hear some explanation as to that item. The Chairman : In answering that
                        question I shall have to make reference to one of those matters which is in
                        disputa beautycon the board of directors in London and the management in
                        Egypt. The board is of opinion that that amount of stock is too beory,
                        having regard to the turnover of the undertaking, and it has been . a matter
                        of debate betroga the board the manager in Egypt to what etape shall be
                        taken to reduce that stock, and also what is &amp; proper sad reasonable
                        stock to carry having regard to the character of the business carried on in

                    <p>The reduction of the Bank of England rate to 5 per cent yesterday was
                        anticipated as a matter of course in financial circles, and it is even
                        suggested that we shall shortly be back to the old rate of 47 per cent. All
                        the conditions are favourable to low rate. The Bank is getting into a very
                        strong position, and money cortines to flow in freely. The return this week
                        shows an addition of a further 1 million to the reserve, and a 5 per cent.
                        rate in present conditions is likely to prove more than sufficieutly
                        effective. The persistent forcing down of discount rates is, however used as
                        an Argoment against a lower rate Since the ship ments of gold to America
                        ceased, and the prospect of e-ier conditione became brighter, rates have
                        dwindled until three months' paper bow realises no more than 47% of even
                        less than this figure, and the probabilities are that it will go still
                        lower. Money is abundant, and overnight accomodation is easily obtainable at
                        817 per cent and at four sper cent for week. After the announcement of the
                        reduction in the Bank rate elearing banks reduced their deposit rate to 81
                        per cent. The Bank return takes an excellent sbowing. Although over £600,000
                        in gold was exporter, the stock of coin and ballion is op £1,020,000. The
                        active note circulation contracted to the ex. tent of £574,0 0, so that the
                        reserve is higher by £1,594,000, making a total of £25,847,000. This
                        compares with total of £22,593,000 in the corresponding weeks last year when
                        the Bank rate was also lowered to 5 per cent. The proportion to liabilities
                        is 521%as agaisnt 453 %year ago The quotation for bar gold is lower on the

                        virtues of the Stoek Exchange, and the pure of events bring some curious
                        instances of its erratie tendencies. One would have imagined that the advent
                        of cheaper money and a reduction in the Bank mate to 5 per cent would have
                        affect ed prices lavourably, but the very opposite has been the result,

                        cases. We pointed out last od week that there bas recently been subatan r

                        rumours, an attempt was tondo to supply a reason for the step alleged to

                        quarrelled over the be former's currency proposals. The report of the

                    <p><hi rend="bold">Egyptians</hi> The Egyptian market has been rather remarkable
                        one this week, for the reason that with about two exceptions, the movements
                        have been absolutely featureless The exceptions UE have been in the case of
                        National Banks and Abonkir, both of which have further progress, ou guod

                        and seem firm at the price. We mentioned in a recent article that an
                        increased coupon night be expected next time, and probably the present
                        strength of these shares is to an extent attributable to this anticipation,
                        although, o course, the excellent position the Bank now boids is generally
                        recognised, and it was in the natural Order of things that the share would
                        show – considerable appreciation de when once the selling incidental to the

                        demand for United Egyptian Lanus on rumours that the company has arranged an

                        pronounced tendency in these shares. Union Foncière has been in quiet demand
                        at about 4 ). These shares present a very attractive yield to investors at
                        this price, and it would seem that in view of several good land sales during
                        the past year, the company should be able to increase its last dividend of 4
                        per cent. Khedivial Mail has been rather neglected, though at 19/6 there
                        seems to be support. Alexandria Water experienced a sharp set back to 104
