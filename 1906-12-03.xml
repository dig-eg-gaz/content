                        petroleum exploration company, was reported today by the coast guard cruiser
                        Nour el Bahr to be aground at Gemsab, near Gebel Zeit, in the Gulf of Suez.
                        At the time of grounding she apparently was in charge of a Red Sea Pilot.
                        The company's steamer Callioubieh was despatched this day at noon to her
                        assistance.</p>

                    <p>BANQUET IN CAIRO</p>
                    <p>A farewell was given yesterday evening to M. de la Bouliniere, French
                        Diplomatic Agent (who is leaving Cairo for Athens) by the French colony of
                        Cairo, at the Continental Hotel. The spacious drawing room of the hotel was
                        converted for the occasion into a banqueting all and the tables, which were
                        arranged in horse shoe fashion, were most artistically decorated with red
                        and white roses relieved by maidenhair ferns. On the right of M. de la
                        Bouliniere was M. de Reffye, who succeeds him as Diplomatic Agent in Cairo,
                        and on his left was M. de Valdrome. Among the other 150 guests were M.
                        Vanei, M. Maspero, M. de Kramer, M. Barois, President Prunieres, Dr.
                        Brossard, M. Picelli, and Chelu Bey.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of dessert M. Vaneri, depute de la nation, in an eloquent
                        speech expressed the great regret of the whole French colony at the
                        severance of heir connection with M. de la bouliniere, whose services daring
                        his four years stay in Cairo had been highly steemed. In wishing M. de la
                        Bouliniere every success in his new appointment which he was about to
                        assume, he expressed the sentiment of not only those who were present but of
                        the united colony.</p>
                    <p>M. Maspero, in handing an illuminated address to M. de la Boulinere, which
                        was signed by all attending the banquet, echoed the wishes of M. Vaneri,
                        saying that this act of homage was but an evidence of the retiring
                        Diplomatic Agent's immense popularity among those whom he represented in
                        this country, and to a man who had faithfully fulfilled his allotted
                        duty.</p>
                    <p>After M. de la Boulinere's reply, in which he expressed the great regret with
                        which he left his many friends in Egypt, and his gratitude for the only too
                        kind and flattering sentiments to which he had just listned, the band of the
                        Inniskilling Dragoons, which supplied the music for the occasion, under the
                        condactorship of Mr. Prosser, struck up the "marseillaise," at the
                        conclusion of which the guest of honour made his departure, shaking hands
                        with all present.</p>
                    <p>It only remains to say that the banquet was most sumptuous, and under the
                        direct supervision of Mr. Braun, even excelled the previous menus of the
                        Grand Continental Hotel on similar occasions.</p>

                    <p>The St. Andrew's Dinner on Friday night was a great and notable sucess.
                        Shepheard's Hotel excelled itself, and provided a flat-rate menu and
                        first-rate wines. The Haggis was solemnly "played in" by the bagpipes, and a
                        telegram sent to Mr. James Hewa at Alexandris, to whose patriotism and
                        generosity the company owed the famous dish. The band of the Inniskilling
                        Fusiliers played throughout the dinner and the haunting charm of the
                        Northern melodies must have awakened many memories, pleasant and pathetic.
                        All the usual toasts were proposed and drunk. Mr. Mitchel-Innes, the
                        chairnman, made a really fine speech for the "Land o' Cakes." Mr. Monteith
                        Smith, Mr. Dicey; C.B., Mr. D.E. Clark, Mr. Ross Taylor, and Mr. B. Thomson
                        were all eloquent and amusing. There were 39 present in all, and among them
                        Harvey Pasha, Messrs. McGillivray, Granville, Scott Monorieff, Hewitt; and
                        we must not forget Mr. Murray, the piper, who came in "fall kit," kilt and
                        all. In fact, it was a memorable and delightful function, and it is to be
                        hoped that St. Andrew's Day will always be as genially and loyally
                        celebrated in Egypt as it was last Friday.</p>

                    <p>One of the first needs of a critic is self-assurance, yet there was occasions
                        on which those bolder than ourselves might reasonably quail; such as, for
                        instance, the performance of "Bar Kohba," a melodrama acted in Yiddish and
                        dealing with a half forgotten period of Jewish history. That such a play can
                        find in Alexandria a large and appreciative audience is proof, if one were
                        needed , not only of the size but also of the constancy and enthusiasm of
                        the Jewish community. Their able support to Saturday's performance will be a
                        welcome contribution to the funds of the "Gmilet Hered," in aid of which
                        charity the entertaiment was given.</p>
                    <p>The acting as well as the incidental music, were apparently of no very high

                    <p>CLAIM SUPPORTED BY ENGLAND.</p>
                    <p>Our Constantinople Correspondent is informed that the question of Thassos has
                        become international, and that the Khedive, supported by England, is making
                        a claim to the port on the island and to the foreign mining concessions
                        given by Turkey to a Geran company. The Khedive, who also opposes the
                        concession for a cable between Thassos and Thendos, says the island belongs
                        to him </p>
                    <p>The news that the Khedive is again actively pressing his claim to the little
                        island of Thassos revives the memory of one of the curiosities of Oriental
                        history. Thassos does unquestionably belong to the descendants of Mehemet
                        Ali, despite the fact that it is geographically a mere detail of the
                        Macedonian coast. That great soldier of fortune was a native of Kavalla, the
                        port of the Macedonian tabacco trade, which faces Thassos across a narrow
                        strip of sea. The Khedive Mehemet never forgot that he was an Albanian by
                        original and a Macedoanian by birth, and to this day the theological
                        students of Kavalla are fed by the bounty of his heirs. Thassos was given to
                        him in 1841, after his great revolt, when his rights over Egypt were made
                        hereditary. In those days the Sultans were very ready to oblige their great
                        vessal, and to take advantage of the military strength of Egypt. It was an
                        Egyptian army which overran and devastated Greece when the Turkish forces
                        had failed to reduce it, during the war of independence, and later, it was
                        an Egyptian army which reconquered insurgent Crete and occupied it till
                        1840. Economically and politically the island, poor enough today, despite
                        its ancient gold mines, has possibilities. It lies on the sea road to
                        Constantinople, and it also commands Kavalla, which might under certain
                        conditions, rival Salonka as the great port of the Egean; it has, moreover,
                        considerable mineral wealth, as the German syndicate which is now exploiting
                        it has discovered. We have a double interest in assisting the Khedive to
                        maintain his rights. For while we are his natural protectors in Egypt, it
                        also happens that Kavalla falls within the section of Macedonia which our
                        officers are helping to on Thassos, which is uncomfortably near the Straits,
                        might have large consequences.</p>

                    <p>The recent squabble in Al Azhar seems to have been due to the opposition of
                        the more conservative among the ulema to the action of Sheikh Mohamed

                        reported to the Khedive, who however, reserved his judgement until the 26th
                        November, when, in recieving the ulema at Abdeen Palace, he expressed the
                        desire that Sheikh Mohamed's measures should be carried out, as they were to
                        the benefit of the studnts.</p>
                    <p>"Thousands of pounds," added his Highness, "are being yearly spent on

                    <p>THE COMMITTE'S HOPES.</p>
                    <p>The committee fo the proposed National University met on Friday evening at
                        the residence of Hassan Bey Gamjoun at Cairo. It was announced that, Saad
                        Pasha Zighloul, the new Minister of Education, who was vide president of the
                        commmittee, had resigned owing to his new appointment; and Kassim Bey Amin,
                        secretary to the committee, was appointed in his stead. The latter delivered
                        a speech dealing with the committee's work, and said that H.H. the Khedive
                        would be pleased to place the University under his patronage Albeit the
                        Governnment appeared to consider the scheme premature, the authorities did
                        not view it with disfavour. The Government feared that the committee's
                        efforts would prove abortive, but "I think," said Amin Bey, "I am not wrong
                        in saying that the Government will not refrain from helping us in the future
                        when we have acted wisely and with energy."</p>
                    <p>The new vice-president suggested that the subscriptions should be taken in
                        hand at one throughout the country.</p>
                    <p>The commmittee hope that one of the Princess of the Khedivial family will
                        accept the post of president.</p>
                    <p>The subscriptions which have been collected in aid of the scheme up to date

                    <head> SLEEPING CAR CO. IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p> NEW RESTAURANT OPENED.</p>
                    <p>The International Sleeping Car Company celebrated the opening of its new
                        buffet restaurant and bar at the Bab-el-Ghedid terminus, Alexandria, by a
                        barquet on Saturday evening. Among those who accepted the invitation of Mr.
                        Tite, the popular representative of the company in Egypt, were Mr. Purser,
                        the manager of teh Goods Department of the Egyptian State Railways, Mr.
                        Grundy, general railway superintendent of Alexandria, Mr. Pearson,
                        divisional railway superintendent of Lower Egypt, Mr. Hylands, divisional
                        railway superintendent of Cairo, Mr. Toureille, director of the Domains
                        Section of the Enginering Department, representatives of Messrs. Thos. Cook
                        and Son (Egypt), Limited, and a number of representatives of the European
                        and native Press. After the many and various items of an excellent menu had
                        been gone through Mr. Grundy, as the Alexandrian representative of the
                        Egyptian State Railways, rose and made an eloquent speech in honour of the
                        occasion. He expressed a hope that the inauguration of the new restaurant in
                        Alexandria would be the beginning of a new era in Egypt, and that many more
                        of the larger stations throughout the length and breadth of Egypt would soon
                        be endowed with similar gastronomic establishments. He stated that he had
                        the pleasure of Mr. Tite's acquaintance for many years, an everything that
                        the gentleman had done to advance the interests in Egypt of the great
                        company, which so worthily represented, had met with complete access, and he
                        consequently had no fears as to the future of the institution which they
                        were inaugurating. Mr. Grundy concluded his discourse by caling on all
                        present to join him in toasting Mr. Tite, an invitation which, it is
                        needless to say, was most heartily responded to.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Tite, in reply, regretted his inability to rival the first speaker's
                        eloquent oration, and thanked the company for the cordial manner in which
                        they had expressed theigood wishes towards the company and himself. He
                        regretted that many had been unable to attend the banquet from Cairo owing
                        to the epidemic of dengue fever, and went on to state that this was the
                        first of the first-class restaurants which teh International Sleeping Car
                        Company intended introducing throughout the principal railway stations in
                        Eypt. A restaurant had been already started in tantah and had met with great
                        success and they had also met with great success and theyhad also
                        restaurants at Port Said and Zagazig. Their aim was to provide the very best
                        fod and drink for their clients the public, and he hoped that in time every
                        one of the larger stations throughout the country would be furnished with a
                        buffet by the company. He had every confidence that the new restaurant at
                        Alenxandria would fil a long-felt want of the travelling public and of
                        visitors arriving from Europe, and in addition to the restaurant and bar, a
                        cloak room and other conveniences had been installed. A good lunch and a
                        good dinner would be always available and there would also be an a la carte
                        service. In conclusion he desired to think the representatives of the Press
                        present for the support which the newspapers had always given to the company
                        and also for thier attendance at the ceremony that evening.</p>
                    <p>The editor of "Al Minbar" replied with some wall-chosen remarks delivered in
                        perfect English. Mr. Parser then rose and dwelt on the hamonious relations
                        that had always existed between the Egytian State Railway Administration and
                        the International Sleeping Car Company, whos receipts in Egypt were
                        advancing rapidly. He remarked that the Administration could not entrust
                        travellers to better hands than those of the company and he was most pleased
                        to testify to the cordial manner which characterised the relations of the
                        Government Railways and the company. After a speech in French by M.
                        Toureille, the proceedings came to a close.</p>

                        social de francs 32,500,000. Le capital social est done reduit des 2 tiers
                        et par suite, ramene a la somme de 0,833,400 francs.</p>
                    <p>2. Creation de 240,523 actions privilegiees de 100 frs. au porteur,

                    <p>tions hypothecaires et par le reglement des inteis, votre Societe se trouve
                        entierement liberee de sa dette envers la Daira Sanieh Sugar Corporation et
                        elle est devenue proprietaire dennitive des immeubles dont, d'apres les
                        contrate de novembre 1902, le transfert ne devait etre opere a son profit
                        qu'au bout de 25 annes.</p>
                    <p>Pendant la campagne 1904-1905, les Sucresies ne fibriquerent que 57.336 sacs
                        contre 645.673 l'annee precedent.</p>
                    <p>Cet abaissement notable de la production peut etre attribue principalement
                        aux froids exceptionnels de l'hiver 1904-1905, qui diminurent le rendement
                        de la canne en poids et en degre; et a la preference que les cultivateurs
                        donnerent au coton par suite des courseleves patriques alors.</p>
                    <p>La campagne 1905-1906 fut meilleure, et les usinness produisirent 624.585
                        sacs de sucre de ler jet dont 189,089 destines a etre livres a la
                        consommation directe, 435.488 destines a la raffinerie, plus environ 22.000
                        sacs de 2 jet.</p>
                    <p>Au printempadernier, a l'epoque ou les cultuvateurs devaient determiner
                        l'assolement de leurs terres, notre Societe se trouvait au moment le plus
                        critique de la crise qu'elle a traversee; cette circonstance nous oblige a
                        une grade reserve dans l'estimation des quantites probles des cannes a
                        travailler durant la prochaine campagne; neanmoins , nous avons lieu de
                        croire que le deficit ne sera pas trop considerable.</p>
                    <p>La Raffinerie a produit 541.595 sacs de sucre raffine en 1904-1905 et e
                        tonnes 38.828 en 1905-1906.</p>
                    <p>sur ces quantites la consommation inte rieure a ete en 1904-1905 de tonnes
                        36.175 et en 1905-1906 de tonnes 36.473</p>
                    <p>Vous constaterez que la vente pour la consommation interieure s'est maintenne
                        aux chiffres precedents.</p>
                    <p>La diminution sur la production provient uniquement de ce que votre societe a
                        estime devoir s'abstenir pour le moment de faire des importations de sucres
                        bruts de l'etranger, ainsi que des exportaions de ancres raffi es pour les
                        Indes.</p>
                    <p>Par suite des dispositions prises depuis le mois d'aout 1905, les frais
                        generaux d'exploitation ont ete sensiblement reduits; et bien que nous ne
                        puissions vous donner aujourd'hui les comptes definitifs de l'exercice
                        1905-1906, nous sommes en mesure de vous dire qu'une amelioration sensible a
                        deja ete obtenne dans les frais d'exploitation.</p>
                    <p>Nous esperons progresser encore dans cettevoie.</p>
                    <p>Ces resultats actuels n'ont ete acquis qu'au prix de grands efforts.</p>
                    <p>Les fonds disponsibles de la Societe ne s'elevaient fin aout 1905 qu'a L.E.
                        42,000 environ; cette somme ne representait pas le dixieme du roulement
                        necessaire pout la campagne 1905-1906. La fermeture des usines et par suite
                        la taillite de la Societe, la perte de toute la recolte de cannes 1905-1906
                        eussent ete fatales, si la Societe de la Daira Sanieh n'avait consent a
                        faire l'avance de la majeure partie des fonds necessaires.</p>
                    <p>Nous croyons rentrer dans vos intentions en adressant a cette Societe des
                        remerciements pour le service qu'elle a renda a la Societe et a tous les
                        cultivateurs de cannes de la Haute-Egypte.</p>
                    <p>Poursuivant le programme que nous nous sommes trace, nous vous proposons de
                        dimineur le plus possible les charges sociales.</p>
                    <p>Votre Societe possede en sus de ses Usines en activite des immeubles
                        improductifs dont la valeur venale est tres appreciable.</p>
                    <p>Nous choisirons le moment opportun pour aliener tout ou partie de'ces
                        immeubles: le prix en sera employe a l'amortissement de votre dette et
                        diminnera ainsi les charges sociales.</p>
                    <p>Vous avez deja modifie en partie les Statuts de votre Societe son capital,
                        vous allez nommer, en remplacement de l'ancien Conseil de nouveaux
                        administrateurs, ou ratifier la nomination des administrateurs provisoires
                        actuels.</p>
                    <p>Vous aurez egalement a statuer sur la de mission donne par les membres de
                        l'ancien conseil et sur la decharge de leur mandat.</p>
                    <p>Nous n'avons pas besoin de vous rappeler que la reconstitution de la Societe
                        a ete rendue possible par les sacrifices consentis par M.M. Dorizon, Barois,
                        Ternynck, Arbib, Davey et Leroux, et il vous parltra sars doute equitable de
                        donner a ces administrateurs decharge de leur mandat. Les 2,400.000 francs
                        qui'ils se sont engages a souscrire en actions privilegiees ont ete verses
                        par eux a votre Societe.</p>
                    <p>Vous aurez aussi, Messieure, a designer les Censeurs pour l'Exercice
                        1906-1907 et a fixer le montant de leur allocation.</p>

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list shewing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <p><cb n="3"/></p>
                    <p>They are as follows:—</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short ones are as
                        follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers of the P.&amp; O., the Egyptian Mail S.S,. Co., North German
                        Lloyd, Orient, and Messageries Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor,
                        British India, Bibby and Henderson Lines are also excellent, and their
                        steamers are largely patronised by travellers to Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said can now be made without change
                        in 4 ½ hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp; O. Brindisi express
                        from Port Said, by the Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., from Alexandria to Marseilles
                        and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe. The Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., have
                        also made arrangements whereby luggage can be collected and sent to any
                        address.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves Port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. <hi rend="italic"
                            >Giardini</hi> is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to
                        Taormina is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the
                        town is much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                        restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of
                        Etna, and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic
                        remains that are found all over the island, are an endless sources of
                        pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a Greek city,
                        which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in
                        B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be seen. The cathedral
                        was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with about 300,000 inhabitants,
                        is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful climate. Much of
                        interest is to be found in this fine city. <hi rend="italic">The Palazzo
                            Reale</hi> is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of <hi
                            rend="italic">S. Giovannia degli Eremiti</hi> with its picturesque
                        cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal
                        Park are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                            bay—<hi rend="italic">Castellamare</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Sorrento</hi>. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento [you can
                        drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                            <hi rend="italic">City of Flowers</hi> and its surrounding country. In
                        Florence itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst
                        the local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. <hi rend="italic"
                            >The Cascine</hi> is the most attractive and fashionable promenade in
                        Florence, whilst the <hi rend="italic">Viale dei Colli</hi>, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to <hi rend="italic">Vallombrosa</hi>, with its <hi
                            rend="italic">Monastery</hi> 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is
                        made first by ordinary train from Florence to <hi rend="italic">St.
                            Ellero</hi>, thence by cog-wheel railway to <hi rend="italic"
                            >Saltino</hi>. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                        striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,

                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>

                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea. No hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi> you make the tour of the
                        beautiful Italian lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come <hi rend="italic"
                            >Tremezzo</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Cadenabbia</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Menaggio</hi> with the prettily-situated town of <hi rend="italic"
                            >Bellaggio</hi> opposite. The walk from <hi rend="italic">Tremezzo</hi>
                        along the shore of the lake to <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> is most
                        enjoyable. A steam tram runs from <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> to <hi
                            rend="italic">Porlezza</hi> on Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour,
                        then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M. de Caprino.and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town, situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>

                        from Alexandria ; the climate in April is charming. The best steamers are
