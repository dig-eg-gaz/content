                    <p>PRE-EMPTION</p>
                    <p>One of the greatest legal abuses at present exiting in Egypt is the way in
                        which the law of preemption is employed. Owing to the recent rise in the
                        veins of real property, and the enormous number of sales of land that are
                        now going on all over the country, a condition of affairs has arisen which
                        was never contemplated by those jurisconsults who gave the ancient Oriental
                        privilege of pre-emption in the Code of the Mixed Tribunals. The right of
                        pre-emption is now invoked on every possible occasion, and the result is
                        that the law is made use of to protect the flimsiest sort of claims, to the
                        detriment of the serious capitalist. A recent preemption case affords a good
                        example of how this ancient right is resuscitated to serve a totally
                        different object to that for which it wat originally intended to serve. In e
                        few days’ time the test case as to the limits of this law will come before
                        the Mixed Court of Appeal. The Nungovich Hotels Company lately purchased the
                        Mena House Hotel, and after the purchase was completed a native doctor
                        exercises his right of preemption, which it upheld by the Mixed Court of lst
                        Instance. There is no doubt that the judgement was technically correct
                        inasmuch as it was based on a strict interpretation of the law. But it is
                        obvious that this interpretation of the law cannot be considered as in any
                        sense equitable, and it will be interesting to see whether the Appeal Court
                        will give a more liberal interpretation than did the lower Court. But
                        whether the Court upholds or quashes this particular decision it is
                        necessary that the law of preemption must be radically changed, for its

                    <p>A Calcutta paper has recently been discovering the best means of getting rid
                        of that "humming bird,” the mosquito. That the method advised of fumigating
                        a room causing the insects to become partially stupified, and so to fall
                        easy victims of the tanglefoot fly-paper ready placed for their delectation
                        and death at a lighted window, the remainder of the room being in darkness,
                        is no doubt as efficacious as it is ancient; but, after all, “prevention is
                        better than cure" as the old proverb has it; and not to have mosquitoes in
                        the homes at all is far better than to allow them entrance and then to take
                        steps for their extermination.</p>
                    <p>In the malarial districts of Africa, both East and West, and also in the
                        United States and elsewhere on the American Continent, in the summer months
                        a plan very widely adopted in modern dwellings is that of the "mosquito
                        proof’ house. So effective has this proved to be in the prevention of
                        malaria that some of the railways have adopted it not only for the cabooses
                        used by their employees travelling almost continually in the low veldt and
                        on the flats where mangrove swamps abound, but also, in some cases, for
                        their general passenger rolling-stock. Every window of the dwelling is
                        provided on the outside with a well-fitting frame, opening up a French
                        window, covered with wire gauze of a fine mesh, which, whilst admitting
                        light and air, effectively prevents small flying insect pests of every
                        description from entering. Doors are fitted in much the same manner,
                        swinging frames, hinged inside the main door, being need to support the wire
                        gauze. In South Africa, where the climatic conditions are so different, it
                        is usual, especially among the extreme faddists, to keep these wire doors
                        closed throughout the day ; hot doubtless they would serve the purpose for
                        which they intended were they to remain closed between the hours of sunset
                        and sunrise only. Such a scheme has not been considered necessary in
                        Colombo, bat bungalows on estates in low-lying malarial district might be
                        thus fitted to advantage, and the following instance, if indeed one is
                        wanted, will prove the necessity of providing against malarial fever through
                        inoculation by mosquitoes. About two years ago, at a certain hospital in
                        Rhodesia, where quite 90 percent of the European patients are admitted
                        suffering from malarial fever, it wai ootioed by the dxitor tbat,after
                        having soooei*- folly treated his oases, and the temperature) of hi*
                        patients were once more down to normal or thereabouts, on the fourth or
                        fifth day after admission, at first inexplicably, a large proportion of
                        those under hie oare bad relapses, and up went their temperatures almost as
                        high as ever ; with the result that the treatment had to be started
                        praetioally all over again. It was the dootor'* idea that, with fresh oases
                        of malaria coming in daily, the mosquitoes promptly oarried infeotion from
                        the new patients to those convalescent Aooordingly, step* were taken .to
                        prevent this ; and the oor- reotnees of this theory was at once proved, for

                    <p>A very sad accident took place at Abbassieh on Monday afternoon. The facts,
                        as we can gather, are as follows. M. A. Tomioh and M. J. Mirfo, both
                        well-known oontraotors, wh:le examining various buildings which are being
                        constructed at AbbaRBieb, deoided to look at the wall of a house wffioh had
                        oracked and was expeoted to oollapse. The two men entered the building
                        followed by their foreman, M. Spiteri, and examined the weak point. M.
                        Tomich then left the bnilding and had only taken a few paces from the
                        entrance when a dad. rumbling sound was heard and the wall, with part of the
                        building, oollapsed in a heap of debris. M. Spiteri, who was standing by a
                        window, jumped for his life the moment he heard the sound and escaped. M.
                        Mirda was buried in the ruins. The workmen in the neighbourhood rashed up
                        and after some d ffioalty recovered the body of the unfortunate man, which
                        bore no mark of anyseriona injury, death being due to suffocation. The
                        oorpae was taken to the Austrian Hospital and thenoe to the house of the
                        deoeased’s parents in the Sharia Madabegh. The fnneral, which took plaoe
                        yesterday afternoon, was largely attended. The late M. Mirsa, who was an
                        architeot and contractor by profession, was only 33 years of age and bad
                        resided for the last two years in Cairo, where he had made many friends.</p>

                        by the following ladies and gentlemen :—Mrs. Gordon, pianoforte selections ;

                    <p>The Castoms returns for December last, which have just been issned, are of
                        exceptional importance inasmuch as they famish us with the statistics not

                        so far as regards the larger totals, tb® annual report of the Custom*
                        Administration, which "’ll ^0t appear for a month or tijo yet. The imports
                        for December fell considerably below the figures for the same month of 1904,
                        bat as was pointed oat in the November Journal of the British Chamber of
                        Commerce, this must ntft be taken to indicate that trade is in any way
                        retrogressing. It is to ba borne in mind that the clearances dnring the
                        November and December of 1901 were phenomenally large. Aboat that time
                        merchants and retailers, through commission agents, apparently all though*;
                        it necessary to lay in heavy atooks. These stooks ryare not so readily
                        assimilated as had been anticipated, and therefore in many trader buyers had
                        to oartail their purchases last year. This is made evident by the faot that
                        although the total increase in the import trade in 1904 amoanted tQ aloae on
                        four millions (whioh, it mast be admitted, was altogether phenomenal), the
                        inore ise reoorded in 1905 only figured oat at something over one million
                        (Egyptian pounds). Notwithstanding, the year’s import returns oonstitnte a
                        record, and even if the same rate of progress was not maintained as in 1904,
                        the figares mast bj considered satisfactory as showing not only that there
                        has been no aotoal retrogression but that the normal rate of progress has
                        been maintained. A comparison of the figares for the past three years, with
                        the respective shares of the principal importing countries, will prove
                        interesting.</p>

                    <p>London, January 15. The Conservative papers do not seek to minimize the
                        significance of the pollings. Liberals are enthusiastic, especially in view
                        of the fact that only two supporters of Mr. Chamberlain have been returned.
                        The analysis of voting shows a remarkable increase of Socialist and Labour
                        votes, namely 63,692, compared with 20,731 in the same constituencies in

                        is annihilated, lying absorbed by labour. Hitherto there have been returned
                        76 Liberals, 13 Labourites, and 29 Unionists. Ministerial gains 49. The
                        Unionists gained a seat at Hastings. Speaking at Waterford, Mr. Redmond said

                    <p>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.)</p>
                    <p>LONDON, JANUARY 5.</p>
                    <p>Major C. R Heastey, who has just retired on retired pay from the 2nd
                        Battalion Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, Cairo, served over nineteen years in
                        the regiment, having got his first commission in November, 1886. He was
                        promoted captain in 1896, and major in 1914. He served with the 2nd
                        Battalion in the North West Frontier campaign, 1897-98 (medal with clasp).
                        The vacant majority has been filled by the promotion of Captain E. J.
                        Buckley, who is specially employed on the General Staff at th9 War Office.
                        Major Buckley has served in the Inniskillings for over eighteen years, got
                        his company in 1897, and was with the 1st Battalion in the South African
                        War, including the battle of Colenso, where he was severely wounded
                        (mentioned in despatches, medal with two clasps). When the late Queen
                        Victoria last visited Ireland in April, 1900, Major Book- ley commanded the
                        special guard of honour furnished by the details of the Inniskillings at
                        Dublin.</p>
                    <p>Major L. F. Philips, King’s Royal Rifle Corps, on restoration to the
                        establishment, has been posted to the 3rd Battalion at Ranikhet, Bengal, and
                        embarks on the 3rd prox. in charge of a draft for the 1st Battalion West
                        Yorkshire Regiment at Meen Meear, Punjab.</p>
                    <p>Captain W. F. G. Wyndham, 4th Battalion King’s Royal Rifle Corps, serving
                        with the Rifle Depot, Winchester, has been selected to accompany Prince
                        Arthur of Connaught on his mission to Tokyo to invest the Mikado with his
                        new distinction.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant R. G. B. Jeffreys, Royal Dublin Fusiliers, the new adjutant of the
                        1st Battalion in Egypt, is the senior subaltern of the gallant “Debs,” which
                        he joined in the February of 1899, a few months before Paul Kruger commenced
                        to “stagger humanity.” Mr. Jeffreys was with the 1st Battalion in the hard
                        fighting into Ladysmith and the campaign afterward' in the Transvaal and
                        Orange River Colony.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant David Mathers, 1st Battalion Royal Scots, is about to be specially
                        promoted captain into the Royal Inniskillings Fusiliers. Lieutenant Mathers
                        has had a fine military career. He enlisted in the Gordon Highlanders, and
                        as a non-commissioned officer served in the Chitral Relief Expedition (medal
                        with clasp); Tochi Expedition, 1897-98; Tirah Expedition (mentioned in
                        despatches, Distinguished Conduct Medal, clasp); South African War,
                        including the advance on Kimberley. actions of Magersfontein, Poplar Grove,
                        Driefontein, Hontnek, Vet River, Zand River, Johannesburg, Pretoria,
                        Belfast, Lydenburg and many minor affairs (medal with five clasps). He
                        received his commission from sergeant in the Gordons in July, 1901, and
                        shortly afterwards joined the West African Frontier Force, and whilst
                        attached to the Southern Nigeria Regiment served in the Aro Expedition, and
                        the Kano-Sokoto Expedition, 1902 (medal with clasp).</p>
                    <p>The King has been pleased to approve of the following members composing the
                        Army Council, on change of administration : Rt. Hon. R. B. Haldane,
                        Secretary of State for War; Lieutenant General Sir N. G. Lyttleton, K.C.B.,
                        Chief of the General Staff (First Military Member) ; Lie tenant General C.
                        W. H. Douglas, O.B., Adjutant General to the Forces (Second Military
                        Member); Lieutenant General Sir William Nicholson, K.C.B Quarter-master
                        General to the Forces (Third Military Member); Major General Sir J. W.
                        Murray, K.C.B., Master General of Ordnance (Fourth Military Member) ; Earl
                        of Portsmouth, Parliamentary Under Secretary for War, and Mr. T. R. Buchanan
                        (Financial Member).</p>
                    <p>It is hardly necessary to say that the arrest of several non-commissioned
                        officers in connection with the South African War scandals has caused a
                        considerable sensation. At the same time nobody takes in that the non-coms
                        ware all to blame for the bribery alleged to have gone on during the war.
                        Anyone who knows anything about military matters is aware that the
                        non-commissioned officers’ chances of peculation are on a very small scale,
                        and that they are not likely to be in a position to perpetrate a big “job.”
                        There is a shrewd opinion expressed that bigger wigs than staff sergeants
                        will be involved in the mess.</p>
                    <p>The report of the Royal Commission now investigating the losses incurred over
                        stores in South Africa will show the necessity for a fully equipped supply
                        branch to deal with every form of army requirement. In the Transvaal war
                        supply and store duties often fell to the lot of inexperienced officers,
                        soldiers, and civilians Owing to the lack of an adequate expert staff to do
                        the work, some millions sterling were wasted by this want of system. The
                        entire question of supplies and stores in the field will be overhauled when
                        the Commission’s report is made.</p>
                    <p>In all probability an expert supply officer will be given charge of supplies
                        at the War Office, with general’s rank. Under the present system it is
                        proved that there is too much divided responsibility and much overlapping,
                        wastage, and faulty administration. The expert handlers of stores are too
                        few for war purposes to secure economy and efficiency, and much of the work
                        is indifferently performed, casually superintended, and sometimes not
                        overlooked at all.</p>
                    <p>There are, it is shown, too many depots and branches for supplies in the
                        field. A corps draws its bread at one place, picketting pegs at another, and
                        transport somewhere else; while the water supply is arranged as a thing
                        apart. Fuel and light are supplied by the Army Service Corps and electricity
                        by the Royal Engineers. Searchlighting is an Engineer service, uat
                        mechanical transport is not. All this leads to complication. Presently the
                        question of heavy gun haulage will arise, and the Royal Artillery will claim
                        first right to control this traction.</p>
                    <p>A consolidation of all the avenues of supply is held to be necessary, with a
                        general depot from which everything would be issued, and with a staff,
                        including buyers, able to control supplies in every part of the field and
                        oat of it, after the manner of successful trading stores.</p>
                    <p>It is proposed to transform the various companies of the Royal Engineers into
                        a series of battalions, complete with every requisite for an army, after the
                        manner of the Japanese. At present all the services for an army are
                        scattered about in separate companies. The Engineer battalions will form a
                        comprehensive organization, covering bridging, telephones, telegraphs,
                        ballooning, and electric lighting, each carried out by trained units of the
                        Corps. These battalions will not form part of the mobilized forces for home
                        defense, but will be prepared essentially for war, and ready to embark with
                        any expeditionary force.</p>
                    <p>The Army Council has just made a decision which will be learned of with joy
                        by many a junior sergeant of the Royal Garrison Artillery at home and
                        abroad, and that is, that all noncommissioned officers of the RG.A., who
                        have been permitted to extend their service beyond 21 years, and who hiving
                        reached the age of forty, and completed 25 years’ service, will go on
                        pension tour months from the 1st January. Owing to the number of N.C.O.’s
                        who were allowed to extend their service many sergeants have had to go to
                        foreign service within two years of their previous tour abroad, and the
                        reduction of several companies further blocked promotion. This new ruling
                        will dear out the senior sergeants and cause a healthy run of promotion
                        amongst the lower ranks. The rule applies to non-coms, on the staff of the
                        Militia and Volunteer forces The four months’ notice is a concession from
                        the usual one in month. A very large number of staff sergeants will be hit
                        by it.</p>
                    <p>The 6th of February has been provisionally fixed for the launching of the
                        huge battleship Dreadnought at Portsmouth. This monster, which will have a
                        displacement of 18,000 tons, will be the largest battleship afloat when
                        completed. She has been got ready for launching in exactly four months,
                        which in itself is a record. One of the many improvements in the battleship,
                        making for the comfort of her handymen, is a well equipped bakery. This
                        improvement is also to be carried out in other ships so that the days of
                        “hard tack,” as well as those of “salt horse,” are numbered.</p>

                    <p>THE COPE WHITEHOUSE CLAIM.</p>
                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette. Sir,—In your ia.sae of 20th December
                        last you published a letter from Mr. Cope White house in which the following
                        statement appeared : — “I had spent many days with Sir Hanbury Brown, and
                        given him my pamphlets and maps, before I learned, through the inadvertent
                        admission of his brother, that he intended to write a book, which I regarded
                        as premature.’ Mr. Cope Whitehouse knew from me of my intention to write
                        when the idea first came to me, and I asked him to lend me what documents he
                        had, for the purpose of working up the subject-. The paragraph quoted above
                        is manifestly intended to convey the impression that my intention was
                        deliberately concealed from him. To support my denial of this statement, I
                        quote from letters of his in my possession. Extract from letter dated 29th
                        May, 1893 : "When I gave you leave to make use of my researches and of my
                        plates for your book it was on the implied understanding that the volume
                        would deal fairly by me.” Extract from letter dated 28 .h Nov. 1892 : ‘ Your
                        comments were perfectly fair and I so considered them.” Extract from letter
                        dated 13th Dec. 1832 : “Further, your conclusions are your own, made so by
                        your independent examination of the evidence.” The difference in tone
                        between the earlier and later letters was due to Mr. Whitehouse’s resentment
                        with some of the reviews of the book which were not as complimentary to him
                        as he would have liked, notably the review in the “Times” asserting that I
                        had “enlivened” my volume with “a post-mortem examination of the Cope
                        Whitehouse theory” ; for which he seemed to hold me in some way responsible.
                        Hanbury Brown. Newlands, Crawley Down, England, 5th January, 1906.</p>

                    <head>NEW EGYPT</head>
                    <p>SOME MORE EXTRACTS.</p>
                    <p>Mr. A. B. de Gaerville, who, by the way, arrived at Alexandria yesterday by
                        the North German Lloyd steamer, went into every section of society in Egypt
                        and naturally came into contact with some of the members of the Khedivial
                        Family, and some very interesting interviews are given. Prince Mohamed Aly
                        Pacha was among the Princes whom our author met, and his Highness expressed
                        himself in the following outspoken fashion on the way Anglo Egyptians
                        neglect the adage that “Manners makyeth the Man.” ‘ Prince," I said, “you do
                        not seem to be particularly fond of the English ?” “Well.” he replied, ‘ I
                        can like them in their own homes, but not here. When I was in England I met
                        many charming people, who treated me with perfect courtesy. It made me ask
                        myself continually, can these people, with such charming manners and so well
                        bred, be the same brutes as we have in Egypt ? Why are they so perfect at
                        home and so ill mannered with us ? And, take my word for it, they are making
                        a great mistake. It is because of their bad manners that they are not liked.
                        A little, more consideration and politeness towards us Egyptians would gain
                        for them many friendships and much devotion, but what we cannot stand is
                        their boorishness, their lack of talk, and their coarseness. We believe that
                        these remarks of the Prince are not altogether beside the point. The
                        Egyptian ''standpoint to the English often resembles that of the young
                        Harrovian towards the late Dr. Temple,: “He is a beast, but a just
                        beast.”</p>
                    <p>Princess Nazil's Opinions.</p>
                    <p>In a talk with Princess Nazli Hanem our author asks.” “Then, Princess, it is
                        clear that the Eygptians are not yet fit to govern themselves ?” To which
                        her Highness-replied: “Govern ourselves But, my dear sir, we are children
                        still, babes in bible unable to stand, no, we cannot be left alone. Here
                        Cromer does everything. Without him we should have to return to the
                        guardianship of the Powers. Cromer is a great man, and Egypt owes him
                        everything but in the last two years he has become too lenient, too kind. I
                        should like to see him smother all these speculators to-day who are the
                        plague of Egypt. In all the capitals of Europe there is a huge building on
                        which is written Stock Exchange. Here the whole country is one vast Stock
                        Exchange, which saps its civilization at the roots.”</p>
                    <p>Female Tourists' Ugliness.</p>
                    <p>Of the ugliness of the female tourist on the Nile steamers our author says :—
                        Alas! there is nothing on board to admire, and we have come to the
                        conclusion that nine-tenths of the ladies who travel are ugly. It is really
                        remarkable the number of plain-looking women in the world. 1 know that all
                        men are not beautiful, but who minds that?</p>
                    <p>The Need of a Maid.</p>
                    <p>On his trip up the Nile he consoles himself in listening to the lamentations
                        of a lady on board who is complaining of the want of a maid. "And it is
                        terrible for me,” she said, “because all my dresses button, hook or lace
                        down the back. I can’t do it myself so of course I’ve got to call the Arab,
                        and his cold clammy finger wanders continually all over my back, and gives
                        me the most horrible feelings!” Poor lady, I know these Arabs by reputation
                        and I can understand.</p>
                    <p>A Word of Warning.</p>
                    <p>The author indulges in some reflections on the unwise familiarity which often
                        ensues in the tourist season between tourists and natives, suggested by this
                        scene at Abou Simbel :— In the evening the crew don large overcoats with
                        hoods, giving them the appearance of monks Naturally they are Arabs, and we
                        have on board certain elderly females.... and yet, when I think of it not so
                        very elderly, who conduct themselves with them in a very extraordinary
                        fashion. Yesterday evening two of them, each with an Arab for company, left
                        the boat, and in the moonlight set off to explore.. the unknown. From the
                        deck we watched them disappear. If the white women who conduct themselves
                        thus with the Arabs would think for a moment of the harm which they are
                        doing to the work of civilization throughout Egypt they might perhaps
                        hesitate They do not seem to realize that the native, convinced that all
                        foreign women are in the same manner as these fools, despises them
                        profoundly, saying to himself, “If that is the result of a Christian
                        education, of their Western civilization, of the emancipation of women—no
                        thanks! better be as we are. and keep our women safely shut up in the
                        harem.”</p>
                    <p>A Flippant Passage</p>
                    <p>Sometimes Mr de Guerville is rather too flippant, as the following passage
                        shows: “I am certain that that is just as it was in the time of oar Savior.”
                        This exclamation, uttered a few paces off, came from an elderly American
                        lady, very bigoted, who since we started, had been diligently study Egypt as
                        described in the Bible. Suddenly her eyes fell, on my pajamas, when she gave
                        me one look, shocked and angry, which I am sure our Lord would not have
                        approved of, but which, making me realize the somewhat scanty nature of my
                        attire, drove me to seek the friendly shelter of my cabin. “An hour later wo
                        passed a large dehabieh, stranded on a sandbank. The whole of the crew,
                        completely naked, were directing all their efforts to refloat her, whilst my
                        American friend put on her glasses to get a better view. The doctor of the
                        Rameses turned to me laughing and said, “My dear fellow, your sin this
                        morning was appearing in pyjamas ; if you had had nothing on, she would
                        probably have honored you with a second look through her glasses.</p>
                    <p>On Chemists.</p>
                    <p>He is hard on chemists :— Among the shopkeepers, the palm undoubtedly must go
                        to the chemists. Their name is legion, and they grow fat in robbing a
                        patient public with a most charming grace. Their cynicism surpasses belief,
                        and their business in life may be summed up as stealing always and poisoning
                        often. This criticism is rather severe and we are glad to be able to state
                        that there are exceptions.</p>
                    <p>A Notable Criticism.</p>
                    <p>One of the most valuable portions of "New Egypt” are the two notes by the
                        late Grand Mufti of Egypt, Sheikh Mohamed Abdou, on public instruction and
                        administration and justice. These notes are the deliberate statements of one
                        of the most respected of modern Egyptian", ‘whose death was regretted by all
                        classes We publish the second of the Grand Mufti’s notes, on administration
                        and justice. It contains a good deal of sound criticism, as every
                        Anglo-Egyptian official will acknowledge: ‘Tin Egyptian Administration has
                        no Deed of great reforms in its organization. Nevertheless it leaves much to
                        be desired. Its principal fault lies in the unsatisfactory choice of its
                        officials. As a rule one thing alone is exacted in a candidate, and that is
                        that he should possess a nature entirety passive. A man in the smaller
                        degree independent will not be admitted, or if by mistake he should be, he
                        will not remain long. Why is it so ? Simply because the English mistrust too
                        much, and without reason, men of independent thought. They find officials
                        ready to do all that is asked of them, and even more if by doing so they can
                        gain favour with their superiors, and they seem to be satisfied with this
                        condition of things. Unfortunately, the result is that those in charge of
                        our affairs are seldom well informed of the men and affairs of the
                        Administration. The Egyptian officials dare not tell them the truth, they
                        take no initiative, approve all that is wanted, and never oppose any
                        measure. One example from a thousand : An Egyptian Moudir in a province is
                        assisted- by an English inspector. Normally the Moudir should administer,
                        and the inspector contra his work. Bat it is not so. The Moudir takes no
                        responsibility, he submits everything, however insignificant, to the
                        Inspector and awaits his orders, which he is ready to carry out. The more he
                        effaces himself, the more he does, so he believes, to please his inspector.
                        If the latter should commit an error, he will allow it to pass rather than
                        offer an observation which might be badly received. And so it is all over.
                        It is notorious that the English will not put up with an Egyptian official
                        unless he is willing to play the part of dummy. 'The country is in this way
                        deprived of the services of those of its children who have an opinion on her
                        reel needs, and who have the courage to express that opinion. In the
                        Department of Justice the same fault exists, with the aggravating
                        circumstance that with an Egyptian Judge of a passive disposition easily
                        influenced by his English colleague, the danger may arise that he will not
                        give an opinion according to his conscience. This danger is very great, and
                        the evil a very serious one. “Another danger is the ease with which the law
                        of the country is made. Each Englishman constitutes himself a legislator,
                        and attempts to modify the law as it suits him. He submits his work to the
                        ministerial council, which, as every one knows, is an assembly of mutes, who
                        sign whatever is put before them. The only control exercised is by the
                        Legislative Council. But this assembly has only a consultative power, and
                        the members of it who are up to their work are very few. “What is required
                        is a kind of State Council, before which would come all proposals in regard
                        to the law. There they would receive serious consideration. The good would
                        pass, the bad would be rejected.” The extracts we have made will give the
                        reader s some idea of this entertaining book and we hope that M. de
                        Guerville will take the opportunity of his present visit to Egypt to find
                        materials for another work on modem Egypt for there is still plenty of
                        subject matter for his sprightly pen.</p>

                    <head>THE OPENING UP OF THE HOLY LAND.</head>
                    <p>The interior of Palestine and Syria, which until recently could only be
                        visited under great difficulties and with serious sacrifice of time and
                        money, has at last, thanks to the efforts of the Hamburg American Line, been
                        made accessible to the travelling public. A considerable improvement in the
                        means of transport in Palestine and Syria has been noticeable since the trip
                        of the German Emperor to Jerusalem in 1898, and the continued interest he
                        still shows in their advance has induced the Turkish .authorities to remove
                        some of the more objectionable inconveniences and to urge forward the
                        construction' of the railways that had been so long projected. The great
                        Mecca Railway, stretching from Damascus to the edge of the Arabian desert,
                        became a real fact; and a connecting length starting at Haifa, crossing over
                        Galilee and along the southern end of the Lake of Gennesaret, links together
                        the fruitful district of the Hauran with the coast. In Syria, the Aleppo
                        Railway forms a connection between Baalbek and the line running from Beyrout
                        to Damascus; in addition to this, many of the roads that were in a terrible
                        condition or practically nonexistent have been thrown a little into shape. A
                        few months ago an overland tour into the interior of Palestine, such as from
                        Jerusalem via Nazareth and Tiberias to Damascus, was one of great
                        difficulty, danger and expense. To carry out a trip of this nature
                        necessitated fitting up an expedition, the equipment and execution of which
                        hid to be entirely in the hands of a dragoman, who, by imposing upon the
                        tourists, robbed the journey to the Holy Land of all its pleasure. Bat the
                        worst of all was that, apart from the houses of the inhabitants, which, in
                        reality, teem with vermin, not a house was to be found on the whole three
                        days journey from Jerusalem to Nazareth and travelers were forced to bring
                        with them, not only cooking apparatus and provisions, but also tents, the
                        inconveniences of which were, on the whole, decidedly unpleasant. But oh!
                        how beautiful is just this part of Palestine. What delightful scene, what
                        effectual pictures, and what precious remembrances the journey via Bethel
                        and Jacob’s Well to Nabulus and then through Samaria, the bountiful fields
                        of the Plain of Jezreel, and Nazareth has in store for us. How many tourists
                        to the Holy Land have been deeply aggrieved, however, that their health or
                        their purse strings have compelled them to abandon a visit to this
                        little-known but highly charming and historical district, and forced them to
                        make their pilgrimage along the over-ran routes to Jerusalem, Jericho,
                        Damascus or Baalbek! My first visit to Palestine included only these latter.
                        How great was my surprise how j ever when, on my second trip, in which I
                        took in Galilee, I was able to compare the fertile j fields of the Plain of
                        Esdraelon with its delight- holm-oak forests; the incomparable harmonious
                        scenery of the Lake of Gennesaret with the barren, mountainous deserts of
                        Judea. Whoever wishes to get a deep and lasting impression of the Holy Land
                        must not confine himself to the visit of such places as the ordinary tourist
                        flocks to in thousands, bat rather plunge into the little known interior.
                        Now that this has been made so easy, every friend of Palestine will
                        certainly feel inwardly thankful to those men who, through unwearied
                        efforts, have succeeded in removing the difficulties and opened up the
                        interior of the land. As mentioned above, the chief impediment to a tour
                        from Jerusalem to Nazareth lay in the complete lack of accommodation. In
                        order to remedy this, the tourist office of the Hamburg American Line has
                        erected hotels at Nabulus and Jenin fitted up in the most modern improved
                        manner and conducted by German managers, hotels where 30 to 40 persons can
                        find sure and comfortable accommodation at moderate charges. The German
                        hotels in Nazareth and Tiberias have, on the advice and with the help of the
                        Line, been modernized and enlarged ; now, whoever desires to make the
                        overland tour need only call at any office of the Tourist Department of the
                        Line, and without any preparations whatever, he or she will be conducted in
                        the cheapest and most comfortable manner. The journey from Jerusalem to
                        Damascus can be made in six days, and this too without the trouble of
                        looking after dragomans, servants and tents, without danger of life or
                        health and above all, for the comparatively small charge of £2.10.0 per day,
                        which is reduced by about one half where several persons club together. On
                        the longest journeys little riding is necessary, the greater part being
                        covered by carriage. On the Lake of Gennesaret the Hamburg American Line has
                        its own little steamer, and from Semak on the southern end of the Lake, the
                        Railway will be used for the journey to Damascus. Not alone here, but in the
                        country east of Jordan, and even down in stony Arabia, a visit to which
                        formerly was coupled with stupendous trials and difficulties, the Hamburg
                        American Line has extended its ramifications and these lands can, under
                        their auspice", be visited without any exertion and with moderate outlay.
                        The magnificent ruins at Jerash, Amman and Petra, ruins of which only rare
                        accounts were brought to light by hardy travelers are now within the reach
                        of every tourist.</p>

                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe. This
                        depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in January
                        may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as Sicily,
                        but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm than many
                        other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt fur too early in the year,
                        for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to
                        go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily. Some will want to take into consideration
                        the number of days to be spent at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list
                        showing the time occupied on each of the various routes between Egypt and
                        the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <p>They are as follows The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to
                        Plymouth, Southampton, London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short
                        ones ore us follows;— Port Said or Alexandria to Brindisi 3 days Alexandria
                        to Messina 3 „ Port Said or Alexandria to Marseilles 5 „ Alexandria to
                        Venice and Trieste... 4 „ Alexandria to Naples 3 „ Port Said to Genoa 5 „

                    <p>The steamers, of the P. and 0. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageries
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt. As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to
                        Alexandria, without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made
                        without change in 4 1/2 hours. The least expensive way to England is by the
                        Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to
                        Liverpool. The German Levant line has also good steamers from Alexandria to
                        Hamburg.</p>

                    <p>mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay. These small but comfortable
                        ships have enormously powerful engines, and attain a very high rate of
                        speed. They are called the “Perry boats,” having been specially built to
                        carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi. If you are going straight
                        through to England you will find the train waiting at .Brindisi which will
                        take you to Calais without changing. It has complete arrangements for j
                        sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in London on the fifth
                        day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMINA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is thc
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Beale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovanni degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a visit.

                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Llovd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        1 during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 8 days. NAPLES is also
                        reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers,
                        which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without wishing to
                        explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri. From Naples to ROME is a
                        train journey of but five hours. All who can will devote at least one week
                        to visiting the many historical and interesting portions of the Eternal
                        City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known to need comment hero.
                        Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers arid its surrounding country. In Florence itself the !
                        churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local
                        promenades and excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most
                        attractive and fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei
                        Colli, one of the finest walks m Europe, opened 85 years ago, goes winding
                        up through the hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion
                        outside Florence is that te Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above
                        the sea level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St.
                        Ellero, thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of
                        oaks takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view. PISA
                        is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ;here there is a fine
                        Cathedral jand the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should If
                        possible be made, in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at sunset.
                        VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near
                        Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient
                        half-way house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable ;
                        and the air and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail. MILAN is a good
                        centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the. Lakes. The
                        Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit. Between Bologna and Milan and only an j
                        hour and-a- half from Milan is SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on
                        account of its thermal springs, change trains at Borgo San Donino and in
                        half-an-hour you are at Salsomaggiore.</p>

                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea-port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above the
                        horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage out
                        of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian lakes.
                        COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza : Boats leave Como frequently for the other
                        towns on the lake, which is very beautiful, and the scenery on either side
                        going up the lakeis most enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come
                        Tremzzp, Cadenabbia, and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of
                        Bellaggio opposite. The walk from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to
                        Menaggio is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on
                        Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in
                        two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                        train in one-and-a-half hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is
                        charmingly situated on the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery.

                        be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty town,
                        situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate, and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Basso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,”
                        by Ciseri, and "The Flight into Egypt.” by Bramantion. LUCERNE.—A striking

                        from Lucerns to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of nature.
                        BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of
                        Lucerne, commands magnificent views of lake and mountain scenery. Along the

                        from Alexandria ; the climate in April is charming. The best steamers are
