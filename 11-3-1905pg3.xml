<div type="item"><head>HAMBURG-AMERIKA LINE.</head></div>
<div type="item"><head>A CONTRADICTION.</head>
<p>The statement of a Cairo contemporary, that the negotiations for the amalgamation in Egypt of the Hamurg-Amerika Line and the Anglo-Amerioan Nile Steamers and Hotels Company were on the point of being broken off, is, we are informed, not correct. The negotiations, though not completed, are proceeding, and there is no question whatever of any amalgamation of the Hamburg-Amerika S.S. Company with Messrs. Thos. Cook and Sons with a view to a new or improved Nile serving.	
</p><p>The S.S. Oceana, which was expected to be ready by the beginning of the year 1906 for the Naples-Alexandria passenger traffic of the German company, is hardly likely, from the latest accounts, to be completed and through her trials in time for the season, and it is therefore possible that some of the Hamburg-Amerika S.S. Company’s boats will run from New York to Alexandria via Naples and back by the same route during the spring, and perhaps will continue their sailings till July, 1906. In the event of this being found practicable the S.S. Deutschland and Augasta Victoria will probably be employed on this service, but no authoritative information is likely to be received on these points till the arrival of Mr. Stangen, who is expected here on or about the 28th inst.

<p>We are very glad to hear that a sufficient □umber of applications has been received to ensure the starting of the new British Club at Alexandria, in accordance with the terms of the circular issued on the 25th ult. There are, however, still many Britishers who cannot be reached by circular, and complaints are daily received concerning the want of notice ; but, as we mentioned in a previous issue, it is a difficult matter to get at many of those who would no doubt like to join or support the club. It is therefore hoped that they will apply to that secretary for application forms as soon as possible, as a meeting of the provisional committee has been called for Monday next to consider the applications and to decide oh the locale of the club. The secretary’s address is Mr. A. R. Purvis, Ports and Lights Administration, Alexandria.

<div type="item"><head>THE VECTIS COLLISION.</head>
<p>A PASSENGER’S ACCOUNT.</p>
<p>The P.O. S. Y. Vectis arrived at Alexandria this morning from Port Said. One of the passengers on board the yacht gives us the following most interesting account of the collision between the Vectis and the Esther R off Constantinople, which he watched from the deck of the British vessel.
</p><p>It appears that the Vectis was steaming out of the harbour at Constantinople bound for Beyrout when the Italian wooden cargo steamer Esther R. appeared steering a course that brought her diagonally across the bows of the Vectis. In spite of signals,which were repeated, that she was steering across the course of the latter vessel, the Italian continued her career without apparently paying any attention, and Captain Thompson, of the Vectis, realising that a collision was imminent, ordered the engines to be put full speed astern so as to minimise the force of the impact, and at the same time ordered all the passengers between decks to be mustered on deck, those for ward to have the priority, owing to the certainty that his bows would suffer. Within about a minute from the command the Vectis struck the bows of the Italian vessel with a noise that resembled the breaking of a hollow box. The vibration was not very considerable, probably owing to the low speed of the ramming vessel but the bow of the Vectis rent the side of the Esther R from the rail to the water line, bulging out the plates on the opposite side of her victim and sending fragments of metal and timber flying in all directions.
</p><p>Immediately on the collision Captain Thompson, as a precautionary measure, ordered the boats to be lowered. The passengers, most of whom were still in bed at the early hour of 6 a.m., were naturally rather startled by the shook and the stewards’ warning, and many of the ladies came on deck in decidedly incomplete toilettes, but there was a most commendable absence of panic. Their coolness was not shown by the crew of the Italian vessel, a number of whom leaped On to the bows of the Vectis as the vessels hung together. As soon as the interlocked bows of the ships separated; the Esther R, with a twenty-foot gap in her side and a huge list, made for the rooks at the entrance of the harbour and in two or three minutes grounded on a ledge. A few minutes more would have seen her founder.
</p><p>The Vectis suffered comparatively light damage: her bows were stovein and some plates holed, but no really serious harm was done to the structure of the ship. The delay of two days, though of course annoying, did not cost the passengers anything, the company merely extending the deration of the voyage, and all were agreed that the action of the captain and his officers, all of whom were on duty at the time of the collision, was marked by a seamanlike resolution and sangfroid,while no unnecessary risks were taken.
</p><p>An enquiry will be held as to the cause of the collision, which is believed to be done to the employment of an inexperienced pilot on the Esther R, which was an old British-built vessel, dating from some 30 years back, since transferred to au Italian company.

</p></div><div type="item"><head>THE KAISER AND EGYPT.</head>
<p>FRENCH PRESS OPINION.</p>
<p>In an interesting article dealing with the hopes entertained by the Egyptian “patriot,” Mustapha Pasha Kamel, of German intervention in Egypt, our contrere "R.C.," of “La Beforme,” says :—“To think that William II. will, from mere disinterested love of Islam; free Egypt of the English, is a chimera, and nothing more. Still, it is possible that some difficulties might be raised by Germany in connection with the abolition of the Capitulations, and several Berlin newspaper's have recently expressed a formal opinion in favor of the maintenance  of these secular treaties. The Capitulations, which were concluded, first of all, by the kings of France, and which every government of our country has hitherto defended, have in future for Germany virtues which they did not possess when France was the only one to defend them. It is rather late in the day now. They left to France the role of eternal "protestataire" while she was in reality the champion of all the European States; and it is only when an agreement has been come to between her and England, having as a corollary the modification if not the abolition of these Capitulations, that they take it into their heads to defend them.
</p><p>"Besides, it is not on this ground that our confrere of the "Lewa” wishes to draw the Emperor William. Native publicists have always been the allies of the English in demanding the suppression of these laws, which, it appears, affect them injuriously. They have never been able to understand that the Capitulations were a guarantee of the relative independence of Egypt: internationalism has not had any more resolute enemies— Lord Cromer excluded —than the native ruling classes themselves.”
</p></div><div type="item"><head>OFFICIAL SALARIES.</head>
<p>The question of increasing official salaries will not be decided for some months to come, but in order that Government employes may take advantage of the revision of the Financial Code, it has been decided that when the new law is promulgated it will have a retrospective effect from the 1st January, 1906. In consequence  of the increase of salary in Government departments it is proposed that officials should work in the afternoon.

</p></div><div type="item"><head>SWIMMING IN THE NILE.</head>
<p>AMERICANS ESTABLISH RECORDS.</p>
<p>A detailed account of a test of endurance and record-forming ordeal in the Nile, should interest all lovers of sport, write a Cairo correspondent. Mr. Poss, the well known American swimmer; successfully accomplished the task of swimming from the Anglo-American  landing-stage (to the south of Kasr-el-Nil bridge) to the Barrage in just three hours and a quarter.	_
</p><p>The event was preceded by an exhibition of fast swimming by Tom Smith, the steward of the Hon. Frederick Morgan. At 9.5 the beautifully appointed launch Rapide, lent for the occasion, and having on board as time-keepers and judges Mr. Bigge,Mr. Cook,Mr. Delbaxon, Mr. Stephens, and Mr. Bourse, pat out from the landing-stage at Kasr-el Doabara, where Smith dived in, and, with a strong tide stroke was soon through the swirl of the Kasr-el-Nil Bridge. He reached Rod el-Farag in a fraction under thirty-five minutes from the moment of diving—an extraordinary feat, considering the condition of the river at the present time.
</p><p>On Poss entering the water, it was seen at once that he had grasped the problem of negotiating the current, and he began his fatiguing journey with a powerful breast stroke,whioh he maintained almost continuously. The water proved towards the end of the swim somewhat chilly. But Poes never showed the slightest inclination to give in. En reute the swimmer was misinformed as to the correct reute, and taking the channel to the right, lengthened the course by nearly two miles and lost also the aid of the current. He was, more over, in constant danger of being ran down by gyhassas, the occupants of which were seized with a desire to rescue from the water a man whom they supposed to be drowning.
</p><p>Smith finished the last four miles with Poss to pace and encourage him, and the two were nearly drawn through sluice gates. Poss, after a vigorous massage and a walk about the precincts of the Barrage, found himself in excellent fettle, and declared that he could do the swim over again. The precise time of the start was 10.15 and the Barrage was reached at 1.30.
</p><p>The two swimmers to whom we have referred, have done a great deal to dispel the many stories which prevailed as to the treacherous character of the Father of Rivers, and have established records in swimming in Egypt, which we hope others will endeavour in due course to surpass. They proved, moreover, that swimming contests in the Nile are as safe as in any other river, and we should that after their exhibition natation will be added to the list of progressive Egyptian sports.

<p>Played at Suez on 1st inst. The naval officers batted first, and after Irwin had been dismissed by Nosworthy at 18, the innings for a time resolved itself into a procession, the attack dominating over the defence to such an extant that seven wickets were down for 29. On Carne joining Bush the visitors' prospects appreciably improved, and when Nosworthy broke the partnership the score had been carried to 66 for eight wickets, the innings dosing for 77. Worthington reputed one of the finest bats in the Navy, was out to hot return to Mansell which was smartly held Both Mansell and Nosworthy constantly heat the batsmen, but they were flattered by a somewhat nerveless defence.</p>
<p>The task imposed on the home team was not a hard one, but, with the exception of Toms and Norton, it failed to do itself justice. The former batsman never failed to punish anything approaching a loose ball The result hung in the balance, the Powerful ultimately winning by 11 runs. Scores :—
