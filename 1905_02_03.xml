                    <p><placeName>LONDON</placeName>ebruary 2. The “Daily Telegraph” learns from St.
                        Petersburg that as a result of an interview on Monday with the Minister
                        Yermoloff, and on his earliest representations, the Tsar signed a case
                        demonstrated a Russian Magna Chart. This directs M. Witte, as President of
                        the Committee of Ministers, to further extend the reform laid down in the
                        Ukase of the 27th December last. It orders that the people shall be invited
                        to co-operate with the Government, leaving M. Witte to determine the manner
                        of such co-operation. It commands the restoration of order throughout the
                        Empire by peaceful methods, and the' pensioning of those who were made
                        orphans or cripples on the 22nd ult. The Council of Ministers afterwards die
                        caused the new situation, M. Witte throwing the whole weight of his
                        influence on the popular side. It was decided to release the captives’
                        to-day, and to free the Press. General Trepoff is to be sent to Manchuria
                        later. A representative council is to be created in a fortnight.

                        the “Magna Charta” is incorrect. It was based on the following
                        circumstances: The Council of Ministers rejected a motion submitted by M.
                        Witte to record its opinion regarding the incidents on the 22nd of January,
                        and to adopt measures in order to prevent their recurrence. M. Witte, whose
                        motion was on the minutes, there upon submitted a memorandum to the Tsar,
                        who approved it. The Council held an extraordinary sitting on the 31st
                        January, in order to discuss the memorandum, when the question of an enquiry
                        into tire incidents of the 22nd January was considered. The Minister of
                        Finance was empowered to prepare a scheme for social and legislative reform
                        with special re to the labour question. (Reuter.)</p>

                    <p>The Italian Consular Court at Alexandria was crowded this morning on the
                        occasion of the demand of M. Attilio Ninci, commercial director of the
                        Societe des Sucreries et de la Raffinerie at Alexandria, for a separation
                        from his wife Olga, nee Constaufiaides, on the grounds of her adultery with
                        Judge Constantine Dimaras. President of the Hellenic Consular Court at
                        Alexandria. M. Ninci was represented by Maitre Colucci and his wife by
                        Maitre Colucci. M. Ninci sat by the side of his counsel but the lady did not
                        put in an appearance. He went on and endeavoured to show that, if the Court
                        should grant a separation, it should be pronounced on the grounds of the
                        misconduct of both husband and wife. Counsel then argued that no such
                        separation should be accorded, as M. Ninci had condoned the offence by
                        agreeing to be reconciled with his wife after he had ascertained that she
                        had committed adultery. Counsel cited an article of the Code applicable to
                        such a case. He insisted that in any case should be granted, and then
                        proceeded to read further correspondence from M. Ninci to his wife from
                        which he deduced the conclusions : That the husband was a man of utterly
                        depraved tastes, that he had maltreated his wife, that he had neglected her
                        when ill and in every way had by his callous conduct to the sin of his wife,
                        who had only succumbed to the Judge alter having been grossly neglected
                        during her illness by her husband. After the reconciliation at Helouan
                        marital intercourse had been resumed, M. Ninci returned here, but as soon os
                        be knew that the Judge had come back to Alexandria, on accident occurred in
                        consequence of which M.Niuci returned to Helonan aggressively maltreated his
                        wife. Reconciliation was now impossible and counsel concluded that both
                        husband and wife were equally to blame and said that it was the wife who
                        made a complaint to the Consulate and asked for better treatment or judicial
                        separation. It was only that M. Ninci brought the present case. Maltre
                        Colucci rose to reply at 12.30 p.m., but the further hearing of the case was
                        postponed until 4 o’clock this afternoon.</p>

                        and Medina. Does it all go with the Mahmal? If so the thieves at Abbassich
                        were merciful the amount is so considerable that I should think it might be
                        made the basis of a bargain whereby in consideration of its continued
                        payment annually the Bedouins should cease from massacring and pillaging
                        unoffending pilgrims. Surely some such terms might be arranged with a view
                        to putting on end to present and prospective perils. Under existing
                        circumstances we are putting a premium on crime and outrage.</p>

                        Neb-kheru-Ra. They have also found monuments of two other kings of the

                    <p>“C” Comp. R. Berks vs. R.M.A. The above teams met at Mustapha on Wednesday
                        last. The R.M.A. soon got down to work, scoring two goals in the first two
                        minutes of the game. After this, however, the R. Berks carried all before
                        them, scoring three goals in rapid succession and adding another in the
                        second half was of a very even character, and both side played a good game.
                        Result: R Berks, 4 goals, R.M.A. 2 goals.</p>
                    <p>R. Berks Regimental Team vs. St. Andrew’s. These teams met on Saturday at
                        Mustapha. Saint Andrew’s won the toss, and elected to kick up the field. The
                        opening stages of the game were confined to midfield, but the superior
                        combination of the regimental platers soon brought them into the “Saint”
                        Andrew’s territory, and the defence had some anxious moments in
                        consequences. Play was again transferred to midfield, and occasionally the
                        visiting forwards would get away, but were always weak at finishing. A
                        series of corners looked dangerous for the Saints, but they eventually
                        cleared. A little later, however, Hutton got through the defence, and put
                        his team one up. The Saints tried hard to draw level, but at half-time the
                        score remained:Regiment 1- Saint Andrew’s O. Playing downhill in the second
                        half, but with the sun against them, the Saint hoped to reduce the lead, but
                        everyone seemed to fall away in disappointing fashion. The game throughout
                        this half was really only a case of shooting for goal on the part of the
                        Berks, who were all over their opponents, Jossy scored the second goal
                        shortly after the restart and a third came from the foot of Hill a few
                        minutes later. Still the Saints were unable to find their bearings, and it
                        was not until late in the second half that they managed to get within range
                        of Adam. Cowie tested him but he saved well, and it was no surprise when
                        Haber and Josey got well away, and the last named finished by scoring a
                        fourth goal for his side. Saint Andrew’s could do nothing after this, and
                        retired defeated by four goals to nil.</p>

                    <head>INFANT MORTALITY IN EGYPT</head>
                    <p>To the editor of the Egyptian Gazette. Sir, Your leader entitled “What is
                        needed” is a brilliant and vigorous defence of the Government’s non pass
                        policy, but I scarely think that it finally disposes of the questions
                        discussed. To me it is neither conclusive nor convincing. I cannot pretend
                        to view with the writer in dialectical skill, through it is easy to point
                        out several factors which his argument fails to notice. In the first place,
                        he leaves out of account the climatic conditions here, which are infinitely
                        more favorable to life than those existing in England, for instance, where
                        we have eight months of winter and the rest not infrequently of rain.
                        Statistics show that the death rate there amongst infants is largely due to
                        diseases occasioned by the inclemency of our climate. There is another point
                        which he leaves out of consideration, and that is overcrowding in our great
                        cities. The evil of overcrowding in Cairo and Alexandria cannot be compared
                        in extent to that of London and Liverpool. Furthermore, the English mother-I
                        speak of her because she is best known to me-is quite as careless, if not
                        more careless, of her infant than the Egyptian in the matter of feeding. It
                        is a common thing amongst the poorer classes in England for infants to be
                        reared upon fried fish washed down. Whatever the native mother’s faults may
                        be, she does not give her infant to quiet its fractions moments. Yet,
                        despite inclement climate, overcrowding, and gin, the rats of infant
                        mortality is considerably lower in England than in Egypt. I therefore
                        maintain that something can be done and should be done to arrest the
                        excessive mortality amongst infants in this country. I am not very sanguine,
                        I confess, that my words will meet with any response from the authorities,
                        who seem far too engrossed in farming brilliant budgets to give heed to the
                        warnings. I am etc. Humanity</p>
