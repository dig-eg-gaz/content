							<p>Count Tattenbach, in an interview with Reuter's correspondent, said
								that the mission to Fez was to thank the Sultan for the Emperor
								William's welcome, and to repeat the assurance concerning the
								integrity of Morocco. He said that it was not intended to ask for
								any con- cessions, or to propose any commercial conven- tion. Had
								France communicated to Germany, the latter would have pointed out
								the incom- patibility of private agreements with the inter- national

					<head>EXECUTION AT ALEXANDRIA. NEW EXECUTION CHAMBER USED.</head>
					<p>The first execution in the new execution chamber at Hadra prison took place
						this morning, when Danik Bassioumi suffered the extreme penalty of the law
						for the murder on November 25 last, of Mohamed Sakr el Ansari at Nahiet
						Mellaha Daoud (Bebera). The execution, being strictly private, was of a most
						orderly character, and was not marked by any incident. Two minutes before
						the appointed time (7.30 am.) the condemned man was led out of his cell and
						conducted to the execution chamber (a plain whitewash- ed-room with a
						black-painted floor). The man showed no resistance whatever, but was per-
						ceptibly afraid of his coming doom. Beyond repeatedly uttering "Aupa
						marloum" (“I am a victim”), however, he made no statement and on the charge
						being read out to him he simply repeated the same ejaculation. He was
						immediately weighed, strapped, and placed on the trapdoor, while the black
						cap was I put over his head. As this operation was being performed he was
						heard to utter some prayer, while his visage took on a leaden i hue, due to
						intense fear. </p>
					<p>At half-past seven precisely, Miralai Hop- kinson Bey, Commandant of Police,
						gave the signal and Ashmawi, the public executioner, pulled the lever which
						launched Danik Bas- sioumi into eternity. A drop of 1.75 metres was allowed,
						death ensuing within seven seconds. The hoisting of the black flag over the
						prison tower indicated to the outside world that justice had been done.</p>
					<p>The body was afterwards examined by Dr. Choucry Bey, the police doctor, as
						well as the prison doctor. It was then taken in a prison van, escorted by a
						posse of mounted police under Sagbolaghasi Waller, to the Government Hos-
						pital, where the usual autopsy was made. The only persons admitted to be
						present at the execution, besides the police and prison officials, were a
						few members of the Press. Although the prison contained no less than 1,200
						prisoners, an ominous silence was notice able, not a sound of any kind being
						heard. It is interesting to note that while Bassioumi, on entering the
						prison, weighed 60 kilos, at the time of his execution he weighed 8 kilos
						more.</p>

					<head>MOHAMED ALY CENTENARY. A MADHOUSE MEMORIAL.</head>
					<p>A meeting was held on Sunday afternoon at the Alexandria Municipality to
						consider what steps should be taken to commemorate the centenary of Mohamed
						Aly at Alexandria. The meeting decided that the best scheme to com- memorate
						the founder of the Khedivial Dynasty and the maker of modern Egypt would be
						to erect a madhouse! All the subscriptions re- ceived from private persons
						are to be devoted to the memorial.</p>
					<p>That Municipality will bear all the expenses connected with the illuminations
						in Mohamed Aly-square and a grant of £1,000 is to be made for that purpose.
						If the cost of the illuminations exceed the grant, the extra expenses will
						also be defrayed by the Municipality in order to keep the illumina- tions

					<head>BANDMANN-DALLAS OPERA. THE EARL AND THE GIRL.</head>
					<p>Those who were in England last summer may remember the “Earl and the Girl"
						drawing crowded houses and enjoying such a run of popular favor, and so they
						made a point of visit- ing it at Cairo on Friday night. But the piece is a
						woful commentary on the mental state of the British public after dinner;
						refusing to think-over or criticise a play, they are appa- rently content to
						merely watch and listen,and that too with a large measure of post-prandial
						charity that covers a multitude of shortcom- ings. From the London
						performance much had to be changed on Friday owing to scenic and other
						difficulties, but it was only a further proof that it is essential for these
						mediocre musical plays to have a first-rate orchestra, a large and
						well-trained chorus, and lavish expenditure on stage properties and scenery.
						For the principals worked well throughout, and no one could fail to
						appreciate Mr. Ralph Roberts’ excellent humorous efforts, his gro- tesque
						impersonation of the Earl in Art II being some of the best low comedy we
						have seen. Mr. O'Connor seems to have a talent for making love in a variety
						roles, though we wish he would let us hear more of the words of his songs he
						is lucky that his heroine, for Miss Corlass plays the part of a fiancee
						charm- ingly and thoroughly deserved her floral tributes. Fot the first time
						Mr. Mark Lester had a chance, and he gave a capital rendering of Downham,
						whilst his songs, especially ”The Man Behind,” greatly pleased the audience.
						Miss Morra made the most of “Sammy” (though the same cannot be said of the
						occu- pants of the favored box!), while vocal honors fell to Miss Nina
						Leslie, who showed great technique and musical skill in her singing of "The
						Nightingale’s Trill.”</p>
					<p>We would advise the manager in future to omit the song “Zanzibar,” which
						cannot be a success without the chorus and properties that helped to enhance
						it at the Vaudeville Theatre.</p>

					<head>SHEM EN-NESSIM AT CAIRO.</head>
					<p>The weather was most favorable to holiday- making round Cairo on Monday and
						large numbers of excursionists visited the Pyramids and Helouan, while the
						Barrage was literally overrun by crowds of Europeans and Arabs. The river
						steamers and the trains which ran at short intervals from Cairo were
						literally pack- ed. Many of the excursion trains numbered 22 carriages and
						were drawn by two loco- motives, and the crowds in the station were
						extraordinarily large and amusingly mixed, numbers of the employes from the
						European shops, soldiers, conjurors, dancing-girls, fortune-tellers, — in
						short, samples of every class of the population of Cairo being on view
						there.</p>
					<p>In spite of the numbers of the trippers who set out for the Barrage the
						railway authorities handled the throngs with remarkable success. The trains
						left to tho minute, room being found up to the last minute for late
						arrivals, and the patience and good temper of both the crowds and the
						platform authorities deserved special mention. Whatever may have been urged
						against the Railway Administration in the past, it is evident that in
						dealing with holiday traffic it has learned all that can be learned, and we
						doubt whether any London station authorities could deal more successfully
						with trippers than their Cairo comrades.</p>

					<head>THE HOLY CITY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE</head>
					<p>Dear Mr. Editor, — I am very sorry my remarks in your issue of Friday last
						offended the pious sentiments of the “Trio”—Ex-Choir- master,” “Tantum
						Religio" and “Anglicanus" —whether they be gentlemen in Black, Blue, Red or
						Tweed. If the first, perhaps they will practise what they preach. Their
						letters are somewhat abusive, and add to this the “Ex Choirmaster's",
						sarcasm regarding the “aug mented choir’s” prodigality of time is rather out
						of place. He no doubt thinks “prodigality” and “shekels” should go hand in
						hand, espe- cially at Easter-time!</p>
					<p>I also particularly desire to state that I did not wish it to be inferred
						that any one desired invidious praise, but that something more might have
						been said in the first report regard- ing the cantats. I have since heard
						that the “criticism” was left to one considered the most capable. Better, I
						think, if it never appeared,for such a "musicianly" effort (such detail and
						accuracy in every sense) is simply marvellous. Apologising for again
						troubling you, and with the assurance that I shall not do so again on this
						matter, not even if smitten with Samson's weapons—I am, etc, ACCORD.</p>

						<dateline>Port Said, Sunday.</dateline>
						<p>Last evening a breeze sprang up from the N.E. By midnight it was blowing
							half a gale and a strong surface current was running into the harbour.
							The harbour of Port Said is quite unprotected from all winds from N.E.
							to E. by S., and the result is that a heavy sea soon gets up in the
							port, and frequently many accidents occur when these winds are pre-
							valent.</p>
						<p>At 2 a.m. a large ship, the “Aladdin,” coming into the harbour from sea,
							doubtless on account of the current sheared about the channel, and in
							her erratic course, collided with a Turkish steamer, the “Mecca," at
							once started to drag, but the officers very smartly sent ropes to the
							nearest buoy and held her till such time as assistance could be sent
							when she was tied up as securely as ever.</p>
						<p>This morning, about 10' o’clock, a big barge laden with timber, a local
							craft, was proceeding to sea, but soon after leaving the shelter of the
							inner harbour, she was struck hy several heavy seas, which in a very
							short time filled her. Her cargo being planks of pine she could not
							sink, but she might easily, had it not been for the prompt aid given her
							by the Government Harbour department, have broken up in a few
							minutes.</p>
						<p>Now, at 3 p.m., the weather is inclined to moderate, and the wind may go
							round to the south, in which case, particularly as we are supported to
							be in the thick of the khamseen season, we may look for another
							“roasting” such as we had only a week back, when in many places the
							thermometer regis- tered well past 10Q deg. Fahr. in the shade.</p>

					<head>THE S.S. "CANDLESHOE" </head>
					<p>The work of discharging this vessel still goes on. The entire contents of the

					<head>THE S.S. "CONGAL”</head>
					<p>The work of constructing the caisson round the S.S. “Congal" with the view of
						eventually raising her by means of pumps, still goes on; and it is hoped
						that in a month from now this disgrace to the harbour, and the Canal Company
						in particular, will have been removed. The vessel, which collided with her,
						the “Craftsman,” has already made two Indian trips since the incident, and
						the "Congal” still remains.</p>

					<p>It appears that the article published in the “Egyptian Gazette” some two
						months ago, anent the gross disproportion of Greek and other pilots in the
						service as compared to the 8% who are British, is likely in the near future
						to bring forth fruit.</p>
					<p>I have it on authority on which I place great reliance, that a certain
						British admi- nistrator of the Canal Company, on reading “Fairplay,” which
						copied the article I men- tion, set himself to make enquiries, with the
						result that, my informant tells me, before very long we may hope to see more
						British officers here, and I venture to say, fewer troubles and difficulties
						with shipmasters in consequences. The latter are often, it appears, by no
						means pleased at the way in which their ships are handled.</p>

					<head>BOURSE KHEDIVIALE</head>
					<p>Remarques sur le marché du disponible et des contrats.</p>
					<p>Samedi, le 29 avril 1905.</p>
					<p>Cotons</p>
					<p>Disponible.—La hausse des contrats a entravé de nouveau les affaires et,
						comme conséquence, nous nous trouvons à peu près aux cours de samedi
						dernier, avec une demande limitée aux qualités spéciales et aux provenances
						Haute-Egypte dont le bon marché réel a fini par être réellement tentant.
						Franco gare.—Nullité complète.</p>
					<p>Contrats.—Nouvelle recolts. On n’y fait pas grand’chose, lo mai absorbant
						toujours l'atten- tion générale, mais les cours sont quand même fermes,
						quoique ne suivant que do très loin la hausse du mai.</p>
					<p>Récolte actuelle.—La semaine avait mal débuté, mais après avoir touché 18
						3/16, le mai s’est subitement relevé et cela sur des on- dit plus ou moins
						fondés. Jeudi, la clôture eut lieu à 13 23/32, mais ce matin sur le accours
						in- espéré de New-York,nous avons atteint jusqu’à 14 1/8, pour réactionner
						ensuite par le contre coup de l'exagération du mouvement et sous la pression
						des grosses réalisations qui ont eu lieu. On croit cependaut toujours à de
						nou- velles manœuvres sur le mois en question. Le juillet est en déport de
						21/32 de talari. Dana la matinée; prix plus haut pour mai taL 14 1/8 à —/—;
						plus bas pour mai 13 27/32 à-/—.</p>
					<p>Graines de coton</p>
					<p>Disponible.—Le marché n’a rien eu d’inté- ressant et a même été lourd si l’on
						prend en considération les gros embarquements. Franco-Station.—Aucune
						affaire.</p>
					<p>Contrats.—Nouvelle récolte. Les gros ven- deurs manquent et cela maintient
						les prix; mais en dehors de cette circonstance les achats de Hull à £5.17/6
						et 5.18/9 influenceut favorablement le marché.</p>
					<p>Récolte ootuelle.—Malgré la bonne demande et les perspectives de hausse par
						suite des gros dégâts avérés aux Indes, les cours ne montent pas
						suffisamment, ce qui doit être attribué au manque de spéculation sur
						l’article. Le marché est cependant ferme.</p>
					<p>Dans la matinée; prix plus haut pour mai P.T. 56 30/40 à —/— : plus bas pour
						mai 56 25/40 à —/—.</p>
					<p>Feves</p>
					<p>Disponible.—Faute d'arrivages copieux, les affaires sont restreintes et les
						cours restent termes.</p>
					<p>Franco-station.—Rien.</p>
					<p>Contrats—Chaque schat cause une amélio- ration dans les cours, mais le marché
						est tellement restreint qu’il se passe des journées entières sans qu'une
						affaire ait lieu.</p>
					<p>Information.—Le comité de l'Alexandria General Produce Association a décidé
						de fermer le marché de Minet-el-Bassal à l'occa- sion du centenaire de
						l’avènement de S.A. Mohamed Aly.</p>

					<head>ALEXANDRIA SPORTING CLUB</head>
					<head>FIRST SUMMER MEETING.</head>
				</div>
				<div type="item">
					<p>The first day of the first summer meeting of the Alexandria Sporting Club was
						held yester- day, and as it coincided with Shem-en-Nessim a very large
						attendance was recorded. All the rank and fashion of Alexandria were present
						and many Cairo sportsmen put in an appear- ance. The weather was excellent
						and very cool for this time of the year. The racing was decid- edly good and
						close finishes were the order of the day. As is usually the case, the course
						was as perfect as it could be and was not too dry, thus obviating any
						inconvenience from dust.</p>
				</div>
				<div type="item">
					<p>Of the races, the Club Stakes excited the greatest interest, as the field was
						one of the largest ever known on the Alexandria Sporting Club’s grounds. It
						was well managed and was watched from three different points, the jockeys
						having been warned that, if they jostled or fouled, they would be suspended
						for a year. The result of this was that not a single protest was lodged, nor
						was there a mishap of any sort or kind. Stillwell, the winning jockey in the
						race, is to be congratulated on his success, which was well deserved. The
						second horse was also well ridden by the English jockey Whiteside.</p>
					<p>Khalil Pasha Khayat was somewhat unlucky in missing the Club Stakes and the
						Pony Handicap, the second and third places in both races going to his
						stables.</p>
					<p>Lieutenant J. K. Bassett performed his duties as starter most creditably, and
						he got off the big field of 34 horses in the Club Stakes in very good
						style.</p>
					<p>The intervals between the races were enli- vened by the band of the 3rd
						Battalion Royal Berkshire Regiment, which, under the leader- ship ff
						Bandmaster Dore, played a delightful selection of music in the course of the
						after- noon.</p>
					<p>Colonel Lucas fulfilled his duties as Clerk of the Course in a most efficient
						manner. The handicapping of Prince Omar Pasha Toussoun and Mr. Rodocanachi
						gave general satisfaction.</p>

						this ex- ceptionally large field gave some trouble at the post, when the
						webbing ascended, it was to a capital start. Rais was first to show in front
						and until the cutting was reached he and Fantasia kept to the fore. Fadgham
						took the lead on leaving the cutting and, humoured by Stillwell, he drew
						away with his long sweeping stride, and a fine struggle was witnessed on the
						straight, Fadg- ham being challenged by Suleik and Au Revoir, but succeeded
						in winning by half a length. Au Revoir took second place in the straight,
						but was overhauled shortly before home was reached by Suleik, who got second
						place by a neck only. Fantasia finished fourth, Mikado fifth.</p>

						well tried to shake his mount up again soon after, but Moofid was then well
						beaten and had to resign third place to Shewiman. Rachid tried to shake off
						Banaback coming down the straight. Khalil Pasha Khayat’s horse made a plucky
						bid for mastery and came in second by half a length, but only a neck ahead
						of Mr. P. W. Stout's Shewiman, which was much fancied. Moofid came in
						fourth. This constituted one of the best finishes of the very successful

					<head>EASTER AT MANSOURAH AND TANTAH.</head>
					<p>It came about that these services began quite canonically with an evensong at
						Tantah on Easter Eve: though really this was quite an impromptu arrangement
						to compensate for the loss of a Good Friday evensong (abandoned owing to the
						extreme heat).</p>
					<p>On Easter morning at 7.45 am. there was a muster of eleven to sing the Easter
						hymn and to communicate. Arriving at Mansourah in time for Matins and Holy
						Communion at 11 a.m. the chaplain found the church room a mass of flowers,
						chiefly roses. Five men of the Constantinia Company from Bassandila had come
						in with a large contribution of these, which the ladies of Mansourah had
						arranged in tasteful manner at the altar, reading desk, lectern, and in the
						windows. The service began with the hymn "For all the Saints,” in honor of
						St George's Day. Mr. F. T. Murdoch, as usual, read the lessons and Miss
						Mullings played the organ with, if possible, more than her usual ability and
						taste. The congregation of twenty-seven, though not a “record,” was all
						things considered a good muster. Twenty communicated. The chaplain
						unfortunately found he had not the necessary vigour left after these efforts
						for going over again to Tantah for the intended evensong. Appended is the
						monthly list of services:</p>
					<p>Mansourah Tantah May 7 Litany and H.C. II a m. Even. 6.30p.m. “ 14 Evensong
						6.30 p.m. H.C. 8 am.. Litany &amp; H.C. 11 am. “ 21 H.C. 8 a.m., Matins
						11a.m. Even. 6.30 p.m. “ 28 Evensong 6.80 p.m. H.C. 8 n.m. Matins 11
						a.m.</p>

					<p>At a church council meeting held at Tantah on Easter Eve whereat Mr. A.J.
						Wakeman Long took office as churchwarden, elected along with Mr. F. M.
						Wright (who again is willing to continue his indefatigable service), pres-
						sure of business crowded out the fact which should have been mentioned that
						repairs are necessary to the organ. Mrs. Wright has for some time now given
						up much of her valuable time and energy to playing this instrument at
						services and practices, as well as to having tho church room cleaned and
						decorated with flowers. Such voluntary ser- vices must not be hampered for
						the want of milliemes to make good the ciphering of the instrument. T. D. C.

					<head>POSTAL NOTICES.</head>
					<p>A money order service has been established between Russia and Egypt from the
						1st May, on the same conditions as laid down in the In- ternational
						Convention. The maximum amount is fixed at 266 francs for each money
						order.</p>
					<p>An office for correspondence, parcels and money orders has been opened at
						Sayyala and Siba (Assouan Mudirieh).</p>
					<p>The continual increase in the demand for house-to-house delivery in Cairo and
						Alex- andria renders it absolutely necessary that all persons in these towns
						desirous of such deliv- ery shall have the number of the house and name of
						the street in which they live indicated on their correspondence. Should by
						any chance a street be unnamed, then the quarter of the town in which it is
						situated must be indicated. Attention to these instructions is imperative to
						avoid delay and error in the delivery of correspondence.</p>
