                    <p><placeName>London</placeName>, December 9.</p>
                    <p>Speaking at Oxford, <persName>Mr. Chamberlain</persName> said that nothing
                        has taken place which in any way affects his personal relations and
                        political connection with <persName>Mr. Balfour</persName>. He remarked that
                        though the name of Home Rule has been abandoned, the policy still remains
                        the sarne, and that Home Role would be granted by instalments on the hire
                        system. He strongly advised fiscal reform based on the imperialist view,
                        aiming at the inclusion of the colonies in a single confederation, all the
                        members of which would mutually support each other.</p>

                        the policy of the Liberals. He hoped that the Liberals would continue the
                        Unionist foreign policy, but he did not see how a mixed administration of
                        Big and Little Englanders would be able to secure continuity of policy.</p>

                            A man's voice has such a different tone that it is necessary to have

                    <p>The Cairo theatre season opened at the <placeName>Khedivial Opera
                            House</placeName> on Thursday with Pailleron's La Souris. It is, of
                        course, early to pronounce on the merits of the company, but the repertoire
                        promises well enough. La Souris, witty and clever, as is all Pailleron's
                        work, was certainly an excellent beginning, and quite well interpreted. Mme
                        Moreno, who has visited us again this year, was as welcome as ever, and
                        deserved the applause she received : she had, naturally, the hardest part,
                        supporting that side of the play which verges on the tragic ; and while her
                        acting was most quiet and convincing, her voice and diction were a
                        delight--a relief, we must confess, to the somewhat tapid and at times
                        overload speech of her colleagues. The play is perhaps too natural in its
                        reproduction on the stage of what all would understand from experience.
                            <persName>M. Monteux</persName> was certainly good as Max. But judgment
                        will be an easier matter after some more performances have been given. So
                        far all seems well enough. Mme Moreno, at the conclusion of the play,
                        recited ''Les trois Hussards, as well as the "Adieu Suzon" of Musset. In
                        both her charm of diction and expression was shown to its full, and we may
                        well look forward to and enjoy her appearance in sub-sequent plays.</p>
                    <p>L'Ami Friz and Le Passant were given on Friday. L'Ami Fritz is a comic opera
                        pure and simple--without the music, as idyllic as can be, plenty of eating
                        and drinking, pretty maidens, housekeepers, old and tried, marriage at the
                        end, a relief in every way to the writer's other works : here was no snow,
                        hunger, enemies, the trouble and endurance of war. It was very nicely staged
                        and played, and such little subtleties of acting as appeared (shared by
                            <persName>Fritz</persName> himself and his old Rabbi Councillor) were
                        quite well brought out. The whole play has somehow a Teutonic flavour; it
                        reminds one of the Verkaufte Braut (not that that is strictly speaking
                        Teutonic) and other such ; and it is perhaps as good praise as need be to
                        say that the actors all adapted themselves to it.</p>
                    <p>The short piece that followed--Le Passant of Francois Coppée--was in every
                        way different, in its exquisite verse and dreamy Italian 'décor' : the
                        diction and charm of voice of the two protagonists--rather the two
                        performers--rendered the whole a gem. <persName>Mme Moréno</persName> we
                        knew, but her companion <persName>Mlle Franquet</persName> fully kept up the
                        harmony, and she has not perhaps the variety and clarity of tone which
                        signalises Mme Moreno, but she has a most musical voice, and almost all
                        through she avoids convention.</p>
                    <p>The staging was in every way admirable ; even <persName>Antoine</persName>
                        himself might have approved it.</p>

                    <head>RIOT At ALEXANDRIA. POPULAR EXCITEMENT.</head>
                    <p><placeName>Alexandria</placeName> was the scene of a somewhat serious
                        disturbance yesterday afternoon,which, coming upon the rumours prevalent
                        daring the past ten days, led to an extraordinary state of alarm and
                        excitement among all classes of the population. There are various rumours as
                        to the origin of the disturbance, but it appears that two Greeks were
                        playing cards in a coffee-house at about 3.30 pm. in the <placeName>rue de
                            Malte</placeName>,.which unites <placeName>Sisters-Street</placeName>
                        with <placeName>Anastasi street</placeName>. They quarrelled during the game
                        and one of the players drew his revolver and discharged its contents at his
                        compatriot The man who was aimed at dodged,and the contents of one of the
                        chambers of the revolver lodged in the body of an Arab, who happened to be
                        near by, and who fell to the ground.</p>
                    <p>The Arabs in the neighborhood at once rushed on the Greek, who fled to a
                        tobacconist's shop, belonging to a Greek of the name of
                            <persName>Vounapartopoulo</persName>, which was besieged and wrecked by
                        the infuriated mob.</p>
                    <p>Fortunately the police came to the rescue of the Greeks,and with great
                        difficulty and by the help of their bayonets succeeded in getting them to
                        the Menshieh caracol.</p>
                    <p>The <placeName>Hamamil quarter</placeName>, where the disturbance broke out,
                        is inhabited, in large part, by the lowest class of Europeans and natives.
                        The former became panic-stricken and began to fire in the air from the roofs
                        of the houses, which needlessly excited the natives. While this was going on
                        in the Hamamil, huge crowds of Arabs came into the <placeName>Mohamed Aly
                            square</placeName>, <placeName>Saint Catherine's-square</placeName>,
                            <placeName>Sister-Street</placeName>, and all the neighboaring quarters.
                        Many Europeans were attacked in the streets and the trams. The mob in the
                            <placeName>Mohamad Aly-square</placeName> was more rowdy than vicious,
                        and was composed of a number of youths. But the trouble in the
                            <placeName>Hamamil quarter</placeName> and
                            <placeName>Anastasi-street</placeName> was more serious. The mob smashed
                        the" chairs and tables in the open-air cafes in the square, while the masons
                        at work on the large block now being built in the Post Office street began
                        to hurl stones and building material on the people below. The mob obtained
                        weapons by using the legs of the tables and chairs of the cafes aod battered
                        any Europeans they came across.</p>
                    <p>The panic among the Europeans in the Square and its immediate neighbourhood
                        was very great. A large number fled for refuge to <placeName>Saint
                            Catherine's Cathedral</placeName>,and fainting women were borne to the
                        Mixed Tribunals, where a number of Europeans were accommodated daring the
                        disturbance. The guardian of the Tribunal disarmed a large number of the
                        rioters.</p>
                    <p>We regret to state that among the victims of the mob's fury was <persName>Mr.
                            Marsden</persName>, the sub manager of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank at
                            <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>, whose ear was slit, but who was not
                        dangerously wounded. Among other Europeans attacked was the cashier of
                        Messrs. Walker and Meimarachi. He was walking down <placeName>Saint
                            Mark's-street</placeName> at the time, when a score of Arabs, armed with
                        nabouts, rushed after him, crying "Death to the Christian" He was rescued in
                        the nick of time by the bowab of <placeName>Saint Mark's
                            Building</placeName>, who pushed him into the passage of the
                        building.</p>
                    <p>One of our reporters, who was on the spot when the disturbance broke out, was
                        attacked by the mob in Anastasi street, and he declares that the attitude of
                        the mob in the Hamamil was very threatening. <persName>H.E. Mahmoud
                            Pasha-Sidky</persName>, Governor of <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>,
                            <persName>Miralai Hop-kinson Bey</persName>, Commandant of the
                        Alexandria City Police, <persName>Bimbashi Cobbe</persName>, Sub-Commandant,
                        and a number of mounted police hastened to the scene of the disturbance. The
                        most effective means employed for calming the overheated passions of the
                        populace were the hoses of the Alexandria. Fire Brigade, which played water
                        upon the crowd with great force and succeeded in dispersing the mob in all
                        directions.</p>
                    <p>The excitement spread from the square to other parts of the town and in the
                        Attarin quarter hundreds of Berberin vagabonds rushed through the streets
                        with nabouts.</p>
                    <p>Quiet was restored at about 5.30 o'clock, and the Mohamed Aly square
                        presented its usual aspect in the evening. Most of the chairs and tables
                        belonging to the coffeehouses that had been destroyed were removed and the
                        damage visible was mainly limited to a little bro ken plate glass. The black
                        marble plate of the Cassa di Soonta e di Risparmio was smashed to pieces,
                        but on the whole little damage was done, for fortunately, being Sunday
                        afternoon, the shops had their shutters up. The streets generally were very
                        deserted during the evening, the number of persons about being few.</p>
                    <p>The <placeName>Cafe de France</placeName> in the Grand Square was attacked
                        and greatly suffered at the hands of the mob. In Anastasi-street much glass
                        and many lamps were smashed.</p>
                    <p>During the past few days the garrison at <placeName>Fort Kom
                            el-Dik</placeName> had been reinforced, but for some unknown reason the
                        fort was depleted of its additional troops on Saturday. Yesterday the fort's
                        garrison was again reinforced.</p>
                    <p>The water supply of the city was to have been completely cut off by the
                        Alexandria Water Company at 8.30 o'clook last night, but owing to the urgent
                        representations of the Governor of Alexandria and the Commandant of Police
                        it was decided to leave the water supply on in case any fires broke out, or
                        it was found necessary again to use the hose on the populace.</p>
                    <p>About 250 members of the Alexandria City Polioe were employed in quelling the
                        rioting, and they effected the arrest of 160 natives. Most conflicting
                        accounts are given as to the attitude of the police during the riot. It is
                        stated that the police did not show any real determination at the beginning
                        of the trouble, and only began to exert themselves when the chief officers
                        arrived. An eye-witness says:-- I was in my house in Anastasi-street
                        yesterday when I saw two policemen taking a European away. The police were
                        followed by two other officers with drawn swords. The European was not
                        protected in front by the police and the natives threw stones at him and hit
                        his face with sticks until it was a bleeding indisting-uishable mass of
                        flesh. Another European was brought along by the police and treated in the
                        same way by the populace.</p>
                    <p>THE SCENE IN THE SQUARE.</p>
                    <p>"An Eye-witness" writes:--I witnessed from the upper story of a house on the
                        square the disturbance which took place there this afternoon, and it may
                        interest you to know what I saw. I may preface- my remarks by saying that,
                        near the same spot, I'saw the massacre in June, 1882. I was also in
                            <placeName>Turkey</placeName> during the massacres in 1896. I do not
                        therefore think that I am likely, to be unduly impressed by what I saw
                        to-day. I was reading in my room when, abont a quarter past four o'clock, I
                        beard an unusual noise in the street. Thinking -that a serious accident had
                        happened, I went to the windows of my rooms and, to my great surprise, I saw
                        a great crowd of persons, both natives and Europeans, rushing frantioally in
                        all directions, as' though they were being panned. I remarked that many of
                        the Arabs were carrying rough pieces of wood in their hands, sufficiently
                        large to inflict an ugly wound, if used as a weapon; other Arabs were busy
                        trying to break up chairs which evidently ban been stolen from a cafe near.
                        The object of breaking up the chairs was evidently to provide a supply of
                        bludgeons. Some of the Arabs broke the chairs by striking them against the
                        stone roadway; others placed chairs before the passing trams, possibly with
                        the idea of stopping the trams. In any case, it was evident they meant
                        mischief. The spectacle was identical with that which I saw in 1882 and, as
                        there was an ugly crowd of some thousands of persons at the, bottom of the
                        Place, with which the police was evidently unable to cope, the situation
                        seemed a serions one. This crowd appeared to be one solid compact mass, and
                        it was only after the arrival of the fire engines that it was, dispersed
                        into the side streets and shortly after quiet was restored. I should say
                        that the mob was not organised, but it was evident that a row of some sort
                        was looked for, as I remarked that, as was the case in 1882, the Berberin
                        were much in evidence, some came on foot, in groups of three or four, others
                        by the trams. They ware evidently on the qui vive. Now we shall possibly be
                        told, by those who are responsible for the maintenance of order in this
                        city, 'that the gamins and shoeblacks were only having a big lark ; that the
                        whole thing was in itself unimportant, and that those who took the thing
                        seriously are poor timid creatures who are easily alarmed. I am not easily
                        alarmed and my longexp-rienoe of the elements composing the population of
                        this city warrants me in saying that a vary grave danger existed and still
                        exists. It is notorious that, for weeks past, both Christians and natives
                        have been busily occupied in pro-ouring arms. No one seems exactly to know
                        why, but natives and Christians alike are nervously awaiting for something
                        to happen. This in itself is a danger and some mens should be taken to
                        demonstrate that the responsible European authorities,for they alone\ can be
                        relied on, dispose of the means necessary to maintain order. It proof ware
                        wanting of the utter uselessness in case of emergency of the police, as it
                        is at present organised, this shoe-black demonstration gave it Their efforts
                        (?) to restore order were absolutely grotesque, so far as I saw. A set of
                        special c onstates would have known better what to do.1 Many were the
                        enquiries as to the whereabouts , of the armée d'occupation. Some said it
                        would only appear if there was shooting to be done, others said that t he
                        authorities were afraid to send troops into the town lest people should get
                        alarmed and visitors he deterred from coming to Egypt All were agreed that
                        it was better to be even more alarmed than they already were than risk a
                        broken bead. Seriously, it is time that some energetic measures were taken
                        to reassure the public, which possibly, though I dont think so, may be
                        needlessly alarmed.</p>

                        telegraphed to the London Stock Exchange Committee to the effect that
                        everything was calm and that that settlements were going on as usual. This

                        towards <persName>Cherif Pasha-street</persName>. There was a large crowd,
                        standing anxiously watching the scene from the peristyle of the Bourse. When
                        the rabble came up to the neighbourhood of the Bourse all these spectators
                        of the fray, huddled up together, seized chairs, decanters aod glasses and
                        with shouts of determination decided to sell their lives dearly. Ore

                        interior of the Bonne. His comrades remained on the peristyle but none of
                        them were hurt as none of the rioters ever got rear them.</p>

                        Proceedings opened shortly after 3 p.m., when the judge asked <persName>Ma
                            Carton de Wiart</persName> whether he was able to put any definite
                        proposals before the meeting. <persName>Me. Carton de Wiart</persName>
                        replied (that be was still unable to do so, but that the negotiations were
                        nearing a settlement. In reply to another question on the part of the
                        President, he stated that proposals now being considered differed from those
                        previously made in that the bondholders, instead of receiving a fixed
                        interest, would be paid a reduced interest guaranteed by a syndicate but
                        would retain their previous position as bondholders. The pourparlers were
                        going steadily forward and there was a possibility that holders of
                        obligations would be repaid at par or 25% premium. He therefore asked for a
                        week's postponement.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that since the 19th September matters had remained in
                        stats quo and he would therefore grant not a week but a fortnight--for
                        positively the last time--but if matters should then have made no progress
                        the situation of the Sucreries would have to be put before the Courts.</p>
                    <p><persName>Me. Carton de Wiart</persName> expressed his readiness to satisfy

                    <head>HISTORY OF ITS FOUNDING</head>
                    <p>Twelve years ago, on a lovely spring morning, I was walking along the east
                        bank of the <placeName>Nile</placeName>, near to the village of
                            <placeName>Hadji Qandil</placeName> some 180 miles above
                            <placeName>Cairo</placeName>. The land around was a wide amphitheatre of
                        sand some twelve miles across, shut in by the Arabian hills, and almost,
                        except near the river, an arid expanse of sand. There was an awakening of
                        life ; pigeons rose from the beanfields in hundreds and a belated gazelle
                        stole up from the watering place and made swiftly for the hills. Lumbering
                        buffaloes were being fastened to the water wheels, and the women were around
                        the wells. Away from the river all was still and silent. Once, however, that
                        sandy plain was all alive with busy men and women. Where low heaps of sand
                        break the monotony of the plain there once stood a splendid temple and a
                        royal palace, while the houses of priests and officials, together with shops
                        and bazaars, formed a busy city. Though little remains of this once
                        beautiful place there are, fortunately, preserved monuments by which we are
                        enabled to reconstruct the town and the life of the king and its people in a
                        wonderful manner. The Arabian hills form the wall of this circus, and the
                        sides of these are the site of many splendid tombs of the city officials. It
                        is no ordinary city we have to deal with ; unique in its origin, history and
                        religion. It forms the record of a remarkable episode in Oriental history
                        and the memorial of the dominant will and power of one of the most
                        astonishing women of the East.</p>
                    <p>ORIGIN OF THE CITY.</p>
                    <p>The recovery and publication of the material from which to restore the
                        picture is due to the work of <persName>Mr. N. de G. Davies</persName>, who
                        has for many months been engaged in copying the sculptures and inscriptions
                        in these great tombs, which have now been published by the Egypt Exploration
                        Fund. Before describing these splendid sculptures a word must be said as to
                        the origin of this city. <persName>Amenophis III</persName>. (B. C. 1500)
                        had during his reign married a member of Asiatic wives, among them being
                            <persName>Tii</persName>, apparently a princess of
                            <placeName>Mitanni</placeName> or northern
                            <placeName>Mesopotamia</placeName>.</p>
                    <p>The foreign element in the Theban royal harem became so powerful that a
                        religious revolution broke out, and an attempt, for a time successful, was
                        made to replace the great worship of <persName>Amen Ra</persName>, king of
                        the gods, by that of the Aten, or “Solar Disk.’’ For a time only was it
                        powerful in <placeName>Thebes</placeName>, and on the accession of the
                        youthful ruler <persName>Amenophis IV</persName> , who was rigidly under the
                        control of his imperious mother, the position became so serious that the
                        king and court removed from <placeName>Thebes</placeName> to a new city
                        which was built upon this plain of <placeName>El Amarna</placeName>. The
                        idea of this abandonment of the southern capital originated with the queen
                        mother, and that she took an active part in the work is shown by her name
                        being inscribed, with all her titles, upon the central pillar of the great
                        quarry from which the stone for the royal and sacred edifices was
                        obtained.</p>
                    <p>The priest of the tombs was that <persName>Mery-Ra</persName> who was the
                        high priest of the Atendisk in the city of <placeName>Akh Aten</placeName>,
                        ''The glory of the disk.” He was also “fan bearer on the king’s right hand,"
                        “royal chancellor,’’ “A sole companion or privy councillor.” On entering the
                        stately portion of the tomb and passing into the columned entrance hall, we
                        see at once we have a quite different class of burial place to those which
                        are found near Thebes. The tombs of <persName>Mery R of Paneshey</persName>
                        are, we find on entering, veritable rock-cut mansions consisting of several
                        stately halls and chambers. Still more marked is the difference in the
                        lavish mural decorations. The walls are not covered with weird scenes from
                        the Books of the Dead or the underworld, nor do they depict scenes in the
                        domestic life of the departed. Each tomb, from its decorations might be a
                        royal tomb. The king and his family dominate everything. As <persName>Mr.
                            Davies</persName> remarks : "His wife and children, his family
                        affection, are here portrayed in detail,” and it is difficult to discover
                        the official whose tomb it is.</p>
                    <p>In the tomb of <persName>Mery-Ra</persName> we have a picture of the house
                        where the king visits him, and it must have been a beautiful abode. Before
                        the entrance was a large tank, surrounded by trees. There are many courts
                        and cool colonnades, while a picturesque garden full of flowers and shady
                        trees, and another large tank, beside which the owner and his family might
                        enjoy the pleasures of home life in the evenings. In the tomb of
                            <persName>Paneshi</persName> we have a representation of the temple of
                        the Aten, and full details of the service. It differs from the Theban temple
                        in many respects.</p>
                    <p>THE ROYAL FAMILY.</p>
                    <p>The offerings were fruit and flowers ; oxen were led to the temple wreathed
                        and decorated with flowers, and the king and the queen and the young
                        princesses came to worship, bringing offerings of flowers, incense and sweet
                        smelling gums. Indeed, it is remarkable how great a part the beauties of
                        nature form in the temple service. The most striking feature, however of
                        these tableaux is the freedom of life, and the way in which the royal family
                        mingled with the people. Seated on the balcony of the palace we see the king
                        with his arm round the neck of the queen throwing down presents of collars
                        and ornaments to the crowd below, or often holding the hand of one of the
                        little princesses and throwing bunches of flowers to the children in the
                        street. One group of dancing children in pleated skirts seems almost modern
                        in its realism. Very touching is one scene depicting a choir of blind men
                        performing before the king. Led by a harper and a leader who keeps time by
                        clapping his hands, these poor sightless men seem to be singing the praises
                        of the bright god of light, whose rays they cannot see. The execution of the
                        work is wonderful, considering its antiquity. In other sculptures we see the
                        king and queen driving across the plain in their chariots, preceded by
                        running footmen.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the whole of this gallery of ancient pictures we strike no sad
                        note. The shadow of death, ever present in the tombs of the Memphic and
                        Theban age, is banished ; all is love and joy and pleasure of life. The
                        period is a unique one in ancient history, and finds its modern parallel in
                        the life of the French court at <placeName>Versailles</placeName>. But the
                        life was a short one. The king died and was buried in a great tomb in the
                        hills, and there was no direct heir to the throne. During this life of
                        pleasure the affairs of State had been neglected, the great conquests in
                            <placeName>Syria</placeName> and in <placeName>Nubia</placeName> were
                        slipping from the hands of this effeminate Pharaoh, and it was not until the
                        Theban power once more regained its supremacy that
                            <placeName>Egypt</placeName> became the ruler of the ancient world.
                        Still, however, the epoch is full of matter of interest to the historian and
                        the archaeologist, and these beautiful reproductions will long form the
                        standard authority upon so interesting an episode in the ever changing
                        panorama of Egyptian history. With the fall of the heretic line the city was
                        abandoned, and the sand of the desert spread its veil over this ancient city
                        of beauty and pleasure. </p>

                        <p>To THE Editor OF THE Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                        <p>Dear Sir,—I noted the forecast you made of the new Liberal Cabinet. I am
                            glad to see by to-day's news that you are likely to be wrong.
                                <persName>Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman</persName> is keeping the men
                            of the stamp of <persName>Lord Rosebery</persName>, <persName>Sir Edward
                                Grey</persName>, <persName>Mr. Asquith</persName>, and the like out
                            of his Cabinet. The last-named is especially odious to the Labour party,
                            among whom he is known as “butcher Asquith,” and <persName>Sir
                                Henry</persName> cannot dispense with the aid of the Labour members,
                            who are likely to be more numerous in the next Parliament. It would be
                            wisest in my opinion for <persName>Sir Henry
                                Campbell-Bannerman</persName> to make a composite Cabinet of
                            Liberals—earnest and thorough, not weak-kneed like the three
                            above-named—Labour members, and a sprinkling of Irish Home Rulers. These
                            last would participate, I believe, if Irish Home Rule is placed in the
                            foremost rank in the programme. The Cabinet would then be for the first
                            time in English history one composed of all classes in the United
                            Kingdom, not limited as heretofore to one class and excluding men who
                            represent Irish ideas and sentiments. With a Cabinet like that, the new
                            Premier can face the Elections with a sure hope of an overwhelming
                            victory. He will then be able to deal boldly and fearlessly—as he
                            expressed it at Stirling—with every social problem, and if the House of
                            Lords try their tactics of obstruction they will do so at their
                            peril.—Yours truly, <persName> J. Amigo</persName>.</p>

                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                        <p>Sir,—It is sincerely to be hoped that the sensible suggestions contained
                            in <persName>Mr. Thorwald Smith</persName>’s letter in yesterday’s (
                            Thursday ) “Egyptian Gazette” will be acted up to by the proper
                            authorities, for there is no doubt that the death rate of
                                <placeName>Egypt</placeName> is largely due to these moat
                            pestiferous creatures. The success of the authorities at <placeName>New
                                Orleans</placeName> in fighting the epidemic of yellow fever now
                            prevailing in that city illustrates forcibly the old and new methods of
                            controlling this scourge. In the country we have the old-fashioned
                            "shot-gun" quarantine in full operation, but in the city the latest
                            methods of sanitary science are taught and enforced. On the former we
                            read Such reports as the following: —“The Governor has directed the
                            Commander of the State Guard to detail as many men as might be necessary
                            to act as guards on all trains entering the State and at all points
                            where boats run in order to establish a strict trade quarantine against
                            all points where yellow fever is found to exist.” It is reported that
                            the State of <placeName>Mississippi</placeName> has five armed boats
                            patrolling the coast to prevent fishermen breaking through the
                            quarantine lines, and armed guards patrol the lines of railroads
                            entering the State. On the other hand the health officer of
                                <placeName>New Orleans</placeName> has issued the following sensible
                            advice and information “The spread of yellow fever is easily controlled
                            by the application of very simple rules. Whether or not <placeName>New
                                Orleans</placeName> will be rid of yellow fever at an early date
                            depends in a very large measure on the degree of assistance each
                            householder is willing to contribute to the work of eradication. Yellow
                            fever is transmitted by the bite of a mosquito whose breeding places are
                            cisterns, water barrels, and similar collections of water. The mosquito
                            bites in the daytime usually, and in order to become infectious must
                            bite a patient daring the first three days of the fever, and then ten
                            days must elapse before it is capable of transmitting the disease.
                            Mosquitoes are not dangerous after the third day of the fever. Therefore
                            protect from mosquitoes, day and night, all cases of fever for three
                            days and then destroy before the tenth day after the beginning of the
                            illness the mosquitoes that are in the room." The mayor has issued a
                            proclamation, approved by the State Board and the United States Public
                            Health Service which requires all citizens to allow no stagnant water on
                            their premises ; to screen all cisterns after treating the surface with
                            oil; to place oil in cesspools and privy vaults ; to sleep under nets;
                            and to screen doors and windows. The Egyptian Sanitary Department ought
                            to issue similar instructions, for not one in a thousand of the people
                            know how dangerous the mosquito is to health.—I am. etc,</p>

                    <p><placeName>London</placeName>, Dec. 6.</p>
                    <p><persName>Major-General J. H. Wodehouse</persName>, C.B., C.M.G., an officer
                        who made a great name in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, commanding the Second
                        (Rawal Pindi) Division of the Northern Army, has been promoted
                        lieutenant-general ini succession to <persName>Sir W. F. Butler</persName>,
                        K.C.B, retired on retired pay. It is close on thirty-four years since this
                        distinguished officer, the son of a distinguished naval
                            officer—<persName>Admiral George Wodehouse</persName>—donned the blue
                        uniform of the Royal Regiment of Artillery. Getting his "jacket” in the
                        Royal Horse Artillery afterwards, he served with that arm in the Zu'u War of
                        1879, including the battle of Ulundi (medal with clasp). and in the Afghan
                        War of 1880 he saw further service, including the smart action of Charasiah
                        (mentioned in despatches, medal with clasp). In <persName>Sir Gerald
                            Graham</persName>’s Sudan Expedition of 1884-85 he participated in the
                        desperate hand-to-hand encounters of El Teb and Temai (mentioned in
                        despatches, brevet of major, medal with clasps and Khedive’s star), and he
                        gained further honors in the Nile Expedition of 1884-85, including the
                        struggle at Kirbekan (two clasps). Joining the army of the Khedive he did
                        good service in the operations of the Sudan Frontier Field Force from the
                        decisive action of Giniss to the engagements of Arguin, in which be defeated
                        the Emir Wad en-Nejuna, and Tuski (mentioned in despatches, C.B. clasp. 2nd
                        class Medjidieh and 2nd class Osmanieh). His last active service was in the
                        North West Frontier Campaign, when he commanded the Third Infantry Brigade,
                        a new one which bad been formed to watch the Buner border. After the
                        pacification of the Swat country, <persName>General Wodehouse</persName>
                        commanded his own brigade and <persName>Colonel Reid</persName>’s force
                        which so cleverely seized the bridge of the Pankjora in the nick of time, as
                        it was the gate of the Chitral. Unfortunately he was wounded in the attack
                        on his camp at Nawagai and had to give the command of his brigade to
                            <persName>General Graves</persName>. The greater part of the opposition,
                        however, had then been broken down, and <persName>General
                            Wodehouse</persName>'s services were recognised by a well-earned mention
                        in despatches and the usual decoration for the campaign.</p>
                    <p><persName>Captain A. J. B. Perceval</persName>, D.S.O., who is serving in the
                        Egyptian Army, will be shortly promoted major in his regiment--the
                        Northumberland Fusiliers, the old “Fighting Fifth.”</p>
                    <p><persName>Brevet-Major F. J. L. Howard</persName>, A.S.C., on return home
                        from <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, has been posted to the command of the 20
                        th Company at Alder-shot.</p>
                    <p><persName>Second Lieutenant W. R. Meredith</persName>, 2nd Battalion Royal
                        Inniskilling Fusiliers, <placeName>Cairo</placeName>, has been promoted
                        lieutenant after a little over three years' service. <persName>Second
                            Lieutenant S.S. Duffin</persName>, from the 5th Battalion Royal Irish
                        Rifles, and <persName>Second Lieutenant M. Hammond-Smith</persName>, from
                        the 6th Battalion Worcestershire Regiment, have been appointed to the
                        Inniskillings and will join the 2nd Battalion eventually.</p>
                    <p>The personnel of the Committee appointed by the War Office to inquire into
                        the whole question of employment for ex-soldiers could hardly be improved
                        on. With <persName>Sir Edward Ward</persName> as chairman, and special
                        qualifications for the work in hand attaching to each of the six members,
                            <persName>Mr. Arnold-Forster</persName> has done all he can to ensure a
                        more or less successful outcome. The committee will have to take great care,
                        nevertheless, to avoid the crippling of any unofficial voluntary
                        organisations already engaged in the same labour. Among the terms of
                        reference is included one empowering the Committee, should they see fit, to
                        recommend the co-ordination of these organisations in one council, “under
                        official auspices.” In itself, the proposal has an innocuous appearance, but
                        the public would greatly prefer, we feel assured, to eliminate even the
                        possibility of the various private societies being subjected to War Office
                        control. There should be no occasion, moreover, for that interference ; the
                        State has its own sphere of co operation so clearly marked out as to prevent
                        any overlapping. In the last annual report on recruiting it was stated that
                        out of 25,498 ex-soldiers who had passed into civilian life, 21,815 had
                        secured some sort of employment, whether permanent or temporary. That seems
                        to show a fairly satisfactory condition of affairs, but we strongly suspect
                        that the State took very little part in helping the movement. Except in the
                        Post Office, there still exists a most lamentable departmental disposition
                        to fill the lower grades with voting men who have shirked that primary duty
                        of good citizen ship the qualifying themselves to take personal part in the
                        defence of the kingdom. We trust that the committee will speak out very
                        plainly on that point.</p>
                    <p>The Drake, flagship of <persName>H. S. H. Prince Louis</persName> of
                        Battenberg, commanding the Second Cruiser Squadron, has again asserted her
                        claim to be the fastest cruiser afloat. In her recent run from Sandy Hook to
                        "Gib” she covered the trip in 7 days, 7 hours and 10 minutes. The run was
                        made at an average speed of 18. knots per hour. The voyage was never made
                        previously by any warship in that time. The propellors, which give the Drake
                        such speed, are likened to bent pennies. They have been applied to other
                        cruisers but with less success.</p>
                    <p>In the near future the German naval superiority to France will become
                        conspicuous unless a special effort at once be made to counteract the
                        activity in German dockyards. It is interesting to note that the world at
                        large and <placeName>England</placeName> in particular cannot be indifferent
                        to any marked decline in the relative strength of the French navy. The
                        present friendly relations between <placeName>France</placeName> and
                            <placeName>England</placeName> only slightly affect the question. All
                        such pleasant relations are liable to change but the maintenance of the
                        balance of sea power affords some guarantee of the European peace.</p>

                        <head>SPORTING CLUB v. E.T.C.</head>
                        <p>This match was played on Saturday last before a good turn-out of
                            spectators, who witnessed a fast and interesting game. Early in the
                            first half the Sporting Club were awarded a penalty-kick which the
                            offence hardly justified, and Crosier, who took the kick, made no
                            mi-take. Spurred by this reverie the E.T.C. made several good runs and
                            Henley cent in a couple of hot shots which were well cleared. Keeping up
                            the pressure, a nice combined movement gave
                                <persName>Willmott</persName> an opportunity, but his shot—a
                            terrific one—hit the bar. As it rebounded, however,
                                <persName>Byrne</persName> netted, thus equalising. But for
                            magnificent saving on the part of the club's' custodian the E.T.C must
                            have crossed over with a good lead. He dealt with some very nasty shots
                            in a masterly manner. In the second half the dub had more of the play,
                                <persName>Carver</persName> and <persName>Macaulay</persName> on the
                            left and <persName>Barnard</persName> on the right putting in some good
                            work, but the ET.C. defence proved equal to all demands,
                                <persName>Lees</persName> and <persName>G. McLean</persName> keeping
                            the opposition at a respectful distance from
                            <persName>Dawson</persName>. <persName>Carver</persName> occupied quite
                            a new position at outside left and gave <persName>Townsend</persName>
                            plenty to occupy him. <persName>Barnard</persName> on the other side was
                            giving <persName>Collier</persName> something to think about and the two
                            had several interesting tussles. A great thorn in the side of the E.T.C.
                            offence was <persName>Mustard</persName>, whose tackling and kicking
                            were excellent. Nothing more was scored and a pleasant game ended in a
                            draw of one goal each.</p>

                    <p>Cotons.—La fermeté s'était accentuée, mais sur l'avant bourse de Liverpool,
                        le marché a commencé à se calmer de nouveau et la finale a été une cloture
                        faible et en sensible réaction. Le courant d'affaires a été pourtant assez
                        satisfaisant ce matin.</p>
                    <p>Graines de coton.—La demande a fait presque défaut et comme conséquence, les
                        transactions sont restées insignifiantes, avec des cours quelque peu en
                        baisse.</p>

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS.</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe. This
                        depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in January
                        may be a little warmer than Riviera, and possibly not so warm as Sicily, but
                        in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm than many
                        other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in the year,
                        for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to
                        go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily. Some will want to take into consideration
                        the number of days to be spent at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list
                        showing the time occupied on each of the various routes between Egypt and
                        the Continent of Europe. </p>

                        London or Liverpool--occupy about 14 days. The short ones are as follows
                        :--</p>
                    <p>Port Said or Alexandria to Brindisi : 3 days</p>
                    <p>Alexandria to Messina : 3 days</p>
                    <p>Port Said or Alexandria to Marseilles : 5 days</p>
                    <p>Alexandria to Venice and Trieste : 4 days</p>
                    <p>Alexandria to Naples : 3 days</p>
                    <p>Port Said to Genoa : 5 days</p>
                    <p>Port Said to Naples : 4 days</p>
                    <p>Alexandria to Constantinople : 4 days</p>
                    <p>Alexandria to Piraeus : 2 days</p>
                    <p>Port Said to Gibraltar : 7 days</p>
                    <p>The steamers, of the P. and O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageries
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg</p>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P. and O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste-Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves Port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian mails from
                        the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry boats," having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMINA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour.In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain - his
                        tomb is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO,
                        with about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of S. Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque
                        cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal
                        Park are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay--Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cogwheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made, in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient halfway
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature--warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,

                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>

                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage, or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other seaport.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going nothwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot ; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two and three quarter hours.</p>

                    <head>SWITZERLAND.</head>
                    <p>Switzerland, the heart of Europe, has been described as "A cluster of
                        delights and grandeurs."</p>
                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one and a half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M. de Caprino and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town, situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate, and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and "The Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>
                    <p>LUCERNE--A striking picture on the Lake of Lucerne facing the Rigi and
                        Pilatus and the snow-clad Alps.</p>
                    <p>In and around the town the walks are charming, and the excursions to be made
                        from Lucerne by boat, rail, etc. are very numerous.</p>
                    <p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful excursions, those to the Rigi,
                        Pilatus, Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other
                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of
                        Lucerne, commands magnificent views of lake and mountain scenery. Along the
                        Lake of Uri from Brunnen to Fluelen runs the famous Axentrasse.</p>
                    <p>A delightful excursion from Lucerne is that to ENGELBERG. Take boat to
                        Stansstad and from Stansstad it is about 1 hour and 40 min. by Electric
                        Railway, with delightful scenery en route. The ascent of Titlis, is made
                        from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps is grand ; extending from
                        Monte Rosa to the Black Forest, and from the Santis to the Matterhosn.</p>

                        centre for making excursions in the Oberland, abounding in fine walks and
                        views. There is a magnificent view of the Jungfrau from the Hoheweg, a fine
                        avenue of walnut trees the chief resort of visitors. Interlaken is also not
                        far from the famous waterfalls, Giessbach, Trummelbach, and Staubbach. Then
                        also the glaciers of the Grindelwald and view from Murren and the Schynige
                        Platte are sights not to be missed.</p>

                        from Alexandria ; the climate in April is charming. The best steamers are
                        those of he Khedivial Mail Co. and the Russian Steam Navigation Co.</p>
                    <p>If possible tourists should arrange to be in Athens for the Orthodox Easter
                        in order to witness the Good Friday and Easter Eve ceremonies, and to be
                        present at the dancing on the Easter Tuesday festival held at Megara for
                        which a special train is run from Athens.</p>
                    <p>It is worth while to spend a few days in CORFU on account of the beauty of
                        the scenery. There is also good snipe and quail shooting to be had.</p>
