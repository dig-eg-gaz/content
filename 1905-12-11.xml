                    <p>London, December 9.</p>
                    <p>Speaking at Oxford, Mr. Chamberlain said that nothing has taken place which in any way affects his personal relations and political connection with Mr. Balfour. He remarked that though the name of Home  Rule has been abandoned, the policy still remains the sarne, and that Home Role would be granted by instalments on the hire system. He strongly advised fiscal reform based on the imperialist view, aiming at the inclusion of the colonies in a single confederation, all the members of which would mutually support each other.</p> <p>(Reuter)</p>

                    <head>KHEDIVIAL OPERA HOUSE.</head>
                    <p>The Cairo theatre season opened at the Khedivial Opera House on Thursday with Pailleron's La Souris. It is, of course, early to pronounce on the merits of the company, but the repertoire promises well enough. La Souris, witty and clever, as is all Pailleron's work, was certainly an excellent beginning, and quite well interpreted. Mme Moreno, who has visited us again this year, was as welcome as ever, and deserved the applause she received : she had, naturally, the hardest part, supporting that side of the play which verges on the tragic ; and while her acting was most quiet and convincing, her voice and diction were a delight--a relief, we must confess, to the somewhat tapid and at times overload speech of her colleagues. The play is perhaps too natural in its reproduction on the stage of what all would understand from experience. M. Monteux was certainly good as Max. But judgment will be an easier matter after some more performances have been given. So far all seems well enough. Mme Moreno, at the conclusion of the play, recited ''Les trois Hussards, as well as the "Adieu Suzon" of Musset. In both her charm of diction and expression was shown to its full, and we may well look forward to and enjoy her appearance in sub-sequent plays.</p>
                    <p>L'Ami Friz and Le Passant were given on Friday. L'Ami Fritz is a comic opera pure and simple--without the music, as idyllic as can be, plenty of eating and drinking, pretty maidens, housekeepers, old and tried, marriage at the end, a relief in every way to the writer's other works : here was no snow, hunger, enemies, the trouble and endurance of war. It was very nicely staged and played, and such little subtleties of acting as appeared (shared by Fritz himself and his old Rabbi Councillor) were quite well brought out. The whole play has somehow a Teutonic flavour; it reminds one of the Verkaufte Braut (not that that is strictly speaking Teutonic) and other such ; and it is perhaps as good praise as need be to say that the actors all adapted themselves to it.</p>
                    <p>The short piece that followed--Le Passant of Francois Coppée--was in every way different, in its exquisite verse and dreamy Italian 'décor' : the diction and charm of voice of the two protagonists--rather the two performers--rendered the whole a gem. Mme Moréno we knew, but her companion Mlle Franquet fully kept up the harmony, and she has not perhaps the variety and clarity of tone which signalises Mme Moreno, but she has a most musical voice, and almost all through she avoids convention.</p>
                    <p>The staging was in every way admirable ; even Antoine himself might have approved it.</p>

                    <head>RIOT At ALEXANDRIA</head>
                    <head>POPULAR EXCITEMENT.</head>
                    <p>Alexandria was the scene of a somewhat serious disturbance yesterday afternoon,which, coming upon the rumours prevalent daring the past ten days, led to an extraordinary state of alarm and excitement among all classes of the population. There are various rumours as to the origin of the disturbance, but it appears that two Greeks were playing cards in a coffee-house at about 3.30 pm. in the rue de Malte,.which unites Sisters-Street with Anastasi street. They quarrelled during the game and one of the players drew his revolver and discharged its contents at his compatriot The man who was aimed at dodged,and the contents of one of the chambers of the revolver lodged in the body of an Arab, who happened to be near by, and who fell to the ground.</p>
                    <p>The Arabs in the neighborhood at once rushed on the Greek, who fled to a tobacconist's  shop, belonging to a Greek of the name of Vounapartopoulo, which was besieged and wrecked by the infuriated mob.</p>
                    <p>Fortunately the police came to the rescue of the Greeks,and with great difficulty and by the help of their bayonets succeeded in getting them to the Menshieh caracol.</p>
                    <p>TheHamamil quarter, where the disturbance broke out, is inhabited, in large part, by the lowest class of Europeans and natives. The former became panic-stricken and began to fire in the air from the roofs of the houses, which needlessly excited tbe natives. While this was going on in the Hamamil, huge crowds of Arabs came into the Mohamed Aly square, Saint Catherine's-square, Sister-Street, and all the neighboaring quarters. Many Europeans were attacked in the streets and the trams. The mob in the Mohamad Aly-square was more rowdy than vicious, and was composed of a number of youths. But the trouble in the Hamamil  quarter and Anastasi-street was more serious. The mob smashed the" chairs and tables in the open-air cafes in the square, while the masons at work on the large block now being built in the Post Office street began to hurl stones and building material on the people below. The mob obtained weapons by using the legs of the tables and chairs of the cafes aod battered any Europeans they came across.</p>
                    <p>The panic among the Europeans in the Square and its immediate neighbourhood was very great. A large number fled for refuge to Saint Catherine's Cathedral,and fainting women were borne to the Mixed Tribunals, where a number of Europeans were accommodated daring the disturbance. The guardian of the Tribunal disarmed a large number of the rioters.</p>
                    <p>We regret to state that among the victims of the mob's fury was Mr. Marsden, the sub manager of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank at Alexandria, whose ear was slit, but who was not dangerously wounded. Among other Europeans attacked was the  cashier of Messrs. Walker and Meimarachi. He was walking down Saint Mark's-street at the time, when a score of Arabs, armed with nabouts, rushed after him, crying "Death to the Christian" He was rescued in the nick of time by the bowab of Saint Mark's Building, who pushed him into the passage of the building.</p>
                    <p>One of our reporters, who was on the spot when the disturbance broke out, was attacked by the mob in Anastasi street, and he declares that the attitude of the mob in the Hamamil was very threatening. H.E. Mahmoud Pasha-Sidky, Governor of Alexandria, Miralai Hop-kinson Bey, Commandant of the Alexandria City Police, Bimbashi Cobbe, Sub-Commandant, and a number of mounted police hastened to the scene of the disturbance. The most effective means employed for calming the overheated passions of the populace were the hoses of the Alexandria. Fire Brigade, which played water upon the crowd with great force and succeeded in dispersing the mob in all directions.</p>
                    <p>The excitement spread from the square to other parts of the town and in the Attarin quarter hundreds of Berberin vagabonds rushed through the streets with nabouts.</p>
                    <p>Quiet was restored at about 5.30 o'clock, and the Mohamed Aly square presented its usual aspect in the evening. Most of the chairs and tables belonging to the coffeehouses that had been destroyed were removed and the damage visible was mainly limited to a little bro ken plate glass. The black marble plate of the Cassa di Soonta e di Risparmio was smashed to pieces, but on the whole little damage was done, for fortunately, being Sunday afternoon, the shops had their shutters up. The streets generally were very deserted during the evening, the number of persons about being few.</p>
                    <p>The Cafe de France in the Grand Square was attacked and greatly suffered at the hands of the mob. In Anastasi-street much glass and many lamps were smashed.</p>
                    <p>During the past few days the garrison at Fort Kom el-Dik had been reinforced, but for some unknown reason the fort was depleted of its additional troops on Saturday. Yesterday the fort's garrison was again reinforced.</p>
                    <p>The water supply of the city was to have been completely cut off by the Alexandria Water Company at 8.30 o'clook last night, but owing to the urgent representations of the Governor of Alexandria and the Commandant of Police it was decided to leave the water supply on in case any fires broke out, or it was found necessary again to use the hose on the populace.</p>
                    <p>About 250 members of the Alexandria City Polioe were employed in quelling the rioting, and they effected the arrest of 160 natives. Most conflicting accounts are given as to the
                        attitude of the police during the riot. It is stated that the police did not show any real determination at the beginning of the trouble, and only began to exert themselves when the chief officers arrived. An eye-witness says:-- I was in my house in Anastasi-street yesterday when I saw two policemen taking a European away. The police were followed by two other officers with drawn swords. The European was not protected in front by the police and the natives threw stones at him and hit his face with sticks until it was a bleeding indisting-uishable mass of flesh. Another European was brought along by the police and treated in the same way by the populace.</p>
                    <p>THE SCENE IN THE SQUARE.</p>
                    <p>"An Eye-witness" writes:--I witnessed from the upper story of a house on the square the disturbance which took place there this afternoon, and it may interest you to know what I saw. I may preface- my remarks by saying that, near the same spot, I'saw the massacre in June, 1882. I was also in Turkey during the massacres in 1896. I do not therefore think that I am likely, to be unduly impressed by what I saw to-day. I was reading in my room when, abont a quarter past four o'clock, I beard an unusual noise in the street. Thinking -that a serious accident had happened, I went to the windows of my rooms and, to my great surprise, I saw a great crowd of persons, both natives and Europeans, rushing frantioally in all directions, as' though they were being panned. I remarked that many of the Arabs were carrying rough pieces of wood in their hands, sufficiently large to inflict an ugly wound, if used as a weapon; other Arabs were busy trying to break up chairs which evidently ban been stolen from a cafe near. The object of breaking up the chairs was evidently to provide a supply of bludgeons. Some of the Arabs broke the chairs by striking them against the stone roadway; others placed chairs before the passing trams, possibly with the idea of stopping tbe trams. In any case, it was evident they meant mischief. The spectacle was identical with that which I saw in 1882 and, as there was an ugly crowd of some thousands of persons at the, bottom of the Place, with which the police was evidently unable to cope, tbe situation seemed a serions one. This crowd appeared to be one solid compact mass, and it was only after the arrival	of the fire engines
                        that it was, dispersed into the side streets and shortly after quiet was restored. I should say that the mob was not organised, but it was evident that a row of some sort was looked for, as I remarked that, as was the case in 1882, the Berberin were much in evidence, some came on foot, in groups of three or four, others by the trams. They ware evidently on the qui vive. Now we shall possibly be told, by those who are responsible for the maintenance of order in this city, 'that the gamins and shoeblacks were only having a big lark ; that the whole thing was in itself unimportant, and that those who took the thing seriously are poor timid creatures who are easily alarmed.
                        I am not easily alarmed and my longexp-rienoe of the elements composing the population of this city warrants me in saying that a vary grave danger existed and still exists. It is notorious that, for weeks past, both Christians and natives have been busily occupied in pro-ouring arms. No one seems exactly to know why, but natives and Christians alike are nervously awaiting for something to happen. This in itself is a danger and some mens should be taken to demonstrate that the responsible European authorities,for they alone\ can be relied on, dispose of the means necessary to maintain order. It proof ware wanting of the utter uselessness in case of emergency of the police, as it is at present organised, this shoe-black demonstration gave it Their efforts (?) to restore order were absolutely grotesque, so far as I saw. A set of special c onstates would have known better what to do.1 Many were the enquiries as to the whereabouts , of the armée d'occupation. Some said it would only appear if there was shooting to be done, others said that t he authorities were afraid to send troops into the town lest people should get alarmed and visitors he deterred from coming to Egypt All were agreed that it was better to be even more alarmed than they already were than risk a broken bead. Seriously, it is time that some energetic measures were taken to reassure the public, which possibly, though I dont think so, may be needlessly alarmed.</p>

                    <head>ON THE BOURSE.</head>
                    <p>This morning some timorous brokers sent off telegrams to London stating that a riot had taken place and that all settlements were to be kept in suspense until the situation was clear. Some prominent Alexandria stock brokers, on hearing of this, at once telegraphed to the London Stock Exchange Committee to the effect that everything was calm and that that settlements were going on as usual. This had a quieting effect and the market has been very firm all round a large number of transactions taking place.</p>
                    <p>At the time of the disturbances, about 5.30 o'clock, when the police had cleared the people from the Frank-street end of Mohamed Aly-square the backwash of the rioters (e.g., bootblacks and other rowdy youths) were driven by the mounted polioe towards Cherif Pasha-street. There was a large crowd, standing anxiously watching the scene from the peristyle  of the Bourse. When the rabble came up to the neighbourhood of tbe Bourse all these spectators of the fray, huddled up together, seized chairs, decanters aod glasses and with shouts of determination decided to sell their lives dearly. Ore prominent-brokerstanding  there boldly exclaimed "Defendiamooi fino al l'ultimo." He then brandished a chair over his head and retired into the interior of the Bonne. His comrades remained on the peristyle  but none of them were hurt as none of the rioters ever got rear them.</p>

                    <head>THE SUCRERIES</head>
                    <head>SETTLEMENT PENDING.</head>
                    <p>We understand that a conclusion of the negotiations  as to a settlement equitable alike to the creditors end bondholders has almost been reached, and that definite news may be expected et any moment.</p>
                    <p>The fourth meeting of the creditors of the Sucreries took place on Saturday afternoon under the presidency of Judge Took. Proceedings opened shortly after 3 p.m., when the judge asked Ma Carton de Wiart whether he was able to put any definite proposals before the meeting. Me. Carton de Wiart replied (that be was still unable to do so, but that the negotiations were nearing a settlement. In reply to another question on the part of the President, he stated that proposals now being considered differed from those previously made in that the bondholders, instead of receiving a fixed interest, would be paid a reduced interest guaranteed by a syndicate but would retain their previous position as bondholders. The pourparlers were going steadily forward and there was a possibility that holders of obligations would be repaid at par or 25% premium. He therefore asked for a week's postponement.</p> <p>The President replied that since the 19th September matters had remained in stats quo and he would therefore grant not a week but a fortnight--for positively the last time--but if matters should then have made no progress the situation of the Sucreries would have to be put before the Courts.</p>
                    <p>Me. Carton de Wiart expressed his readiness to satisfy the President, end then came another development M. Dienzeda, a workman under the company, who had been injured in an accident, had been a year in the French hospital and had never seen his pay since December 5, 1904. Me. Martino spoke on his behalf and touched on the Cronier bills, asking whether the bills had been given to cover the current accounts that M. Cronier may have had in different banks, whether those produced were renewals or had they been regularly discounted since the date of their endorsement, and in that case what was the rate of discount?</p>
                    <p>Me. Carton de Wiart replied that the causes of M. Drenzede's accident were uncertain; as far as his pay went the company was ready-to pay after verification of the claim Me. Padoa Bey remarked that the Martino clients had no right re intervene for the discussion of the validity of the claims put in by the creditors : which led the President to observe that creditors and shareholders were alike interested in bills representing 20,000,COO frs.</p> <p>More explanations and discussions followed. The Oases of M. Dienzde and of M. Mariotti, an employe in a like condition, were to go before the  competent court, so Judge Jack decided, and after Professor Sampaolo had handed into Court a number of verifications, proceedings closed till the next and positively the last meeting.</p>

                    <head>RUINS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN CITY.</head>
                    <head>EXCAVATIONS HAVE MADE POSSIBLE AN ACCURATE PICTURE of El Amarna.</head>
                    <head>HISTORY OF ITS FOUNDING</head>
                    <p>Twelve years ago, on a lovely spring morning, I was walking along the east bank of the Nile, near to the village of Hadji Qandil some 180 miles above Cairo. The land around was a wide amphitheatre of sand some twelve miles across, shut in by the Arabian hills, and almost, except near the river, an arid expanse of sand. There was an awakening of life ; pigeons rose from the beanfields in hundreds and a belated gazelle stole up from the watering place and made swiftly for the hills. Lumbering buffaloes were being fastened to the water wheels, and the women were around the wells. Away from the river all was still and silent. Once, however, that sandy plain was all alive with busy men and women. Where low heaps of sand break the monotony of the plain there once stood a splendid temple and a royal palace, while the houses of priests and officials, together with shops and bazaars, formed a busy city. Though little remains of this once beautiful place there are, fortunately, preserved monuments by which we are enabled to reconstruct the town and the life of the king and its people in a wonderful manner. The Arabian hills form the wall of this circus, and the sides of these are the site of many splendid tombs of the city officials. It is no ordinary city we have to deal with ; unique in its origin, history and religion. It forms the record of a remarkable episode in Oriental history and the memorial of the dominant will and power of one of the most astonishing women of the East.</p>
                    <p>ORIGIN OF THE CITY.</p>
                    <p>The recovery and publication of the material from which to restore the picture is due to the work of Mr. N. de G. Davies, who has for many months been engaged in copying the sculptures and inscriptions in these great tombs, which have now been published by the Egypt Exploration Fund. Before describing these splendid sculptures a word must be said as to the origin of this city. Amenophis III. (B. C. 1500) had during his reign married a member of Asiatic wives, among them being Tii, apparently a princess of Mitanni or northern Mesopotamia.</p>
                    <p>The foreign element in the Theban royal harem became so powerful that a religious revolution broke out, and an attempt, for a time successful, was made to replace the great worship of Amen Ra, king of the gods, by that of the Aten, or “Solar Disk.’’ For a time only was it powerful in Thebes, and on the accession of the youthful ruler Amenophis IV , who was rigidly under the control of his imperious mother, the position became so serious that the king and court removed from Thebes to a new city which was built upon this plain of El Amarna. The idea of this abandonment of the southern capital originated with the queen mother, and that she took an active part in the work is shown by her name being inscribed, with all her titles, upon the central pillar of the great quarry from which the stone for the royal and sacred edifices was obtained.</p>
                    <p>The priest of the tombs was that Mery-Ra who was the high priest of the Atendisk in the city of Akh Aten, ''The glory of the disk.” He was also “fan bearer on the king’s right hand," “royal chancellor,’’ “A sole companion or privy councillor.” On entering the stately portion of the tomb and passing into the columned entrance hall, we see at once we have a quite different class of burial place to those which are found near Thebes. The tombs of Mery R of Paneshey are, we find on entering, veritable rock-cut mansions consisting of several stately halls and chambers. Still more marked is the difference in the lavish mural decorations. The walls are not covered with weird scenes from the Books of the Dead or the underworld, nor do they depict scenes in the domestic life of the departed. Each tomb, from its decorations might be a royal tomb. The king and his family dominate everything. As Mr. Davies remarks : "His wife and children, his family affection, are here portrayed in detail,” and it is difficult to discover the official whose tomb it is.</p>
                    <p>In the tomb of Mery-Ra we have a picture of the house where the king visits him, and it must have been a beautiful abode. Before the entrance was a large tank, surrounded by trees. There are many courts and cool colonnades, while a picturesque garden full of flowers and shady trees, and another large tank, beside which the owner and his family might enjoy the pleasures of home life in the evenings. In the tomb of Paneshi we have a representation of the temple of the Aten, and full details of the service. It differs from the Theban temple in many respects.</p>
                    <p>THE ROYAL FAMILY.</p>
                    <p>The offerings were fruit and flowers ; oxen were led to the temple wreathed and decorated with flowers, and the king and the queen and the young princesses came to worship, bringing offerings of flowers, incense and sweet smelling gums. Indeed, it is remarkable how great a part the beauties of nature form in the temple service. The most striking feature, however of these tableaux is the freedom of life, and the way in which the royal family mingled with the people. Seated on the balcony of the palace we see the king with his arm round the neck of the queen throwing down presents of collars and ornaments to the crowd below, or often holding the hand of one of the little princesses and throwing bunches of flowers to the children in the street. One group of dancing children in pleated skirts seems almost modern in its realism.
                        Very touching is one scene depicting a choir of blind men performing before the king. Led by a harper and a leader who keeps time by clapping his hands, these poor sightless men seem to be singing the praises of the bright god of light, whose rays they cannot see. The execution of the work is wonderful, considering its antiquity. In other sculptures we see the king and queen driving across the plain in their chariots, preceded by running footmen.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the whole of this gallery of ancient pictures we strike no sad note. The shadow of death, ever present in the tombs of the Memphic and Theban age, is banished ; all is love and joy and pleasure of life. The period is a unique one in ancient history, and finds its modern parallel in the life of the French court at Versailles. But the life was a short one. The king died and was buried in a great tomb in the hills, and there was no direct heir to the throne. During this life of pleasure the affairs of State had been neglected, the great conquests in Syria and in Nubia were slipping from the hands of this effeminate Pharaoh, and it was not until the Theban power once more regained its supremacy that Egypt became the ruler of the ancient world. Still, however, the epoch is full of matter  of interest to the historian and the archaeologist, and these beautiful reproductions will long form the standard authority upon so interesting an episode in the ever changing panorama of Egyptian history. With the fall of the heretic line the city was abandoned, and the sand of the desert spread its veil over this ancient city of beauty and pleasure.	</p>

                        <p>To THE Editor OF THE Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                        <p>Dear Sir,—I noted the forecast you made of the new Liberal Cabinet. I am glad to see by to-day's news that you are likely to be wrong. Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman is keeping the men of the stamp of Lord Rosebery, Sir Edward Grey, Mr. Asquith, and the like out of his Cabinet. The last-named is especially odious to the Labour party, among whom he is known as “butcher Asquith,” and Sir Henry cannot dispense with the aid of the Labour members, who are likely to be more numerous in the next Parliament. It would be wisest in my opinion for Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman to make a composite Cabinet of Liberals—earnest and thorough, not weak-kneed like the three above-named—Labour members, and a sprinkling of Irish Home Rulers. These last would participate, I believe, if Irish Home Rule is placed in the foremost rank in the programme. The Cabinet would then be for the first time in English history one composed of all classes in the United Kingdom, not limited as heretofore to one class and excluding men who represent Irish ideas and sentiments. With a Cabinet like that, the new Premier can face the Elections with a sure hope of an overwhelming victory. He will then be able to deal boldly and fearlessly—as he expressed it at Stirling—with every social problem, and if the House of Lords try their tactics of obstruction they will do so at their peril.—Yours truly, 	J. Amigo.</p>

                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                    <p>Sir,—It is sincerely to be hoped that the sensible suggestions contained in Mr. Thorwald Smith’s letter in yesterday’s ( Thursday ) “Egyptian Gazette” will be acted up to by the proper authorities, for there is no doubt that the death rate of Egypt is largely due to these moat pestiferous creatures. The success of the authorities at New Orleans in fighting the epidemic of yellow fever now prevailing in that city illustrates forcibly the old and new methods of controlling this scourge. In the country we have the old-fashioned "shot-gun" quarantine in full operation, but in the city the latest methods of sanitary science are taught and enforced. On the former we read Such reports as the following: —“The Governor has directed the Commander of the State Guard to detail as many men as might be necessary to act as guards on all trains entering the State and at all points where boats run in order to establish a strict trade quarantine against all points where yellow fever is found to exist.” It is reported that the State of Mississippi has five armed boats patrolling the coast to prevent fishermen breaking through the quarantine lines, and armed guards patrol the lines of railroads entering the State. On the other hand the health officer of New Orleans has issued the following sensible advice and information “The spread of yellow fever is easily controlled by the application of very simple rules. Whether or not New Orleans will be rid of yellow fever at an early date depends in a very large measure on the degree of assistance each householder is willing to contribute to the work of eradication. Yellow fever is transmitted by the bite of a mosquito whose breeding places are cisterns, water barrels, and similar collections of water. The mosquito bites in the daytime usually, and in order to become infectious must bite a patient daring the first three days of the fever, and then ten days must elapse before it is capable of transmitting the disease. Mosquitoes are not dangerous after the third day of the fever. Therefore protect from mosquitoes, day and night, all cases of fever for three days and then destroy before the tenth day after the beginning of the illness the mosquitoes that are in the room." The mayor has issued a proclamation, approved by the State Board and the United States Public Health Service which requires all citizens to allow no stagnant water on their premises ; to screen all cisterns after treating the surface with oil; to place oil in cesspools and privy vaults ; to sleep under nets; and to screen doors and windows. The Egyptian Sanitary Department ought to issue similar instructions, for not one in a thousand of the people know how dangerous the mosquito is to health.—I am. etc,</p>

                    <p>London, Dec. 6.</p>
                    <p>Major-General J. H. Wodehouse, C.B., C.M.G., an officer who made a great name in Egypt, commanding the Second (Rawal Pindi) Division of the Northern Army, has been promoted lieutenant-general ini succession to Sir W. F. Butler, K.C.B, retired on retired pay. It is close on thirty-four years since this distinguished officer, the son of a distinguished naval officer—Admiral George Wodehouse—donned the blue uniform of the Royal Regiment of Artillery. Getting his "jacket” in the Royal Horse Artillery afterwards, he served with that arm in the Zu'u War of 1879, including the battle of Ulundi (medal with clasp). and in the Afghan War of 1880 he saw further service, including the smart action of Charasiah (mentioned in despatches, medal with clasp). In Sir Gerald Graham’s Sudan Expedition of  1884-85 he participated in the desperate hand-to-hand encounters of El Teb and Temai (mentioned in despatches, brevet of major, medal with clasps and Khedive’s star), and he gained further honors in the Nile Expedition of 1884-85, including the struggle at Kirbekan (two clasps). Joining the army of the Khedive he did good service in the operations of the Sudan Frontier Field Force from the decisive action of Giniss to the engagements of Arguin, in which be defeated the Emir Wad en-Nejuna, and Tuski (mentioned in despatches, C.B. clasp. 2nd class Medjidieh and 2nd class Osmanieh). His last active service was in the North West Frontier Campaign, when he commanded the Third Infantry Brigade, a new one which bad been formed to watch the Buner border. After the pacification of the Swat country, General Wodehouse commanded his own brigade and Colonel Reid’s force which so cleverely seized the bridge of the Pankjora in the nick of time,
                        as it was the gate of the Chitral. Unfortunately  he was wounded in the attack on his camp at Nawagai and had to give the command of his brigade to General Graves. The greater part of the opposition, however, had then been broken down, and General Wodehouse's services were recognised by a well-earned mention in despatches and the usual decoration for the campaign.</p>
                    <p>Captain A. J. B. Perceval, D.S.O., who is  serving in the Egyptian Army, will be shortly promoted major in his regiment--the Northumberland Fusiliers, the old “Fighting Fifth.”</p>
                    <p>Brevet-Major F. J. L. Howard, A.S.C., on return home from Egypt, has been posted to the command of the 20 th Company at Alder-shot.</p>
                    <p>Second Lieutenant W. R. Meredith, 2nd Battalion Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, Cairo, has been promoted lieutenant after a little over three years' service. Second Lieutenant S.S. Duffin, from the 5th Battalion Royal Irish Rifles, and Second Lieutenant M. Hammond-Smith, from the 6th Battalion Worcestershire Regiment, have been appointed to the Inniskillings and will join the 2nd Battalion eventually.</p>
                    <p>The personnel of the Committee appointed by the War Office to inquire into the whole question of employment for ex-soldiers could hardly be improved on. With Sir Edward Ward as chairman, and special qualifications  for the work in hand attaching to each of the six members, Mr. Arnold-Forster has done all he can to ensure a more or less successful outcome. The committee will have to take great care, nevertheless, to avoid the crippling of any unofficial voluntary organisations already engaged in the same labour. Among the terms of reference is included one empowering the Committee, should they see fit, to recommend the co-ordination of these organisations in one council, “under official auspices.” In itself, the proposal has an innocuous appearance, but the public would greatly prefer, we feel assured, to eliminate even the possibility of the various private societies being subjected to War Office control. There should be no occasion, moreover, for that interference ; the State has its own sphere of co operation so clearly marked out as to prevent any overlapping. In the last annual report on recruiting it was stated that out of 25,498 ex-soldiers who had passed into civilian life, 21,815 had secured some sort of employment, whether permanent or temporary. That seems to show a fairly satisfactory condition of affairs, but we strongly suspect that the State took very little part in helping the movement. Except in the Post Office, there still exists a most lamentable departmental disposition to fill the lower grades with voting men who have shirked that primary duty of good citizen ship the qualifying themselves to take personal part in the defence of the kingdom. We trust that the committee will speak out very plainly on that point.</p>
                    <p>The Drake, flagship of H. S. H. Prince Louis of Battenberg, commanding the Second Cruiser Squadron, has again asserted her claim to be the fastest cruiser afloat. In her recent run from Sandy Hook to "Gib” she covered the trip in 7 days, 7 hours and 10 minutes. The run was made at an average speed of 18. knots per hour. The voyage was never made previously by any warship in that time. The propellors, which give the Drake such speed, are likened to bent pennies. They have been applied to other cruisers but with less success.</p>
                    <p>In the near future the German naval superiority to France will become conspicuous unless a special effort at once be made to counteract the activity in German dockyards. It is interesting to note that the world at large and England in particular cannot be indifferent to any marked decline in the relative strength of the French navy. The present friendly relations between France and England only slightly affect the question. All such pleasant relations are liable to change but the maintenance of the balance of sea power affords some guarantee of the European peace.</p>

                    <p>SPORTING CLUB v. E.T.C.</p>
                    <p>This match was played on Saturday last before a good turn-out of spectators, who witnessed a fast and interesting game. Early in the first half  the Sporting Club were awarded a penalty-kick which the offence hardly justified, and Crosier, who took the kick, made no mi-take. Spurred by this reverie the E.T.C. made several good runs and Henley cent in a couple of hot shots which were well cleared. Keeping up the pressure, a nice combined movement gave Willmott an opportunity, but his shot—a terrific one—hit the bar. As it rebounded, however, Byrne netted, thus equalising. But for magnificent saving on the part of the club's' custodian the E.T.C must have crossed over with a good lead. He dealt with some very nasty shots in a masterly manner. In the second half the dub had more of the play, Carver and Macaulay on the left and Barnard on the right putting in some good work, but the ET.C. defence proved equal to all demands, Lees and G. McLean keeping the opposition at a respectful distance from Dawson. Carver occupied quite a new position at outside left and gave Townsend plenty to occupy him. Barnard on the other side was giving Collier something to think about and the two had several interesting tussles. A great thorn in the side of the E.T.C. offence was Mustard, whose tackling and kicking were excellent. Nothing more was scored and a pleasant game ended in a draw of one goal each.</p>
                    <p>Next Saturday the Sporting Club entertain St. Andrew’s at Ibrahimieh.</p>

    <p>Cotons.—La fermeté s'était accentuée, mais sur l'avant bourse de Liverpool, le marché a commencé à se calmer de nouveau et la finale a été une cloture faible et en sensible réaction. Le courant d'affaires a été pourtant assez satisfaisant ce matin.</p>
    <p>Graines de coton.—La demande a fait presque défaut et comme conséquence, les transactions sont restées insignifiantes, avec des cours quelque peu en baisse.</p>
    <p>Fèves.—Toujours nullité complète.</p>

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS.</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them are fraught with difficulty.
                        In choosing the route home there are several things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe. This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in January may be a little warmer than Riviera, and possibly not so warm as Sicily, 
                        but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily. Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list
                        showing the time occupied on each of the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe. </p>
                    <p>They are as follows:--</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes--from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southampton, London or Liverpool--occupy about 14 days. The short ones are as follows :--</p>
                    <p>Port Said or Alexandria to Brindisi : 3 days</p>
                    <p>Alexandria to Messina : 3 days</p>
                    <p>Port Said or Alexandria to Marseilles : 5 days</p>
                    <p>Alexandria to Venice and Trieste : 4 days</p>
                    <p>Alexandria to Naples : 3 days</p>
                    <p>Port Said to Genoa : 5 days</p>
                    <p>Port Said to Naples : 4 days</p>
                    <p>Alexandria to Constantinople : 4 days</p>
                    <p>Alexandria to Piraeus : 2 days</p>
                    <p>Port Said to Gibraltar : 7 days</p>
                    <p>The steamers, of the P. and O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageries Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria, without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg</p>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P. and O. Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste-Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves Port Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry boats," having been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi. If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMINA, one of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful, occupying about one hour.In and around the town is much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain - his tomb is to be seen. The cathedral
                        was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The Palazzo Reale is of S. Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its bay--Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, railway journey of five hours brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea level.
                        This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero, thence by cogwheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if possible be made, in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient halfway house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba)--The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and a phenomenally equable temperature--warm in winter and deliciously cool breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces, gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn to Genoa. Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Nilan is SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs, change trains at Borgo San Dorino and in half an hour you are at Salsomaggiore.</p>

                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage, or bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other seaport. The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going nothwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter hours by train by way of Monza.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot ; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia, and Menaggio with the prettily situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two and three quarter hours.</p>

                    <head>SWITZERLAND.</head>
                    <p>Switzerland, the heart of Europe, has been described as "A cluster of delights and grandeurs."</p>
                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one and a half hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San Salvatore, M. de Caprino and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty town, situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate, and is an excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment," by Ciseri, and "The Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>
                    <p>LUCERNE--A striking picture on the Lake of Lucerne facing the Rigi and Pilatus and the snow-clad Alps.</p>
                    <p>In and around the town the walks are charming, and the excursions to be made from Lucerne by boat, rail, etc. are very numerous.</p>
                    <p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful excursions, those to the Rigi, Pilatus, Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery on the trip from Lucerne to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of nature.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of Lucerne, commands magnificent views of lake and mountain scenery. Along the Lake of Uri from Brunnen to Fluelen runs the famous Axentrasse.</p>
                    <p>A delightful excursion from Lucerne is that to ENGELBERG. Take boat to Stansstad and from Stansstad it is about 1 hour and 40 min. by Electric Railway, with delightful scenery en route. The ascent of Titlis, is made from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps is grand ; extending from Monte Rosa to the Black Forest, and from the Santis to the Matterhosn.</p>
                    <p>THE BERNESE OBERLAND.--INTERLAKEN a favourite summer resort and the best centre for making excursions in the Oberland, abounding in fine walks and views. There is a magnificent view of the Jungfrau from the Hoheweg, a fine avenue of walnut trees the chief resort of visitors. Interlaken is also not far from the famous waterfalls, Giessbach, Trummelbach, and Staubbach. Then also the glaciers of the Grindelwald and view from Murren and the Schynige Platte are sights not to be missed.</p>
                    <p>CHATEAU D'OEX. 3,500 ft. above the sea on the new Electric Railway between Montreux and Interlaken, surrounded by magnificent scenery, with pure dry air. Much frequented by English people in Summer and Winter.</p>

                    <p>If possible tourists should arrange to be in Athens for the Orthodox Easter in order to witness the Good Friday and Easter Eve ceremonies, and to be present at the dancing on the Easter Tuesday festival held at Megara for which a special train is run from Athens.</p>
                    <p>It is worth while to spend a few days in CORFU on account of the beauty of the scenery. There is also good snipe and quail shooting to be had.</p>
