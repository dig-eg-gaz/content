                            reference to the work performed, and we "ha to never been amongst those
                            who considered that we had enough of the Com- mission's time. The
                            circumstances of the case may certainly . have required that something
                            more clearly defined and comprehensive was necessary, bat the
                            authorities could hardly have expected this when selecting gentlemen os
                            members of the Commission from among there who were so concerned in
                            other important duties, that their absence from England could not be of
                            long duration. We regarded the matter ourselves much in the light of a
                            reference to a consulting phy- sician who gives his opinion and leaves
                            the are to others. In the likening of a railway to any other commercial

                            knowledge and experience cannot master, and, if necessary, reform when
                            accepted lines have been agreed upon. When, however, we come to
                            "Traffic’s” arrangements of deportments, and the position he would
                            accord to the traffic manager, we are com- pelled to part company. If we
                            re tarn to his principles of trade and commerce, we do not find that, in
                            practice, the head of the sales department has absolute control over
                            baying and building operations. The opinion of the soles manager tho old
                            be valuable, and taken accordingly, bat the bayer and architect look to
                            someone higher thin him m their master. It is true that the success of a
                            railway may depend more upon the traffic manager than upon any other
                            official, and in matters of complication or competition the railway's
                            earnings, and the welfare of the country, may greatly depend upon his
                            wisdom and ex- perience. In the matter of expenditure of every kind, is
                            representations of the requirements of his departments must carry snob
                            weight (involving os they do the security of life and property), that
                            they cannot be lightly set aside. Upon him depends to a great extent
                            whether money is wisely spent, withheld, or wasted, although it is
                            invariably held that he is not concerned in its expenditure, except in
                            so far os it may apply 'to his own establish- ment, for his training os
                            a rale would not fit him to deal with it, any more than the train- ing
                            of the responsible heads of other depart- ments would fit them to carry
                            oat their work as contractors under his guidance. This brings as to the
                            second part of “Traffic’s’* reply. We feel that it suddenly descends to
                            a kind of criticism of little value To the supervision of the general
                            manager over the whole of the executive staff might be added "and of all
                            its works,” without convey- ing the strained meaning attached to it.
                            There is necesarilly a chain of responsibility, not only on a railway,
                            bat in every department of it, and the Commission’s competition treated
                            as absurd in the case of the general manager would, as interpreted by
                            "Traffic,” be also absurd in the case of any important depart- ment of
                            any large railway. Whether Kantara is interlocked or not, whether
                            appearances, as hurriedly seen,were for oraganic it,or whether a mistake
                            has been mode in the name or in anything else ; whether signallers may
                            or may not have their books to passing trains ; or whether existing and
                            local circumstances jus- tify certain of the Commission's remarks, are
                            matters too technical for is to touch upon. We took the Report as
                            adopted generally by the authorities, including the head of the railway,
                            and hod every right to export that Mr. Bury’s wide experience and high
                            position at home made him a reliable adviser to the Commission in his

                            Great Northern Railway but of numbers who seek and accept Mr. Bary’s

                        <p>Since he has been in Simla this year Lord Kitchener has been much
                            occupied in superin- tending the improvements which were com- menced
                            last year in the lower bungalow which forms the main portion of Snowdon,
                            hie Excellency's official residence. Snowdon was originally bought from
                            General Pater Innes by Lord Roberta in 1873-1, and was purchased from
                            the latter, say* "Men and Women o India,” by the Government for about
                            Rs.80,000. Since Lord Kitchener has been in residence there he has made
                            so many alterations that the house can honestly be said to hare been
                            com- pletely transformed. Not only has he built a delightful
                            dining-room, possessing oar red wall and ceilings, bat he has
                            constructed a main hall and staircase, which are ornamented with
                            trophies of the chase and spoils of war, Among those latter may be
                            mentioned the curious coat-of-arms in carved oak which originally formed
                            the back of tin canopy under which President Kroger used to sit is the

                            to the rub of his country and himself; was signed. Then there are ban-
                            ners and Hags taken at Omdnrman as well as in South Africa, and curious
                            old arms without number. The old ball-room has been consider- ably
                            enlarged and improved, the electric light U being installed throughout
                            the entire block of buildings, and the construction of a library promise
                            to convert "Snowdon" into a residence which will ha worthy of the famous
                            soldier who ` has taken an interest in its improvement.</p>

                    <p>A Cario correspondent writes;- I have just heard of the death, at Milan, of
                        Angelo tomi- sani, who, as many readers of the "Egyptian Gazette" will
                        rememebr sang at the Verdi Theatre and at ALexandria. I had the pleasure of
                        hearing him in several opera at the Verdi and I confess to having enjoyed
                        his singing far more than that of many whose names are better known and
                        reputations moe firmly established and more highly remunerated. I
                        remmeberespecially two operas- nMignon and Rigoletto. Mignon both in Cario
                        and in ALex- andria, was a deservedly brilliant success for M. Tomisani and
                        in Rigoletto his version of "La donna e mobile" was all one could have asked
                        for. I do not pretend to knoen anything about his former career or training
                        but I do assert (and many people will bear me out) that he had a delightful
                        voice of most charming tone and timbre especially in the higher notes of his
                        register. THe delicacy of these was very much beyond what an average
                        audience in this country expects. What he might have done no one can tell.
                        what he has done, as I and others heard it was I will maintian of unusual
                        promise and merit. I shall always be glad that I heard him sing, and more
                        than sorry to know that an untimely death prevents us from hear- ing him
                        again.</p>

                        a view to hearing the explanations of the promoters of the British
                        manufactureers exhibition and to the appointment of an advisory commitee The

                        of the exhibition Messrs. LEgge and Prior to ex- plain the scope and
                        outlines of their scheme to the meeting.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Prior then read a statement summaris- ing the scheme in which he pointed
                        out that British trade in Egypt needed some stimulus which would be supplied
                        by the holding of such an exhibition. He then gave the main outlines of the
                        scheme. The organisers intended to give their whole time and attention to
                        mak- ing the exhibition a success and proposed to act as managers supported
                        by an advisory committee. The exhibition was to be confined to British and
                        Colonial goods, and would be held between the months of December and
                        February nxext thereby enabling exhibitors to show the same goods at
                        Alexandria and Cario. The exhibiton would be open to all, classes of goods
                        which would be arranged as far as possible in their respective sections and
                        would be an onject lesson to the Egyptian public of the capabilities of
                        British manufacturers.</p>
                    <p>It was expected that suitable and central sites would be obtainable in Cario
                        and Alex- andria. Exhibitors would be charged according to the space
                        allotted them , and a small en- trance dee would be paid by the public but
                        as it was not desired to preclude admission to possible buyers a certain
                        number of free tickets would be issued ot exhibitors for dis- tribution
                        amongst locla merchants and others. Exhibitors would be charged the cost of
                        erect- ing stalls according to their plans. A band would be present and
                        other arrangements made to attract the public while everything would be done
                        to advertise the exhibition bith in England and Egpyt. Local agents of hoem
                        manyfactureers, whether British or foreign would be interviewed on order to
                        obtain their support and circulars owuld be forwarded to the most importnat
                        British manu- facturers and merchants explaining the aims of the exhibition
                        and inquiring whether they were willing to support it. THe organisers
                        above-mentioned would start a owrkinf ex- pense fund with sufficient capital
                        to carry out the scheme. The majority of the local merchnay and agents had
                        been interviews and had one and all promised to support the project while
                        very favorable reports as to the attitude of home manufacturers had been
                        received from Mr. Murray the London agent of the exhibition.</p>
                    <p>An advisory committes was then formed consisting of Messrs. Williams, Naggar,

                    <head>NILE VALLEY. PROPOSED INCREASE OF CAPITAL</head>
                    <p>The following circular has been issued to the shareholders of the Nile Valley
                        Com- pany:</p>
                    <p>The option which was given to Mr. J.B. Robinson to take up the 47,000
                        unissued shares in your company at 30s per share, has expired through
                        effluxion of time. The direc- tors only having been authorised to dispose of
                        these shares to Mr. Robinson at the price stated and note at a lower figure
                        with out first consulting the shareholders and furtehr work- ing capital
                        being required to successfully and quickly develop your property have deemed
                        it advisable to give the shareholders an oppor- tunity now that the 47,000
                        shares are freem to suscribe for the same at par on the conditions stated
                        below.</p>
                    <p>The additional capital is required for the following purposes: (1) The
                        erection of Cornish pump, which is now on the ground (2) The erection of a
                        permanent hoisting plant also now on the ground. (3) THe vigorous
                        development of the mine at depth . (4) To considerably increase the crushing
                        capacity of the battery. A large amount of gold as the ahreholders are
                        aware, has been extracted in the pass from the phenomenally rich chute of
                        ore, but it is not expected that the specimen gold still left between the
                        108 ft and 150 ft levels wil do much more than discharge the present
                        liabilities of the company. No. 1 shaft is down to within a few feet of the
                        200 ft level and it is intended as son as the shaft reaches this level to
                        drive about 50 it in order to pick up th erich chute. The drives north and
                        south at the 200 ft level form No. 5 shaft are proving the reef to be wider,
                        and of a far more per- manent appearence than in the upper leyals.</p>
                    <p>It is therefore proposed to offer the said 47,000 shares tot he shareholder
                        at 1 per share payable as to 5s per share on application 5s per share on
                        allotment and the balance of 10s per share within two months form the date
                        of allotment. A special settlement will be applied for on the Stock Exchange
                        on shres now subscribed for so that all shares may rank alike.</p>

                    <head>LAST OF THE BRITANNIA</head>
                    <p>A somewhat pathetic incident in the annals of H.M. Navy is about to take
                        place in the closing of His Majesty's Ship Britannia at Dartmouth on of the
                        old wooden walls of England and Specil nterest attatched to the distribution
                        of prizes on the 2nd August as it was the last function on board the old
                        cadet ship. The cadets after the holidays, will be housed in the new NAval
                        College erected at Dartmouth at a cost of nearly 500,000. Admiral Sir Lewis
                        Beaumont distibuted the prizes and said although the wooden walls were at
                        last to be swept away, and a new system inaugurted the traditions of the
                        grand old ship would remain Captian Wemyas com- manding the Dartmouth and

                        an interesting but a pathetic one. Not a naval officer but ws sorry to see
                        the altered conditions of naval wartare in recent years rendered it
                        imperative. Cadets from the crusiers Isis and Highflyar wre present in full
                        numbers, and they gave volley after volley of cheers for the Britannia and
                        the new college. </p>

                            after having transferred her mails, as is usual by going alongside the
                            larger ship was steaming down to her regular mornings, when for some
                            unexplained reason a large steam-hopper crashed into her. The damage to
                            the latter is serious and she was at once beached to avoid the

                    <p>London, August 4 After finishing up string last week, markets had a sharp
                        check early in the present week, the reported ntterances of the Tsar and M.
                        Witte being taken more seriously than was expected. Some are saying that the
                        one real reason wy Russia might almost be said to fear peace is the internal
                        state of the country and the possible consequences of recalling a beaten and
                        dscontented army home, where her ttroubles are far from being at an end.</p>
                    <p>The truth ism that although investment business is really good there is
                        little or no speculation on the part of the public and such speculative
                        accounts as there are open are mostly all professional: Declare thought they
                        had "seen their way" a little last week and opened small bull acounts, but
                        with littl permanent effect, as the public declined to follwo suit Consols
                        remain an uncertain market at 90 1/4 and Home Rails are generally weaker on
                        the disappointing returns. In Foreign Bonds, War stocks are dull.</p>
                    <p>Egyptian stocks are steady and have shown a tendency tp harden lately. As we
                        pointed out before, Agricultural Bank shares at the present price of 14 1/4,
                        still carry the right to apply for the new shares ay 5. This brings the
                        price of the old share down to 9 1/4 and the premium on the new shares is
                        sucha very tempting one that the old shares is sucha very tempting one tha
                        the old shares should still be well worth buying, and might easily rise to
                        16 or 17 between noe and the end of Septem- ber for they will not be quoted
                        ex rights till about them as the application for the new must be lodged
                        early in October.</p>
                    <p>In the Mining section the only point of interest is the new issue of 47,000
                        Nile Valley shares at 1 which ahs naturally brought the price of the old
                        shares back to the same level, These 47,000 shares have been under option to
                        Mr. J.B. Robinson at 30s per share and through efflution of time that option
                        has now expired. The vigoroud development of the mine at depth and an
                        extension of the crush- ing capacity are the main reasons advanced for the
                        issue but as the issue price is par and the old shares owing to the fall
                        to-day, may be had in the market for 18s 9d. there would appear to be little
                        in it. Apart from a small decline in "Mummies" other Egyptian Mines were not
                        mentioned.</p>

                    <head>MARKETING AT THE DOOR.</head>
                    <p>To be sure it was a great enterprise for us to take a cottage in a French
                        fishing village we having little French and to import an English cook, who
                        had no French at all. Our French speaking friends raised their hands at our
                        daring. "You will be frightfully cheated" they assured us. "How on earth are
                        you going to do your marketing? Why you don't even know the value of French
                        money!"</p>
                    <p>THat was true of courswe. We had to begin by letting the vendors help
                        themselves to their payments but that was for a day or two only. Our freinds
                        underrated our intelligence but we found the decimal coinage esy of under
                        standing and were only puzzled when some of the more unsophisticated skipped
                        from centimes to sous with a startling rapidity.</p>
                    <p>Even here there is a season which begina about the last week in July. We
                        arrived in the third week and were pertubed to find that a week later prices
                        suddenly jumped up. That was because the big hotel was filling with English.
                        Apparently the French visitors have no influence on the season for the
                        cha;ets were full of French people when we came; but of course Madame knows
                        the full value of what she buys and it would be quite useless to name an
                        extortinate price with her. Indeedm we noticed at first that when Madame
                        came to purchase at the carts at the same time as we were purchasing prices
                        were mentioned in a whisper. However, that was before we learned to do
                        without rather than to pay overmuch. When we had to come to that point we
                        began to be treated with respect. But before we arrived there Zelie the
                        fishwoman had made a tre- mendous haul out of us. We had paid her five
                        francs for six small fish the result of stupefac- tion rather than of
                        anyting else. Since then we have ceased to deal with Zelie</p>
                    <p>Fish there is an abundance and fresh out of the sea, very often "All alive,
                        O!" We generally dismiss two or thee fishsellers before breakfast. The
                        earyly hours are a disadvantage. WE are on the ground-floor, and the hall
                        door with is screen of pierced ironwork, is at our bed head. It is
                        disquieting when a cry of "Des moules, inadame sil vous plait" pierces one's
                        ear at six o'clock in the morning. You may buy seven basinful of mussels for
                        three pence as our cook did yesterday but even so early an hour.</p>
                    <p>After bathing you may buy eels on the sands and carry them home, writhing in
                        whatever happens to be hanady. Also, as you sit at meals it is no uncommon
                        thing to have a crab or a lobster thrust through the open window each quite
                        ready to show fight. After we have bought them they promenade round the
                        kitchen to the amusement od our cook, whom we sus0 pect of a French-descent.
                        We also buy a flat, thick, white fish, which is very sweet and delicate of a
                        variety unknown to us, Then there is a glittering silverfish very like a
                        salmon, which they cal "bar" and for which they charge salmon prices. It
                        eats rather like a milder kind of salmon. Can it be barbel?</p>
                    <p>Mademoiselle who sells us our fruit and vegetables comes out from Boulogue
                        market. She has a little ass and cart and a'stout dog to assist "l'auesse"
                        up the hilld and down, She has beautiful peaches and melons and plums and
                        tomatoes and all manner of vegetables. As she sits on her cart, with her
                        handsome dark face she is the centre of a most pleasing pictue. We like her
                        the better that is well fed and accustomed to sugar and that the dog turns
                        up his nose at mere bread. Still, she has picked over the peaches fo us,
                        giving us the least mature while the French. medames selected the ripest and
                        roundest. How impossible it is to remonstrate when one has little French!
                        Then there comes a day when she can speak only in a whisper and has her
                        throat swathed up with bandages. We present her with some tabloids of
                        chlorate of potash. The next time she comes she thanks and we notice that
                        she lays aside our selection of a caterpillar-ridden lettuce for a better
                        one. At Tuesday's market she takes charge of us. We see her watching over us
                        from afar. Not any longer does she pick for us the hardest and greenest
                        peaches.</p>
                    <p>There is a delightful little olf woman who comes from Cape GRisnez with
                        adonkey cart full of butter and eggs. The butter, swathed in cabbage leaves
                        under a white cloth is de- licious past the "best Devon" of London shops.
                        The eggs are brown and new-laid. Sometimes a child comes to the dooe with
                        three or four warm eggs on a platter, asking a few sous.-</p>
                    <p>Again, there re those who appear at the door wiht a shrieking and miserable
                        pullet or duck wiht its legs tied together. Or the baker like a conjurerm
                        will produc a rabbit from amid his long brownloaves. Or again there is the
                        woman with her little brown face in its widefrilled white cap a brown as her
                        wares.</p>
                    <p>Once there is a misunderstanding. The boy of the knife-grinder has been
                        hanging enrap- tured over the oyster-man as he opens the oysters for his
                        customers. Presently the bpy appears in our open door. "French" we say in
                        our halting French. "French" re plies. "Very cheap" we say to each other
                        approvingly and straight way oder two dozen. "E have not go" them", he syas
                        shaking his bewildered head WE produce a long dish and thrust it under his
                        nose. His bewilderment but increases Pantomime fails. He leaves us at last
                        still shaking his head. Those mad Enlgish I L to himself, doubtless. It is

                        toprove that they are "tres solide" and an excellent test it is, for they
                        are great and brawny even by those sons of Anak our fishermen.</p>

                    <head>THE JUNGFRAU RAILWAY</head>
                    <p>A further step has been made towards the completion of the railway which is
                        to transport tourists to the summit of the Jungfrau. A year ago the station
                        of Eigerwant which is about 9,000 feet above the sea level was opened and it
                        wsa announced that the next station Eismeer, 950 feet higher up, would in
                        all probability be readyby August 1. How well the engineers made their
                        calcula- tions can be gauged from the fact that trains went through the
                        Kismeer on the 27th ult.- that is to say, a wwek before the appointed date;
                        an d this notwithstanding that a tunnel nearly a mile in length had to be
                        bored through the hard stone and rock of the Eiger.</p>
                    <p>There was great excitement at Interlaken when it was known tha the line was
                        open and crowds thronged outto Lauterbrunnen and Wengernlap in order to take
                        advantage of the new extension. Special trians had to be put on and the
                        pressure continued until the evening. It was at first feard that the opening
                        would have to be postponed owing to the inclement weather which prevailed on
                        the previos days but yesterday was an ideal summer day and so the opening
                        took place.</p>
                    <p>The view from Eigerwand is nearly always sploit by a mist which constantly
                        comes and goes but up at Eismeer the atmosphere was perfectly clear anf the
                        view of the Alps was superb. Indeed, Eismeer is always free from mist and
                        fog and so one can almost always rely on a clear view. This latter station
                        is hewn out of the solid rock which lies midway at the foot of the summits
                        of the Eiger and the Monch. From the Eismeer the tip of the Fiescherhoner
                        can be seen, as also the Schreckhorn and Wetterhorn and down below before
                        one's eyes stretches the Eiger glacier with terrible abysses and gigantic
                        gorges. It is a sight which excites intense admiration and at the same time
                        causes the spectator un- willingly to shudder.</p>
                    <p>By next summer it is hoped to have a road open up to the sumts of the Eiger
                        and the Monch whilst the railway will be continued along the Col de Jungfran
                        to the point from which a gigantic life will convey passengers up a tunnel
                        bored through the mountain to the summit. This last section will be the most
                        difficult and when it is completed it will be the crowning example of what
                        modern engineer- ing genius can achieve.</p>

                    <head>A PROTECTION AGAINST MOSQUITOES</head>
                    <p>Mr. Walter J. Hammond writed form the City ofLondon Club Old Broad-street E.C
                        IN 1890 fever broke out in the town of Rio Claro S. BAulo Brazil where I was
                        staying obliging me to remove to San Carlos. In my new residence there were
                        no mosquito nets for the beds so for two nights I has no refreshing sleep on
                        account of mosquitos. All who have experienced similar misery know how weary
                        and desperate we become through the constant onslaught of the insects which
                        prevent sound sleep however weary and tired the body may be. Knowning
                        kerosine oill or petroleum to be destructive of all insect life. I annointed
                        my face, neck, and hands witht he oil and so got some sleep; but as soon as
                        it had evaporated teh creaturs were at me again. My eye fell on the
                        washstand and in a happy moment I thought of mixinf the petroleum oil in a
                        string lather of soap. The effect was perfect and I slept until the morning
                        in peace. Until I had mosqioto nets arranged I used this moxture every
                        nights with th esame happy result. Numbers of my friends have used this
                        preventive not only for the terrible mosquito that conveys the germs of
                        yellow fever or other awful diseases but to keep off gnats of all kinds
                        midges which are to be found in England. I write this because so many
                        persons have at times to sleep a night or two in mosquito-infected towns
                        where nets are not always available. The proportion I found best was about a
                        small coffee spoonful of petroluem to a latehr of soap and water which when
                        free from bubbles would fill one-third of the soap dish. The mixture of
                        course smells sightly of the oil but it is not any stringer than old brown
                        Windsor or coal-tar soaps. No injury whatever is done to the skin, however
                        often it is need and the slight discomfort felt at first is compensated a
                        thousandfold by the mmunity it establishes from mosquito or gnat results and
                        the attendant dangers.</p>

                    <head>MAT HAFFIGAN;S ADVOCATE</head>
                    <p>When Mr. George Bernard Shaw wrote "John Bull's Other Island" he invented Mr.
                        Mathew Haffigan as a type of the land- hungering Irishman whose "sufferings"
                        had almost turned his head and to whome nothing was of the least service
                        that did not begin and end with the restoration to "the people" of the land
                        to which he supposed them to have an indefeasible right. A violent and not
                        very brilliant old person, he was quite unable to understand that when the
                        "land" had passed in small holdings into the hands of men who lacked means
                        as much as the old landloards and lacked also the education and influence
                        which enabled their predecessors in many instances to do their duty by their
                        tentants Ireland would be in worse case than ever before. His socialism was
                        of that unreasoning kind that can olny see the attractive begining and is
                        deluded by a belief that a inevitable end, in which all the old evils have
                        new evils added unto them can be indefinately postponed, MR. Shaw who knows
                        his own island, invented this Haffigan to show his folly, But Mr. Shawm
                        though a Fabian is a shrewd studnet of national life</p>
                    <p>Count Tolstoy who devotes seven long if interesting columns of the "Times" to
                        an ex- posiition of his well-known views on the re- generation of Russia is
                        a Socialist and a dreamer. So he follows Haffigan rather than Shaw. TO
                        demonstrate his views on the land question for Russia (which he compares in
                        one passage to Ireland), he had invented many characters (whom he introduces
                        in a narrative passage) whose "sufferings" and aspirations are not unlike
                        our friend Matthew's . But form these premisses he goes on to argue tha the
                        nationalisation of land is absolutley the only panaces for the ills to which
                        his country if heir and that all reform or attempted re- form which does not
                        start from this point is a hindrance and not a help.</p>
                    <p>Count Tolstoy is both violent and visionary. His dreams are haunted by the
                        figure of Henry George whose doctirine of which the manifest fallacies were
                        long ago acknowldged is quoted and accepted by him as the indestructible
                        argu- ment of an inspired reformer. Having got the one idea of the land
                        question and its solution firmly fixed in his mind as the only true hope of
                        or road to national salvation there is room for nothing else.And he devotes
                        a vast amount of zealous energy to a bitter denuciation of all reformers who
                        are seeking in other direc- tions the regenration of Russia. Private owner-
                        ship of land is an "atrocity." All who disagree with Leo Tolstoy are sinful
                        Scribes and Pha- rises "like unto whited sepulchres" and "only those who are
                        not religous and there- fore do not truly love can invent trifling
                        unimportant improvements in the condition of the people wihtout seeing that
                        cheif evil from which others are suffering and which they themselves are
                        partly producing" land-hunger to wit. Such "unimportant improvements" are
                        efforts "to abolish the censorship of books, arbitrary banishments and to
                        organise every- where schoold, common and agricultural, to increase the
                        numebr of hospitals, to cancle passports and monoplies to institute strict
                        inspection in the factories to reward maimed workers, to mark boundaries
                        between pro- pertis of land by peasants and much else." And all who devote
                        themselves to merely practical ideals such as these, Liberal, Social- ists,
                        Revolutionists, or Governemt officials are preverse, blind and sinful. In
                        fact, aut Tolstoy aut nullus and ot hte crows with all reforms and reformers
                        who do not belive that the nationalisation of land is the one and ony hope
                        for Russia.</p>
                    <p>This singular outburst interesting and amaz- ing shows clearly enough why the
                        idealistic noble is permitted a latitude which the Russian Government does
                        not often allow to thinkers so free and courageous. The more Count Tolstoy
                        writes in this fashion the more he sows dissen sion in the party reform. His
                        words directly and the GOvernment by separating peasants from
                        "intellectuals" and causing a great disrtrust of those who might lead were
                        the country as a whole to follow. Supposing that his ideal were less
                        impractible than is actually the case, he still puts the cart before the
                        horse and retards any possible realisation of hisown desires by decrying to
                        reform of Governemnt which must be ther first step on a new path for his
                        country. How so keen an intellect can believe or write as he does is
                        something of a mystery but it is clear enough that he must do a great deal
                        of harm to the cause of intelligent reform, while the bureaucracy mus t find
                        in his activity a valued ally in their war aganst the "intellectuals" whom
                        they have reson to dread. MR. G.B. Shaw made another of his puppets call Mat
                        Haffigan a "foostering old dodderer" Count Leo Tolstoy would have bailed him
                        as a true disciple. But while there is hope in Ireland, there can be little
                        for Russia where doctors continue so disastorously to disagree.</p>

                        sport complet!" Streaming with perspiration wild eyed, red-faced hoarse
                        yoiced and "debrailles" no Elnglish word conveys such an exact description
                        of the utter abandonment of their dishevelled state- the "camelots" who are
                        selling, eveing papers with the result of to-day's racing at
                        MAisons-Laffitte tear past the office windowm pattering down the hot
                        boulevard upon their string-soled espadrilles- shoes of white drill with
                        laces of bright blue.</p>
                    <p>"PAAAris sport! Complet des courses!" I have wondered sometimes whether
                        thesemen be millionaires dyspeptic men in search of violent exercise who in
                        spite of their rags, ahve ple- thora of moeny at the bank. Their cheif
                        design seems to be speed and they do not appear to want to sell their ares.
                        If they do sell them they do so as the rish by and nothing short of the
                        police can stop them Why, I have seen them thrust a paper into a man's hand
                        ansd go on wihtout the halfpenny becuase he could not get the coin out
                        quickly enogh for the camelot's taste.</p>
                    <p>"PAAAris sport!" On they rush a quire or two of the damp papers in onr hand,
                        the other free to take your halfpenny and thrust the paper into your hand.
                        This sometimes only. FOr although there must be fifty hawkers selling the
                        same paper within 500 yeards each man runs as though his life depended on
                        his gettting farther up the street, or farther down it as the case may be
                        and tears along in desperate earnestness of haste, missing five customers
                        for every one to whome he sells a paper.</p>
                    <p>"PAAri sport! Complet des courses!" "Sac a papier!" grumbles an old concierge
                        in velet skullcap (it is Sunday) and huge horn-rimmed spectacles- "Sac a
                        papier! I knew that Sabre- tache was bound to win! And" turning to his wife
                        sitting hand on her knees on a small stool beside the doorway "you and your
                        Verdigris! You would not let me play Sabre- tache, and you see the result!
                        Ninety-eight francs for five!" "I dreamed that there was Verdigris upon the
                        firt floor's copper sauce0 pans," meekly says Madame Concierge The tip
                        seemed good enough you know last year...." "Last year, last year! I should
                        have won ninety-eight francs in Sabretache instead of losinf five on your
                        absurd Verdigris, growls the lord of creation. "Last year! Les voila bien
                        les femmes!"</p>

                        looks down the paper feverishly then claps her hands re- gaurdless of the
                        new gloves on them and ex- claims "Forty0nine franc! Yes hald of
                        ninety-eight of forty-nine and Jeanne and I have ninety-eight frnacs to
                        divde! Quelle veine! quelle veine!" She picks the paper from the pavement
                        where she had dropped it in her excitement and glances down the other races.
                        "Vasistas-not even placed! Five fracs gone, for Jeanna would not bet on him.
                        Well never mind; I've made my forty some- thing francs anyhow!"</p>
                    <p>"PAAris sport!" A methodical old gentle- man the least liekly man in Paris to
                        have betted you would think buys the paper sits down at the cafe order a
                        grenadine which he forgets to drink and wiht a pencil a notebook and the
                        newly bought paper works out the results of the day. Six of the seven horses
                        he had backed have places. The seventh one has lost. A net gain of eighteen
                        franc fifty "PAAris sport!" A man as ragged as the camelot gives him his
                        last sopper and breaks into loud curses. "PAris sport!"</p>
                    <p>It's eight o'clock. The hawker alost dead with heat and weariness drops on a
                        seat upon the Boulevard St. Danis. He is voiceless his heart thumps
                        underneath his tattered shirt the open neck of which shows the veind of his
                        throat tight-strung like the catgut of a violin. But he has sold all his
                        paers and has made his wahe of two francs. Enough to live on for another
                        day, and more by a good deal than the day's "sport" has brought to may of
                        his pockets, curls up on the bench and goes to sleep. "Paris sport" He jumps
                        up and shakes himself. Time to get up and sell the "Courrier de Soir."</p>

                    <p>Not fo many years observes the "Yachts- man" has the outlook for Cowes been
                        brighter. One factor alone remains- an all important one and should the
                        weather not be propitions our hopes may be blasted. THe coincidence of the
                        visit of the French fleet will make a bright mark at done which the Press
                        would make a bright mark for that mysterious midnight meeting of the royal
                        yachts of Russia and Germanu which has taken place in the Baltic. These are
                        shoal waters into which we cannot ventue; fortu- nately, we are not
                        dependent on outsiders for our Cowes. As a matter of factm however, the
                        Metero will be present and it is highly impro- bable that the gay week on
                        the Solent will ruffle the political sea. Not for many years has there been
                        so much demand for accommodtion on shore or for anchorage a fleat. Britannia
                        will holat her o'd colours and the racing should be exceptionally good.</p>
