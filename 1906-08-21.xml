                    <p>RIVALS AND ENEMIES</p>
                    <p>According to the “Evening Standard an: St. JarneH’s Gazette,” the meeting of
                        the Kir, and the Kaiser offers a good opportunity for Great Britain and
                        Germany to take stock their mutual relations. For years past thw has been a
                        certain perceptible friction between the two countries. This, be it
                        observed, ha-nothing to do with their Governments. The Foreign Offices of
                        the Wilhelmstrasse and Downing-street have had no quarrel, no differ ences
                        even, of any importance. A year ago when there were suggestions for a
                        general settlement between England and Germany on the lines of the
                        Anglo-French Convention, it was pointed out that there was really n«>-thing
                        to settle. There were no outstanding questions at issue, like those, for
                        instance, of Egypt and Siam and the Newfoundland fisheries. It was not a
                        case for negotiations, or treaties, or diplomacy’at all. The Governments had
                        no formal cognisance that there was any breach or any circumstance likely to
                        lead to one.</p>
                    <p>The estrangement, so far as it has existed, hAs been one of popular
                        sentiment, sedulously fomented by mistaken patriotism on both sides. Germans
                        and Englishmen, good friends for centuries, and often close allies,
                        gradually discovered, towards the end of the Bismarckiaa period, that they
                        were not very fond of one another. As Germany grew stronger, and more
                        ambitious and aggressive, the feeling intensified. The Franco-German war had
                        natu rally put the Teutonic peoples a little above themselves. Their
                        self-satisfaction increased when they began to add the triumphs of peaz* to
                        those of war. On the Continent of Europe they were the cocks of the walk.
                        France' had been dethroned from her ancient pride of place; Russia was
                        chaotic, and semi-barbarous ; Austria, Italy, Spain were in the second rank.
                        But Germany discovered that she produced other things besides soldiers and
                        professors. She could build great steamers, manufacture machinery, run
                        cotton-mills and engine-sheds, and create an enormous export trade. Her
                        ambitions turned to the wider world outside Europe, and, like the first
                        Napoleon, she began to think of “Ships, Colonies, and Commerce,” the
                        mainstays of an Empire But here, wherever she looked, she saw herself
                        brought up against the achievements of Britain. The ships, the colonies, the
                        oversea trade, the great markets—they were ours already. Germany set herself
                        diligently to wrest a share of these from us. We bent ourselves, somewhat
                        slowly and contemptuously at first, to keeping what we had got. The
                        situation led naturally to a certain bitterness. The Germans were irritated,
                        because we had already obtained most of the things they wanted. We were
                        annoyed because they were trying to take from us what we had come to regard
                        almost as a monopoly. It was disagreeable to find ourselves faced everywhere
                        by a new pushing concern, organised on the latest methods ; and on the other
                        hand, it was mortifying for the new tiaders to realise that, with all their
                        energy and enter prise, they were badly handicapped in the race with a
                        competitor who had gained a century’s start..</p>
                    <p>The commercial rivalry is a fact* with which we must make our account. It
                        will not disappear or even diminish. Germany and England for a good many
                        decades to come will be competitors in many lines of trade. But it does not
                        follow that they need be enemies, if only because they are excellent
                        customers for one another. So far as one can see there is no reason whatever
                        why the warfare should not be waged by the merchants, the manufacturers, the
                        shipowners, and shippers, without in the least involving the*8oldiers, the
                        sailors, and the statesmen. It is true Germany has certain vague territorial
                        ambitions, which may eventually bring her into conflict with us. But really
                        that might be said of most other great countries—of France, Japan, Russia,
                        the United States—and, indeed, wre have said it of nearly all in turn. It is
                        barely ten years since it was almost a religion with patriotic Frenchmen and
                        Englishmen to believe that a great wrar between the two countries was
                        “inevitable.” It is not much longer since we felt convinced that we should
                        some time or other have to fight the United States for the possession of
                        Canada ; and two generations of Britons have been brought up in the firm
                        faith that between Russia and England no firm or lasting peace was possible.
                        Now, we are tionate towards America, cordial towards Frtn* ce, and even
                        disposed towards a reasonable friendship with Russia. These nations are
                        still our rivals^industrially and politically; their aims are not, and never
                        will be, completely attained without some interference with our own. Yet we
                        have discovered that we need not hate them, and that they are far from
                        hating us. And we may hope that we are on the eve of the same revelation
                        with regard to Germany. Nations seem to be realising, as individuals and
                        associations have done, that rivalry and enmity need not be necessarily
                        conjoined. A trader may strive fiercely to undercut or outdo another man in
                        business. But he does not go about uttering threats of personal violence,
                        and may even be quite civil and friendly in his bearing towards his opponent
                        when they meet in private life.</p>

                        <p>Mohamed Ibrahim and Tahir Mohamed, two “suffragis” in Cairo, belonging to
                            the Ababdeh tribe, agreed on Sanday afternoon to settle their
                            differences by an encounter on the Abbassieh hills, and half an hoar
                            later they were at the appointed spot alone. The weapons used in the
                            duel were nabouts. Mohamed Ibra¬him was the first to draw blood, Tahir
                            Moha¬med receiving a tremendous blow on the head, which so enraged him
                            that, taking a knife out of his belt, he stabbed bis adversary twioe in
                            the leg. Mohamed Ibrahim, who was quicker in motion than the other,
                            succeeded iD wrenching the weapon from Tahir Mohamed’s hand and thrust
                            it into his heart, killing him on the spot, and afterwards decamping. He
                            was arrested shortly afterward?, however, and confessed his guilt. The
                            injuries he sustained in the fight will require ten days’ medical

                    <head>THE “DEUTSCHE REVUE” ARTICLES</head>
                    <head>GOVERNMENT ATTITUDE.</head>
                    <p>(Gazette's Special Service.) LONDON, Taesday, August 21. The Berlin Press
                        have repudiated the articles published in the “Deutsche Revue’ and say that
                        they are ill advised and in no way official. The journal has no connection
                        with the Government and does not even voice the opinions of an appreciable
                        percentage of Germans. The Government at Berlin regards the question of
                        Egypt as being perfectly settled, and the authorities are quite prepared to
                        abide by the status quo. </p>
                    <p> As the culmination of a long series of attacks upon British policy in Egypt
                        in the German Press, the last number of the “Deutsche Revue.” which is
                        reputed to speak with authority in matters of foreign policy, discussed the
                        Egyptian “question” from the German point of view. The gist of the article
                        is the proposal that Egypt should be treated as an object of common interest
                        to England and Germany and that its future should be decided between the two
                        Powers on the basis of compensating values. The course of reasoning by which
                        this position is reached has been rendered familiar by the campaign which
                        preceded the outbreak of the Morocco question last year. </p>
                    <p> The article premises the existence of an Anglo French “coalition” against
                        Germany, with which she will have to reckon. The Anglo French Convention of
                        1904 is described as the logical sequel to Disraeli’s conquete hypothecaire
                        of the Suez Canal and as evidence of British determination to absorb Egypt
                        before Germany has firmly established herself in Asia Minor. Of this
                        intention Lord Cromer’s proposals for ameliorating the judicial system and
                        for facilitating the work of administration are regarded as affording the
                        necessary proof. Lord Cromer’s proposals are represented as a direct attack
                        upon the Capitulations and as the first step towards the abolition of the
                        exterritoriality of foreigners. With the abolition of these regulations the
                        security of foreigners would be at an end, since the reconstituted Courts
                        would be subject to British influence. The suggestion that a local board of
                        control, international in its composition, should be substituted for
                        diplomatic representation is treated with suspicion, notwithstanding Lord
                        Cromer’s very categorical assurances, upon the ground that the British
                        community would be invested with a preponderating vote, upon the strength of
                        superior interests. Lord Cromer’s other proposals are examined in a similar
                        spirit and the conclusion is reached that Egypt is being conciously
                        transformed into a British “protectorate.” It is admitted that Lord Cromer’s
                        proposals have not yet received the public sanction of the British
                        Government, but is maintained that the Sultan has been definitely dislodged,
                        and that the Egyptian flag is only allowed to float from motives of policy. </p>
                    <p> Although Lord Cromer’s proposals have admittedly not been sanctioned, the
                        Akabah dispute and the Deniahwai incident, both of which are described as
                        having been deliberately provoked, are interpreted as indications of the
                        British Government’s probable intentions. If, it is argued, effect is to be
                        given to Lord Cromer’s proposols, England “will, of course, require the
                        assent of Germany as well as of other Powers.” “In these circumstances,” it
                        is added, “it is natural that the Liberal Cabinet should not regard the
                        pronounced differences which now prevail between England and Germany as
                        desirable, and that those who declare that the text of the music to which
                        the latest hymns of peace are being played is to be found in Lord Cromer’s
                        report should be oonsidered not altogether wrong.” After this the authors
                        and advocates of the recent series of demonstrations of Anglo-German
                        friendship will hardly be surprised to hear that the agitation in favour of
                        the limitations of armaments is regarded merely as another link in the same
                        chain. </p>
                    <p> Exception is further taken to Lord Cromer’s proposal that English, French,
                        and Italian should be recognized as the official languages in the Egyptian
                        law Courts, and in the proceedings of the international board. In view of
                        various German commercial interests, the importance of which is duly
                        estimated in marks and tons, the inclusion of German among the official
                        languages is demanded, and it is urged that this demand should be pressed
                        “in any circumstances.” For the present, however, the German Government is
                        advised to wait and see whether Lord Cromer’s proposals are sanctioned and
                        “what equivalents the British Goverrment proposes to offer Germany for the
                        renanciation of her treaty rights.” What sort of “equivalents” Germany would
                        demand seems clear from the following sentences :— ‘ I this connexion,
                        moreover, the question will have to be considered whether this occasion,
                        upon whch we are expected to bestow fresh favours upon England, would not be
                        a good opportunity for claiming her friendly compliance with regard to the
                        Persian Gulf terminas of the Baghdad Railway. </p>
                    <p> For England to persist in her policy of transforming the Persian Gulf into a
                        mare clausum Britannicum would be to throw down the gauntlet (die Macht/rage
                        au/zuuerfen), and her persistence would compel us to meet British Cabinet
                        with the same measure. If the intentions of the present British Cabinet with
                        regard to Germany are really pacific and friendly, the settlement of
                        questions of this kind between the two nations must be effected upon a
                        footing of confiding reciprocity.” </p>
                    <p> Concerning the Pan Islamic movement. Ihe genasis of which is ascribed to
                        British policy, the article observes : — </p>
                    <p> “If England and France conclude agreements with regard to the future of
                        Mussulman countries, without in any way consulting the inhabitants of these
                        countries, a universal outbreak of discontent throughout the whole of Islam
                        would not be at all unnatural. As a matter of fact, both Powers have reason
                        to be gratefal to Germany for laying stress upon the sovereignty of the
                        Sultan of Morocco and for proposing an international conference in
                        conjunction with the Sultan, since by this means Germany effectually
                        precluded the outbreak of Mahomedan fanaticism, or at any rate robbed it of
                        some very serious pretexts for its manifestation. If the British Government
                        should adopt Lord Cromer’s proposals without any alteration, the question
                        might arise whether a similar procedure would not be desirable in the case
                        of Egypt.” </p>

                        judg-ment in an amusing case.</p>
                    <p>Some time ago a native barrister gave a commission to a Greek artist to paint
                        his por-trait in oils. It was a three quarter face portrait, and when the
                        work was finished the native barrister was delighted with it and invited all
                        his friends to come and see the masterpiece. They did FO, and to the
                        advocate’s disgust, instead of praising the work, maintained a polite hat
                        omioous silence as they gazed at the pioture, and finally one of them asked
                        if he had already paid for it. The barrister replied in th%‘ negative, and
                        was at once congratulated by his friends, who remarked that the work was a
                        fraud as the painter had only depicted him with one ear.</p>
                    <p>The advocate recognised that this criticism was only too true and he rushed
                        round to the artist’s studio in a state of great indignation, and declared
                        that in view of the just oriticism of his friends he would never pay for the
                        portrait. The artist thought that the man of law was jesting, but when he
                        discovered that the barrister was quite setioi s, he was at pains to explain
                        to him that in a three-quarter face portrait it was only possible for the
                        person so depicted to have one ear visible.</p>
                    <p>The barrister, however, deolined to regard the argument as valid, and
                        persists in refusing to pay, so the artist has been compelled to bring an
                        action.</p>

                        of the board of directors of the National Bank of Egypt containirg the
                        conditions which the Government is disposed to accept in the case of the
                        Bank becoming a State banking institu¬tion.These conditions are extremely
                        favourable, and there is no doubt but that at the next meeting of the board
                        of directors they will be accepted as they in no way hinder the bank’s
                        present system of conducting its busi¬ness. Moreover, the conditions permit
                        of the bank’s making nee of its reserve fond, as it will be replaced by
                        Government Stook, of which a considerable part at least will be placed at
                        the disposal of the bank’s reserve ‘withoat any interest having to be
                        paid.</p>

                    <p>Pera, August 14. M. N. Christoff, a well known Bulgarian merchant of
                        Amsterdam, is said to have the intention of going to Cairo in order to open
                        a commercial establishment and a Bulgarian commercial museum.</p>
                    <p>Mgr. Neotarius, Metropolitan of Aleppo, has applied to the Grand Vizier and
                        the Minister of Justice, on behalf of Mgr. Photius, Patriarch of Alexandria,
                        for permission to reconstruct the Orthodox Chnrch of Benghazi.</p>
                    <p>As soon as the list of candidates for the Catholic Armenian Episcopate of
                        Alexandria reaches the Patriarchate of Sakyz Agatch here, the Holy Synod of
                        the Patriarchate will meet in order to elect the Bishop. As is know, the
                        bishoprio is vacant owing to the election of Mgr. Sabaghian to the
                        Patriarchal Throne of Constantinople.</p>
                    <p>Some delegates who have come to Constantinople propose to proceed to
                        Alexandria to try and obtain from the Khedivial Mail Line a reduction in
                        freights for Servian exports to Egypt.</p>

                    <p>The arrest ff Mahmoud Bey Arif at Stamboul has afforded high Egyptian circles
                        another opportunity to raise the question of a Kapou Kethadasri for
                        Egyptians at Constantinople. A Kapou Kethudassi is a Political Agent
                        accredited to the Sublime Porte, but the appointment has long been deferred
                        owing to the desire of the Khedive to nominate to it an Egyptian belonging
                        to the Maieh Sanieh. To this the sozerain Government objects.</p>
                    <p>It is to be hoped that daring his stay in Stamboul the Khedive may avail
                        himself of the occasion to approach the Turkish authorities on this subject,
                        which has remained in this undecided state for several years. The Egyptians
                        on the Bosphorus are to all intents and purposes a separate colony, and it
                        is to be hoped that their status as such shall be more clearly defined so
                        that regrettable incidents of the kind just alluded to may in future be
                        avoided.</p>

                        blocking of the pavement Opposite the Savoy Hotel extensions by workmen.
                        Instead of observing any improvement in this state of affairs we remark that
                        the inconvenience to the public has been increased by the addition of the
                        workmen who are employed in mending Kasr-el-Nil road. We are of opinion that
                        the police authorities are in no way justified in ignoring fench reasonable
                        complaints made by the public of Cairo, and we trust that measures will be

                    <head>THE LETTI ESTATES.</head>
                    <p>A new company is now being formed to take over a grant of 10,000 acres of
                        agricultural land at Letti, in the Province of Dongola, Sudan, subject to an
                        agreement made with the Sudan Government, in which it is specified that the
                        total capital shall be £100,000, of which £85,000 in £1 Ordinary shares is
                        to be working oapital. The whole of this is to be guaranteed before the
                        public issue of shares. The sum of £13,000 in £1 Ordinary shares is to be
                        held in reserve, while £2,000 of oapital is divided into 40,000 deferred
                        shares of Is. each. These will be allotted in repayment of the expenses of
                        obtaining the grant and of forming the company, which have been borne by the
                        Nile Valley Block “E,” Limited. A farther sum of £ 10,500 cash is to be
                        allowed out of working capital for preliminary ex¬penses. The terms of the
                        agreement with the Sudan Government allow two years in which to form and
                        obtain its sanotion to a scheme of irrigation and agriculture, after which a
                        lease will be granted for ten year?, during which the freehold can be
                        purchased at 10s. an acre of all land brought under caltivatior. The £74,500
                        net working oapital available after payment of all preliminary expenses is
                        considered sufficient to bring the whole property under cultivation, local
                        conditions being economical. The net yearly profits are estimated at from
                        £20,000 to £30,000 per annum, which would be suffi¬cient to yield dividends
                        of from 15 to 20 per cent, on the Ordinary share?, the principal orops being
                        dates, oottoD, and cereals.</p>

                        Mastapha Pasha Kamel, might I be allowed to sfcnd you my impression ot this
                        notorious agitator's* latest escapade. We now hear of him dally living “en
                        prince” at the Carltori Hotel and making wondrous speeches before admiring
                        Little Englanders, to whom In has to-fly, finding that elsewhere his
                        pseudo^patriotio effusions meet with no sympathy. Lit ns remark “en passant”
                        that the Pasha’s Well-knowirlaok of the virtue of generosity does not seem
                        to be in evidence at present for he now stints himself in no way in the
                        cause Of “patriotism,” for we coaid not suppose that the ohargss of bribery
                        brought by Mr. Findlay upon the local Press could really have been trne, and
                        so an explanation found for the Pasha’s pro¬digality. His present tactics
                        bear a striking resemblance to those of Mark Anthony as depicted by the
                        immortal Shakeipearp. Having, by inflammatory articles in his paper, excited
                        the people to the verge of fanatioism, and to the expectation of a H>ly War
                        by order of the Saltan, he suddenly preaches -calm ! 0! be calm , yj people!
                        He now tells ns. that there is no more dooile race in the world than the
                        Egyptians, and that the charge of fanati¬cism is absurd. Q rite so, mou oher
                        Pasha, no more dooile race did yon not excite and inflame them with
                        seditions articles ! Finally his Excellency tells his deting audience, which
                        love? to slander its fellow coantrymen abroad, that the mass of the people
                        ooald never have been affeotei by the newspapers owing to their inability to
                        read ’ Tho Pasha mast know as well as we do that those that can read, read
                        to those who cannot, and all that they hear is taken as gospel truth; this
                        can be seen any day in the country by those who keep their eyes open.—I am,

                    <p>Sir, — May I through the medium of your valuable newspaper draw the attention
                        of those concerned to an irregularity, of which they are unaware, in the
                        servioe of the tram¬way beyond San Stefano. On Saturday night I ha 1 to wait
                        32 minutes before a tram pat in an appearance, and this is by no means an
                        isolated instance of snch delays. Also, in view of the large number of
                        people staying at the Hotel Beau Rivage, it would be much more convenient
                        were the balte closer to the hotel than it is. I am sure that if the
                        directors were aware of this state of things, which is doe to the negleot on
                        the part of their employes, they woald remedy this at once one defect in
                        their excellent service.—I am etc.</p>

                    <head>CANAL MARITIME</head>
                    <p> Nous avons parlé en son temps du projet de l’Administration des Ports et
                        Phares au sujet de la création d'un Canal maritime par¬tant du Jardin Nouzha
                        et traversant le jardin du Gabbari. Les auteurs de ce projet avaient pour
                        but de débarrasser le écluses de Minèted Passai de l’encombrement des
                        barques et de mettre un terme à l’envasement du port in térieur par l’apport
                        des eaux boueuses du Mali- inoudieh. Entre autres avantages, le canal
                        projeté devait permettre aux barques 1 accès direct’dans le port et prévenir
                        pour celui-ci tout danger de contamination.</p>
                    <p>M. Dietrich Bey, chargé récemment par la Délégation d’émetre son avis sur le
                        projet en question, estime d’abord que la somme de LE. 170,000, fixée par
                        l’ingénieur des Ports et Phares pour l'ensemble dJs travaux, ne peut être
                        qu’approximative. Pour donner un chiffre exact, il faudrait posséder un
                        devis complet et connaître parfaitement la nature du terrain dans le lac
                        Mariout. En outre, il n'a été tenu aucun compte dans le projet des travaux
                        accessoires et imprévus qui accompagnent tou¬jours ces grandes éntrepiises ;
                        en tous cas, les sommes prévues pour cet objet sont cer-tainement
                        insuffisantes. Ainsi la zone maré-cageuse bordant le voie ferrée au sud peut
                        offrir un énorme surcroît de dépenses pour la conso¬lidation des digues du
                        canal, si le sol, qui est de nature vaseuse dans cette localité, vient à
                        s’affaisser sous l’action combinée du poids des terres et des eaux
                        d’infiltration de la mer, ren fermées dans un canal de 60 m. de large dont
                        le plan d’eau sera de 3 mètres plus élevé que le niveau du Mariout.</p>
                    <p>Pour empêcherla dite infiltration, M. Dietrich trouve préférable d’employer
                        les pierres prove¬nant du creusement du canal dans le jardin du Gabbari pour
                        protéger d’un perré en maçonne¬rie les talus du côté du canal, au lieu de
                        les employer comme noyau à l’intérieur des di¬gues. Il conseille de plus la
                        construction de plu¬sieurs siphons en maçonnerie permettant aux eaux des
                        masrafs de s’écouler dans le lac Maréotis, pour éviter la formation de
                        marais entre la ligne du chemin de fer et le canal projeté.</p>
                    <p> Revenant ensuite au devis estimatif des dépenses, il trouve insuffisante la
                        somme de LE. 2800 pour le rehaussement de 4 mètres de la voie ferrée, ainsi
                        que celles de L.E. 12.000 et 8000 pour la construction de l’écluse de 100
                        mètres en amont du jardin Nouzha et l’achat de terrains dans cette localité
                        ou ailleurs.</p>
                    <p> Voici maintenant l’opinion de M. Dietrich Bey sur l’opportunité du nouveau
                        canal mari time : —</p>
                    <p>On sait que l’encombrement des quais pro-vient de l’agglomération des
                        chounahs en certains points, du manque d’espace ou des voies j d’accès
                        commodes et enfin du peu de largeur ,des routes longeant le canal ou y
                        abootiMant. ) affaire», quelques tranHMtion» en Nungov.eh l^es quais sont
                        aussi trop hauts sur une grandi» partie de leur parcours pour le
                        déchargement du coton. Enfin le commerce du bois contribue pour une large
                        part and cet encombrement.</p>
                    <p>Lorsque les dépôts de bois seront transférés au Gabbari, comme c’est décidé
                        en principe, le canal Mahmoudieh pourra suffire longtemps encore aux
                        nécessités du trafic, moyennant les améliorations suivantes : 1.
                        prolongement des quais jusqu’à la rue Ragheb Pacha ; 2. élargis- '• sement
                        du canal entre le pont Ibrahim et Forn- el-Guéraya. Ce dernier travail
                        donnera lieu à de coûteuses expropriations ; aussi la largeur du canal dans
                        cette partie sera-trelle limitée au strict nécessaire, soit 40 mètres,
                        tandis qu’en amont elle aura 50 mètres. De chaque côté du ( canal proprement
                        dit, il sera réservé 10 mètres de terrain pour un quai en maçonnerie, desti
                        ' tiné à l’entrepôt des marchandises en départ ou en arrivée, et 15 mètres
                        pour la route. Entre le pont Daira Sanieh et l’Usine Electrique des 1
                        Tramways où les quais sont trop élevés, il fau 1 dra les abaisser ; mais
                        pour cela il faudra pro-céder à des expropriations ; en attendant, on
                        pourrait commencer par les parties Gù le canal est suffisament large pour
                        construire en dessous des quais et routes existantes un nouveau quai de H)
                        mètres pour y déposer les marchandises débarquées avant leur entrée en
                        chounah.</p>

                    <head>REFORMS IN PERSIA.</head>
                    <p>The influence of the mollahs or Mahomedan clergy is peculiarly strong in
                        Persia. They have preserved an ecclesiastical organization unknown in other
                        Moslem countries, and they wield considerable judicial powers. They are the
                        only body capable of standing between the rulers and the people ; and, with
                        all their faults, they have on more than one occasion interposed their
                        influence against misgovern¬ment when carried to intolerable lengths.
                        Naturally also they have of recent years come to stand as the
                        representatives of the national¬feeling of Persia against foreign,
                        influences. Between them and the Shah the breach has been steadily growing
                        wider. Some time ago the priests at Kcrbelah actually threatened the Shah
                        with excommunication. Last December the leading Mojtehids of Teheran, to
                        express their protest against the misgovernment of the country, practically
                        went on strike by taking eanotuary in a shrine and thus suspend¬ing all
                        their judicial work. They were temporarily quieted by promises, which, *gpf
                        course, were not carried out. Bat last month the trouble broke out again,
                        and in a more acute form. Under the influenc3 of events in Rassia tin
                        populace of Teheran began to olamour for some form of representative
                        insti-tutions. Serious street fights took plaoe iu Teheran, and eventually
                        the whole body of Mojtehids left the city, while their adherents, afraid of
                        the vengeance of the Coart faction, took refage in the grounds of the
                        British Legation—an interesting testimony of the confidonce fe’t in Persia
                        in our power and our sympathy with reform. ( “Times.”)</p>
