                    <p>The new handbook to Egypt and the Sudan, which Messrs. Thos. Cook &amp; Son
                        have just issued, is bound to be recognised as the stan- dard guide book to
                        the valley of the Nile. This new handbook has been entreated to the hands of
                        Dr. Wallis Badge, the well known savant, who is in charge of the Egyptian
                        and Assyrian antiquities in the British Museum. The new guide is a great
                        improvement on the former handbook, the greater part of it having been
                        re-written and voluminous fresh information added Foil particulars are given
                        as to Custom- house examinations and the regulations as to the exportation
                        of antiquities, special au- thorisation for this being required, and an
                        assessment of the value for export duty being necessary also. Another item
                        of interest is the advice given in the matter of suitable dress for
                        tourists, which is a matter of real im- portance to Visitors to Egypt.
                        Valuable hints are also given as to the medicines it is ad- visable to
                        provide in case of attacks from the maladies which are prevalent in Egypt,
                        such as fever, diarrhea, dysentery, etc. We do not think that any
                        information likely to be required by the tourist is omitted from this very
                        complete and interesting guide-book.</p>

                    <p>The managers of the Bibby Line inform us that they have made an important
                        improvement in the sailings of their homeward steamers, which is to come
                        into force during the busy season, and which should prove of great
                        convenience to passengers traveling by this popular line. Commencing with
                        the S.S. Cheshire on March 4, and until the sailing of the same ship on June
                        10, it has been arranged for the steamers to leave Port Said at a fixed and
                        regular time. They are, therefore, intended to sail as soon as passengers
                        and luggage are embarked after the arrival of the train on Sunday due at
                        Port Said at 3:30 pm.</p>
                    <p>The advantage obtained by this alteration is that the steamers will now
                        arrive in Marseil- les in time for passengers to connect with the evening
                        train on Friday for Paris, and so arrive in London on Saturday instead of
                        Sunday as heretofore.</p>

                        These letters are of the utmost import- once, providing as they do, that a
                        complete sys- tim of concealment had been organized by M. Pouter and the
                        late M. de la Bouglise and others, at the expense of Hon. A. J. Davey and
                        several of his colleagues.</p>
                    <p>We are informed that a letter in this con- nection, written by M. Poutrel,
                        contained full instructions as to the use of a private code which was to be
                        employed in combination with the ordinary code of the Scurries Company.</p>
                    <p>Another letter written by the late M. de la Bouglise, contained instructions
                        to the effect that ordinary matters of business were to be left in the hands
                        of the Hon. A. J. Davey, in the hope that he would imagine himself au
                        courant with everything and ask no questions. Important and confidential
                        matters, such as drafts, acceptances, etc., were to be kept strictly from
                        his notice.</p>
                    <p>Under these circumstances we imagine it will be difficult for the most ardent
                        supporters of M. Poutrel to contend that his dismissal was unjustifiable. We
                        understand that copies of these letters have been submitted to the Court,
                        and to Me. Guilhaumou, counsel for M. Poutrel.</p>

                        L.E. 200 has been promised to meet immediate needs. Moreover, the Financial

                        State subvention of L.E. 100 (which is the amount of the Mani cipal
                        subvention for 1905) on condition that the appeal which he understands is
                        about to be made to the public of Alexandria for sus- criptions, meets with
                        adequate response.</p>
                    <p>"As long as Alexandrians are willing, to support the society, the Government
                        will be willing to lend a helping hand, but the Government subvention if
                        contingent on the collection of an adequate amount from the local
                        public.</p>

                    <head>CONCERT AT BOULAC.</head>
                    <p>The opening concert of the season at the well-appointed Railway Institute at
                        Boulac took place last Saturday evening. There was a large attendance of
                        members and friends, many of whom had to remain on the balcony, the
                        concert-room being crowded. A capital programme had been got together and
                        was ably sustained by a company of talented and popular artistes. The
                        concert opened by a pianoforte solo by Miss Bingham, after which followed
                        two fine violin solos by Mr. Ed. Gahar, who rendered these in a very
                        effective manner. Band man Smith at once become a favorite with his song,
                        "Under the Deodeh,” and had to respond to an encore. In the second part he
                        gave the "Bes,” and again responding to an encore, gave in characteristic
                        style “imita- tions,” which was received by the audience with round after
                        round of applause. Colour Sergt. Harrington was heard to advantage in his
                        songs “Big Ben” and “Fight of Ages,” followed by Lce. Corp. Glynn, who gave
                        a capital render- ing of “Moonbeams”. Miss Bingham gave in an able manner
                        another solo, and later a duet with Miss Strachan, which was well received.
                        Gramaphone selections were given by Mr. Richard Curtis and were well
                        received by the audience. Bandsman Gibbons as ac- companist left nothing to
                        be desired. The thanks of the members are due to the popular chairman, Mr.
                        G. Walker, and an able sub- committee, of which Mr. Isop is convener, in
                        providing such a pleasant evening’s enter- tainment.</p>

                        Cario. The regi- meant was popular and efficient, alike socially and
                        professionally, and its distinguished record was upheld during its stay in
                        Cario. Brig- Gen. Bullock’s tribute to the battalion was thoroughly well
                        deserved and we need not say that Rifles had a capital send off on Tuesday
                        evening, when they entrained for Suez, where they have embarked in the
                        troop- ship Assaye for Bombay from where the battalion will rail to its new
                        station, Chan- battia.</p>
                    <p>The 2nd Battalion of the “Green Jackets” served in the Khartoum Expedition,
                        1898 includ- ing the battle of Omdurman, and subsequently was in Ladysmith,
                        throughout the siege and gallant defense helping to “keep the old flag
                        flying,” After the war it went to Cario and then Khartoum. It was last in
                        India from 1857 to 1868.</p>
