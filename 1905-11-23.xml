                        sants are traversing the country with red flags, pillaging and burning.

                    <p>The new handbook to Egypt and the Sudan, which Messrs. Thos. Cook &amp; Son
                        have just issued, is bound to be recognised as the stan- dard guide book to
                        the valley of the Nile. This new handbook has been entreated to the hands of
                        Dr. Wallis Badge, the well known savant, who is in charge of the Egyptian
                        and Assyrian antiquities in the British Museum. The new guide is a great
                        improvement on the former handbook, the greater part of it having been
                        re-written and voluminous fresh information added Foil particulars are given
                        as to Custom- house examinations and the regulations as to the exportation
                        of antiquities, special au- thorisation for this being required, and an
                        assessment of the value for export duty being necessary also. Another item
                        of interest is the advice given in the matter of suitable dress for
                        tourists, which is a matter of real im- portance to Visitors to Egypt.
                        Valuable hints are also given as to the medicines it is ad- visable to
                        provide in case of attacks from the maladies which are prevalent in Egypt,
                        such as fever, diarrhea, dysentery, etc. We do not think that any
                        information likely to be required by the tourist is omitted from this very
                        complete and interesting guide-book.</p>

                    <head>THE BIBBY LINE. </head>
                    <p>The managers of the Bibby Line inform us that they have made an important
                        improvement in the sailings of their homeward steamers, which is to come
                        into force during the busy season, and which should prove of great
                        convenience to passengers traveling by this popular line. Commencing with
                        the S.S. Cheshire on March 4, and until the sailing of the same ship on June
                        10, it has been arranged for the steamers to leave Port Said at a fixed and
                        regular time. They are, therefore, intended to sail as soon as passengers
                        and luggage are embarked after the arrival of the train on Sunday due at
                        Port Said at 3:30 pm.</p>
                    <p>The advantage obtained by this alteration is that the steamers will now
                        arrive in Marseil- les in time for passengers to connect with the evening
                        train on Friday for Paris, and so arrive in London on Saturday instead of
                        Sunday as heretofore.</p>

                    <head>(BY TELEPHONE.)</head>
                    <p>We understand that on the conclusion of the hearing of the action brought by
                        M. Pou- trel against the Hon. A. J. Davey, for wrong- fun dismissal, a
                        packet of letters bearing upon the case was handed to Maitre Carton de Wait.
                        These letters are of the utmost import- once, providing as they do, that a
                        complete sys- tim of concealment had been organized by M. Pouter and the
                        late M. de la Bouglise and others, at the expense of Hon. A. J. Davey and
                        several of his colleagues.</p>
                    <p>We are informed that a letter in this con- nection, written by M. Poutrel,
                        contained full instructions as to the use of a private code which was to be
                        employed in combination with the ordinary code of the Scurries Company.</p>
                    <p>Another letter written by the late M. de la Bouglise, contained instructions
                        to the effect that ordinary matters of business were to be left in the hands
                        of the Hon. A. J. Davey, in the hope that he would imagine himself au
                        courant with everything and ask no questions. Important and confidential
                        matters, such as drafts, acceptances, etc., were to be kept strictly from
                        his notice.</p>
                    <p>Under these circumstances we imagine it will be difficult for the most ardent
                        supporters of M. Poutrel to contend that his dismissal was unjustifiable. We
                        understand that copies of these letters have been submitted to the Court,

                        will be willing to lend a helping hand, but the Government subvention if
                        contingent on the collection of an adequate amount from the local

                        members and friends, many of whom had to remain on the balcony, the
                        concert-room being crowded. A capital programme had been got together and
                        was ably sustained by a company of talented and popular artistes. The
                        concert opened by a pianoforte solo by Miss Bingham, after which followed
                        two fine violin solos by Mr. Ed. Gahar, who rendered these in a very
                        effective manner. Band man Smith at once become a favorite with his song,
                        "Under the Deodeh,” and had to respond to an encore. In the second part he
                        gave the "Bes,” and again responding to an encore, gave in characteristic
                        style “imita- tions,” which was received by the audience with round after
                        round of applause. Colour Sergt. Harrington was heard to advantage in his
                        songs “Big Ben” and “Fight of Ages,” followed by Lce. Corp. Glynn, who gave
                        a capital render- ing of “Moonbeams”. Miss Bingham gave in an able manner
                        another solo, and later a duet with Miss Strachan, which was well received.
                        Gramaphone selections were given by Mr. Richard Curtis and were well
                        received by the audience. Bandsman Gibbons as ac- companist left nothing to
                        be desired. The thanks of the members are due to the popular chairman, Mr.
                        G. Walker, and an able sub- committee, of which Mr. Isop is convener, in
