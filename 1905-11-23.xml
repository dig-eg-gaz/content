                    <p>The new handbook to Egypt and the Sudan, which Messrs. Thos. Cook &amp; Son
                        have just issued, is bound to be recognised as the stan- dard guide book to
                        the valley of the Nile. This new handbook has been entreated to the hands of
                        Dr. Wallis Badge, the well known savant, who is in charge of the Egyptian
                        and Assyrian antiquities in the British Museum. The new guide is a great
                        improvement on the former handbook, the greater part of it having been
                        re-written and voluminous fresh information added Foil particulars are given
                        as to Custom- house examinations and the regulations as to the exportation
                        of antiquities, special au- thorisation for this being required, and an
                        assessment of the value for export duty being necessary also. Another item
                        of interest is the advice given in the matter of suitable dress for
                        tourists, which is a matter of real im- portance to Visitors to Egypt.
                        Valuable hints are also given as to the medicines it is ad- visable to
                        provide in case of attacks from the maladies which are prevalent in Egypt,
                        such as fever, diarrhea, dysentery, etc. We do not think that any
                        information likely to be required by the tourist is omitted from this very
                        complete and interesting guide-book.</p>

                    <p>The managers of the Bibby Line inform us that they have made an important
                        improvement in the sailings of their homeward steamers, which is to come
                        into force during the busy season, and which should prove of great
                        convenience to passengers traveling by this popular line. Commencing with
                        the S.S. Cheshire on March 4, and until the sailing of the same ship on June
                        10, it has been arranged for the steamers to leave Port Said at a fixed and
                        regular time. They are, therefore, intended to sail as soon as passengers
                        and luggage are embarked after the arrival of the train on Sunday due at
                        Port Said at 3:30 pm.</p>
                    <p>The advantage obtained by this alteration is that the steamers will now
                        arrive in Marseil- les in time for passengers to connect with the evening
                        train on Friday for Paris, and so arrive in London on Saturday instead of

                        the following note:—</p>
                    <p>"We are glad to be able to announce that an appeal to the Government on
                        behalf of our society has met with a favorable response, and a donation of
                        L.E. 200 has been promised to meet immediate needs. Moreover, the Financial
                        Adviser authorises us to state that he is willing to recommend an annual
                        State subvention of L.E. 100 (which is the amount of the Mani cipal
                        subvention for 1905) on condition that the appeal which he understands is
                        about to be made to the public of Alexandria for sus- criptions, meets with
                        adequate response.</p>
                    <p>"As long as Alexandrians are willing, to support the society, the Government
                        will be willing to lend a helping hand, but the Government subvention if
                        contingent on the collection of an adequate amount from the local
                        public.</p>
                    <p>"In the opinion of the Adviser the L.E. 50 or L.E. 60 at present collected

                    <head>CONCERT AT BOULAC.</head>
                    <p>The opening concert of the season at the well-appointed Railway Institute at
                        Boulac took place last Saturday evening. There was a large attendance of
                        members and friends, many of whom had to remain on the balcony, the
                        concert-room being crowded. A capital programme had been got together and
                        was ably sustained by a company of talented and popular artistes. The
                        concert opened by a pianoforte solo by Miss Bingham, after which followed
                        two fine violin solos by Mr. Ed. Gahar, who rendered these in a very
                        effective manner. Band man Smith at once become a favorite with his song,
                        "Under the Deodeh," and had to respond to an encore. In the second part he
                        gave the "Bes," and again responding to an encore, gave in characteristic
                        style "imita- tions," which was received by the audience with round after
                        round of applause. Colour Sergt. Harrington was heard to advantage in his
                        songs "Big Ben" and "Fight of Ages," followed by Lce. Corp. Glynn, who gave
                        a capital rendering of "Moonbeams". Miss Bingham gave in an able manner
                        another solo, and later a duet with Miss Strachan, which was well received.
                        Gramaphone selections were given by Mr. Richard Curtis and were well
                        received by the audience. Bandsman Gibbons as ac- companist left nothing to
                        be desired. The thanks of the members are due to the popular chairman, Mr.
                        G. Walker, and an able sub- committee, of which Mr. Isop is convener, in
                        providing such a pleasant evening's enter- tainment.</p>

                        Cario. The regi- meant was popular and efficient, alike socially and
                        professionally, and its distinguished record was upheld during its stay in
                        Cario. Brig- Gen. Bullock's tribute to the battalion was thoroughly well
                        deserved and we need not say that Rifles had a capital send off on Tuesday
                        evening, when they entrained for Suez, where they have embarked in the
                        troop- ship Assaye for Bombay from where the battalion will rail to its new
                        station, Chan- battia.</p>
                    <p>The 2nd Battalion of the "Green Jackets" served in the Khartoum Expedition,
                        1898 including the battle of Omdurman, and subsequently was in Ladysmith,
                        throughout the siege and gallant defense helping to "keep the old flag
                        flying," After the war it went to Cario and then Khartoum. It was last in
                        India from 1857 to 1868.</p>

                    <p>mari, elle fat l'objet d'une démarche singulière de la part de son propre
                        frère, un certain M. Weiss, qui demanda à prendre tous les papier du défunt,
                        touchant l'entreprise de Suez, pou les remettre à Revoltella.</p>
                    <p>La veuve, confiante, les octroya sans dif ficulté. Le 28 février 1859,
                        Revoltella lui écrivit une lettre où il lui annonçait que cinq parts de
                        fondateur lui étaient allouées en souvenir des services rendus par son mari,
                        ainsi qu'une somme de 20,000 francs qui, seale, fat touchée par elle.
                        Revoltella spécifiait que cette attribution était faite à titre de "donation
                        personnelle"."</p>
                    <p>Plus tard, vers la fin de 1861, le banquier pria Mme de Negrelli de lui faire
                        parvenir tous les renseignements nécessaires pour immatriculer cinq
                        nouvelles parta de fond teurs au nom des héritiers du chevalier de
                        Negrelli.</p>
                    <p>Craignant que cette nouvelle allocation re se confondit avec la première, la
                        veuve, pour dissiper toate équivoque, fit part de ses doutes à Revoltella
                        qui, le 25 octobre 1861, lui affirma l'indépendance des deux
                        attributions.</p>
                    <p>Mme de Negrelli apprit également que les cinq parts dévolues aux héritiers
                        avaient été expédiées au baron de Haerdt, choisi par eux comme représentant
                        et avocat.</p>
                    <p>Après le règlement des droits de succession, la veuve attendit que Revoltella
                        lni remit sa propre donation. Elle avait confiance dans son banquier et dans
                        l'ami intime de son mari, et le temps s'écoula.</p>
                    <p>Vera le milieu de 1869, ayant appris la ma- adie de Revoltella, elle lai
                        écrivit, mais os fat 'son secrétaire, Marassig, qui lui répondit. Dans sa
                        lettre, il parlait des titres "dévolus à la succession," et comme Mme de
                        Negrelli demandait des explications, Marussig répondit qu'il y avait
                        confusion entre les parts des héri- tiers et celles dévolues à la veuve.</p>
                    <p>Quelques jours après, Revoltella mourut et le mystère continus.</p>
                    <p>En 1876, cependant, l'attention de Mme de Negrelli se porta encore sur les
                        parts de fondateur qui semblaient devoir produire bientôt un dividende. Elle
                        écrivit respec- tueusement à M. de Lesseps qui, comme Marussig, affirma la
                        confusion des droits de. la veuve et de ceux des héritiers. C'était la
                        négation des lettres de Revoltella.</p>
                    <p>Quelque temps après, Mme de Negrelli mourait sans avoir osé faire un procès,
                        mais convaincue de son dépouillement.</p>
                    <p>Elle laissait heureusement une fille, Mme veuve Grois, née Marie de Negrelli,
                        remar- quable autant par son intelligence que par son inlassable
                        volonté.</p>
                    <p>Grâce à ses recherches constantes et obsti- nées, elle finit par apprendre le
                        rôle joué par son père dans l'entreprise de Suez, l'adoption de son projet
                        de canal sans écluses et l'attribu- tion à lui faite de vingt parta de
                        fondateur, dont les héritiers avaient été frustrés....</p>
                    <p>Il ne m'est guère possible, à cause du défact de place, de relever ici tous
                        les détails de ses minutieuses investigations. L'essentiel est de Bavoir que
                        la fille du chevalier arriva à des con- olusions certaines, étayées sur des
                        faits nou- veaux. Elle fut aidée, dans son œuvre difficile, par son
                        gouvernement et l'appui d'amis fidèles et dévoués, respectueux de la mémoire
                        de son illustre père.</p>
                    <p>Convainene, de la façon la plus absolue, que celui-ci faisait partie de la
                        liste primitive des fondateurs, elle demanda à la Compagnie de Snez la
                        communication de cette pièce, dont la disparition fat avoués. Parmi les
                        découvertes de Mme de Negrelli, il convient, cependant, de citer la lettre
                        de M. Ferdinand de Lesseps, du! 24 septembre 1858, au chevalier de Negrelli,
                        où il disait: "vous êtes inscrit sur le registre des fondateurs pour dix
                        actions de fondateur, le baron de Brack pour dix également et le che valier
                        de Revoltella pour cinq".</p>
                    <p>Mme de Negrelli soutint alors que la liste des fondateurs était fausse. Après
                        avoir con- aulté le procureur général de Narbourg, elle porta une plainte, à
                        Paris, en mai 1901, et, le 15 mai de la même année, la chambre des mises en
                        accusation rendait un arrêt dont il convient de détacher l'attenda
                        suivant:</p>
                    <p>-Attenda que la lettre rapprochée: 1° du rapport général de Lesseps, adressée
                        le 30 avril 1855 an vice-roi; 2 du-décret vice-royal du 19 mai 1855; 3° de
                        la lettre de Ferdinand de Lessepe en date du 20 octobre 1860, à Koenig Berg
                        rend vraisemblable l'existence dès le mois d'avril 1855 d'une liste de
                        soixante membres fondateurs, arrêtée par le vice-roi et l'inscription sur
                        cette liste du chevalier de. Negrelli. Cette lettre étant de nature à donner
                        aux faits de nouveaux développements utiles à la manifestation de la vérité,
                        constitue une charge nouvelle.</p>
                    <p>C'est la découverte de tous ces faits non- veaux, qu'il n'est pas possible
                        d'étudier dana tous ses détails, qui est la base de la requête civile
                        d'aujourd'hui, dirigée contre l'arrêt du 22 mai 1896, que nous rappelions au
                        débat. Mais qui n'entend qu'une cloche n'entend qu'un son, et la suite des
                        débats éclairera peat-être cette affaire, plus que mystérieuse, d'an jour
                        nouveau.</p>
                    <p>La plaidoirie de Me Maurice Tézenas, pour la comtesse de Negrelli, a déjà
                        occupé deux audiences; Me Chena qui soutient également la même thèse, a
                        plaidé tout l'après-midi d'hier et terminera à huitaine.</p>
                    <p>La parole sera ensuite donnée à Me Barboux, défenseur de la Compagnie de

                    <p>The demand for Egyptian cotton has been quieter this week, and the quotations

                        market this week opened strong and active, and prices advanced 78 points,
                        touching the highest figure so far this season. The advance induced
                        extensive liquidation, and prices fell away sharply, falling fally 30 points
                        from the top rates; later a steadier feeling has prevailed, and there has
                        been a recovery of a few points. To-day's closing values are 28 @ 29 points
                        below those of last Thursday. The Bureau Report giving a condition of 68.8,
                        was higher than expected; it indicates a crop of about 11 millions, and has
                        undoubtedly somewhat shaken faith in the very small crop esti- mates, and in
                        the probability of much higher values. At the same time the South is holding
                        cotton firmly for higher prices, so that ope- rators, in view of the
                        satisfactory trade con- ditions, are not inclined to sell short. We look for
                        constantly fluctuating markets within moderate limits for the immediate
                        future, until later information enables one to form a more definite
