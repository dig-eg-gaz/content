Any Excuse for a Holiday appears to be
the prevailing idea among officials in Egypt
Not content with closing all the Ministries on

the great night of the monied was on Tuesday.

Murder at Alexandria.—A murder was
committed in the Souk el Bersim quarter of
Alexandria yesterday, when a native porter
stabbed a native baker in the abdomen, tho
latter being killed on the spot. The murderer
was arrested, and on being questioned as to
the motive of bis crime stated that his victim
had had improper relations with his wife.
Mouled en-Nebi.—The attendance at the
fantasia which yearly takes place at Abbassieh
on the occasion of the Mouled en-Nebi seemed
to be a record one. An unending string of
trams and carriages, crowded to their utmost
capacity, emptied themselves of their heavy
loads of passengers at this spot,and the number
of those who wended their way on foot was
<head>NEW RECTSUDAN MAIL SERVICE</head>
The LewSuez-Suakin direct service to which
we alluded some days ago is now in operation,
and the departures from Suez take place on
Wednesday afternoon, after the arrival of the
Cairo train, instead of on Thursday as formerly,
thus connecting with the arrival of the P. and
0. Brindisi mail without loss of time.
The direct steamer leaves on alternate weeks,
and is due at Port Sudan on the following
Saturday morning, when a steam launch meets
her and delivers the mail in Snakin a few
hours later. The steamer herself proceeds to
Snakin the next day, and sails again thence
on Wednesday at noon and from Port Sudan
in the evening being at Suez on Saturday
morning. Thus passengers can now go to
Snakin and get back within 10 days, with a
sufficient interval for business purposes both
there and at Port Sudan, and with this service
passengers and mails will be delivered four
days earlier than under the former arrange-
ments.
The S.S. "Dakahlieh” will shortly pass t&
canal to take np this direct service, which
until her arrival is being carried on by the
“Maballah."
We understand the Egyptian Government
h8s granted the Khedivial Company an annual
subvention of LE. 5,000 for this new direct
line.
The general manager, Mr. Parkinson, and
the sub manager, Ahmed Bey, have just re-
turned from Snakin and Port Sudan, where
they have made arrangements in this connec-
tion with the Sudan authorities, and with a
view to facilitate the operations of merchants
the company have decided to grant important
redactions in their tariffs both for goods and
passengers, the new rates coming into force
from the 1st proximo.
The ordinary fortnightly sailings to Snakin,
vift Jeddah, continuing on to Massowah, Ho-
tl. idab, and Aden, take place in the interven-
ing weeks between the direct sailings, and in
addition to the above, the company will
despatch in the week of tho direct steamer to
Suakin another steamer to Jeddah and the
ports fin tlier south if required, thus putting
all ports in the Red Sea practically in weekly
communication with Suez and with each other.
We congratulate both the Government and
!he company upon these results and feel sure
that tho latter will find that by meeting all
reasonable demands of the trading community,
and even at some temporary sacrifice removing
all cause of _ complaint with regard to their
rates and the previously irregular intervals in
sailing-*, they will eventually reap the
reward of their enterprise.
PORT SAID DEVELOPMENT.
Enolish Language in Mixed Tribunals’
—The decree admitting the English language
to rank as official in the Mixed Tribunals
coming into vigour this morning, the use
of that language was inaugurated by Mr. P.
Plunkett presenting in the registry of the
Commercial Court of First Instance at Cairo
an application for the registration of his
well-known trade mark "An Dd Ronge” as
applicable to all linen, cotton, and woven
stuffs, fancy goods, hosiery, laces, and mer-
cer’s goods of every description manufactured
by or for him or imported by him. The
tribunal officials were ready for the occasion
and passed the “acte” of registration without a
hitch.
Windsor Hotel.—The management of this
hotel have arranged to give open-air concerts
by a specially selected orchestra on the
verandah every evening during the summer
months, commencing on Sunday next. The
orchestra will play between 6 p.m. and mid-
night, and tho concerts should prove a great at-
traction for those who wish to escape from the
sultriness of the city. The hotel, being situated
on tho new quay, is exposed ''t?* the cool sea
breezes, and diners-out should not fail to
patronise tho Windsor Hotel verandah on a
hot evening. The hotel has undergone exten-
sive alterations and improvements of late,
which make it one of the beat-appointed hotel-
ries in Alexandria and its neighbourhood. The
dining-room, for instance, has been painted
and decorated in such a way as to render it
one of the handsomest dining-rooms in the
country.
A “8oib£e Noire" was held the other
evening at the ‘■Theatre des Noaveantes,’’
Cairo. The performance calls for but little
remark : it is almost sufficient to say that
it was os poor as the average entertainment
given by this house. It Uie success of snob a
performance depends upon tho letting fall of
a number of remarks suggestive, to say the
least of it, of indecency, the management can
congratulate themselves upon having given
a good entertainment from their point of view.
Doubtless the artistes who were responsible
for these remarks regarded them as supremely
witty, bat to badge from the very scanty
applause with which the meager audience
greeted them it would be well for-the directors
of the Nonveautes to recognise that Cairenes
look for a somewhat higher class of entertain-
ment. We might also suggest that they should
engage an orchestra which is capable of keep-
ing in time and in tune with the singers.

It is intended to finish Port Said with greatly
increased railway conveniences for tourists.
Towards the end of 1906 tourists will be con-
veyed from the boat at Port Said by a train
in waiting at the new quay station, which is
to be built. The station will be on the land-
ing stage and only a step from the steamer to
the train. The Customs will be practically on
the platform and the idea is to afford the
same facilities for travellers as at Tilbury
Docks.
<head>THE PIGMIES</head>
As already announced, Col. Harrison’s pig-
mies left Cairo for Port Said by the 6.15 p.m.
train on Tuesday. They spent the night at
Port Said and left there yesterday for London
by the Bine Funnel liner "Orestes." They are
being taken to England under the arrange-
ments of Messrs. Cook. One of Messrs. Cook’s
dragomans is accompanying the pigmies to
London. The party consists of four men and
two women, and special arrangements have
been made for their catering and comfort on
board.
The pigmies appear to be in good spirits
and wore greatly interested in their departure.
Tho men were dressed in native Egyptian garb
with a sort of t urban in their heads. Tho women
were in long white robes.
<head>THE “SOLDIER’S FROLIC”.</head>
The unfortunate case of drunken rowdyism
on the part of a soldier belonging to the Army
of Occupation in Cairo on the night of the
centenary fete has led to considerable com-
ment. The fact is, of course, that the British
soldier in Egypt is supposed to be snob a
putem of respectability that when one does
run amuck far more attention is paid to his
unwonted proceedings than would be • the
case if such eccentricity of behaviour wore an
every-day occurrence. The most disgraceful
part of the incident was tho non-interference
of four of his fellow-soldiers, who were passing
at the moment. The right course to have
taken would have been for these four men to
have prevented their comrade from raising
such an uproar. The statement, which appear-
ed in our issue of Tuesday last, was in no way
exaggerated, and we sincerely hope that an
incident will never occur again.

arrival. His Highness drove straight to the
tent of the Sheikh Said el-Bakri, where he
passed more than an hour, and then retamed

<head>MILITARY BAND PERFORMANCE.</head>
At the general request of the public, and
with the concurrence of the conductors of the
bands of the Inniskilling Fusiliers and the
King’s Royal Rifles, the bi-weekly programme
of music to be played in the Esbekieh Gardens
on Taesdays and Fridays will appear in this
paper on Mondays and Thursdays invariably,
and not on Tuesdays and Fridays as was the
case sometimes last year.
The band of the King’s Royal Rifles will
play every Tuesday evening under the con-
daotorebip of Mr. J. Brown and that of the
Inniskilling Fasiliera under Mr. Ramsay on
Fridays.
A new and permanent bandstand has taken
the place of the temporary wooden one which
was used last year and a new cafe has also
been constructed, where refreshments are served
at moderate prices. The cafe is a fine and
spacious one, and is provided with a broad
terrace, and chairs and tables are also placed
on the paving below. Those who come to hear
the band,and are willing to spend an extra two
piastres for a seat, will find themselves well
accommodated on the roof of the cafe. Both
the bandstand and cafe are well illuminated
with electric light.
On Tuesday night the band of the King’s
Royal Rifles gave an excellent programme, but
the attendance was somewhat poor, doubtless
because it is not generally known that these
band nights have begun.
By kind permission of Major C. J. L David-
sod, D.S.O., commanding, and Officers 2nd
Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, the Band will
perform the following selection of music in the

<head>GREAT RISE IN PRICES.</head>
(From our Correspondent).
Snakin, May 10.
The British steamer "Fortnna," late of
Bell’s Asia Minor Steamship Co., arrived
here from Suez on the 1st inst, with a consign-
ment of timber, etc., and left again for Suez
on 4th inst., with a full cargo of sheep and
cattle. The export of cattle has raised the
price of meat here .from P.T. 2 i per oke to
P.T. 5 per oke.
Owing to the great number of people that
come here now by every steamer for Snakin
and Port Sndan, the price for onions and
potatoes (imported from Egypt) is now treble
the price in Egypt. I think the Government
onght to look into this for some Government
employes receive very small salaries, and rail-
way workmen accepted low wages last year
owiDg to cheap living. Now that there is
so great a difference, several have resigned
owing to not getting an inorease of salary.
<head>RAILWAY AND TELEGRAPH.</head>
El Miralai Macauley Bey, R.E., Director
of Sndan Railways, left here for Port Sndan
via Sallom station by rail on the 4th inst, ac-
companied by El Kaimakam Turner Bey,
Director of Sndan Posts and Telegraphs. From
Sallom station camels conveyed them to Port
Sudan to enable them to study the road on
whioh the railway and telegraph line will be
laid as far as Port Sudan. They returned on
the 6th bat.
<head>PORT SUDAN.</head>
By the S.S. “Fayonm,” whioh arrived here
from 8nez on the 3rd inst, came a great number
of masons, carpenters, smiths, etc., for work
at Port Sndan. Amongst these were Messrs.
Cavalotti and Battiate, engineers, who were
here last year in connection with the building
of the National Bank of Egypt and the qua-
rantine camp under Messrs. Kaol, Corbetta
and Co.
Messrs. Albert Frank and Co., merchants
and steamship agents, have been fortunate
enough to obtain the contract from the
Government to build a quarantine station at
Port Sudan for LE. 8,000 and have engaged
under this contract the well-known Italian
engineer Cav. Gnido Corbetta, late of Messrs.
G. Kanl and Co., of Alexandria.
<head>SMALLPOX AND CHICKEN-POX.</head>
Two more oases of small-pox occurred
amongst the Sudanese pilgrims in quarantine.
The crisis is now over, however, and the
health of the pilgrims is very good.
Chicken-pox has made its appearance here,
and in order to prevent the disease spreading
the following notice has appeared from the
Mondirieh, in Arabic and English :—
"There are several cases of chicken-pox in
Suakin. The symptoms are slight fever, with
spots on the body. The medical officer should
at once be informed of any case occurring like
this. Any one found willfully neglecting to
report a case will be punished. This disease is
very infections. It has no connection with
small-pox and vaccination is in no sense a
preventative. Vaccination is performed solely
for the prevention of small-pox.”

(From our Financial Correspondent).
London, May 12.
The main factors are the same as reported
last week—uncertainty, nervous tension, an-
xious waiting on events in the East; with
the same result, viz., market paralysis, unwil-
ling sales, no will to buy, depressed prioes.
The Settlement that finishes to-day has
been, to say the least of it, an uncomforta-
ble one. The heavy fall in the American
market made speculative aooonnts show con-
siderable losses; in order to meet which
stocks were thrown overboard in other sec-
tions, and, in the absence of publio support,
these sales told more heavily than wonld
have been the case in active markets. Added
to this unsatisfactory state of fin*nm>l affaire,
we had the various rumours of possible com-
plications in the Far East. Fortunately, thanks
to the excellent understanding now existing
between ourselves and our neighbour Franoe,
these rumours need not have been taken
seriously, as it since became evident, and
although the situation has been delicate it
was not really dangerous.
Egyptian stocks, as we have before pointed
out, are enabled to stand clear of snow
market breaks as we have just had, owing
to the fact there is no open speculative
account here, and that the principal stocks
are in strong hands. Prices have consequently
held good, and show little change,
shares, in fact, making an advance, Nationals
at 27 } and Agrionltnrals at 13
Egyptian mining shares are still doll and
neglected, with the other mining markets.
Amongst the various new companies, Egyptian
Estates are weak at par.
Next week the new 3} per cent. Debenture
issue of the Land Bank of Egypt made its
appearance, partly in Paris, where it is expect-
ed that the 500-frano share will be offered at
475 franos. Money is plentiful in Paris just
now, and this ought to prove attractive.
Many new Egyptian enterprises are ''hatch- .
mg," bat, being largely under-written, they
will not require much public money, and will
no doubt go off as soon as they are "out" We
do not regret this, and repeat that, with judi-
oious management, there is ample scope in
Egypt and Sudan for the profitable investment
of money.
