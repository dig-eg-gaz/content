                            <p>Mr. BALFOUR'S SPEECH. The home papers to hand miming contain full
                                report! of Mr. Balfour’s greit speech in the House of Commous this
                                day week. The Prime Minister's speeoh was a double triumph—for the
                                speaker himself, and for principles with which the party he repre-
                                sents has ever been specially identifiel. It was a personal triumph,
                                inaamuoh as it showed Mr. Balfou'r at his best, rising above the
                                littleness of the daily strife of parties—wherein, for all his skill
                                in debate, the Premier does not exoel because he does not care for
                                the gamo—and sunning himself ia the largo liberty of a theme of
                                permanent patriotic interest of supremo importance. Mr. Balfour is
                                at home on the heights, and thithor, last Thursday, he was able not
                                only to lead that party which stands in a special sense for the care
                                of National and Imperial defeuoe, but to do much more. Ho led even
                                those who habitually affeot to regard the integrity of our Islands
                                and of the British Empire as a matter for which we, like the lilies
                                of the field, need toil not neither spin, beoause there is a law of
                                nature by which 8amson, in all his strength, was not arrayed in suoh
                                I armour of proof as envelops the United King- dom and the vast
                                collection of dependencies which it has, almost unconsciously and
                                wholly unintentionally, gathered round it</p>
                            <p>However, Mr. Balfour carried the wholeHouse with him, which, we
                                repeat «u a triumph for him an4 for the party which does like
                                Imperial- ism, rightly understood, njnoh—and muoh more to that
                                Furthermore, his speech, as the ■‘Times’’ says, marks a stago in the
                                history of the question of Imperial defence. Why so I Beoause it
                                induced the House of Commons to •ooopt the principle which underlies
                                the crea- tion of the Imperial Defeuoe Committee. We hare but to
                                look back a very few years to realise that the mere creation of a
                                permanent oonsultative body, instead of the tampon cowritters,
                                dealing with questions, having no continuous existence and keeping
                                no continuous records, which was all we ever had before, constitutes
                                a veritable revolution in our procedure. Time was, and not very long
                                ago, when aU the Departments would have arisen and prophesied
                                concerning it that it was a most un-British institution - as,
                                indeed, we are not sure that it is not—aud that we might very weU
                                have gone on as we did, not merely iD pre-Crimean days, but even for
                                thirty years after the war of 1870, and all that followed it, should
                                have roused us to a sense of the realities of the age we live in.
                                Well, God be thanked for our good amends ! As the result of a tardy
                                national awakening we have got a Navy, and there is some hope that,
                                in the course of time, we may even get an Army as weU. Before we do
                                so, however, it is desirable, not to say necessary, that we should
                                know for what precise object we require the land forces for which we
                                pay at present £53,000,000 per annum without getting value for one
                                money. That object, as Mr. Balfour tells us, must be considered from
                                the stand- points of home, colonial, and Indian defence. : As to the
                                Colonies, their fate must depend on that of the mother country: if
                                once England received that “blow over the heart" against which the
                                late Lord Salisbury warned her, ihe individual power of any Colony
                                to resist an enemy would avail no little. To avert the "blow over
                                the heart”—successful invasion of the British islands—we may, Mr.
                                Balfour holds, depend upon the Navy: we do not need an Army for home
                                defense. In his opinion, which is that of the Committee, "serious
                                invasion of. these islands is not an eventuality which we need
                                seriously consider.” Given a sufficiently powerful Navy, that
                                conclu- sion may be accepted without demur, albeit we should be
                                considerably surprised to learn that military entire on the
                                Continent are prepared henceforward to regard successful invasion of
                                England as outside the sphere of praoticsl politics. Let ns here, by
                                the way, congratulate Mr. Balfour upon the admirable tone of his
                                theoretical reference to France as the moat obvious quarter when the
                                invasion most, owing to geographical conditions, be looked for. That
                                a»nmption—happily, now, parely theoretical—need not, of
                                ooarse,exoluda an intelligent appreciation of the foot that Franoe
                                is not the only Continental Power with a greatNavyand with ports
                                oonveniently situat- ed in rather close proximity to the shore of
                                Eng- land. On that latter snbjeot the silence ot the Premier is,
                                perhaps, not lees significant than words would have been—and
                                oonsiderebly lees liable to misconstruction. Wherefore we must again
                                congratulate. It was, however, with the military requirements of the
                                North-West frontier of India that Mr. Balfour was mainly condemed.
                                He showed, in language of the utmost courtesy, but of unflinchiug
                                firmness, that England oan permit no ’extension of the powerful
                                Russian railway system, which has already reached the Afghan border,
                                into the territories of the Ameer. Afghanistan must remain the
                                "glacis,” as Ljrd Cureon has called it, across whioh no possible
                                enemy can be allowed, in peaoe time, to creep np to the walls of the
                                Indian fortress. We cannot be too thankful to Mr. Balfonr for having
                                laid down that fundamental proposition in absolutely unmistakable
                                terms. To do that was all the more necessary because our inevitable
                                result of the present war in the Par East must be to throw the
                                expansive energy of Russia baok upon the Middle East. It is towards
                                India, aud towards the Per- sian Gulf, that Russian ambition will
                                ne- cessarily look, and it will be for us to see to it that Russia
                                shall not find in either of those directions her line of least
                                resistance That is a theme which might be discussed at any length ;
                                for the preseut we have only to thank the Prime Minister for his
                                luminous and comprehensive exposition of that whole pro- blem ol the
                                defense of the Empire which must be the permanent object of the
                                solicitude of a strong and continuous military policy.</p>

                            baker in the abdomen, tho latter being killed on the spot. The murderer

                        <p>Windsor Hotel.—The management of this hotel have arranged to give

                            every evening during the summer months, commencing on Sunday next. The
                            orchestra will play between 6 p.m. and mid- night, and tho concerts
                            should prove a great at- traction for those who wish to escape from the
                            sultriness of the city. The hotel, being situated on tho new quay, is
                            exposed ''t?* the cool sea breezes, and diners-out should not fail to
                            patronise tho Windsor Hotel verandah on a hot evening. The hotel has
                            undergone exten- sive alterations and improvements of late, which make
                            it one of the beat-appointed hotel- ries in Alexandria and its
                            neighbourhood. The dining-room, for instance, has been painted and
                            decorated in such a way as to render it one of the handsomest
                            dining-rooms in the country.</p>
                        <p>A “Soire Noire" was held the other evening at the Theatre des
                            Noaveantes,’’ Cairo. The performance calls for but little remark : it is
                            almost sufficient to say that it was os poor as the average
                            entertainment given by this house. It Uie success of snob a performance
                            depends upon tho letting fall of a number of remarks suggestive, to say
                            the least of it, of indecency, the management can congratulate
                            themselves upon having given a good entertainment from their point of
                            view. Doubtless the artistes who were responsible for these remarks
                            regarded them as supremely witty, bat to badge from the very scanty
                            applause with which the meager audience greeted them it would be well
                            for-the directors of the Nonveautes to recognise that Cairenes look for
                            a somewhat higher class of entertain- ment. We might also suggest that
                            they should engage an orchestra which is capable of keep- ing in time
                            and in tune with the singers.</p>

                            night of the centenary fete has led to considerable com- ment. The fact

                            a putem of respectability that when one does run amuck far more
                            attention is paid to his unwonted proceedings than would be • the case
                            if such eccentricity of behaviour wore an every-day occurrence. The most
                            disgraceful part of the incident was tho non-interference of four of his
                            fellow-soldiers, who were passing at the moment. The right course to
                            have taken would have been for these four men to have prevented their

                        <p>MILITARY BAND PERFORMANCE. At the general request of the public, and with
                            the concurrence of the conductors of the bands of the Inniskilling
                            Fusiliers and the King’s Royal Rifles, the bi-weekly programme of music
                            to be played in the Esbekieh Gardens on Taesdays and Fridays will appear
                            in this paper on Mondays and Thursdays invariably, and not on Tuesdays
                            and Fridays as was the case sometimes last year. The band of the King’s
                            Royal Rifles will play every Tuesday evening under the leadership of Mr.
                            J. Brown and that of the Inniskilling Fasiliera under Mr. Ramsay on
                            Fridays.</p>
                        <p>A new and permanent bandstand has taken the place of the temporary wooden
                            one which was used last year and a new cafe has also been constructed,
                            where refreshments are served at moderate prices. The cafe is a fine and
                            spacious one, and is provided with a broad terrace, and chairs and
                            tables are also placed on the paving below. Those who come to hear the
                            band,and are willing to spend an extra two piastres for a seat, will
                            find themselves well accommodated on the roof of the cafe. Both the
                            bandstand and cafe are well illuminated with electric light.</p>
                        <p>On Tuesday night the band of the King’s Royal Rifles gave an excellent
                            programme, but the attendance was somewhat poor, doubtless because it is
                            not generally known that these band nights have begun. By kind

                        <p>GREAT RISE IN PRICES. (From our Correspondent). Snakin, May 10. The
                            British steamer "Fortnna," late of Bell’s Asia Minor Steamship Co.,
                            arrived here from Suez on the 1st inst, with a consign- ment of timber,
                            etc., and left again for Suez on 4th inst., with a full cargo of sheep
                            and cattle. The export of cattle has raised the price of meat here .from
                            P.T. 2 i per oke to P.T. 5 per oke.</p>
                        <p>Owing to the great number of people that come here now by every steamer
                            for Snakin and Port Sndan, the price for onions and potatoes (imported
                            from Egypt) is now treble the price in Egypt. I think the Government
                            onght to look into this for some Government employes receive very small
                            salaries, and rail- way workmen accepted low wages last year owiDg to
                            cheap living. Now that there is so great a difference, several have
                            resigned owing to not getting an increase of salary.</p>

                            following notice has appeared from the Mondirieh, in Arabic and English

                            slight fever, with spots on the body. The medical officer should at once
                            be informed of any case occurring like this. Any one found willfully

                            <p>The main factors are the same as reported last week—uncertainty,
                                nervous tension, an- xious waiting on events in the East; with the
                                same result, viz., market paralysis, unwil- ling sales, no will to
                                buy, depressed prioes. The Settlement that finishes to-day has been,
                                to say the least of it, an uncomforta- ble one. The heavy fall in
                                the American market made speculative accounts show con- siderable
                                losses; in order to meet which stocks were thrown overboard in other
                                sec- tions, and, in the absence of publio support, these sales told
                                more heavily than wonld have been the case in active markets. Added
                                to this unsatisfactory state of fin*nm>l affaire, we had the various
                                rumours of possible com- plications in the Far East. Fortunately,
                                thanks to the excellent understanding now existing between ourselves
                                and our neighbour France, these rumours need not have been taken
                                seriously, as it since became evident, and although the situation
                                has been delicate it was not really dangerous.</p>
                            <p>Egyptian stocks, as we have before pointed out, are enabled to stand
                                clear of snow market breaks as we have just had, owing to the fact
                                there is no open speculative account here, and that the principal
                                stocks are in strong hands. Prices have consequently held good, and
                                show little change, shares, in fact, making an advance, Nationals at
                                27 } and Agrionltnrals at 13 Egyptian mining shares are still doll
                                and neglected, with the other mining markets. Amongst the various
                                new companies, Egyptian Estates are weak at par.</p>
                            <p>Next week the new 3} per cent. Debenture issue of the Land Bank of
                                Egypt made its appearance, partly in Paris, where it is expect- ed
                                that the 500-franc share will be offered at 475 francs. Money is
                                plentiful in Paris just now, and this ought to prove attractive.
                                Many new Egyptian enterprises are ''hatch- . mg," bat, being largely
                                under-written, they will not require much public money, and will no
                                doubt go off as soon as they are "out" We do not regret this, and
                                repeat that, with judi- oious management, there is ample scope in

                    <p>OUR LONDON LETTER. ( From Our Correspondent .) London, May 11. The most
                        serious factor in the neutrality question is the growing anger of Japan at
                        the help which Fruneo seems to be giving Admiral Rodjestvensky, or allowing
                        him to take. Our allies, as is perhaps not unnatural in the air
                        circumstances, have shown a certain inability ft) appreciate the extreme
                        delicacy of European diplomacy. They were irritated because wo did not speak
                        more strongly to Russia. It is not to be expected that they should preserve
                        their equanimity at the inaction of France. Nor can France herself rest and
                        be satisfied much longer. She has an imperative duty to perform. But the
                        Japanese must not forget — and their high official representatives no doubt
                        recognize the responsibility as clearly as any- body that in protesting with
                        undue vehe- mence they will be playing Russia’s game. A drastic policy
                        against France might drawGreat Britain also into the confliot, and then
                        Russia’s extreme difficulties would be over. Her face would be saved. And
                        what matter if other people's countenances became downcast 1 We believe
                        Japan will proceed cautiously, and, on the other hand, have equal faith that
                        France will see the situation in its proper light. Europe has batter cause
                        than over to be grate- ful that M. Delcasse retained office. He is an asset
                        on the side of honesty and peace. The fact that Japan is England’s ally is
                        not sufficient to account for English enthusiasm over the victories of Togo
                        and Oyama. There are other reasons: among them the national habit of being
                        on the side of the “little chap,” and natural pleasure of seeing a bluffing
                        bully brought to earth. Can it be, as Quida suggests iu the “Fortnightly,”
                        that we have allowed sentiment to over balance judgment! The prophetess
                        foretells woe, and nothing bat woe, as the consequence of Japan’s triumph. A
                        terrible fate is preparing for us while we are congratulating the real foe.
                        If the yellow race is superior to the white, then must the white go to the
                        wall. If we think that, having tasted blood and the joy of conquest, the
                        Japanese will return to the painting of chrysanthemums and the making of
                        tea-trays, we are sadly mistaken. Quida says so, and adds that the horizon
                        is red with fire. She believes in the Yellow Peril as strongly as the old
                        philosophers believed in the elixir of life. , But the forgets that there
                        are yellow men and yellow men, Obiuete and Koreans as well as Japanese;
                        forgets also—what we are all in . danger of forgetting—that iu the first
                        shock i ol surprise we have perhaps gilded the Japanese . virtues with too
                        much retiued gold. II—we say, i if—the yellow mau were the sublime and i
                        superhuman genius which some zealots declare him to be, Ouida’s foreboding
                        would be justified, aud the Yellow Peril might make ns all Ilussophiles. But
                        the yellow mau is only man alter all, and none ol us are pure gold
                        throughout, though he is one of the best. The Admiralty announcement as to
                        the postponement of the summer mana'uvrea is a model of suppressed
                        significance. The manoeu- vres may cause inconvenience if carried out as
                        planned ; if not carried out as planned they would serve no useful purpose.
                        Rodjestvensky and Togo hold the waters, and till they have finished it will
                        be safer for us not to play at war in their neighbourhood. A British
                        squadron might be mistaken for a fishing fleet—there is really no saying
                        what might happen—and in those circumstances no international commission
                        would be able to avert horrible consequences. There is an irony in the
                        picture called np by the imagination of the British Navy playing at sailors
                        and coming into unintentional oonflict with the Russian and Japanese Davies.
                        It will be far better not to run the risk. Yet from one point of view we
                        cannot but regret the decision, sensible as it is from all other points of
                        view. There will be bo much to be learned from the great fight, if and when
                        it comes off, that a British fleet might have acted the part of ourions
                        spectator with advantage to itself and perhaps to other people. It is said
                        that the struggle between Lord Kitchener and the civil authorities in India
                        turns upon a grandiose proposal of Lord Kit- chener’s to plant a line of
                        great military camps along the Northern frontier. The proposal would involve
                        an expenditure of £10,000,000, and is vehemently opposed by all the members
                        of Lord Cnrzon’s Council, including Lord Curzon himself. The quarrel places
                        the homo Government in a very difficult position, for Mr. Brodrick must know
                        only too well that Lord Kitchener’s best arguments for these gigantic
                        defensive measures against a possible Russian attack can be drawn from Mr.
                        Balfour’s speeches. The Prime Minister may have to pay dearly for bis
                        various Russian scares. The probability is that a compromise will be reach
                        ed and the peril of Lord Kitchener’s return averted. At any rate the
                        Government is likely to make many efforts to prevent Lord Kit- chener’s
                        return to England ’ anmauled” on the eve of a general election, Prom a
                        military standpoint, it is an exceed- ingly grave matter that the plague
                        should have selected the Punjaubfor its most ter- rible devastations in
                        India. That usually healthy province actually suffered a loss of a quarter
                        of a million of its inhabitants, out of about twenty millions, in three
                        months last year, and since then, as the “Lancet" shows from official
                        statistics, the rate of plague mort- ality has materially augmented. As the
                        Land of the Five Rivers supplies the native army with its most efficient
                        recruits, including those born soldiers, the Sikhs, Lord Kitchener may be
                        forced to lessen his demands on its physi- cal resources. Daring recent
                        years the oon- cinuons tendency of the Indian War Office has been in the
                        other direction, Madras and Burmese troops being more and more stiffened by
                        recruiting in Northern India. But the surge of Asia evidently declines to
                        subscribe to this racial re-arrangement; last week, while the number of
                        deaths from the disease in Burmah was only 72, and in Madras 81, the Punjanb
                        suffered a shrinkage of over 19,000. Odd to say, this extraordinary
                        disparity of plagae mortality between the hardier and less hardy populations
                        is manifest almost through- out the peninsula. Whereas last week’s deaths in
                        the Central Provinces number Jover twenty- three thousand, Bengal, with its
                        enormous aud physically inferior population, lost no more than 9,703.</p>
                    <p>The Stonehenge ease has no doubt attract- ed the attention of the public to
                        the ancient monuments which still exist in Great Britain, and an article in
                        the "Quarterly Review” which deals with the subject of their preser- vation
                        is of more than passing interest The writer points out that here in England
                        we take far less heed of the memorials of the past than they do in other
                        countries. France takes official notice of over two thousand monuments, and
                        included in the list are over three hundred dolmens. In Germany the
                        Ministers of Public Instruction and of the Interior have charge of all
                        ancient monu- ments, and appoint official custodians to look alter them.
                        Even the smaller States show anxiety to protect the monuments of their past
                        history, and all of them pay more offi- cial attention to the subject than
                        we do in England. We have an Ancient Monuments Act, but want of money causes
                        it to remain almost a dead letter. There is now no In- spector of Ancient
                        Monuments, and there is no official machinery to deal with cases of
                        vandalism. The writer of tho article calls attention to several instances
                        which show that many of our most valuable monuments exist only by accident,
                        and not because they have been properly taken care of. The habit ' our
                        ancestors had of building cottage with Roman and prehistoric walls is
                        largely re- sponsible for the loss of many priceless relics, ' and it cannot
                        be said that the danger of this sort of vandalism is yet completely past. A
                        hundred years ago this week Schiller died peacefully at Weimar after a life
                        into which much physical suffering was crowded, and wherever the German
                        language is spoken festi- vities are held in memory of Germany’s greates'
                        poet. It is interesting to note that his last direct descendant, Alexander,
                        Freiherr von Gleichen-Russwurm, the grandson of Schiller's youngest daughter
                        Emilie, is taking au active part in several of the celebrations. On
                        Saturday, when Schiller’s birthplace was en fete, he was at Morbacb, on
                        Sunday at Stuttgart, and yesterday he was the chief speaker at the imposing
                        festival at Cologne, while three weeks ago he had officiated in the same
                        capacity amoDg the Germans at Rome. Freiherr von Gleiohen-RuBswunn is forty
                        years old, and after leaving the German Army some years ago he devoted
                        himself entirely to literary pursuits, and has had the satisfaction of
                        seeing one of his plays, "The Comedy of Conscience," per- formed on the
                        famous Weimar stage. Discussing the part played by medicine in colonization
                        the "British Medical Journal” says that to Laveran we owe the discovery
                        which marked the dawn of a new era in tro- pical pathology and sanitation,
                        and from this idee mere of a parasitic origin of a disease which has been a
                        mystery sinoe the beginning of civilisation has sprang, especially daring
                        the last fifteen years, a series of other discoveries which have gone far to
                        justify the statement made by Sir Patrick Manson before the Royal
                        Geographical Society in 1898 that 99 per cent, of tropical diseases were
                        caused by germs. Climate may cause discomfort and enerva- tion, and may
                        predispose to disease, bat the real enemy of the white man in tropioal dimes
                        and the great obstacle to colonisation is the wealth of parasitic life,
                        whioh finds in him a ready prey. In the discovery of means of de- stroying
                        these parasites or neutralizing their power of mischief lies the secret of
                        acclimatisa- tion. The prosperity of our empire, perhaps the existence of
                        our country, depends to a large extent on the successful development of the
                        material resources of oar Colonies, and this in turn depends on the
                        increased possibilities of acclimatisation. This is the chief practical '
                        problem which the schools of tropioal medicine have been brought into
                        existence to solve. At a conference organised by the Church Association and
                        National Protestant League yesterday it was decided, the motion of Mr.
                        Ati'Ln T y'or, that a supreme effort should be made to influence the
                        candidates at the aiming General Election, so that oidy staunch Protestants
                        xLould bes-nt to Pur i-iment,aince tho grave and vital question of the
                        Protestant- ism of the Church of England would have to be dctlt with aud
                        decided by that Parliament, and that a fund of not less than £30,000 should
                        be appealed for to enable a vigorous Protestant electoral campaign to be
                        carried out whenever a dissolution was announced. Christ's College,
                        Cambridge, which is cele- brating 'ho 400th anniversary of tho re-fonoda-
                        tiou by Margaret Beaufort, was first founded as "God's House" in 1448 by
                        Henry VI. owing to "a great scarcity of masters of grammar.” It was the Alma
                        Mater not only of John Milton but of the famous if little read “Cambridge
                        Platonifcts." Mark Pattison’s theory that Milton turned Puritan through
                        antipathy to his Laudian tutor Chappell, by whom be was "whipt,” seems
                        unconvincing; for the poet, in the "Apology for Smectymnus,” refers to the
                        "courteous and learned Fellows" of his old College. Including Milton, five
                        poets are claimed for Christ’s by Dr. Peile, the Master and historian of the
                        College, but that beloved of bards, C. S. Calverley, is surely entitled to a
                        sixth place among the brotherhood. The trustees of the British Museum have
                        decided to make an addition to their collection of "human documents," which
                        will be at onoe unique, and of great interest They have accepted the offer
                        of some of the companies which occupy themselves with the phono- graphic
                        reproduction of coal utterances to supply them with a series of such records
                        for permanent preservation. The choice will be carefully restricted, being
                        confined, it is under- stood, to speeches of real importance, and they will
                        be available “for posterity only,” in no cose being at the service of
                        contemporaries. It is rosy to think how full of interest such a collection
                        must be. How many problems they might solve! What would we not give, for
                        example, for an imperishable reproduction of words which have become
                        historio ? As it is, we have to be content with the written reports of
                        historians, who may or may not have been well-informed, and may or may not
                        have been biassed in their accounts.</p>
                    <p>There is a story of heroism from Dublin in the London papers which deserves
                        all the prominence it can be given. Something went wrong at a sewer manhole
                        on the quays, and a workman was sent down to investigate. As he did not
                        reappear, his two mates and the engineer who was their superior successively
                        followed, likewise not to return. Then a police- man, Constable Patrick
                        Sheehan, was fetched to the spot, and in spite of the overpowering sewer gas
                        that was issuing from the manhole, he bravely went down into tho horrible
                        trap, and had sent np three of the four men fastened to ropes before he was
                        himself overcome. A cab-driver and a fireman followed, and in time an eager
                        crowd of volunteers clamoured round the hole for the privilege ol taking
                        their turns at the work of rescue. Man after man was overpowuie-J, but it
                        was cleared at last Un- happily, I be original victim died in hospital, and
                        the brave policeman as he was being conveyed thither. As the story of the
                        Birken- head was read by order to the regiments of Prussia, so the tale of
                        Constable Sheehan's heroic death deserves to be read in every police-station
                        and from every pulpit and head- master's desk in the United Kingdom. In the
                        face of agitation and common-sense, it seems that we have got to have the
                        cri- noline, after all. News of the formation of an Anti-Crinoline League
                        leaves the autocratic costumiers of France smiling but firm. The return of
                        the crinoline, it seems, is an inevit- able consequence of the evolution of
                        the shape of the skiit. The more important question, therefore, is—what are
                        we to do with the monster when we have got it ? Times have changed, and a
                        conformation that could be endured carriage drives and gentle shop- ping
                        excursions is incompatible with hansoms and hockey. The compact modern flat
                        or residence, too, is ill-anited to superfluity of circumference. It almost
                        seems as if a new mode of feminine life would have to be evolved to fit the
                        new mode in garments. A simple life it will have to be, involving the
                        minimum of complication in movement, and an outdoor life, too, unless we are
                        all prepared to rebuild our drawing rooms. Wherefore it is to be hoped that
                        the crinoline, as it has to oome, may ar- rive while the warm weaker is jet
                        with us — and depart before the leaves begin to fall.</p>
