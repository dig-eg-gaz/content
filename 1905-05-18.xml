                    <p>Mr. BALFOUR'S SPEECH. The home papers to hand miming contain full report! of
                        Mr. Balfour’s greit speech in the House of Commous this day week. The Prime
                        Minister's speeoh was a double triumph—for the speaker himself, and for
                        principles with which the party he repre- sents has ever been specially
                        identifiel. It was a personal triumph, inaamuoh as it showed Mr. Balfou'r at
                        his best, rising above the littleness of the daily strife of
                        parties—wherein, for all his skill in debate, the Premier does not exoel
                        because he does not care for the gamo—and sunning himself ia the largo
                        liberty of a theme of permanent patriotic interest of supremo importance.
                        Mr. Balfour is at home on the heights, and thithor, last Thursday, he was
                        able not only to lead that party which stands in a special sense for the
                        care of National and Imperial defeuoe, but to do much more. Ho led even
                        those who habitually affeot to regard the integrity of our Islands and of
                        the British Empire as a matter for which we, like the lilies of the field,
                        need toil not neither spin, beoause there is a law of nature by which
                        8amson, in all his strength, was not arrayed in suoh I armour of proof as
                        envelops the United King- dom and the vast collection of dependencies which
                        it has, almost unconsciously and wholly unintentionally, gathered round
                        it</p>
                    <p>However, Mr. Balfour carried the wholeHouse with him, which, we repeat «u a
                        triumph for him an4 for the party which does like Imperial- ism, rightly
                        understood, njnoh—and muoh more to that Furthermore, his speech, as the
                        ■‘Times’’ says, marks a stago in the history of the question of Imperial
                        defence. Why so I Beoause it induced the House of Commons to •ooopt the
                        principle which underlies the crea- tion of the Imperial Defeuoe Committee.
                        We hare but to look back a very few years to realise that the mere creation
                        of a permanent oonsultative body, instead of the tampon cowritters, dealing
                        with questions, having no continuous existence and keeping no continuous
                        records, which was all we ever had before, constitutes a veritable
                        revolution in our procedure. Time was, and not very long ago, when aU the
                        Departments would have arisen and prophesied concerning it that it was a
                        most un-British institution - as, indeed, we are not sure that it is not—aud
                        that we might very weU have gone on as we did, not merely iD pre-Crimean
                        days, but even for thirty years after the war of 1870, and all that followed
                        it, should have roused us to a sense of the realities of the age we live in.
                        Well, God be thanked for our good amends ! As the result of a tardy national
                        awakening we have got a Navy, and there is some hope that, in the course of
                        time, we may even get an Army as weU. Before we do so, however, it is
                        desirable, not to say necessary, that we should know for what precise object
                        we require the land forces for which we pay at present £53,000,000 per annum
                        without getting value for one money. That object, as Mr. Balfour tells us,
                        must be considered from the stand- points of home, colonial, and Indian
                        defence. : As to the Colonies, their fate must depend on that of the mother
                        country: if once England received that “blow over the heart" against which
                        the late Lord Salisbury warned her, ihe individual power of any Colony to
                        resist an enemy would avail no little. To avert the "blow over the
                        heart”—successful invasion of the British islands—we may, Mr. Balfour holds,
                        depend upon the Navy: we do not need an Army for home defense. In his
                        opinion, which is that of the Committee, "serious invasion of. these islands
                        is not an eventuality which we need seriously consider.” Given a
                        sufficiently powerful Navy, that conclu- sion may be accepted without demur,
                        albeit we should be considerably surprised to learn that military entire on
                        the Continent are prepared henceforward to regard successful invasion of
                        England as outside the sphere of praoticsl politics. Let ns here, by the
                        way, congratulate Mr. Balfour upon the admirable tone of his theoretical
                        reference to France as the moat obvious quarter when the invasion most,
                        owing to geographical conditions, be looked for. That a»nmption—happily,
                        now, parely theoretical—need not, of ooarse,exoluda an intelligent
                        appreciation of the foot that Franoe is not the only Continental Power with
                        a greatNavyand with ports oonveniently situat- ed in rather close proximity
                        to the shore of Eng- land. On that latter snbjeot the silence ot the Premier
                        is, perhaps, not lees significant than words would have been—and
                        oonsiderebly lees liable to misconstruction. Wherefore we must again
                        congratulate. It was, however, with the military requirements of the
                        North-West frontier of India that Mr. Balfour was mainly condemed. He
                        showed, in language of the utmost courtesy, but of unflinchiug firmness,
                        that England oan permit no ’extension of the powerful Russian railway
                        system, which has already reached the Afghan border, into the territories of
                        the Ameer. Afghanistan must remain the "glacis,” as Ljrd Cureon has called
                        it, across whioh no possible enemy can be allowed, in peaoe time, to creep
                        np to the walls of the Indian fortress. We cannot be too thankful to Mr.
                        Balfonr for having laid down that fundamental proposition in absolutely
                        unmistakable terms. To do that was all the more necessary because our
                        inevitable result of the present war in the Par East must be to throw the
                        expansive energy of Russia baok upon the Middle East. It is towards India,
                        aud towards the Per- sian Gulf, that Russian ambition will ne- cessarily
                        look, and it will be for us to see to it that Russia shall not find in
                        either of those directions her line of least resistance That is a theme
                        which might be discussed at any length ; for the preseut we have only to
                        thank the Prime Minister for his luminous and comprehensive exposition of
                        that whole pro- blem ol the defense of the Empire which must be the
                        permanent object of the solicitude of a strong and continuous military
                        policy.</p>

                            that it was os poor as the average entertainment given by this house. It
                            Uie success of snob a performance depends upon tho letting fall of a

                            recognise that Cairenes look for a somewhat higher class of entertain-
                            ment. We might also suggest that they should engage an orchestra which
                            is capable of keep- ing in time and in tune with the singers.</p>

                    <p>The new Suez-Suakin direct service to which we alluded some days ago is now
                        in operation, and the departures from Suez take place on Wednesday
                        afternoon, after the arrival of the Cairo train, instead of on Thursday as
                        formerly, thus connecting with the arrival of the P. and 0. Brindisi mail
                        without loss of time.</p>
                    <p>The direct steamer leaves on alternate weeks, and is due at Port Sudan on the
                        following Saturday morning, when a steam launch meets her and delivers the
                        mail in Snakin a few hours later. The steamer herself proceeds to Snakin the
                        next day, and sails again thence on Wednesday at noon and from Port Sudan in
                        the evening being at Suez on Saturday morning. Thus passengers can now go to
                        Snakin and get back within 10 days, with a sufficient interval for business
                        purposes both there and at Port Sudan, and with this service passengers and
                        mails will be delivered four days earlier than under the former arrange-
                        ments.</p>

                        service, which until her arrival is being carried on by the “Maballah."</p>
                    <p>We understand the Egyptian Government h8s granted the Khedivial Company an
                        annual subvention of LE. 5,000 for this new direct line.</p>
                    <p>The general manager, Mr. Parkinson, and the sub manager, Ahmed Bey, have just
                        re- turned from Snakin and Port Sudan, where they have made arrangements in
                        this connec- tion with the Sudan authorities, and with a view to facilitate
                        the operations of merchants the company have decided to grant important
                        redactions in their tariffs both for goods and passengers, the new rates
                        coming into force from the 1st proximo.</p>
                    <p>The ordinary fortnightly sailings to Snakin, vift Jeddah, continuing on to
                        Massowah, Ho- tl. idab, and Aden, take place in the interven- ing weeks
                        between the direct sailings, and in addition to the above, the company will
                        despatch in the week of tho direct steamer to Suakin another steamer to
                        Jeddah and the ports fin tlier south if required, thus putting all ports in
                        the Red Sea practically in weekly communication with Suez and with each
                        other.</p>
                    <p>We congratulate both the Government and !he company upon these results and
                        feel sure that tho latter will find that by meeting all reasonable demands
                        of the trading community, and even at some temporary sacrifice removing all
                        cause of _ complaint with regard to their rates and the previously irregular
                        intervals in sailings, they will eventually reap the reward of their

                    <p>The unfortunate case of drunken rowdyism on the part of a soldier belonging

                        led to considerable com- ment. The fact is, of course, that the British
                        soldier in Egypt is supposed to be snob a putem of respectability that when
                        one does run amuck far more attention is paid to his unwonted proceedings
                        than would be • the case if such eccentricity of behaviour wore an every-day
                        occurrence. The most disgraceful part of the incident was tho
                        non-interference of four of his fellow-soldiers, who were passing at the
                        moment. The right course to have taken would have been for these four men to
                        have prevented their comrade from raising such an uproar. The statement,
                        which appear- ed in our issue of Tuesday last, was in no way exaggerated,

                        <p>The British steamer "Fortnna," late of Bell’s Asia Minor Steamship Co.,
                            arrived here from Suez on the 1st inst, with a consign- ment of timber,
                            etc., and left again for Suez on 4th inst., with a full cargo of sheep
                            and cattle. The export of cattle has raised the price of meat here .from
                            P.T. 2 i per oke to P.T. 5 per oke.</p>
                        <p>Owing to the great number of people that come here now by every steamer
                            for Snakin and Port Sndan, the price for onions and potatoes (imported
                            from Egypt) is now treble the price in Egypt. I think the Government
                            onght to look into this for some Government employes receive very small
                            salaries, and rail- way workmen accepted low wages last year owiDg to
                            cheap living. Now that there is so great a difference, several have
                            resigned owing to not getting an increase of salary.</p>

                        <p>Two more oases of small-pox occurred amongst the Sudanese pilgrims in
                            quarantine. The crisis is now over, however, and the health of the
                            pilgrims is very good. Chicken-pox has made its appearance here, and in
                            order to prevent the disease spreading the following notice has appeared
                            from the Mondirieh, in Arabic and English :— "There are several cases of
                            chicken-pox in Suakin. The symptoms are slight fever, with spots on the
                            body. The medical officer should at once be informed of any case
                            occurring like this. Any one found willfully neglecting to report a case
                            will be punished. This disease is very infections. It has no connection
                            with small-pox and vaccination is in no sense a preventative.
                            Vaccination is performed solely for the prevention of small-pox.”</p>

                    <p>The main factors are the same as reported last week—uncertainty, nervous
                        tension, an- xious waiting on events in the East; with the same result,
                        viz., market paralysis, unwil- ling sales, no will to buy, depressed prioes.
                        The Settlement that finishes to-day has been, to say the least of it, an
                        uncomforta- ble one. The heavy fall in the American market made speculative
                        accounts show con- siderable losses; in order to meet which stocks were
                        thrown overboard in other sec- tions, and, in the absence of publio support,
                        these sales told more heavily than wonld have been the case in active
                        markets. Added to this unsatisfactory state of fin*nm>l affaire, we had the
                        various rumours of possible com- plications in the Far East. Fortunately,
                        thanks to the excellent understanding now existing between ourselves and our
                        neighbour France, these rumours need not have been taken seriously, as it
                        since became evident, and although the situation has been delicate it was
                        not really dangerous.</p>
                    <p>Egyptian stocks, as we have before pointed out, are enabled to stand clear of
                        snow market breaks as we have just had, owing to the fact there is no open
                        speculative account here, and that the principal stocks are in strong hands.
                        Prices have consequently held good, and show little change, shares, in fact,
                        making an advance, Nationals at 27 } and Agrionltnrals at 13 Egyptian mining
                        shares are still doll and neglected, with the other mining markets. Amongst
                        the various new companies, Egyptian Estates are weak at par.</p>
                    <p>Next week the new 3} per cent. Debenture issue of the Land Bank of Egypt made
                        its appearance, partly in Paris, where it is expect- ed that the 500-franc
                        share will be offered at 475 francs. Money is plentiful in Paris just now,
                        and this ought to prove attractive. Many new Egyptian enterprises are
                        ''hatch- . mg," bat, being largely under-written, they will not require much
                        public money, and will no doubt go off as soon as they are "out" We do not
                        regret this, and repeat that, with judi- oious management, there is ample
                        scope in Egypt and Sudan for the profitable investment of money.</p>

                    <p> The most serious factor in the neutrality question is the growing anger of
                        Japan at the help which Fruneo seems to be giving Admiral Rodjestvensky, or
                        allowing him to take. Our allies, as is perhaps not unnatural in the air
                        circumstances, have shown a certain inability ft) appreciate the extreme
                        delicacy of European diplomacy. They were irritated because wo did not speak
                        more strongly to Russia. It is not to be expected that they should preserve
                        their equanimity at the inaction of France. Nor can France herself rest and
                        be satisfied much longer. She has an imperative duty to perform. But the
                        Japanese must not forget — and their high official representatives no doubt
                        recognize the responsibility as clearly as any- body that in protesting with
                        undue vehe- mence they will be playing Russia’s game. A drastic policy
                        against France might drawGreat Britain also into the confliot, and then
                        Russia’s extreme difficulties would be over. Her face would be saved. And
                        what matter if other people's countenances became downcast 1 We believe
                        Japan will proceed cautiously, and, on the other hand, have equal faith that
                        France will see the situation in its proper light. Europe has batter cause
                        than over to be grate- ful that M. Delcasse retained office. He is an asset
                        on the side of honesty and peace. The fact that Japan is England’s ally is
                        not sufficient to account for English enthusiasm over the victories of Togo
                        and Oyama. There are other reasons: among them the national habit of being
                        on the side of the “little chap,” and natural pleasure of seeing a bluffing
                        bully brought to earth. Can it be, as Quida suggests iu the “Fortnightly,”
                        that we have allowed sentiment to over balance judgment! The prophetess
                        foretells woe, and nothing bat woe, as the consequence of Japan’s triumph. A
                        terrible fate is preparing for us while we are congratulating the real foe.
                        If the yellow race is superior to the white, then must the white go to the
                        wall. If we think that, having tasted blood and the joy of conquest, the
                        Japanese will return to the painting of chrysanthemums and the making of
                        tea-trays, we are sadly mistaken. Quida says so, and adds that the horizon
                        is red with fire. She believes in the Yellow Peril as strongly as the old
                        philosophers believed in the elixir of life. , But the forgets that there
                        are yellow men and yellow men, Obiuete and Koreans as well as Japanese;
                        forgets also—what we are all in . danger of forgetting—that iu the first
                        shock i ol surprise we have perhaps gilded the Japanese . virtues with too
                        much retiued gold. II—we say, i if—the yellow mau were the sublime and i
                        superhuman genius which some zealots declare him to be, Ouida’s foreboding
                        would be justified, aud the Yellow Peril might make ns all Ilussophiles. But
                        the yellow mau is only man alter all, and none ol us are pure gold
                        throughout, though he is one of the best. The Admiralty announcement as to
                        the postponement of the summer mana'uvrea is a model of suppressed
                        significance. The manoeu- vres may cause inconvenience if carried out as
                        planned ; if not carried out as planned they would serve no useful purpose.
                        Rodjestvensky and Togo hold the waters, and till they have finished it will
                        be safer for us not to play at war in their neighbourhood. A British
                        squadron might be mistaken for a fishing fleet—there is really no saying
                        what might happen—and in those circumstances no international commission
                        would be able to avert horrible consequences. There is an irony in the
                        picture called np by the imagination of the British Navy playing at sailors
                        and coming into unintentional oonflict with the Russian and Japanese Davies.
                        It will be far better not to run the risk. Yet from one point of view we
                        cannot but regret the decision, sensible as it is from all other points of
                        view. There will be bo much to be learned from the great fight, if and when
                        it comes off, that a British fleet might have acted the part of ourions
                        spectator with advantage to itself and perhaps to other people. It is said
                        that the struggle between Lord Kitchener and the civil authorities in India
                        turns upon a grandiose proposal of Lord Kit- chener’s to plant a line of
                        great military camps along the Northern frontier. The proposal would involve
                        an expenditure of £10,000,000, and is vehemently opposed by all the members
                        of Lord Cnrzon’s Council, including Lord Curzon himself. The quarrel places
                        the homo Government in a very difficult position, for Mr. Brodrick must know
                        only too well that Lord Kitchener’s best arguments for these gigantic
                        defensive measures against a possible Russian attack can be drawn from Mr.
                        Balfour’s speeches. The Prime Minister may have to pay dearly for bis
                        various Russian scares. The probability is that a compromise will be reach
                        ed and the peril of Lord Kitchener’s return averted. At any rate the
                        Government is likely to make many efforts to prevent Lord Kit- chener’s
                        return to England ’ anmauled” on the eve of a general election, Prom a
                        military standpoint, it is an exceed- ingly grave matter that the plague
                        should have selected the Punjaubfor its most ter- rible devastations in
                        India. That usually healthy province actually suffered a loss of a quarter
                        of a million of its inhabitants, out of about twenty millions, in three
                        months last year, and since then, as the “Lancet" shows from official
                        statistics, the rate of plague mort- ality has materially augmented. As the
                        Land of the Five Rivers supplies the native army with its most efficient
                        recruits, including those born soldiers, the Sikhs, Lord Kitchener may be
                        forced to lessen his demands on its physi- cal resources. Daring recent
                        years the oon- cinuons tendency of the Indian War Office has been in the
                        other direction, Madras and Burmese troops being more and more stiffened by
                        recruiting in Northern India. But the surge of Asia evidently declines to
                        subscribe to this racial re-arrangement; last week, while the number of
                        deaths from the disease in Burmah was only 72, and in Madras 81, the Punjanb
                        suffered a shrinkage of over 19,000. Odd to say, this extraordinary
                        disparity of plagae mortality between the hardier and less hardy populations
                        is manifest almost through- out the peninsula. Whereas last week’s deaths in
                        the Central Provinces number Jover twenty- three thousand, Bengal, with its
                        enormous aud physically inferior population, lost no more than 9,703.</p>
                    <p>The Stonehenge ease has no doubt attract- ed the attention of the public to
                        the ancient monuments which still exist in Great Britain, and an article in
                        the "Quarterly Review” which deals with the subject of their preser- vation
                        is of more than passing interest The writer points out that here in England
                        we take far less heed of the memorials of the past than they do in other
                        countries. France takes official notice of over two thousand monuments, and
                        included in the list are over three hundred dolmens. In Germany the
                        Ministers of Public Instruction and of the Interior have charge of all
                        ancient monu- ments, and appoint official custodians to look alter them.
                        Even the smaller States show anxiety to protect the monuments of their past
                        history, and all of them pay more offi- cial attention to the subject than
                        we do in England. We have an Ancient Monuments Act, but want of money causes
                        it to remain almost a dead letter. There is now no In- spector of Ancient
                        Monuments, and there is no official machinery to deal with cases of
                        vandalism. The writer of tho article calls attention to several instances
                        which show that many of our most valuable monuments exist only by accident,
                        and not because they have been properly taken care of. The habit ' our
                        ancestors had of building cottage with Roman and prehistoric walls is
                        largely re- sponsible for the loss of many priceless relics, ' and it cannot
                        be said that the danger of this sort of vandalism is yet completely past. A
                        hundred years ago this week Schiller died peacefully at Weimar after a life
                        into which much physical suffering was crowded, and wherever the German
                        language is spoken festi- vities are held in memory of Germany’s greates'
                        poet. It is interesting to note that his last direct descendant, Alexander,
                        Freiherr von Gleichen-Russwurm, the grandson of Schiller's youngest daughter
                        Emilie, is taking au active part in several of the celebrations. On
                        Saturday, when Schiller’s birthplace was en fete, he was at Morbacb, on
                        Sunday at Stuttgart, and yesterday he was the chief speaker at the imposing
                        festival at Cologne, while three weeks ago he had officiated in the same
                        capacity amoDg the Germans at Rome. Freiherr von Gleiohen-RuBswunn is forty
                        years old, and after leaving the German Army some years ago he devoted
                        himself entirely to literary pursuits, and has had the satisfaction of
                        seeing one of his plays, "The Comedy of Conscience," per- formed on the
                        famous Weimar stage. Discussing the part played by medicine in colonization
                        the "British Medical Journal” says that to Laveran we owe the discovery
                        which marked the dawn of a new era in tro- pical pathology and sanitation,
                        and from this idee mere of a parasitic origin of a disease which has been a
                        mystery sinoe the beginning of civilisation has sprang, especially daring
                        the last fifteen years, a series of other discoveries which have gone far to
                        justify the statement made by Sir Patrick Manson before the Royal
                        Geographical Society in 1898 that 99 per cent, of tropical diseases were
                        caused by germs. Climate may cause discomfort and enerva- tion, and may
                        predispose to disease, bat the real enemy of the white man in tropioal dimes
                        and the great obstacle to colonisation is the wealth of parasitic life,
                        whioh finds in him a ready prey. In the discovery of means of de- stroying
                        these parasites or neutralizing their power of mischief lies the secret of
                        acclimatisa- tion. The prosperity of our empire, perhaps the existence of
                        our country, depends to a large extent on the successful development of the
                        material resources of oar Colonies, and this in turn depends on the
                        increased possibilities of acclimatisation. This is the chief practical '
                        problem which the schools of tropioal medicine have been brought into
                        existence to solve. At a conference organised by the Church Association and
                        National Protestant League yesterday it was decided, the motion of Mr.
                        Ati'Ln T y'or, that a supreme effort should be made to influence the
                        candidates at the aiming General Election, so that oidy staunch Protestants
                        xLould bes-nt to Pur i-iment,aince tho grave and vital question of the
                        Protestant- ism of the Church of England would have to be dctlt with aud
                        decided by that Parliament, and that a fund of not less than £30,000 should
                        be appealed for to enable a vigorous Protestant electoral campaign to be
                        carried out whenever a dissolution was announced. Christ's College,
                        Cambridge, which is cele- brating 'ho 400th anniversary of tho re-fonoda-
                        tiou by Margaret Beaufort, was first founded as "God's House" in 1448 by
                        Henry VI. owing to "a great scarcity of masters of grammar.” It was the Alma
                        Mater not only of John Milton but of the famous if little read “Cambridge
                        Platonifcts." Mark Pattison’s theory that Milton turned Puritan through
                        antipathy to his Laudian tutor Chappell, by whom be was "whipt,” seems
                        unconvincing; for the poet, in the "Apology for Smectymnus,” refers to the
                        "courteous and learned Fellows" of his old College. Including Milton, five
                        poets are claimed for Christ’s by Dr. Peile, the Master and historian of the
                        College, but that beloved of bards, C. S. Calverley, is surely entitled to a
                        sixth place among the brotherhood. The trustees of the British Museum have
                        decided to make an addition to their collection of "human documents," which
                        will be at onoe unique, and of great interest They have accepted the offer
                        of some of the companies which occupy themselves with the phono- graphic
                        reproduction of coal utterances to supply them with a series of such records
                        for permanent preservation. The choice will be carefully restricted, being
                        confined, it is under- stood, to speeches of real importance, and they will
                        be available “for posterity only,” in no cose being at the service of
                        contemporaries. It is rosy to think how full of interest such a collection
                        must be. How many problems they might solve! What would we not give, for
                        example, for an imperishable reproduction of words which have become
                        historio ? As it is, we have to be content with the written reports of
                        historians, who may or may not have been well-informed, and may or may not
                        have been biassed in their accounts.</p>
                    <p>There is a story of heroism from Dublin in the London papers which deserves
                        all the prominence it can be given. Something went wrong at a sewer manhole
                        on the quays, and a workman was sent down to investigate. As he did not
                        reappear, his two mates and the engineer who was their superior successively
                        followed, likewise not to return. Then a police- man, Constable Patrick
                        Sheehan, was fetched to the spot, and in spite of the overpowering sewer gas
                        that was issuing from the manhole, he bravely went down into tho horrible
                        trap, and had sent np three of the four men fastened to ropes before he was
                        himself overcome. A cab-driver and a fireman followed, and in time an eager
                        crowd of volunteers clamoured round the hole for the privilege ol taking
                        their turns at the work of rescue. Man after man was overpowuie-J, but it
                        was cleared at last Un- happily, I be original victim died in hospital, and
                        the brave policeman as he was being conveyed thither. As the story of the
                        Birken- head was read by order to the regiments of Prussia, so the tale of
                        Constable Sheehan's heroic death deserves to be read in every police-station
                        and from every pulpit and head- master's desk in the United Kingdom. In the
                        face of agitation and common-sense, it seems that we have got to have the
                        cri- noline, after all. News of the formation of an Anti-Crinoline League
                        leaves the autocratic costumiers of France smiling but firm. The return of
                        the crinoline, it seems, is an inevit- able consequence of the evolution of
                        the shape of the skiit. The more important question, therefore, is—what are
                        we to do with the monster when we have got it ? Times have changed, and a
                        conformation that could be endured carriage drives and gentle shop- ping
                        excursions is incompatible with hansoms and hockey. The compact modern flat
                        or residence, too, is ill-anited to superfluity of circumference. It almost
                        seems as if a new mode of feminine life would have to be evolved to fit the
                        new mode in garments. A simple life it will have to be, involving the
                        minimum of complication in movement, and an outdoor life, too, unless we are
                        all prepared to rebuild our drawing rooms. Wherefore it is to be hoped that
                        the crinoline, as it has to oome, may ar- rive while the warm weaker is jet
                        with us — and depart before the leaves begin to fall.</p>

                        "For some time I had suffered very "badly from indigeston and a nervous
                        breakdown. 1 lost hope of ever being better, and never thought I should get
                        out again. I had palpita- tions and severe pains in the chest. I fell away
                        to a shadow. All food was repugnant. "The Consumption I was hastening to was
                        really due to lack of blood. Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills gave me the blood I
                        needed so badly, and that is why they oured me when do ordinary remedies
                        could. Other medicine might brace me np, but what I wanted was new blood.”

                        "After I had taken two boxes I began to feel a different woman. I took five

                        naturally follow. The splendid appetite which Dr. Williams’Pink Pills give
                        shows that they oure Indigestion at once. They do it by making New Blood.
                        Mothers know why they and their daughters need new blood more than men ; bnt
                        men can be Anwmio, too. The weak book, easy fatigue, lack of interest in
                        life, and general nervous weakness which trouble both men and women, need
                        New Blood to cure them. Nerves that need new blood to feed them show their
