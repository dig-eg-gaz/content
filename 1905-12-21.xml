                    <p>The publication of the French Yellow Book on Morocco on the same day as the
                        utterance of the speech of the German Imperial Chancellor to protest against
                        the charges against Germany of aggression and hostility has led to some
                        comparisons in the home Press. Just when we were asking ourselves how far
                        suspicion of German policy ought to melt like snow before the genial
                        sunbeams of German official assurances, sudden ly a yard measure is thrust
                        into our hands, whore with some very useful measurements can bo taken.
                        Briefly, it comes to this, that, a year and a half ago, Prince Bulow made
                        certain state ments in the Reichstag, the value of which has since been
                        tested by experience. The result of that test forms, as the "Times" put it
                        on Friday last, "the best possible comment upon the pacific protestations in
                        which Prince Billow indulged once again, yesterday, in regard to this
                        country." The official documents now show that as far back as 1901 the
                        Maghzen was trying to enlist European support against France while
                        subjecting her to constant friction and annoyance on her Algerian frontier.
                        As the result of c ommunications between M. Delcasse and the German
                        Ambassador in Paris, the latter admit tad very fully the right of France to
                        a "special position" in Morocco. That right was subsequently fortified by
                        the Sultan's request for French military assistance to crash the Pretender,
                        with which request France refused to comply, thereby proving her
                        determination to refrain from anything in the nature of a military adventure
                        in Morocco. Such was the situation when the crucial fact of the Anglo-French
                        Agreement made its appearance in the spring of last year.</p>
                    <p>It is with the Anglo-French Agreement that the comparison which Friday's
                        London papers invite begins. The German justification for action which has
                        caused the downfall of M. Delcass6, and has seriously menaced the peace of
                        Earope, consists in the allegation that the French Minister withheld from
                        Germany all knowledge of the contents of the Agreement, with intent to flout
                        and to "isolate" Germany. What are the facts ? In March, last year, M.
                        Delcasse, in reply to enquiries, fully explained to Prince Radolin the
                        position of France in regard to Morocco. Thereupon the Ambassador thanked
                        him cordially for an explanation which (as he has since admitted) had not
                        been vouchsafed to any other Power except Russia. Soon after Prince Bulow
                        publicly stated in the Reichstag that Germany had no reason to dread any
                        infringement of her mercantile interests in Morocco. A few weeks later, when
                        the Agreement had been signed, the French Ambassador gave farther assurances
                        at Berlin, which assurances the Chancellor accepted in the Reichstag in
                        terms which were cordially received, all the world over, as a frank
                        recognition of the true character of the Anglo-French Agreement. Later on,
                        when the franco-Spanish Agreement was officially communicated to the Powers,
                        with farther assurances of commercial freedom for all in Morocco, the German
                        official reply affirmed that Germany's interests in that oonntry were purely
                        of the economic sort. That, however, was last autumn. The winter brought a
                        decisive change in the state of international affairs ; the result of the
                        Russo-Japanese war was no longer in doubt; the military power of the ally of
                        France had collapsed ; the battle of Mukden had swept all the chessmen off
                        the board, and a new game was to begin. Germany then announced that "the
                        Imperial Government totally ignored the Agreements that had been concluded
                        as regards Morocco" on the ground that Germany had been systematically
                        excluded. Then came the Imperial visit to Tangier and the series of
                        diplomatic menaces to France which are revealed in their entirety in the
                        Yellow book. It was in Jane that things reached their most critical stage,
                        when Prince Bulow actually talked about the danger of lingering on a road
                        which "bordered a precipice and even an abyss." Upon such language, and the
                        diplomacy which accompanied it, comment is superfluous. France, however,
                        kept her head in spite of all provocation, and perce was preserved. We are
                        now within a few weeks of the Conference which is the outcome of the German
                        procedure, and, in view of that coming event, the publication of the fall
                        history of its antecedents is very timely.</p>

                            prized at this season of the year, and which, previous to the

                            pupils at the Berlitz Schools. There is, however, nothing more simple
                            thau to go and book the hours for their lessons without any necessity to
                            begin before January Also the choice of hours is certainly greater now
                            than after the afflux of new pupils next month.</p>

                            palms and ferns. Dancing was kept up briskly until the early hours of
                            the morning, the uniforms of the military and naval officers present
                            blending harmoniously with the ladies'charming toilettes. The Roumanian
                            Band, kindly lent by the manager of the New Khedivial Hotel, played a
                            selection of music in their usual masterly fashion and was appreciated
                            by all present.</p>

                            Inland Revenue five years ago, and was one of the Junior Counsel at the

                    <p>There is little doubt that the practice. so prevalent among the fellaheen, of
                        drenching the cotton plants with water during the hot season, is bad for the
                        yield. Under a hot sun, the atmosphere, beneath the leafy shade, must be
                        steamy, and exceptionally suited to the production of the cotton worm. It is
                        to this bad habit, as well as to overcropping the land, and to making use of
                        inferior seed, that the deterioration of the Egyptian cotton crop is
                        undoubtedly largely due.</p>

                    <p>The second part of the performance was most amusing. Mr. Stephens began with
                        ventriloquist entertainment and ventriloquised with such realism that when
                        he imitated a dog growling, a hound in another part of the building gave
                        tongue with fervour. Then came a sale by auction of sweets and other good
                        things, with Mr. Chinn as auctioneer, and finally a toy symphony with a
                        bewildering number of instruments well conducted by Miss Simpson. After the
                        National Anthem the Rev. R. MacInnes, in a short speech, thanked all who had
                        given their services on his own behalf and that of his sister, after which
                        proceedings dosed with the Doxology.</p>

                    <p>This morning the trial of the third batch of rioters began and the Court was
                        still sitting as we went to press.</p>
                    <p>The third day's hearing of the charges against 71 natives who were accused of
                        being concerned in the rioting of Sunday week at Alexandria was concluded at
                        the Native Court at 2 p.m. yesterday, when the presiding judge, Abdel Magid
                        Bey, addressed the Court as follows:—</p>
                    <p>"Before pronouncing judgment I think it my duty, as an Egyptian and a Moslem,
                        to say a few words. During the last few days I have perused the local papers
                        and I have paid attention to their expressions of opinion and comments on
                        the recent disturbance at Alexandria. Some journals have exaggerated the
                        affair by stating that the outbreak was due to the religious fanaticism of
                        the natives ; but having carefully studied the papers in the case, I have
                        come to the conclusion that fanaticism played no part in the
                        disturbances.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of his address the judge passed sentence on the prisoners.
                        Of the total, 71, about 24 were acquitted, 25 were sentenced to six months'
                        imprisonment, with hard labour, and the remainder to one year's imprisonment
                        with hard labour.</p>

                    <p>WILSON NUNGOVICH.</p>
                    <p>RECEPTION AT THE SAVOY.</p>
                    <p>Great was the disappointment in Cairo that the weather had not been more
                        favorable yesterday, when so much was expected of it. Luckily the rain did
                        keep off during the afternoon, though the sun refused to shine. All Saints'
                        Church had been very prettily decorated for the occasion of Miss Nungovioh's
                        wedding to Captain Wilson, and so many guests assembled that no one had time
                        to notice the state of the weather. There was scarcely a seat to be had by
                        half-past three, and it was only a few minutes after that hour when the
                        bride appeared on her father's arm, and followed by her pretty sister, Miss
                        Marietta Nungovich, and the children bridesmaids and pages. A military band
                        was stationed near the chancel and a fanfare of trumpets greeted her
                        approach. The service was conducted by Dean Butcher and the Rev. Wilson,
                        cousin of the bridegroom, who had travelled out from Dublin for the special
                        purpose. The hymns sung during the service were "Oh perfect love" and "The
                        voice that breathed o'er Eden," and after the signing of the register the
                        happy couple left the churoh while the band played the "Wedding March" with
                        great effect.</p>
                    <p>The reception held afterwards at the Savoy Hotel was attended by over 500
                        people and was a most cheery function. Captain and Mrs. Wilson stood in the
                        large hall and received the congratulations of all their friends, who
                        afterwards found their way into the big dining hall, where refreshments were
                        being served. It is almost impossible to give a list of the guests, but the
                        following are a few among the number Prince Ahmed Fuad, Comte de Serionne,
                        principal agent of the Suez Canal Co., Artin Pasha, Mazloum Pasha, Izzet

                        very heavy rains have been experienced daily. Numerous shipping casualties
                        have been occasioned by the gales, and there has been great destruction of

                    <p>K. S. C. 1st WINTER MEETING.</p>
                    <p>WEATHER SPOILS FIRST DAY'S SPORT.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday's races were spoiled, as far as comfort was concerned, by the
                        weather, which deserved everything that was said against it. Raw, cold, and
                        windy, the afternoon was more than unpleasant, and the lair sex was mostly
                        disinclined to brave the changes of rain. The racing, however, was not at
                        all bad. Omar Bey Sultan and Ahmed Bey Bakri's partnership pulled off the
                        Cairo Derby and the sixth race, and the fourth race gave a good finish, won
                        by Mr. Sohreiber's White Feather. The entries in all but the second race
                        were good, and it is the greatest of pities that the day was so
                        unfavorable.</p>
                    <p>Among those present were Prince Mohamed Ibrahim, General, Mrs. and the Misses
                        Bullock, Sir John and Lady Rogers, Count de Serionne, Hon. F. Morgan, Mr. A.

                    <head>PROVINCIAL COMMISSIONS.</head>
                    <p>The work of the provincial local committees is unfavorably criticised by Mr.
                        Perry in his recently issued report. He remarks as follows :</p>
                    <p>"Viewed from the stand-point of economical working the Commissions still show
                        a very low efficiency. A false sense of amour-propre prevents their
                        requesting technical advice from our inspectors. Their inexperience is
                        exploited by local contractors, and considerable waste of public funds
                        naturally results. Independence before Economy is evidently their watchword.
                        As an instance, a pump had been erected at Assouan by Messrs. Cook and Son
                        and guaranteed till 1907. This pump required repairs in 1904. A local
                        mechanic was consulted and charged with the work without contract or
                        specification. The work was estimated by the High Commission engineer at L.E
                        11. A bill for L E. 90 was presented. As the original cost of the pump was
                        only L.E. 100 this may be characterised as a bad bargain. At Assouan the
                        design for the pump chamber was not submitted to the Public Works
                        Department, with the result that the walls leaked like a sieve when the Nile
                        rose. The work farther was pronounced as bad. At Suez oar inspector had
                        occasion to complain of the quality of road metal, which instead of passing
                        a 0 5 ring, varied on 40% of the consignment from a maximum of 0*15 to a
                        minimum of 0*7. Such metal is quite useless. It was discovered that no
                        conditions of any kind had been imposed on the contractor famishing. The
                        metal had to be broken up by the road makers and cost in consequence 24 P.T.
                        per metre against a normal 16 P.T."</p>
                    <p>In regard to this criticism, Sir William Garstin remarks in his introduction
                        to the P.W.D. report</p>
                    <p>"Mr. Perry criticises the work done by the local committees on the whole
                        unfavorably. He considers that they endeavour first to attain independence
                        from control, and place efficiency in the second rank of importance.
                        Doubtless this is so to a certain extent, but, with time, it is to be hoped
                        that improvement will result A great deal of good work is being done, and
                        the principle of interesting the inhabitants of these towns in their own
                        improvements, and giving them a voice regarding the expenditure, is a sound
                        one. In everything but unimportant projects, moreover,they are controlled by
                        the Superior Committee. "</p>

                    <p>Speaking at Queen's Hall, Mr. Asquith said that attempts are being made to
                        steal votes in favor of Protection under the false cry of "Home Rules." He
                        was of opinion that, like himself, the majority of the Liberal Party in the
                        new Parliament will be opposed to ad vancing on any path leading to
                        separation, being resolved to maintain the supreme authority of the Imperial
                        Parliament. But if, on these lines, it were attempted to liberalise and
                        improve the Irish administration, they could not be accused of being the
                        enemies of the integrity of the Empire, for they would but be developing
                        it.</p></div>

                    <head>GERMAN SHIPPING WAR.</head>
                    <p>PROBABLE EMBRACE OF THE TWO DISPUTANTS.</p>
                    <p>Berlin, December 11.</p>
                    <p>There are good grounds for believing that the dispute between the
                        Hamburg-America and the North German Lloyd Steamship Companies may
                        ultimately lead to the fusion of both companies into the most powerful
                        shipping combination in the world.</p>
                    <p>The dispute which broke out nearly a month ago was the inevitable result of
                        the latent hostility which has long existed between the two concerns. The
                        Hamburg-America and the North German Lloyd competed against one another
                        freely in former years, but fully twenty-five years ago their common
                        interests compelled them to conclude a work ing arrangement based on a
                        division of spheres of interest in several parts of the world. This
                        co-operation was gradually extend-ed year after year, until each company's
                        sphere was clearly defined.</p>
                    <p>The North German Lloyd was accused of violating this agreement by invading
                        the Hamburg-America's preserves, whereupon the latter announced its
                        intention of proceeding relentlessly against its Bremen competitor. The
                        Emperor intervened in the dispute, with the intention of bringing about an
                        amicable settlement, because strife between, these two great companies would
                        benefit neither, and would cripple both very seriously. This was a serious
                        prospect from the German national point of view, since both the
                        Hamburg-America and the North German Lloyd are closely connected with
                        commercial prosperity.</p>
                    <p>Herr Ballln's Ambition.</p>
                    <p>The managing director of the Hamburg America, Herr Ballin, and the managing
                        director of the North German Lloyd, Herr Wiegand, after conferring
                        individually with the Emperor, met last week at Berlin to discuss their
                        differences. It is expected that their conference will provide a basis for a
                        satisfactory settlement of the dispute. The settlement will probably be
                        arranged on conditions which will promote the ultimate fusion of the two
                        companies. It is known that Herr Baltin, whose ambition is proportionate to
                        his wonderful skill in organising, aims at the union of the two companies
                        under his own direction. On the other hand, the North Ger man Lloyd, which
                        does not desire amalgamation, will strenuously resist Herr Baltins attempts
                        to bring this about; but it is gene rally expected that the weaker Bremen
                        company will finally, in its own interests, consent to be absorbed by its
                        Hamburg rival.</p>
                    <p>Herr Baltin probably anticipates that a number of the smaller shipping
                        companies of Hamburg and Bremen would then join the combination, thus giving
                        the Hamburg-America line a practical monopoly of the German shipping trade
                        and making him the dictator of Germany's mercantile marine.</p>
                    <p>A financial writer in the ''Zukunft" com pares Herr Baltin with Mr. Pierpont
                        Morgan. but describes him as possessing "more stability than the speculative
                        Yankee."</p>

                    <head>WILL EGYPTIAN HOTEL KEEPERS FOLLOW SUIT ?</head>
                    <p>The International Association of Hotel Keepers, at present holding a
                        conference in Brunswick, have passed a resolution in favor of raising their
                        prices after Jan. 1. According to the statements of speakers at the
                        conference, Continental hotel proprietors have rain staring them in the face
                        if they do not resort to extraordinary measures. Their expenses during the
                        past ten years have risen by leaps and bounds, salaries are higher, they
                        have had to provide elevators, install electric light, modern bath rooms,
                        modern sanitary appliances, steam heating, etc. Taxes are higher, and now
                        come higher prices for butcher's meat and provisions generally. It is
                        thought that an additional 20 per cent. all round will meet the necessities
                        of the case.</p>

                    <p>The Political Situation.</p>
                    <p>Excepting the very improved position of the American market nothing has
                        occurred of importance here this week, the Stock Exchange settlement, which
                        was of a satisfactory but an interesting character, having employed a large
                        part of the time. Apart from the disturbed state of Russia, and the somewhat
                        artificial cloud over our relations with Germany, the political situation is
                        unchanged. As regards the latter differences, the mutual expressions of
                        good-will which begin to be interchanged between the people of both
                        countries, and the categorical assurances of Prince Bulow are tending to
                        dear the air and promote a better understanding.</p>
                    <p>The Money Position.</p>
                    <p>The Bank statement is only worse through the Bank consolidating its own
                        position by-withdrawing money from the market and making its rate effective,
                        which is better for all purposes than raising the rate, as 4% is a healthy
                        figure for both bankers and public.</p>
                    <p>Prosperous Trade.</p>
                    <p>Trade continues to be prosperous in almost all countries of the world, and
                        the amounts being distributed for dividends are very large. We do not,
                        therefore, look for dear money, particularly while the cautious attitude of
                        the investing public continues. The reports from South Africa, showing that
                        the output from the gold-mines will reach this year over £20,000,000, while
                        highly satisfactory, do not seem to have had any appreciable effect upon the
                        shares, some of which are undoubtedly altogether undervalued. The
                        extraordinary prosperity of America and Canada is, however, after all the
                        most important feature.</p>
                    <p>Gilt-edged Stocks.</p>
                    <p>Consols have suffered a slight relapse this week, and leave off at 89 3/16 a
                        fall of 11/16 since our last. Other gilt-edged stocks are fairly steady.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Bonds.</p>
                    <p>A more optimistic report, at the beginning of the week, of the condition of
                        affairs in Russia, sent Russian bonds up 1 1/4 points, but the advance has
                        not been maintained, and the price has gradually declined to 80 3/4. The new
                        Japanese loan is quoted to-night at 5 7/8 prem.</p>
                    <p>Railways.</p>
                    <p>Business in the market for home railways has been quiet, with a dull tone
                        prevailing. The traffic receipts, though not quite so large as those of
                        previous weeks, were, with perhaps one exception, good, and the surprising
                        feature was the large increase in the South Eastern return, despite the
                        Charing Cross disaster. When the holidays are over this market should come
                        in for a larger share of attention. The American market has shown some very
                        large dealings, and the great prosperity of the country gives a firm
                        undertone. There has been much speculation in Union Pacifics, which are now
                        147 7/8. Various reasons are given for this, but at the time of writing we
                        cannot get at anything authoritative.</p>
                    <p>Egyptians.</p>
                    <p>There is hardly anything to report respecting the Egyptian market; there has
                        been a total absence of business in all classes of shares. National Bank of
                        Egypt have scarcely moved and close. 25 1/4 1/2. Agricultural Banks remain
                        firm at 9 1/8 1/4 and the Preference are a little firmer at 10 1/16—3/16.
                        New Agriculturals are quoted 8 3/4—9. Daira Ordinary have fallen back to 17
                        1/4, but the Deferred keep steady at 106-110. Daira Sugar are only a very
                        nominal market at 4 1/4. Corporation of Western Egypt advanced at one time
                        to 11/16 premium bid, and close firm either side of this figure. Delta
                        Preference bearer at 11 3/4 and Delta Land at 2 1/8 are unchanged. There is
                        nothing fresh in Egyptian Markets at. 1 5/16 and Salt and Soda at 1 1/16.
                        Union Fonciere have fallen to 11/16 premium, and Abyssinian Banks are
                        lifeless at about 1/8 discount. There has been a farther enquiry for

                        with no sellers about. Bank of Roumania have sprung into life again on very

                    <p>In the South African mining market Ge-dulds were sold, largely on Wednesday
                        owing to the fact that the assay returns which were expected, had not been
                        published. Yesterday the shares recovered some of the setback of the
                        previous day, and were assisted by the publication of a satisfactory return
                        from the mine. This recovery had a favorable effect on the market in
                        general.</p>
                    <p>The Egyptian mining section has been almost unmentioned since our last. Nile

                    <head>THE EMANCIPATION OF EGYPT</head>
                    <p>II.</p>
                    <p>Chapter I, Part II. opens with the following fine passage :—</p>
                    <p>"We have thus discussed the events which led up to the British Occupation in
                        1882. We have dwelt upon the necessities of that occupation, and in so doing
                        justified it as far as it stood in need of justification. The next point
                        which has been dealt with was the British Occupation, and we have thown that
                        it has up till now been highly beneficial to Egypt, in spite of all that has
                        been advanced to the contrary But if we are to secure a basis which will
                        enable us to discuss with profit the political conjunctures of the present
                        and the political possibilities of the future, we must considerably extend
                        our sphere of investigation. The Egyptian question is made up of a tangled
                        web of international factors. Almost every nation in Europe has invested
                        large earnings in Egypt, and consequently almost every nation in Europe has
                        the keenest individual interest in seeing Egypt thrive and prosper."</p>
                    <p>In several well-written pages the author proceeds to outline Turkish
                        influence in Egypt; from these we quote the following short paragraph :
                        —</p>
                    <p>" The tide of anti-Turkish prejudice still runs high throughout the West. The
                        generality of Europeans are enable to grasp the wide gulf which severs the
                        Turk as a political being from the Turk as a social being. The few people
                        who have come into actual contact with the Turk in private life and have
                        experienced his unfailing courtesy, his unfailing tact, and have really
                        found that the Turk is the gentleman of the East, have failed to stem to any
                        perceptible extent the stream of popular dislike and suspicion which marks
                        the West as a whole. In Egypt, the Turk remains an exceedingly important
                        social factor. He has a multitude of friends ; it must he admitted a far
                        greater multitude since his fall from power.</p>
                    <p>"It must also never be forgotten that Mohamedan Egypt is bound by puissant
                        religious ties to the Sultan as Khalif, as Defender of the Faithful, and
                        that the Saltan still has (he appointment of the important office of the
                        Grand Cadi. Above all it must be remembered that the Khedive is not only
                        appointed and invested with the dignity of Ruler of Egypt, but that the
                        constitution of that country is practically defined by the Sultan."</p>
                    <p>We think that, at all events with reference to the past few years, the writer
                        would have been better advised, if he had said "theoretically" instead of
                        "practically," in the last sentence. Our author goes on to review at
                        considerable length Russian influence in the East, and we shall refer to
                        this later on, in our concluding remarks. To German influence he also
                        devotes several pages, from which we quote a few lines :—</p>
                    <p>"To come, then, to the discussion of Germany as a factor in Egypt's future.
                        Germany can no longer be treated with the scant consideration of pre
                        Bismarckian days. Her progress has bean rapid, and she figures to day in the
                        forefront of the great Powers. Her commercial activity is universally
                        recognised and generally felt, and her pretensions to become a World Power
                        cannot be denied."</p>
                    <p>"The direct point upon which German energies are concentrated has long been
                        an open secret. For years they have been endeavouring to Germanise Asia
                        Minor with the same thoroughness with which we have shown France to have
                        formerly Frenchified Egypt."</p>
                    <p>"There remains, as we have said, the possible opposition of England to
                        Germany's schemes in Asia Minor, and for this reason Germany may be very
                        glad to retain the means of at least diplomatically tying England's hand.
                        While England remains in Egypt she can make but a half-hearted protect to
                        Germany making a second Egypt out of Asia Minor, including, perhaps, the
                        Euphrates valley."</p>
                    <p>"But Germany's policy is now wavering in the balance. All we know is that she
                        is sensitive of the imperious necessity of finding some field of colonial
                        expansion ; where that field of expansion is to be, we cannot be so sure.
                        The events of the past few months may perhaps be found to have
                        revolutionised the kaleidoscope of Eastern affairs."</p>
                    <p>Our author evidently thinks that if England would kindly give up Egypt she
                        would acquire some sort of "locuestandi" for interfering with German
                        development in Asia Minor and the Euphrates Valley ; we refrain from
                        commenting on this suggested change of positions just now, but we may say
                        something with reference to it later on.</p>
                    <p>A whole chapter is devoted to France and Italy, which are justly considered
                        considerable factors in the Egyptian question ; and here we find some very
                        interesting remarks, from which we extract a few passages :—</p>
                    <p>' Next to Great Britain, France has always been regarded, and very correctly
                        regarded, as being by far the most important factor in the future of Egypt.
                        But the attitude of France, which has been defended and opposed, and
                        criticised from every possible point of view, io books innumerable, in half
                        the languages of Europe, has been almost invariably misconstrued. 'This fact
                        is all the more astonishing when we consider that in the position which
                        France has taken up towards Egyptian affairs she has in nowise deviated from
                        her traditional policy. Among the number of writers on Egypt figure the
                        names of not a few eminent politicians, to whose opinion one naturally
                        listens with defer ential attention ; but when they come to speak of France
                        they are, or have up to the present been, almost without exception
                        completely mistaken.</p>
                    <p>It is happily not our business: to show the fallacy of all those gloomy hot
                        fortunately groundless forebodings; circumstances have</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>done so amply enough. England has found herself involved in expense, and with
                        her energies folly taxed, but France, so far from disclosing a hostile
                        policy, has done every thing in her power to free England's hands.</p>
                    <p>"That France has thoroughly realised the futility of such dreams we cannot
                        for a moment doubt. Few countries have had such magnificent colonial
                        prospects, few so unconcernedly , or perhaps ruthlessly, sacrificed them to
                        home necessities. The life of nations is much like the life of men. If the
                        household is torn within, and threatened without the man cannot venture to
                        embark on fair schemes far from home. Even so it is with France. We need
                        only remember the French dominions in Canada, which were ceded to England,
                        it is true, as the price of a disastrous war, yet when they were still
                        French, not an energetic move was made to save them, not a man was sent to
                        relieve Montcalm, who was vainly struggling against overwhelming odds.
                        France has had its great sailors and its empire-builders, but most have died
                        broken-hearted at the pitiless way in which their life-work has been
                        immolated in the interests at home.</p>
                    <p>The other great imperial possession of France is Algeria, only a few hours'
                        sail from Toulon, and which despite the vigorous efforts which it cost to
                        conquer, has since proved a valuable asset and a source of military
                        strength, for from Algeria France has been able to call Zouave troops to her
                        aid."</p>
                    <p>"We might at first not unnaturally be very surprised at finding that while
                        the vast German Empire has great difficulty in maintaining its rule over
                        comparatively small African territories, a small power like Portugal is able
                        to keep its holding in Africa, proportionately a for larger one, with
                        relative peace and security. The Germans find themselves taxed to the utmost
                        in suppressing a temporary revolt such as that of the Herreros, while the
                        Dutch are able to keep a strong hold upon such possessions as Acheen, where
                        her subjects are in a perennial state of insubordination—but Holland has
                        long ceased to be troubled by home difficulties. The act of neutralisation
                        has made her as complete apolitical island as England is a geographical one,
                        her resources may not he very enormous, but they stand at her absolute
                        disposal, she can concentrate all her forces upon her weak point, while
                        Germany cannot afford to ship any large expedition over sea. Germany cannot
                        overwhelm the Herreros by the dispatch of an army of crusing power."</p>
                    <p>"If Egyptians have seen the light of their hopes in France they have deluded
                        themselves, and to-day that sun has irrevocably set.</p>
                    <p>"Should Egypt become an independent national unity, it will be because such
                        an independence readily combines the interests of all parties concerned. She
                        will never become so by the quixotic but impolitic action of a great
                        power.</p>
                    <p>In the foregoing remarks with reference to France our author shows, as in
                        many parts of this book, an intimate knowledge and a firm grasp of his
                        subject. On the question of Algeria we do not quite agree with him, there is
                        much that might he said, but it is beyond our present purpose to divert the
                        attention of our readers in that direction. He is hardly complimentary in
                        his remarks on German efforts in colonisation in Africa, but much more so to
                        Portugal and Holland ; the latter is said to have long ceased to be troubled
                        by home difficulties. We are still inclined to think that Holland has
                        existed for many years past, with the fear of God and a powerful neighbour,
                        so intensely before its eyes, that it is hardly that haven of rest which our
                        author's remarks might lead us to believe.</p>
                    <p>When we come to the Italian question, we are said to be treading on tender
                        ground ; whether it is because our author is peculiarly sensitive when he is
                        writing of his own country, or for some other reason which we cannot fathom,
                        we fail to follow him here so easily as in most other parts of the book.</p>
                    <p>There is in Egypt a large and prosperous Italian colony ; we believe it has
                        never been larger or more prosperous than at the present moment The public
                        works carried out in Egypt in recent years, such as the construction of the
                        Assouan Dam and many other undertakings, have given employment to a large
                        number of Italians; Italy has sent us some of our best judges and lawyers,
                        and we have always bean under the impression that Italians have worked even
                        more cordially with the English, than people of most other nationalities. We
                        fail to see how Italians have suffered in any way from England's
                        intervention in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Our author rightly says that it was the ambition of Italy to annex an
                        exceedingly rich hinterland to their former possessions in Africa. Would it
                        have been possible we ask, for even Italy's best friends to tell her that
                        she had better not avail herself of the opportunity which offered, for fear
                        of disaster ; we think not, nor do we agree that Italy was employed as a
                        cat's paw. Still our author argues with a considerable amount of equity and
                        forbearance, as will be shown by the following extracts :</p>
                    <p>"When we come to apeak of the Italian attitude towards the Egyptian question
                        we are treading upon much more tender ground. By way of preface we may say
                        that the position of Italy has during the last few years undergone an almost
                        entire change, and this change has not been brought about without a very
                        considerable amount of ruffled feelings. The change has not been the cause
                        of any diplomatic ruptures, and consequently has come about without the use
                        of anything but the most polite of phrases. But diplomatists have made it
                        part of their profession to say the harshest things in the most polite
                        words. The threat of war is gilded into considering something as an
                        unfriendly act, so that we may well imagine that much bitterness of heart
                        may underlie quite impeccable civility."</p>
                    <p>"With a view to what we have to say, we must again deny that the part played

                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>England can be justly termed Machiavellian Mach has been written against
                        England, who is represented as having lured Italy into African disaster
                        purely in order to farther British interests. This is a very harsh and
                        uncompromising fashion of stating the case. And although it has some element
                        of truth, for nobody will to-day deny that Italy was employed as a cat's-paw
                        in the solution of the complicated Central Africa problem, nevertheless it
                        cannot be advanced that England in any way outstepped the recognised rales
                        of the political game. If Italy was encouraged in the undertaking of her
                        disastrous African schemes by English politicians, her catastrophe cannot he
                        laid to England's charge. Whatever encouragement Italy received she most
                        very well have been able to estimate at its intrinsic value, and her
                        military political reverses can be visited apon none bat herself.</p>
                    <p>'The Italians were already in possession of a very important outlet on the
                        Red Sea coast in Eretria, and it was their great ambition to ensure the good
                        fortune of this opening by annexing the exceedingly rich hinterland. This
                        could only be done at the expense of Abyssinia. The Italians required
                        encouragement, and encouragement they very naturally received in abundance
                        from the English, who were above all anxious to with-' draw Abyssinian
                        attention from the Nile. If the Negus was kept on the Red Sea. he would be
                        unable to either succour the Mahdi or forestall the English in occupying the
                        upper barks of the Nile. That England foresaw the Italian defeat is quite
                        untenable, as that defeat did not at all assist the British calculations,
                        although, by treaty, matters were subsequently satisfactorily arranged with
                        the Negus."</p>
                    <p>"We need nit go into the sore feelings which the Italians undoubtedly do feel
                        to some ex tent with regard to England, whom they consider to have duped
                        them into their Abyssinian calamities, but we would point out that Italy is
                        not likely to take the British side in the case of any anti-British
                        combination."</p>
                    <p>''The British occupation, at all events, avoid-ed the necessity of bringing
                        the awkward question up again, at all events for the time being. This
                        temporary solution of the difficulty was undoubtedly rendered much more
                        easy, much more satisfactory, by the faultless tact shown by the statesman
                        whom-England appointed to represent her in Egypt. It is difficult to
                        overrate the conduct of such men as Lord Cromer, against whom indeed the
                        most embittered fault-finders of British policy have refrained, as a rule,
                        from uttering a word of disparagement. He has, indeed, won universal esteem
                        for the manner in which he has filled a post fall of thorns and
                        difficulties, withoat once transgressing the limits of the utmost courtesy.
                        He has known how to yield graciously, when he could yield without injuring
                        the interests of his country, and he has known how to exact rigorously, but
                        without giving offence when the British policy compelled him to be exacting.
                        Lord Cromer's tact has served as a model on which numberless other officials
                        have moulded their conduct, and things have therefore on the whole gone very
                        smoothly.'</p>
                    <p>"To-day as we have shown the situation has changed. The over-sensitive
                        apprehensions of almost every European Power with regard to Egypt has cooled
                        down and down, until each of them, we have seen, regards the maintenance of
                        the present condition with complete difference."</p>
                    <p>"England's passion for Imperialism has undergone phases, it has at no time
                        suffered eclipse ; all Englishmen when probed to the quick will be found
                        Imperialists at heart; they differ among themselves only on questions of
                        method and degree."</p>
                    <p>"Even the most unintelligent eye could not fail, upon looking at a map of the
                        Mediterranean, to see the wonderful strategic importance of the Ionian
                        Islands, and above all of Corfu. Lying as they do under the shelter of the
                        Greek coast, but just opposite to the point where the heel of Italy draws
                        closest to Epirus, they effectively command the entrance to the Adriatic. At
                        the present day a Naval Power in possession of them would render useless the
                        whole of the Austro-Hungarian seaboard, by cutting off its one outlet to the
                        Mediterranean."</p>
                    <p>"We cannot here, nor would it he to the point to give a detailed history of
                        the various occupations of the Ionian Islands, before they were ultimately
                        handed over to the English in 1814 as a reward by Louis XVIII. for valuable
                        services received. Suffice it to say that they were employed with great
                        advantage by Napoleon as a stepping-stone towards Egypt; and, as he hoped,
                        towards India ; and he subsequently hoped to make them exceedingly valuable
                        in his designs on Central Europe. His hopes were blighted at Aboukir Bay,
                        but, although three of the Islands were afterwards captured by the English
                        fleet, Corfu continued to hold out until Napoleon's abdication."</p>
                    <p>"We are not yet admitted into all the secrets of the Government, and are
                        unable to tell all the puissant motives which led to Mr. Gladstone's cession
                        of the islands in 1864. The difficulties of keeping the natives in order
                        were no doubt great but England had patiently overcome them for 50 years,
                        and did not lose patience now. Neither was England compelled to abandon the
                        islands, as is currently said, in order to secure the non-election of the
                        Franco-Russian candidate the Duke of Leuch--tenherg to the Greek throne. The
                        outcry raised against the evacuation was great: it was confidently predicted
                        that England's Naval preponderance in the Mediterranean was gone for ever, a
                        fear which subsequent years have sufficiently allayed.</p>
                    <p>"In the sequel England has not found her naval superiority in the
                        Mediterranean impaired ; and if in the case of war it should become
                        important to re-occupy Corfu, England would stand as good if not a better
                        chance of securing the islands than would any other Power.</p>
                    <cb n="4"/>
                    <p>"All this has gone to show that even in Imperialist policy there are moments
                        when retirement and seeming self-abnegation are not misplaced, and when,
                        though sheer force would very probably have proved successful, yet its
                        employment would not have been adequately rewarded."</p>
                    <p>"It would he very untrue argument to say that in politics all false positions
                        are pernicious, for it is, on the contrary, generally recognised that - in
                        political life we cannot get on without them. The stiff and starched
                        moralist may perhaps take exception to what he considers a very debasing
                        principle to admit, but we would- once more warn the reader against
                        endeavouring to conduct politics upon the same strict principles which we at
                        all events strive to observe in private life; he will not succeed. In
                        private life we would vigorously uphold the doctrine that false positions
                        are a man's ruin : he must avoid them with all his power, and if he by
                        inadvertence or misfortune allows himself to be drawn into one, he must
                        escape from it at all hazards and at all sacrifices. In politics, perhaps
                        unhappily, but by their very nature, we are bound to accept false positions.
                        We cannot always attain that excellent and primitive bluntness which having
                        once called a spade a spade closes the subject for ever. We cannot always
                        reconcile the de facto with the de jure and however much the moralist may
                        cry out;we are bound to tolerate situations which in private life would be
                        very rightly called lies, but which in politics, when they take any name at
                        all, are termed compromises."</p>
                    <p>"We shall then abstain from riding on the high horse, and, as we have already
                        said, we shall make no reproaches. The fact that England has repeatedly
                        declared her intention of, evacuating Egypt and yet to the present day has
                        failed to fulfil her engagement, we shall certainly not take into
                        consideration from the point of view of abstract morality ; such a
                        discussion, although it affords ample scope for anti-British declamation,
                        and has hitherto famished, and will doubtlessly continue to furnish, gutter
                        scribblers with many a sounding period, does not advance the candid
                        investigator nor the wall-meaning counsellor one jot or one tittle. All we
                        wish at present to discover whether the maintenance of England's false
                        position in Egypt really pays her. Does she really mean business ?</p>
                    <p>"The advantages which England derives from Egypt are undoubtedly immense. Are
                        they in any way enhanced by England's semi-occupation of the country ? Would
                        they in any way be impaired by its evacuation ?</p>
                    <p>"To begin with, Egypt no longer lies upon the direct route to India, which
                        now runs through the Suez Canal. Even the most unmitigated Jingo has not yet
                        taken upon himself to propose the seizure of the neutralised Suez Canal. He
                        cannot even with a semblance of plausibility declare that the occupation of
                        Egypt is necessary in order to ensure the free navigation of the Red Sea. He
                        must be fully aware that, whether he has Egypt, or no, the Red Sea will be
                        open to him as long as he maintains the dominant sea power."</p>
                    <p>In answer to this we think it is only necessary to tay that so long as
                        England holds Egypt, and so long only she can trust the Suez Canal to take
                        care of itself.</p>
                    <p>"The advocate of evacuation can only wonder what are the motives which have
                        so far induced the English to keep so tenacious a hold upon Egypt; there is
                        no European Power desirous or capable of seizing the position if vacated by
                        England.</p>
                    <p>"Why should not Egypt form a type of this latter category ? It is owing to
                        the English tutelage that she has become fit to assume such a position, and
                        will England deny her the capacity to play the part for which she has
                        herself educated her ? Free, but under the eye of England, who encompasses
                        her on every side, Egypt would be as profitable to England, more loyal if
                        loyalty were required, and at any rate out of auy possibility of doing
                        harm.</p>
                    <p>"We have shown, on the contrary;! that the evacuation could not possibly
                        entail any danger, and that Egypt would remain, although independent, within
                        the circle of British power both by sea and land, which fact would be a
                        sufficient guarantee for her future good behaviour."</p>
                    <p>We regret to say that the opinions expressed in the last three paragraphs do
                        not appear to us to carry any conviction with them.</p>

                    <p>L'IMPORTATION DES CUIRS ET PEAUX EN EGYPTE.</p>
                    <p>L'importation des cuirs et peaux a encore sabi une importante augmentation et
                        est montée de 113.147 livres égyptiennes en 1903 à 133.352 livres
                        égyptiennes on 1904 ; les pays qui ont pris la plus grande part à dette
                        importation sont : Ja France, l'Autriohe-Hongrie, l'Allemagne, l'Angleterre
                        et la Turquie. L'article le plus important de cette branche de oommerce est
                        le ouir à semelles, qui a été im porté de France, d'Italie et aussi, depuis
                        quelques années, en quantités importantes, d'Autriche-Hongrie. Le cuir à
                        semelles italien "Buenos-Ayres" est vendu à Alexandrie de 2 fr. 40 à 3 fr.
                        35 le kilog. ; le ouir français de 2 fr. 90 à 3 fr. 50.</p>
                    <p>Le cuir à semelles hongrois s'est très bien importé à Alexandrie ; c'est un
                        produit qui est bien travaillé et qui n'est pas aussi chargé d'extraits que
                        le produit italien : son prix est d'environ 3 fr. 50 le kilog. La Hongrie
                        fournit également quelques coupons à 4 fr. et 4 fr. 30 le kilog.</p>
                    <p>Les pays qui participent à la fourniture du cuir pour empeignes sont surtout
                        la France, l'Allemagne, l'Angleterre et l'Italie, ainsi que
                        l'Autriohe-Hongrie et l'Amérique, pour des quantités peu importantes. Le
                        veau ciré est livré presque exclusivement par la France. La clientèle
                        indigène ne demande que des peaux légères pesant de 5 à 10 kilog. par doc*
                        zaine. Le produit français coûte de 9 fr. 50 à 10 fr. 50 le kilog. et est
                        très soigneusement travaillé. Les peaux de chevreaux trouvent on débouché
                        croissant dans le pays, elles soi t importées principalement d'Allemagne et
                        également par des fabriques françaises depuis longtemps introduites sur le
                        marché, leur taille est de 5 à 8 pieds carrés. La demande de veau de couleur
                        est aussi très importants.</p>
                    <p>La produit allemand, contre lequel le fran-çais ne peut que difficilement
                        lutter, est vendu sur le marché dans les tailles de 100 à 120 pieds carrés
                        et au prix de 120 à 150 fr. le pied carré. Le cuir scié, lourd,vient de
                        France, ainsi que d'Angleterre et d Amérique; il ne sert qu'à la fabrication
                        des chaussures ordinaires et coûte de 3 a 4 fr. le kilogramme.</p>
                    <p>Les veaux de couleur portent préjudice à la vente des chevreaux également de
                        couleur ; ces derniers sont importés d'Allemagne, de Franoe et
                        d'Autriohe-Hongrie, eu tailles et forces très différentes, au prix de 40 à
                        90 fr. la douzaine et ils sont principalement employés pour les chaussures
                        de dames. Les mêmes pays fournissent aussi au prix de 70 à 90 fr. la
                        douzaine le chevreau maroquin, qui trouve son emploi dans la reliure, la
                        carrosserie et l'industrie des meubles. Le veau ohamoisé, de meilleure
                        qualité, est livré en petites quantités par la France au prix de 100 à 130
                        fr., et par l'Allemagne aux prix de 95 à 125 fr., la douzaine. L'Allemagne
                        et la France livrent aussi des petits lots de chamois au prix de 30 à 45
                        fr., la douzaine. La vache vernie trouve un débouché assez important dans
                        cette contrée et elle e3t importée spécialement d'Amérique ; cependant, il
                        en vient aussi d'Allemagne et de France; son prix varie entre 22 et 45 fr.
                        la peau ; elle est employée surtout dans la carrosserie.Le veau verni vient
                        en grande partie d'Allemagne ; les prix de et article sont très différents,
                        suivant la taille,et varient entre 60 et 130 fr. la douzaine. Le mouton
                        verni est également importé de France et d'Allemagne, mais en petites
                        quantités ; on l'emploie à la fabrication des chaussures de dames et des
                        courroie'.</p>

                    <p>Les jours d'Europe sont en baisse sensible. A Londres, le Consolidé a perdu
                        hier 5/8 de livre, la National Bank of Egypt 1/4 et l'A-gricole 1/8. A

                    <p>La récente élévation du taux d'escompte à Londres est attribuée
                        principalement aux craintes d'exportation d'or, notamment vers l'Amérique du
                        Sud. A Paris et à Berlin on appréhende, d'autre part, le resserrement
                        monétaire qui pourrait être déterminé par les embarras éventuels du Tresor
                        russe.</p>
                    <p>Assurément, les baissiers noircissent à outrance le tableau. Il n'en est pas
                        moins évident que les marchés régulateurs sont mal préparés au grand effort
                        qu'il faudra faire fin décembre. Il faut ajouter que cet effort sera de
                        courte durée, car des disponibilités considérables reviendront au marché
                        aussitôt après.</p>
                    <p>loi, ce matin, le marché des valeurs a été calme sur les Banques. La National
                        et F Agricole se maintiennent à leurs cours d'hier. Le Crédit Foncier
                        clôture en baisse d'un frano à 776.</p>
                    <p>Un bon mouvement, que nous avions prévu d'ailleurs, s'est dessiné sur les
                        Improprement Corporation. On a ouvert à 4 1/8 pour hausser, sur des
                        demandes, à 4 5/16. Les acheteurs sont sérieux et il faut s'attendre à des
                        cours plus élevés.</p>
                    <p>L'aotion Agricoles du Nil a gagné 3 francs à 238 ; la part de fondateur est
                        restée à £ 4.</p>
                    <p>Laotien Jouissance des Eaux du Caire a perdu 2 francs à 246.</p>
                    <p>L'aotion Ciments fléchit à 70 et les dividendes à 20.</p>
                    <p>Dans le groupe des Hôtels, les Baehler ont monté à 3 1/4. Les Nungovich
                        restent à 10 5/8.</p>
                    <p>Parmi les petites valeurs, les Oasis reculent £ 0 15/16 et les Sait and Soda
                        à 19 sh. La Delta Land est à 2 1/16 sans affaires et les Investment Abdy à 1
                        3/32.</p>
                    <p>Nous avons eu l'occasion de parler oes jours dernieis de la bonne affaire
                        faite par l'Egyptian Land and General Trust (Hooker) en achetant 65 % de la
                        superficie du domaine de Gourbal à Alexandrie. Ce domaine mesure au total 49
                        feddans, sur lesquels environ 32 reviennent au Trust. Il s'agit d'excellents
                        terrains de construction acquis à des conditions très avantageuses, et il
                        est certain que la Société tirera un gros profit de cette opération. Il en
                        est de même pour le vaste terrain de construction acheté par le Trust dans
                        le quartier de Nasrieh au Caire, près le ministère des finances.</p>
                    <p>On annonce, d'autre part, que le Trust a fait d'heureuses acquisitions de
                        terrains dans le voisinage immédiat de Khartoum, et qu'il est sur le point
                        de terminer deux ou trois autres affaires des plus rémunératrices.</p>
                    <p>L'assemblée générale extraordinaire de la Cassa di Sconto, convoquée pour le
                        17 courant, n'ayant pas réuni le nombre d'aotions prescrit par les Statuts
                        pour délibérer valablement, a été ajournée à Dimanche prochain 24 décembre,
                        à 10 h. a.m., au siège social à Alexandrie.</p>
                    <p>Un dividende de 5 %, moins l'inoome-tax, sera payé, à partir du 23 déœmbre, à
                        l'Anglo-Egyptian Bank, sur le coupon N° 5 des actions Egyptien Markets.</p>
                    <p>La hausse sur le coton s'accentue en Amé. rique. Le spot a encore gagné 15
                        points, le Janvier 19 et le Mai 21.</p>
                    <p>Le marché de Liverpool est également en bonne tendanoe.</p>
                    <p>On prévoit généralement des cours plus élevés, notamment s'il est exact que
                        le rapport des Ginners évalue à 8,975,000 le nombre des balles égrenées
                        jusqu'au 15 décembre.</p>

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY</head>
                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at
                        Salsomaggiore.</p>

                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                        on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
