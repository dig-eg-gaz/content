                        <p>The promise of warmer weather yesterday was not fulfilled, and the day
                            was cold and bleak. The wind dropped to 14 kilom. per hour and the sea
                            became smoother. The morning opens cloudy with prospects of more rain.
                            The barometer is rising, and there are indications that the weather will
                            improve as the day advances.</p>

                    <head>THE FRENCH AND MOROCCO.</head>
                    <p>The publication of the French Yellow Book on Morocco on the same day as the 
                        utterance of the speech of the German Imperial Chancellor to protest against 
                        the charges against Germany of aggression and hostility has led to some 
                        comparisons in the home Press. Just when we were asking ourselves how far 
                        suspicion of German policy ought to melt like snow before the genial sunbeams 
                        of German official assurances, sudden ly a yard measure is thrust into our 
                        hands, whore with some very useful measurements can bo taken. Briefly, it 
                        comes to this, that, a year and a half ago, Prince Bulow made certain state 
                        ments in the Reichstag, the value of which has since been tested by 
                        experience. The result of that test forms, as the “Times” put it on Friday 
                        last, “the best possible comment upon the pacific protestations in which 
                        Prince Billow indulged once again, yesterday, in regard to this country.” 
                        The official documents now show that as far back as 1901 the Maghzen was 
                        trying to enlist European support against France while subjecting her to 
                        constant friction and annoyance on her Algerian frontier. As the result of 
                        c ommunications between M. Delcasse and the German Ambassador in Paris, 
                        the latter admit tad very fully the right of France to a “special position” 
                        in Morocco. That right was subsequently fortified by the Sultan’s request 
                        for French military assistance to crash the Pretender, with which request 
                        France refused to comply, thereby proving her determination to refrain from 
                        anything in the nature of a military adventure in Morocco. Such was the 
                        situation when the crucial fact of the Anglo-French Agreement made its 
                        appearance in the spring of last year.</p>
                    <p>It is with the Anglo-French Agreement that the comparison which Friday’s 
                        London papers invite begins. The German justification for action which has 
                        caused the downfall of M. Delcass6, and has seriously menaced the peace of 
                        Earope, consists in the allegation that the French Minister withheld from 
                        Germany all knowledge of the contents of the Agreement, with intent to flout 
                        and to “isolate” Germany. What are the facts ? In March, last year, M. 
                        Delcasse, in reply to enquiries, fully explained to Prince Radolin the
                        position of France in regard to Morocco. Thereupon the Ambassador thanked 
                        him cordially for an explanation which (as he has since admitted) had not 
                        been vouchsafed to any other Power except Russia. Soon after Prince Bulow 
                        publicly stated in the Reichstag that Germany had no reason to dread any 
                        infringement of her mercantile interests in Morocco. A few weeks later, when 
                        the Agreement had been signed, the French Ambassador gave farther assurances
                        at Berlin, which assurances the Chancellor accepted in the Reichstag in terms 
                        which were cordially received, all the world over, as a frank recognition of 
                        the true character of the Anglo-French Agreement. Later on, when the 
                        franco-Spanish Agreement was officially communicated to the Powers, with 
                        farther assurances of commercial freedom for all in Morocco, the German official
                        reply affirmed that Germany’s interests in that oonntry were purely of the
                        economic sort. That, however, was last autumn. The winter brought a decisive 
                        change in the state of international affairs ; the result of the Russo-Japanese 
                        war was no longer in doubt; the military power of the ally of France had 
                        collapsed ; the battle of Mukden had swept all the chessmen off the board, 
                        and a new game was to begin. Germany then announced that “the Imperial 
                        Government totally ignored the Agreements that had been concluded as regards 
                        Morocco” on the ground that Germany had been systematically excluded. Then 
                        came the Imperial visit to Tangier and the series of diplomatic menaces to 
                        France which are revealed in their entirety in the Yellow book. It was in 
                        Jane that things reached their most critical stage, when Prince Bulow actually 
                        talked about the danger of lingering on a road which “bordered a precipice and 
                        even an abyss.” Upon such language, and the diplomacy which accompanied it, 
                        comment is superfluous. France, however, kept her head in spite of all 
                        provocation, and perce was preserved. We are now within a few weeks of the 
                        Conference which is the outcome of the German procedure, and, in view of 
                        that coming event, the publication of the fall history of its antecedents 
                        is very timely.</p>

A native servant was killed, and several other passengers escaped with severe injuries. The locomotives and carriages of both trains were badly smashed, and several trucks turned over.</p>

                    <head>DETERIORATION OF EGYPTIAN COTTON.</head>
                    <p>Sir William Garstin remarks in his introduction to the P. W. D. Report for the past year : —</p>
                    <p>There is little doubt that the practice. so prevalent among the fellaheen, of drenching the cotton plants with water during the hot season, is bad for the yield. Under a hot sun, the atmosphere, beneath the leafy shade, must be steamy, and exceptionally suited to the production of the cotton worm. It is to this bad habit, as well as to overcropping the land, and to making use of inferior seed, that the deterioration of the Egyptian cotton crop is undoubtedly largely due.</p>

                    <p>A capital concert was given at Connaught House on Tuesday night under the patronage of Brig.-General Bullock, C. B., who opened the proceedings with a brief and witty speech. Then came "Call me back”, very nicely sung by Miss Bingham, with a violin obbligato by Mrs. Gardiner, which greatly pleased the audience. Mrs. Stephens was in good form,despite a cold, and Dr. Clarke’s Hungarian dances were admirably rendered with any amount of dash and spirit Miss Gertrude Simpson, with "A Woodland Madrigal” and a very fine ’cello solo by Herr Otto, were greatly appreciated Herr Otto’s playing was exquisite and hope to hear him many more times this season, The Rev. Thompson Burns hardly did justice to Gounod’s "Nazareth”, and the concert closed with a violin solo by Mrs. Gardiner, ably accompanied by Sig. Valentino.</p>
                    <p>The second part of the performance was most amusing. Mr. Stephens began with ventriloquist entertainment and ventriloquised with such realism that when he imitated a dog growling, a hound in another part of the building gave tongue with fervour. Then came a sale by auction of sweets and other good things, with Mr. Chinn as auctioneer, and finally a toy symphony with a bewildering number of instruments well conducted by Miss Simpson. After the National Anthem the Rev. R. MacInnes, in a short speech, thanked all who had given their services on his own behalf and that of his sister, after which proceedings dosed with the Doxology.</p>

                    <p>This morning the trial of the third batch of rioters began and the Court was still sitting as we went to press.</p>
                    <p>The third day’s hearing of the charges against 71 natives who were accused of being concerned in the rioting of Sunday week at Alexandria was concluded at the Native Court at 2 p.m. yesterday, when the presiding judge, Abdel Magid Bey, addressed the Court as follows:—</p>
                    <p>"Before pronouncing judgment I think it my duty, as an Egyptian and a Moslem, to say a few words. During the last few days I have perused the local papers and I have paid attention to their expressions of opinion and comments on the recent disturbance at Alexandria. Some journals have exaggerated the affair by stating that the outbreak was due to the religious fanaticism of the natives ; but having carefully studied the papers in the case, I have come to the conclusion that fanaticism played no part in the disturbances.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of his address the judge passed sentence on the prisoners. Of the total, 71, about 24 were acquitted, 25 were sentenced to six months’ imprisonment, with hard labour, and the remainder to one year’s imprisonment with hard labour.</p>

                    <p>WILSON NUNGOVICH.</p>
                    <p>RECEPTION AT THE SAVOY.</p>
                    <p>Great was the disappointment in Cairo that the weather had not been more favorable yesterday, when so much was expected of it. Luckily the rain did keep off during the afternoon, though the sun refused to shine. All Saints’ Church had been very prettily decorated  for the occasion of Miss Nungovioh’s wedding to Captain Wilson, and so many guests assembled that no one had time to notice the state of the weather. There was scarcely a seat to be had by half-past three, and it was only a few minutes after that hour when the bride appeared on her father’s arm, and followed by her pretty sister, Miss Marietta Nungovich, and the children bridesmaids and pages. A military band was stationed near the chancel and a fanfare of trumpets greeted her approach. The service was conducted by Dean Butcher and the Rev. Wilson, cousin of the bridegroom, who had travelled out from Dublin for the special purpose. The hymns sung during the service were "Oh perfect love” and "The voice that breathed o’er Eden,” and after the signing of the register the happy couple left the churoh while the band played the “Wedding March” with great effect.</p>
                    <p>The reception held afterwards at the Savoy Hotel was attended by over 500 people and was a most cheery function. Captain and Mrs. Wilson stood in the large hall and received the congratulations of all their friends, who afterwards found their way into the big dining hall, where refreshments were being served. It is almost impossible to give a list of the guests, but the following are a few among the number Prince Ahmed Fuad, Comte de Serionne, principal agent of the Suez Canal Co., Artin Pasha, Mazloum Pasha, Izzet Pasha, M. de la Boulinidre, Crookshank Pasha, Mr. and Mrs. Harari Pasha, Mrs. Kocb, Mrs. Wild, Mrs. Herrling, Mrs. Montagu Somers, Major and Mrs. Spong, Mrs. Scott Dalgleish, Mrs. Carton de Wiart, Mme De Martino Pasha, Mme Koth, Cot Lodd, Cot Magill, Mr. George Royle, Mr. Chas. Hoyle, Mme de Gorostarsu, Dr. and Mrs. Rucker-Jenisch, Consul General for Germany, Comte Kodziebrodzki, Consul General for Austria, Comte Stadnioki, of the Austrian Agenoy, Baron Oppenheim, Dr. Grafi, Mrs. Ballet, Mrs. Hunter, Mme Aghion, Mrs. Heller, Miss Snares, Miss A. Cattaui, Mgr. Photios, Patriarch of the Greek Orthodox Churoh, Dean and Mrs. Butcher, Mr. and Mrs. Patterson, Mrs. Vere Alston, etc.</p>
                    <p>Space and time forbid us giving details in this issue of the many lovely dresses worn on this occasion. The bride’s dress has already been described, with those worn by her brides maids and Mrs. Nungovioh. We hope to enlarge further on this subject and give the list of presents in our next issue.</p>

                    <p>The weather in the Mediterranean is re ported by all ships arriving at Alexandria as being very bad. Gales from between east and north have been raging over Italy, the Adriatic and the Tyrrhenian Sea and from north-east and west in Tunisia and Eastern Algeria. Within the area of the disturbance very heavy rains have been experienced daily. Numerous shipping casualties have been occasioned by the gales, and there has been great destruction of property on shore.</p>

                    <p>WEATHER SPOILS FIRST DAY’S SPORT.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday’s races were spoiled, as far as comfort was concerned, by the weather, which deserved everything that was said against it. Raw, cold, and windy, the afternoon was more than unpleasant, and the lair sex was mostly disinclined to brave the changes of rain. The racing, however, was not at all bad. Omar Bey Sultan and Ahmed Bey Bakri’s partnership pulled off the Cairo Derby and the sixth race, and the fourth race gave a good finish, won by Mr. Sohreiber’s White Feather. The entries in all but the second race were good, and it is the greatest of pities that the day was so unfavorable.</p>

                    <head>PROVINCIAL COMMISSIONS.</head>
                    <p>The work of the provincial local committees is unfavorably criticised by Mr. Perry in his recently issued report. He remarks as follows :</p>
                    <p>"Viewed from the stand-point of economical working the Commissions still show a very low efficiency. A false sense of amour-propre prevents their requesting technical advice from our inspectors. Their inexperience is exploited by local contractors, and considerable waste of public funds naturally results. Independence before Economy is evidently their watchword. As an instance, a pump had been erected at Assouan by Messrs. Cook and Son and guaranteed till 1907. This pump required repairs in 1904. A local mechanic was consulted and charged with the work without contract or specification. The work was estimated by the High Commission engineer at L.E 11. A bill for L E. 90 was presented. As the original cost of the pump was only L.E. 100 this may be characterised as a bad bargain. At Assouan the design for the pump chamber was not submitted to the Public Works Department, with the result that the walls leaked like a sieve when the Nile rose. The work farther was pronounced as bad. At Suez oar inspector had occasion to complain of the quality of road metal, which instead of passing a 0 5 ring, varied on 40% of the consignment from a maximum of 0*15 to a minimum of 0*7. Such metal is quite useless. It was discovered that no conditions of any kind had been imposed on the contractor famishing. The metal had to be broken up by the road makers and cost in consequence 24 P.T. per metre against a normal 16 P.T.”</p>
                    <p>In regard to this criticism, Sir William Garstin remarks in his introduction to the P.W.D. report</p>
                    <p>"Mr. Perry criticises the work done by the local committees on the whole unfavorably. He considers that they endeavour first to attain independence from control, and place efficiency in the second rank of importance. Doubtless this is so to a certain extent, but, with time, it is to be hoped that improvement will result A great deal of good work is being done, and the principle of interesting the inhabitants of these towns in their own improvements, and giving them a voice regarding the expenditure, is a sound one. In everything but unimportant projects, moreover,they are controlled by the Superior Committee. ”</p>

                    <p>Speaking at Queen's Hall, Mr. Asquith said that attempts are being made to steal votes in favor of Protection under the false cry of "Home Rules." He was of opinion that, like himself, the majority of the Liberal Party in the new Parliament will be opposed to ad vancing on any path leading to separation, being resolved to maintain the supreme authority of the Imperial Parliament. But if, on these lines, it were attempted to liberalise and improve the Irish administration, they could not be accused of being the enemies of the integrity of the Empire, for they would but be developing it.</p>

                    <head>GERMAN SHIPPING WAR.</head>
                    <p>PROBABLE EMBRACE OF THE TWO DISPUTANTS.</p>
                    <p>Berlin, December 11.</p>
                    <p>There are good grounds for believing that the dispute between the Hamburg-America and the North German Lloyd Steamship Companies may ultimately lead to the fusion of both companies into the most powerful shipping combination in the world.</p>
                    <p>The dispute which broke out nearly a month ago was the inevitable result of the latent hostility which has long existed between the two concerns. The Hamburg-America and the North German Lloyd competed against one another freely in former years, but fully twenty-five years ago their common interests compelled them to conclude a work ing arrangement based on a division of spheres of interest in several parts of the world. This co-operation was gradually extend-ed year after year, until each company’s sphere was clearly defined.</p>
                    <p>The North German Lloyd was accused of violating this agreement by invading the Hamburg-America’s preserves, whereupon the latter announced its intention of proceeding relentlessly against its Bremen competitor. The Emperor intervened in the dispute, with the intention of bringing about an amicable settlement, because strife between, these two great companies would benefit neither, and would cripple both very seriously. This was a serious prospect from the German national point of view, since both the Hamburg-America and the North German Lloyd are closely connected with commercial prosperity.</p>
                    <p>Herr Ballln's Ambition.</p>
                    <p>The managing director of the Hamburg America, Herr Ballin, and the managing director of the North German Lloyd, Herr Wiegand, after conferring individually with the Emperor, met last week at Berlin to discuss their differences. It is expected that their conference will provide a basis for a satisfactory settlement of the dispute. The settlement will probably be arranged on conditions which will promote the ultimate fusion of the two companies. It is known that Herr Baltin, whose ambition is proportionate to his wonderful skill in organising, aims at the union of the two companies under his own direction. On the other hand, the North Ger man Lloyd, which does not desire amalgamation, will strenuously resist Herr Baltins attempts to bring this about; but it is gene rally expected that the weaker Bremen company will finally, in its own interests, consent to be absorbed by its Hamburg rival.</p>
                    <p>Herr Baltin probably anticipates that a number of the smaller shipping companies of Hamburg and Bremen would then join the combination, thus giving the Hamburg-America line a practical monopoly of the German shipping trade and making him the dictator of Germany’s mercantile marine.</p>
                    <p>A financial writer in the ‘‘Zukunft” com pares Herr Baltin with Mr. Pierpont Morgan. but describes him as possessing “more stability than the speculative Yankee.”</p>

                    <p>The International Association of Hotel Keepers, at present holding a conference in Brunswick, have passed a resolution in favor of raising their prices after Jan. 1. According to the statements of speakers at the conference, Continental hotel proprietors have rain staring them in the face if they do not resort to extraordinary measures. Their expenses during the past ten years have risen by leaps and bounds, salaries are higher, they have had to provide elevators, install electric light, modern bath rooms, modern sanitary appliances, steam heating, etc. Taxes are higher, and now come higher prices for butcher’s meat and provisions generally. It is thought that an additional 20 per cent. all round will meet the necessities of the case.</p>

                    <p>(FROM OUR FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT).</p>
                    <p>The Political Situation.</p>
                    <p>London, Dec. 15.</p>
                    <p>Excepting the very improved position of the American market nothing has occurred of importance here this week, the Stock Exchange settlement, which was of a satisfactory but an interesting character, having employed a large part of the time. Apart from the disturbed state of Russia, and the somewhat artificial cloud over our relations with Germany, the political situation is unchanged. As regards the latter differences, the mutual expressions of good-will which begin to be interchanged between the people of both countries, and the categorical assurances of Prince Bulow are tending to dear the air and promote a better understanding.</p>
                    <p>The Money Position.</p>
                    <p>The Bank statement is only worse through the Bank consolidating its own position by-withdrawing money from the market and making its rate effective, which is better for all purposes than raising the rate, as 4% is a healthy figure for both bankers and public.</p>
                    <p>Prosperous Trade.</p>
                    <p>Trade continues to be prosperous in almost all countries of the world, and the amounts being distributed for dividends are very large. We do not, therefore, look for dear money, particularly while the cautious attitude of the investing public continues. The reports from South Africa, showing that the output from the gold-mines will reach this year over £20,000,000, while highly satisfactory, do not seem to have had any appreciable effect upon the shares, some of which are undoubtedly altogether undervalued. The extraordinary prosperity of America and Canada is, however, after all the most important feature.</p>
                    <p>Gilt-edged Stocks.</p>
                    <p>Consols have suffered a slight relapse this week, and leave off at 89 3/16 a fall of 11/16 since our last. Other gilt-edged stocks are fairly steady.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Bonds.</p>
                    <p>A more optimistic report, at the beginning of the week, of the condition of affairs in Russia, sent Russian bonds up 1 1/4 points, but the advance has not been maintained, and the price has gradually declined to 80 3/4. The new Japanese loan is quoted to-night at 5 7/8 prem.</p>
                    <p>Railways.</p>
                    <p>Business in the market for home railways has been quiet, with a dull tone prevailing. The traffic receipts, though not quite so large as those of previous weeks, were, with perhaps one exception, good, and the surprising feature was the large increase in the South Eastern return, despite the Charing Cross disaster. When the holidays are over this market should come in for a larger share of attention. The American market has shown some very large dealings, and the great prosperity of the country gives a firm undertone. There has been much speculation in Union Pacifics, which are now 147 7/8. Various reasons are given for this, but at the time of writing we cannot get at anything authoritative.</p>
                    <p>Egyptians.</p>
                    <p>There is hardly anything to report respecting the Egyptian market; there has been a total absence of business in all classes of shares. National Bank of Egypt have scarcely moved and close. 25 1/4 1/2. Agricultural Banks remain firm at 9 1/8 1/4 and the Preference are a little firmer at 10 1/16—3/16. New Agriculturals are quoted 8 3/4—9. Daira Ordinary have fallen back to 17 1/4, but the Deferred keep steady at 106-110. Daira Sugar are only a very nominal market at 4 1/4. Corporation of Western Egypt advanced at one time to 11/16 premium bid, and close firm either side of this figure. Delta Preference bearer at 11 3/4 and Delta Land at 2 1/8 are unchanged. There is nothing fresh in Egyptian Markets at. 1 5/16 and Salt and Soda at 1 1/16. Union Fonciere have fallen to 11/16 premium, and Abyssinian Banks are lifeless at about 1/8 discount. There has been a farther enquiry for Khedivial Mail Steamship Ordinary and the price has advanced to 1 1/4 buyers with no sellers about. Bank of Roumania have sprung into life again on very steady and good buying, the price advancing from 7 1/2 nominal to 7 7/8 buyers, Egyptian Estates are a little better at 1 9/16. There are rumours of further very favourable deals made by this company. </p>
                    <p>Mining.</p>
                    <p>In the South African mining market Ge-dulds were sold, largely on Wednesday owing to the fact that the assay returns which were expected, had not been published. Yesterday the shares recovered some of the setback of the previous day, and were assisted by the publication of a satisfactory return from the mine. This recovery had a favorable effect on the market in general.</p>
                    <p>The Egyptian mining section has been almost unmentioned since our last. Nile Valleys have been marked 3/32 lower on last Friday’s quotation, but have recovered to 5/8 Urn Rus are 1/16 lower at 9/16 and Egyptian Mines close at 11s.0d. United African Exploration are slightly lower at 1 1/2.</p>
                    <p>The closing prices to-night are as follows : -</p>

                    <head>THE EMANCIPATION OF EGYPT</head>
                    <p>II.</p>
                    <p>Chapter I, Part II. opens with the following fine passage :—</p>
                    <p>“We have thus discussed the events which led up to the British Occupation in 1882. We have dwelt upon the necessities of that occupation, and in so doing justified it as far as it stood in need of justification. The next point which has been dealt with was the British Occupation, and we have thown that it has up till now been highly beneficial to Egypt, in spite of all that has been advanced to the contrary But if we are to secure a basis which will enable us to discuss with profit the political conjunctures of the present and the political possibilities of the future, we must considerably extend our sphere of investigation. The Egyptian question is made up of a tangled web of international factors. Almost every nation in Europe has invested large earnings in Egypt, and consequently almost every nation in Europe has the keenest individual interest in seeing Egypt thrive and prosper.”</p>
                    <p>In several well-written pages the author proceeds to outline Turkish influence in Egypt; from these we quote the following short paragraph : —</p>
                    <p>“ The tide of anti-Turkish prejudice still runs high throughout the West. The generality of Europeans are enable to grasp the wide gulf which severs the Turk as a political being from the Turk as a social being. The few people who have come into actual contact with the Turk in private life and have experienced his unfailing courtesy, his unfailing tact, and have really found that the Turk is the gentleman of the East, have failed to stem to any perceptible extent the stream of popular dislike and suspicion which marks the West as a whole. In Egypt, the Turk remains an exceedingly important social factor. He has a multitude of friends ; it must he admitted a far greater multitude since his fall from power.</p>
                    <p>“It must also never be forgotten that Mohamedan Egypt is bound by puissant religious ties to the Sultan as Khalif, as Defender of the Faithful, and that the Saltan still has (he appointment of the important office of the Grand Cadi. Above all it must be remembered that the Khedive is not only appointed and invested with the dignity of Ruler of Egypt, but that the constitution of that country is practically defined by the Sultan.”</p>
                    <p>We think that, at all events with reference to the past few years, the writer would have been better advised, if he had said “theoretically” instead of "practically,” in the last sentence. Our author goes on to review at considerable length Russian influence in the East, and we shall refer to this later on, in our concluding remarks. To German influence he also devotes several pages, from which we quote a few lines :—</p>
                    <p>“To come, then, to the discussion of Germany as a factor in Egypt’s future. Germany can no longer be treated with the scant consideration of pre Bismarckian days. Her progress has bean rapid, and she figures to day in the forefront of the great Powers. Her commercial activity is universally recognised and generally felt, and her pretensions to become a World Power cannot be denied.”</p>
                    <p>“The direct point upon which German energies are concentrated has long been an open secret. For years they have been endeavouring to Germanise Asia Minor with the same thoroughness with which we have shown France to have formerly Frenchified Egypt.”</p>
                    <p>"There remains, as we have said, the possible opposition of England to Germany’s schemes in Asia Minor, and for this reason Germany may be very glad to retain the means of at least diplomatically tying England’s hand. While England remains in Egypt she can make but a half-hearted protect to Germany making a second Egypt out of Asia Minor, including, perhaps, the Euphrates valley.”</p>
                    <p>“But Germany’s policy is now wavering in the balance. All we know is that she is sensitive of the imperious necessity of finding some field of colonial expansion ; where that field of expansion is to be, we cannot be so sure. The events of the past few months may perhaps be found to have revolutionised the kaleidoscope of Eastern affairs.”</p>
                    <p>Our author evidently thinks that if England would kindly give up Egypt she would acquire some sort of “locuestandi” for interfering with German development in Asia Minor and the Euphrates Valley ; we refrain from commenting on this suggested change of positions just now, but we may say something with reference to it later on.</p>
                    <p>A whole chapter is devoted to France and Italy, which are justly considered considerable factors in the Egyptian question ; and here we find some very interesting remarks, from which we extract a few passages :—</p>
                    <p>‘ Next to Great Britain, France has always been regarded, and very correctly regarded, as being by far the most important factor in the future of Egypt. But the attitude of France, which has been defended and opposed, and criticised from every possible point of view, io books innumerable, in half the languages of Europe, has been almost invariably misconstrued. ’This fact is all the more astonishing when we consider that in the position which France has taken up towards Egyptian affairs she has in nowise deviated from her traditional policy. Among the number of writers on Egypt figure the names of not a few eminent politicians, to whose opinion one naturally listens with defer ential attention ; but when they come to speak of France they are, or have up to the present been, almost without exception completely mistaken.</p>
                    <p>It is happily not our business: to show the fallacy of all those gloomy hot fortunately groundless forebodings; circumstances have</p>
                <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>done so amply enough. England has found herself involved in expense, and with her energies folly taxed, but France, so far from disclosing a hostile policy, has done every thing in her power to free England’s hands.</p>
                    <p>“That France has thoroughly realised the futility of such dreams we cannot for a moment doubt. Few countries have had such magnificent colonial prospects, few so unconcernedly , or perhaps ruthlessly, sacrificed them to home necessities. The life of nations is much like the life of men. If the household is torn within, and threatened without the man cannot venture to embark on fair schemes far from home. Even so it is with France. We need only remember the French dominions in Canada, which were ceded to England, it is true, as the price of a disastrous war, yet when they were still French, not an energetic move was made to save them, not a man was sent to relieve Montcalm, who was vainly struggling against overwhelming odds. France has had its great sailors and its empire-builders, but most have died broken-hearted at the pitiless way in which their life-work has been immolated in the interests at home.</p>
                    <p>The other great imperial possession of France is Algeria, only a few hours’ sail from Toulon, and which despite the vigorous efforts which it cost to conquer, has since proved a valuable asset and a source of military strength, for from Algeria France has been able to call Zouave troops to her aid.”</p>
                    <p>“We might at first not unnaturally be very surprised at finding that while the vast German Empire has great difficulty in maintaining its rule over comparatively small African territories, a small power like Portugal is able to keep its holding in Africa, proportionately a for larger one, with relative peace and security. The Germans find themselves taxed to the utmost in suppressing a temporary revolt such as that of the Herreros, while the Dutch are able to keep a strong hold upon such possessions as Acheen, where her subjects are in a perennial state of insubordination—but Holland has long ceased to be troubled by home difficulties. The act of neutralisation has made her as complete apolitical island as England is a geographical one, her resources may not he very enormous, but they stand at her absolute disposal, she can concentrate all her forces upon her weak point, while Germany cannot afford to ship any large expedition over sea. Germany cannot overwhelm the Herreros by the dispatch of an army of crusing power.”</p>
                    <p>“If Egyptians have seen the light of their hopes in France they have deluded themselves, and to-day that sun has irrevocably set.</p>
                    <p>“Should Egypt become an independent national unity, it will be because such an independence readily combines the interests of all parties concerned. She will never become so by the quixotic but impolitic action of a great power.</p>
                    <p>In the foregoing remarks with reference to France our author shows, as in many parts of this book, an intimate knowledge and a firm grasp of his subject. On the question of Algeria we do not quite agree with him, there is much that might he said, but it is beyond our present purpose to divert the attention of our readers in that direction. He is hardly complimentary in his remarks on German efforts in colonisation in Africa, but much more so to Portugal and Holland ; the latter is said to have long ceased to be troubled by home difficulties. We are still inclined to think that Holland has existed for many years past, with the fear of God and a powerful neighbour, so intensely before its eyes, that it is hardly that haven of rest which our author’s remarks might lead us to believe.</p>
                    <p>When we come to the Italian question, we are said to be treading on tender ground ; whether it is because our author is peculiarly sensitive when he is writing of his own country, or for some other reason which we cannot fathom, we fail to follow him here so easily as in most other parts of the book.</p>
                    <p>There is in Egypt a large and prosperous Italian colony ; we believe it has never been larger or more prosperous than at the present moment The public works carried out in Egypt in recent years, such as the construction of the Assouan Dam and many other undertakings, have given employment to a large number of Italians; Italy has sent us some of our best judges and lawyers, and we have always bean under the impression that Italians have worked even more cordially with the English, than people of most other nationalities. We fail to see how Italians have suffered in any way from England’s intervention in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Our author rightly says that it was the ambition of Italy to annex an exceedingly rich hinterland to their former possessions in Africa. Would it have been possible we ask, for even Italy’s best friends to tell her that she had better not avail herself of the opportunity which offered, for fear of disaster ; we think not, nor do we agree that Italy was employed as a cat’s paw. Still our author argues with a considerable amount of equity and forbearance, as will be shown by the following extracts :</p>
                    <p>“When we come to apeak of the Italian attitude towards the Egyptian question we are treading upon much more tender ground. By way of preface we may say that the position of Italy has during the last few years undergone an almost entire change, and this change has not been brought about without a very considerable amount of ruffled feelings. The change has not been the cause of any diplomatic ruptures, and consequently has come about without the use of anything  but the most polite of phrases. But diplomatists have made it part of their profession  to say the harshest things in the most polite words. The threat of war is gilded into  considering something as an unfriendly act, so that we may well imagine that much bitterness of heart may underlie quite impeccable civility.”</p>
                    <p>“With a view to what we have to say, we must again deny that the part played by</p>
                <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>England can be justly termed Machiavellian Mach has been written against England, who is represented as having lured Italy into African disaster purely in order to farther British interests. This is a very harsh and uncompromising fashion of stating the case. And although it has some element of truth, for nobody will to-day deny that Italy was employed as a cat’s-paw in the solution of the complicated Central Africa problem, nevertheless it cannot be advanced that England in any way outstepped the recognised rales of the political game. If Italy was encouraged in the undertaking of her disastrous African schemes by English politicians, her catastrophe cannot he laid to England's charge. Whatever encouragement Italy received she most very well have been able to estimate at its intrinsic value, and her military political reverses can be visited apon none bat herself.</p>
                    <p>‘The Italians were already in possession of a very important outlet on the Red Sea coast in Eretria, and it was their great ambition to ensure the good fortune of this opening by annexing the exceedingly rich hinterland. This could only be done at the expense of Abyssinia. The Italians required encouragement, and encouragement they very naturally received in abundance from the English, who were above all anxious to with-' draw Abyssinian attention from the Nile. If the Negus was kept on the Red Sea. he would be unable to either succour the Mahdi or forestall the English in occupying the upper barks of the Nile. That England foresaw the Italian defeat is quite untenable, as that defeat did not at all assist the British calculations, although, by treaty, matters were subsequently satisfactorily arranged with the Negus.”</p>
                    <p>“We need nit go into the sore feelings which the Italians undoubtedly do feel to some ex tent with regard to England, whom they consider to have duped them into their Abyssinian calamities, but we would point out that Italy is not likely to take the British side in the case of any anti-British combination.”</p>
                    <p>‘‘The British occupation, at all events, avoid-ed the necessity of bringing the awkward question up again, at all events for the time being. This temporary solution of the difficulty was undoubtedly rendered much more easy, much more satisfactory, by the faultless tact shown by the statesman whom-England appointed to represent her in Egypt. It is difficult to overrate the conduct of such men as Lord Cromer, against whom indeed the most embittered fault-finders of British policy have refrained, as a rule, from uttering a word of disparagement. He has, indeed, won universal esteem for the manner in which he has filled a post fall of thorns and difficulties, withoat once transgressing the limits of the utmost courtesy. He has known how to yield graciously, when he could yield without injuring the interests of his country, and he has known how to exact rigorously, but without giving offence when the British policy compelled him to be exacting. Lord Cromer's tact has served as a model on which numberless other officials have moulded their conduct, and things have therefore on the whole gone very smoothly.’</p>
                    <p>“To-day as we have shown the situation has changed. The over-sensitive apprehensions of almost every European Power with regard to Egypt has cooled down and down, until each of them, we have seen, regards the maintenance of the present condition with complete difference.”</p>
                    <p>“England’s passion for Imperialism has undergone phases, it has at no time suffered eclipse ; all Englishmen when probed to the quick will be found Imperialists at heart; they differ among themselves only on questions of method and degree.”</p>
                    <p>“Even the most unintelligent eye could not fail, upon looking at a map of the Mediterranean, to see the wonderful strategic importance of the Ionian Islands, and above all of Corfu. Lying as they do under the shelter of the Greek coast, but just opposite to the point where the heel of Italy draws closest to Epirus, they effectively command the entrance to the Adriatic. At the present day a Naval Power in possession of them would render useless the whole of the Austro-Hungarian seaboard, by cutting off its one outlet to the Mediterranean.”</p>
                    <p>“We cannot here, nor would it he to the point to give a detailed history of the various occupations of the Ionian Islands, before they were ultimately handed over to the English in 1814 as a reward by Louis XVIII. for valuable services received. Suffice it to say that they were employed with great advantage by Napoleon as a stepping-stone towards Egypt; and, as he hoped, towards India ; and he subsequently hoped to make them exceedingly valuable in his designs on Central Europe. His hopes were blighted at Aboukir Bay, but, although three of the Islands were afterwards captured by the English fleet, Corfu continued to hold out until Napoleon’s abdication.”</p>
                    <p>“We are not yet admitted into all the secrets of the Government, and are unable to tell all the puissant motives which led to Mr. Gladstone’s cession of the islands in 1864. The difficulties of keeping the natives in order were no doubt great but England had patiently overcome them for 50 years, and did not lose patience now. Neither was England compelled to abandon the islands, as is currently said, in order to secure the non-election of the Franco-Russian candidate the Duke of Leuch--tenherg to the Greek throne. The outcry raised against the evacuation was great: it was confidently predicted that England’s Naval preponderance in the Mediterranean was gone for ever, a fear which subsequent years have sufficiently allayed.</p>
                    <p>“In the sequel England has not found her naval superiority in the Mediterranean impaired ; and if in the case of war it should become important to re-occupy Corfu, England would stand as good if not a better chance of securing the islands than would any other Power.</p>
                <cb n="4"/>
                    <p>“All this has gone to show that even in Imperialist policy there are moments when retirement and seeming self-abnegation are not misplaced, and when, though sheer force would very probably have proved successful, yet its employment would not have been adequately rewarded.”</p>
                    <p>"It would he very untrue argument to say that in politics all false positions are pernicious, for it is, on the contrary, generally recognised that - in political life we cannot get on without them. The stiff and starched moralist may perhaps take exception to what he considers a very debasing principle to admit, but we would- once more warn the reader against endeavouring to conduct politics upon the same strict principles which we at all events strive to observe in private life; he will not succeed. In private life we would vigorously uphold the doctrine that false positions are a man’s ruin : he must avoid them with all his power, and if he by inadvertence or misfortune allows himself to be drawn into one, he must escape from it at all hazards and at all sacrifices. In politics, perhaps unhappily, but by their very nature, we are bound to accept false positions. We cannot always attain that excellent and primitive bluntness which having once called a spade a spade closes the subject for ever. We cannot always reconcile the de facto with the de jure and however much the moralist may cry out;we are bound to tolerate situations which in private life would be very rightly called lies, but which in politics, when they take any name at all, are termed compromises.”</p>
                    <p>“We shall then abstain from riding on the high horse, and, as we have already said, we shall make no reproaches. The fact that England  has repeatedly declared her intention of, evacuating Egypt and yet to the present day has failed to fulfil her engagement, we shall certainly not take into consideration from the point of view of abstract morality ; such a discussion, although it affords ample scope for anti-British declamation, and has hitherto famished, and will doubtlessly continue to furnish, gutter scribblers with many a sounding period, does not advance the candid investigator nor the wall-meaning counsellor one jot or one tittle. All we wish at present to discover whether the maintenance of England’s false position in Egypt really pays her. Does she really mean business ?</p>
                    <p>“The advantages which England derives from Egypt are undoubtedly immense. Are they in any way enhanced by England’s semi-occupation of the country ? Would they in any way be impaired by its evacuation ?</p>
                    <p>“To begin with, Egypt no longer lies upon the direct route to India, which now runs through the Suez Canal. Even the most unmitigated Jingo has not yet taken upon himself to propose the seizure of the neutralised Suez Canal. He cannot even with a semblance of plausibility declare that the occupation of Egypt is necessary in order to ensure the free navigation of the Red Sea. He must be fully aware that, whether he has Egypt, or no, the Red Sea will be open to him as long as he maintains the dominant sea power.”</p>
                    <p>In answer to this we think it is only necessary to tay that so long as England holds Egypt, and so long only she can trust the Suez Canal to take care of itself.</p>
                    <p>“The advocate of evacuation can only wonder what are the motives which have so far induced the English to keep so tenacious a hold upon Egypt; there is no European Power desirous or capable of seizing the position if vacated by England.</p>
                    <p>“Why should not Egypt form a type of this latter category ? It is owing to the English tutelage that she has become fit to assume such a position, and will England deny her the capacity to play the part for which she has herself educated her ? Free, but under the eye of England, who encompasses her on every side, Egypt would be as profitable to England, more loyal if loyalty were required, and at any rate out of auy possibility of doing harm.</p>
                    <p>“We have shown, on the contrary;! that the evacuation could not possibly entail any danger, and that Egypt would remain, although independent, within the circle of British power both by sea and land, which fact would be a sufficient guarantee for her future good behaviour.”</p>
                    <p>We regret to say that the opinions expressed in the last three paragraphs do not appear to us to carry any conviction with them.</p>

                    <p>L’IMPORTATION DES CUIRS ET PEAUX EN EGYPTE.</p>
                    <p>L'importation des cuirs et peaux a encore sabi une importante augmentation et est montée de 113.147 livres égyptiennes en 1903 à 133.352 livres égyptiennes on 1904 ; les pays qui ont pris la plus grande part à dette importation sont : Ja France, l’Autriohe-Hongrie, l’Allemagne, l’Angleterre et la Turquie. L’article le plus important de cette branche de oommerce est le ouir à semelles, qui a été im porté de France, d’Italie et aussi, depuis quelques années, en quantités importantes, d’Autriche-Hongrie. Le cuir à semelles italien “Buenos-Ayres” est vendu à Alexandrie de 2 fr. 40 à 3 fr. 35 le kilog. ; le ouir français de 2 fr. 90 à 3 fr. 50.</p>
                    <p>Le cuir à semelles hongrois s’est très bien importé à Alexandrie ; c’est un produit qui est bien travaillé et qui n’est pas aussi chargé d’extraits que le produit italien : son prix est d’environ 3 fr. 50 le kilog. La Hongrie fournit également quelques coupons à 4 fr. et 4 fr. 30 le kilog.</p>
                    <p>Les pays qui participent à la fourniture du cuir pour empeignes sont surtout la France, l’Allemagne, l’Angleterre et l’Italie, ainsi que l’Autriohe-Hongrie et l’Amérique, pour des quantités peu importantes. Le veau ciré est livré presque exclusivement par la France. La clientèle indigène ne demande que des peaux légères pesant de 5 à 10 kilog. par doc* zaine. Le produit français coûte de 9 fr. 50 à 10 fr. 50 le kilog. et est très soigneusement travaillé. Les peaux de chevreaux trouvent on débouché croissant dans le pays, elles soi t importées principalement d’Allemagne et également par des fabriques françaises depuis longtemps introduites sur le marché, leur taille est de 5 à 8 pieds carrés. La demande de veau de couleur est aussi très importants.</p>
                    <p>La produit allemand, contre lequel le fran-çais ne peut que difficilement lutter, est vendu sur le marché dans les tailles de 100 à 120 pieds carrés et au prix de 120 à 150 fr. le pied carré. Le cuir scié, lourd,vient de France, ainsi que d’Angleterre et d Amérique; il ne sert qu’à la fabrication des chaussures ordinaires et coûte de 3 a 4 fr. le kilogramme.</p>
                    <p>Les veaux de couleur portent préjudice à la vente des chevreaux également de couleur ; ces derniers sont importés d'Allemagne, de Franoe et d’Autriohe-Hongrie, eu tailles et forces très différentes, au prix de 40 à 90 fr. la douzaine et ils sont principalement employés pour les chaussures de dames. Les mêmes pays fournissent aussi au prix de 70 à 90 fr. la douzaine le chevreau maroquin, qui trouve son emploi dans la reliure, la carrosserie et l’industrie des meubles. Le veau ohamoisé, de meilleure qualité, est livré en petites quantités par la France au prix de 100 à 130 fr., et par l’Allemagne aux prix de 95 à 125 fr., la douzaine. L’Allemagne et la France livrent aussi des petits lots de chamois au prix de 30 à 45 fr., la douzaine. La vache vernie trouve un débouché assez important dans cette contrée et elle e3t importée spécialement d’Amérique ; cependant, il en vient aussi d’Allemagne et de France; son prix varie entre 22 et 45 fr. la peau ; elle est employée surtout dans la carrosserie.Le veau verni vient en grande partie d’Allemagne ; les prix de et article sont très différents, suivant la taille,et varient entre 60 et 130 fr. la douzaine. Le mouton verni est également importé de France et d’Allemagne, mais en petites quantités ; on l’emploie à la fabrication des chaussures  de dames et des courroie’.</p>

                    <p>NOTES ET CRITIQUES</p>
                    <p>Le Caire, 20 décembre.</p>
                    <p>Les jours d’Europe sont en baisse sensible. A Londres, le Consolidé a perdu hier 5/8 de livre, la National Bank of Egypt 1/4 et l’A-gricole 1/8. A Paris, l’action Crédit Foncier n’a fléchi que d’un franc à 771.</p>
                    <p>La récente élévation du taux d’escompte à Londres est attribuée principalement aux craintes d’exportation d’or, notamment vers l’Amérique du Sud. A Paris et à Berlin on appréhende, d’autre part, le resserrement monétaire qui pourrait être déterminé par les embarras éventuels du Tresor russe.</p>
                    <p>Assurément, les baissiers noircissent à outrance le tableau. Il n’en est pas moins évident que les marchés régulateurs sont mal préparés au grand effort qu’il faudra faire fin décembre. Il faut ajouter que cet effort sera de courte durée, car des disponibilités considérables reviendront au marché aussitôt après.</p>
                    <p>loi, ce matin, le marché des valeurs a été calme sur les Banques. La National et F Agricole se maintiennent à leurs cours d’hier. Le Crédit Foncier clôture en baisse d’un frano à 776.</p>
                    <p>Un bon mouvement, que nous avions prévu d’ailleurs, s’est dessiné sur les Improprement Corporation. On a ouvert à 4 1/8 pour hausser, sur des demandes, à 4 5/16. Les acheteurs sont sérieux et il faut s’attendre à des cours plus élevés.</p>
                    <p>L’aotion Agricoles du Nil a gagné 3 francs à 238 ; la part de fondateur est restée à £ 4.</p>
                    <p>Laotien Jouissance des Eaux du Caire a perdu 2 francs à 246.</p>
                    <p>L’aotion Ciments fléchit à 70 et les dividendes à 20.</p>
                    <p>Dans le groupe des Hôtels, les Baehler ont monté à 3 1/4. Les Nungovich restent à 10 5/8.</p>
                    <p>Parmi les petites valeurs, les Oasis reculent £ 0 15/16 et les Sait and Soda à 19 sh. La Delta Land est à 2 1/16 sans affaires et les Investment Abdy à 1 3/32.</p>
                    <p>Nous avons eu l’occasion de parler oes jours dernieis de la bonne affaire faite par l’Egyptian Land and General Trust (Hooker) en achetant 65 % de la superficie du domaine de Gourbal à Alexandrie. Ce domaine mesure au total 49 feddans, sur lesquels environ 32 reviennent au Trust. Il s’agit d’excellents terrains de construction acquis à des conditions très avantageuses, et il est certain que la Société tirera un gros profit de cette opération. Il en est de même pour le vaste terrain de construction acheté par le Trust dans le quartier de Nasrieh au Caire, près le ministère des finances.</p>
                    <p>On annonce, d’autre part, que le Trust a fait d’heureuses acquisitions de terrains dans le voisinage immédiat de Khartoum, et qu’il est sur le point de terminer deux ou trois autres affaires des plus rémunératrices.</p>
                    <p>L’assemblée générale extraordinaire de la Cassa di Sconto, convoquée pour le 17 courant, n’ayant pas réuni le nombre d’aotions prescrit par les Statuts pour délibérer valablement, a été ajournée à Dimanche prochain 24 décembre, à 10 h. a.m., au siège social à Alexandrie.</p>
                    <p>Un dividende de 5 %, moins l’inoome-tax, sera payé, à partir du 23 déœmbre, à l’Anglo-Egyptian Bank, sur le coupon N° 5 des actions Egyptien Markets.</p>
                    <p>La hausse sur le coton s’accentue en Amé. rique. Le spot a encore gagné 15 points, le Janvier 19 et le Mai 21.</p>
                    <p>Le marché de Liverpool est également en bonne tendanoe.</p>
                    <p>On prévoit généralement des cours plus élevés, notamment s’il est exact que le rapport des Ginners évalue à 8,975,000 le nombre des balles égrenées jusqu’au 15 décembre.</p>
                    <p>loi, le Mars a ouvert ce matin à 16 1/16 pour clôturer à 16 5/32.</p>
                    <p>MM. H. de Vries et Boutigny, agents de change, se chargent de l’exécution de tous ordres de Bourse (valeurs et marchandises) sur les marchés de Londres, Paris, Bruxelles, Anvers, Liverpool et New-York. La Circulaire quotidienne de la maison est envoyée sur demande.</p>

                       <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                       <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                           accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                           they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                           accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                           are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                           things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                           between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                       <cb n="2"/>
                       <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                           January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                           Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                           than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                           the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                           place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                       <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                           sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                           the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>

                       <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                           London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

                       <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                           Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                           also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                           Egypt.</p>
                       <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                           without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                           in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                       <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                           Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                           line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                       <cb n="5"/>
                       <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                           Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                           express from Alexandria.</p>
                       <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                           is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                           responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                           deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                       <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                           fast Mail Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                           Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                           />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                       <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                           attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                           been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                           If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                           at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                           arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                           London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                       <head>SICILY.</head>
                       <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers which
                           leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                           of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                           station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                           occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                           visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                           CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                           Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                           the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                           history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                           413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                           is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                           about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                           delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                           Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                           Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                           Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                           visit.</p>

                       <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                           during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                       <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s
                           steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                           wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                           bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                           [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                       <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                           devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                           portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                           to need comment here.</p>
                       <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                           brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                           City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                           and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                           excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                           fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                           finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                           hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                           Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                           level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                           thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                           takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                       <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                           Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                           possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                           sunset.</p>
                       <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                           and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                           house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                           and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                       <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                           the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                           a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                           breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                       <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                           gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                           constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                           Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                           marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                           filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                       <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                       <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                           Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                           illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                           cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                       <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                           SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                           change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at

                       <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                           delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                           vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                           bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                           approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                           The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                           behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                           the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                           out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                       <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                           lakes.</p>
                       <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                           hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                       <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                           beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                           enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                           and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                           from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                           steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                           of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                           hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                           the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San

                       <p>LOCARNO, may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty

                           excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                           town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, “Entombment,"
                           by Ciseri, and ‘Tho Flight into Egypt,” by Bramantion.</p>

                           Pilatus, Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other
                           excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                           on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
