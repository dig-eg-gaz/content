                        <p>The promise of warmer weather yesterday was not fulfilled, and the day
                            was cold and bleak. The wind dropped to 14 kilom. per hour and the sea
                            became smoother. The morning opens cloudy with prospects of more rain.
                            The barometer is rising, and there are indications that the weather will
                            improve as the day advances.</p>

                    <head>THE FRENCH AND MOROCCO.</head>
                    <p>The publication of the French Yellow Book on Morocco on the same day as the 
                        utterance of the speech of the German Imperial Chancellor to protest against 
                        the charges against Germany of aggression and hostility has led to some 
                        comparisons in the home Press. Just when we were asking ourselves how far 
                        suspicion of German policy ought to melt like snow before the genial sunbeams 
                        of German official assurances, sudden ly a yard measure is thrust into our 
                        hands, whore with some very useful measurements can bo taken. Briefly, it 
                        comes to this, that, a year and a half ago, Prince Bulow made certain state 
                        ments in the Reichstag, the value of which has since been tested by 
                        experience. The result of that test forms, as the “Times” put it on Friday 
                        last, “the best possible comment upon the pacific protestations in which 
                        Prince Billow indulged once again, yesterday, in regard to this country.” 
                        The official documents now show that as far back as 1901 the Maghzen was 
                        trying to enlist European support against France while subjecting her to 
                        constant friction and annoyance on her Algerian frontier. As the result of 
                        c ommunications between M. Delcasse and the German Ambassador in Paris, 
                        the latter admit tad very fully the right of France to a “special position” 
                        in Morocco. That right was subsequently fortified by the Sultan’s request 
                        for French military assistance to crash the Pretender, with which request 
                        France refused to comply, thereby proving her determination to refrain from 
                        anything in the nature of a military adventure in Morocco. Such was the 
                        situation when the crucial fact of the Anglo-French Agreement made its 
                        appearance in the spring of last year.</p>
                    <p>It is with the Anglo-French Agreement that the comparison which Friday’s 
                        London papers invite begins. The German justification for action which has 
                        caused the downfall of M. Delcass6, and has seriously menaced the peace of 
                        Earope, consists in the allegation that the French Minister withheld from 
                        Germany all knowledge of the contents of the Agreement, with intent to flout 
                        and to “isolate” Germany. What are the facts ? In March, last year, M. 
                        Delcasse, in reply to enquiries, fully explained to Prince Radolin the
                        position of France in regard to Morocco. Thereupon the Ambassador thanked 
                        him cordially for an explanation which (as he has since admitted) had not 
                        been vouchsafed to any other Power except Russia. Soon after Prince Bulow 
                        publicly stated in the Reichstag that Germany had no reason to dread any 
                        infringement of her mercantile interests in Morocco. A few weeks later, when 
                        the Agreement had been signed, the French Ambassador gave farther assurances
                        at Berlin, whioh assurances the Chancellor accepted in the Reichstag in terms 
                        which were cordially received, all the world over, as a frank recognition of 
                        the true character of the Anglo-French Agreement. Later on, when the 
                        franco-Spanish Agreement was officially communicated to the Powers, with 
                        farther assurances of commercial freedom for all in Morocco, the German official
                        reply affirmed that Germany’s interests in that oonntry were purely of the
                        economic sort. That, however, was last autumn. The winter brought a decisive 
                        change in the state of international affairs ; the result of the Russo-Japanese 
                        war was no longer in doubt; the military power of the ally of France had 
                        collapsed ; the battle of Mukden had swept all the chessmen off the board, 
                        and a new game was to begin. Germany then announced that “the Imperial 
                        Government totally ignored the Agreements that had been concluded as regards 
                        Morocco” on the ground that Germany had been systematically excluded. Then 
                        came the Imperial visit to Tangier and the series of diplomatic menaces to 
                        France which are revealed in their entirety in the Yellow book. It was in 
                        Jane that things reached their most critical stage, when Prince Bulow actually 
                        talked about the danger of lingering on a road which “bordered a precipice and 
                        even an abyss.” Upon such language, and the diplomacy which accompanied it, 
                        comment is superfluous. France, however, kept her head in spite of all 
                        provocation, and perce was preserved. We are now within a few weeks of the 
                        Conference which is the outcome of the German procedure, and, in view of 
                        that coming event, the publication of the fall history of its antecedents 
                        is very timely.</p>

                       <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                       <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                           accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                           they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                           accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                           are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                           things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                           between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                       <cb n="2"/>
                       <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                           January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                           Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                           than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                           the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                           place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                       <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                           sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                           the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>

                       <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                           Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                           also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                           Egypt.</p>
                       <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                           without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                           in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                       <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                           Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                           line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                       <cb n="5"/>
                       <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                           Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                           express from Alexandria.</p>
                       <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                           is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                           responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                           deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                       <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                           fast Mail Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                           Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                           />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                       <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                           attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                           been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                           If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                           at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                           arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                           London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                           of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                           station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                           occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                           visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                           CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                           Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                           the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                           history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                           413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                           is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                           about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                           delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                           Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                           Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                           Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                           visit.</p>

                       <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                           during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                       <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s
                           steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                           wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                           bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                           [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                       <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                           devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                           portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                           to need comment here.</p>
                       <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                           brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                           City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                           and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                           excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                           fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                           finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                           hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                           Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                           level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                           thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                           takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                       <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                           Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                           possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                           sunset.</p>
                       <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                           and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                           house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                           and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                       <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                           the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                           a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                           breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                       <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                           gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                           constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                           Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                           marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                           filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                       <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                       <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                           Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                           illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                           cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                       <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                           SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                           change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at
                           Salsomaggiore.</p>

                       <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                           delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                           vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                           bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                           approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                           The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                           behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                           the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                           out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                       <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                           lakes.</p>
                       <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                           hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                       <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                           beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                           enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                           and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                           from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                           steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                           of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                           excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                           town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, “Entombment,"
                           by Ciseri, and ‘Tho Flight into Egypt,” by Bramantion.</p>

                           on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
