                    <head>THE SOAP TRUST.</head>
                    <p>Though the English people have hardly as yet awakened to the fact, there have
                        been of late many attempts to carry out the methods of the American Trust in
                        England.. We are in danger, but we hope, says the “Globe,” that the shock
                        which the latest attempt has given to the nation may suffice to put us
                        permanent­ly on our guard. The Soap Trust is a peculiarly serious example of
                        that remorseless avarice which seems to dominate what Trust magnates are
                        pleased to call their souls, because its operations will chiefly affect the
                        poorest and the most defenceless. It is the little struggling washerwoman
                        who now just makes both ends meet who will be crushed when the Trust has
                        cleared all rivals from its path, and begins to recoup itself for the
                        expenses and anxiety of the campaign. Fortunately, the people who control
                        the “ combine ’’ have alreadyshown so clearly what the public has to ex­pect
                        at their hands if <hi rend="italic">they are</hi> successful, that we may
                        fairly hope the monster will be strangled at birth. To begin operations by
                        selling fifteen ounces for the pound was a tactical error of the most
                        glaring kind, and we believe the public will not soon, or readily, forget it
                        It appears as if this Trust is ac­tuated by just the same motives as those
                        of its American compeers, and is ready to adopt the same methods. If it is
                        allowed to come to maturity prices may be raised, dealers ruined, employes
                        dismissed, and an almost irresistible tyranny established. The remedy,
                        however, is simple. Let no one buy the soap of any firm which has entered
                        the “combine.” There are plenty of soaps sold by the free firms every bit as
                        good anything which the Trust can produce, and the grocer, if he has any
                        regard to his own interests, will be very glad to tell a customer wh<hi
                            rend="underline">ic</hi>h soaps they are.</p>

                    <head>THE CONQUEST OF THE AIR</head>
                    <p>An epoch in the history of aerial navigation was reached on Tuesday week,
                        when M. Santos Dumont won the prise offered by M. Ernest Archdoacon at
                        Bagatelle; the conditions of the prise were that a flying-machine,
                        constructed on the “heavier than air” principle should cover a distance of
                        25 metres. In order to comply with these conditions, the intrepid aeronaut
                        had constructed a machine of an entirely novel character. The latest thing
                        in aeroplanes is described as running so bicycle wheels, weighing some six
                        hundred pounds, and having three large wings ; in this machine M Santos
                        Dumont rose so a height of about nine feet from the ground, and traversed a
                        distance of some eighty yards, finally coming gradually down, until the
                        wheels again touched . earth. A point to be noticed in connection with the
                        experiment is the fact that the “Bird of Prey,” for so the new aeroplane is
                        called, did not start from a height and, as it were, drop into the sir, but
                        running for a considerable distance on the ground until sufficient motive
                        power had been created, it then, with the assistance of its powerful rudder,
                        rose from the earth by its own unaided efforts. But, of course, the really
                        remarkable part of the experiment lies in the fact that at last a machine
                        heavier <hi rend="underline">the</hi>n the air, constructed more or less
                        entirely of metal, and having no gas-inflated envelopes or parachute
                        arrangements to support it, has suc­ceeded in doing what no other aeroplane
                        has done before. Without entirely agreeing with M. Santos Dumont’s remark
                        that in the course of ten years flying machines will be as common as motor
                        cars now are, we admit that it is not possible to foretell the developments
                        which may be at hand, now that one of the most im­portant points in aerial
                        navigation appears to have been solved successfully.</p>

                        <p>rather amusing was the judgment of the Cairo Mixed Court of Misdemeanours
                            in acquitting Mme Marietta Lisella, a shopkeeper who was accused of
                            selling drink in her shop. The verdict reflects somewhat on the police
                            intelligence. The Tribunal ruled that the space allowed by the contents
                            of the shop was insufficient for a table at which drinks could be served
                            to customers ; that there was a conflict in the evidence given by the
                            police and the other witnesses as to the appearance of the room ; that
                            it was unlikely that Mme Lisella would go to such expense and risk as
                            the alleged alterations implied, and that the presence of cobwebs and
                            dust was against such an allegation.</p>

                        Alexandria with the Naval Brigade after the bombardment in 1882, and going
                        for a ride on horseback he wandered outside the British lines and lost his
                        way. He fell in with a party of Arabs, who took him to an outpost of the
                        enemy. Here he was dragged from his hohorsee and taken before Arabi Pasha,
                        one of his captors remarking on the way, “I think you bang,” which was
                        afterwards explained to have been meant as a joke, but it seemed no joke to
                        the young middy. Arabi received Do Chair very civilly, and gave him some
                        dinner, but told him he must go to Cairo as a prisoner. He was allowed to
                        tele­graph to his parents, assuring them that he was alive. He afterwards
                        escaped, and rejoined the British forces. He was selected by Sir Garnet

                    <p>"THE VICTIM OF POLICY.”</p>
                    <p>Commenting on Yacoub Pasha Artin’s retirement from the post of
                        Under-Secretary of State for Education, "Al Watan” writes : — The Pasha, it
                        will be remembered, only acccept the post of Under-Secretary at the argent
                        instance of the British occupants—a fact which rendered his advancement
                        probable and did not lead ns to expect his eventual resignation. Of course,
                        there are many who maintain that Artin Pasha hardly merits oar praise on the
                        ground of his entire adhesion to the British policy—whioh at times was
                        fatally inspired— and on the ground of his failure to extend public
                        instruction. But the facts, in our opinion, prove that Yacoub Pasha, was not
                        a mere passive instrument and was not prepared to sacrifice his independence
                        for nothing. That is why his departure amazes us, who long counted
                        confidently on his promotion. He is the victim of polioy—whioh proved
                        relentless. On that account he merits sympathy and justice. The fact that he
                        was refused pro­motion on the ground of his being an Armenian Christian is
                        to be set against the authorities as a grave error of policy.</p>

                        enough for the present to draw the attention of the occupants of Egypt to
                        the fact that Egyptians and all British Liberals would feel offended by such
                        an appointment, which is most unwise. If, however, they persist in the

                        the London loaders, Gainsborough’s famous paint­ing, “The Duchess of

                    <p>INSTALLATION OF HUGE COALING PLANT.</p>
                    <p>No time is being lost by the Sudan Depart­ment of Public Works in taking
                        advantage of the possibilities for trade lately opened up at Port Sudan. The
                        Department have recently arranged for the installation of a large coal
                        handling plant at the harbour of Port Sudan, and the contract for the work
                        has, daring the past few days, been awarded to the Cleveland Bridge and
                        Engineering Co., of Darlington. The installation will consist of four
                        transporters each electrically controlled, and each capable of dealing with
                        150 tone of coal. At the rear of the transporters will be established a
                        large covered-in storage shed, which will run parallel to the quay, and have
                        a length of over 1,000 feet, and a gantry with travelling crane, of a length
                        of 360 feet.</p>
                    <p>In addition, the Cleveland Bridge Company are new engaged upon a large
                        rolling-lift bridge required at Port Sudan in connection with an extension
                        of the Berber-Port Sudan Railway system. This bridge, which will rank as the
                        second largest rolling-lift bridge ever constructed, will have a span of 164
                        feet io length. Thirteen hundred tons of steel work will be required, and
                        the whole of this, along with the necessary plant, will be shipped to the
                        site before the close of the present year.</p>
                    <p>The erection of the rolling-lift bridge and of the coal-handling plant at
                        Port Sudan will be under the personal supervision of Mr. G C. Imbault, of

                    <p>This year, as in former years, the Govern­ment has decided to allow those who
                        are desir­ous of so doing, and who undertake to submit to the prescribed
                        conditions, to accompany the Mahmal caravan.</p>

                        The journey will be accomplished by the shortest possible and least

                        and prestige. The cost of the expedition will bn lessoned by joining the
                        caravan, as pilgrims will profit by the advantageous arrangements which the

                    <p>Before Mr. Justice Jelf, in the High Court, last week, the Securities
                        Conversion Association sought to recover from the Anglo Egyptian Syndicate,
                        Limited, upwards of £l,000, which defendants were said to have agreed to pay
                        to or on behalf of the plaintiffs. Defendants, denied liability as to a
                        portion of the amount claimed.</p>
                    <p>It appeared from the opening statement of <hi rend="bold">Mr.
                        </hi>Lushington, for plaintiffs, that his clients in 1904 Bought to buy some
                        land in Egypt on which to grow cotton, and employed Sir Douglas Fox’s
                        engineering <hi rend="bold">firm </hi>to report upon it. The purchase was
                        not completed, and defendants bought the report, paying to the firm of Sir
                        Douglas Fox £145 13s 6d, and, afterwards, to the plaintiffs £100 on account
                        of the balance due. No farther sum being paid, plaintiffs applied for
                        judgment under Order XIV. The Mister gave them judg­ment for £100, leaving
                        the question whether defendants were obliged to pay the balance to be tried.
                        He submitted that defendants were liable, under the agreement, for the
                        amount of the obligation plaintiffs were under to Sir Douglas Fox as soon as
                        they issued the report for prospectus purposes, which had undoubtedly been
                        done.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Moreton Smith, for defendants, argued that the amount was not payable
                        until the purchase of the property was completed. In any case, the claim was
                        premature, as under the agreement between the defendants and <hi rend="bold"
                            >Sir </hi>Douglas Fox’s firm the sum in dispute had not yet become
                        payable.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Justice Jelf held that the amount in dispute was not due when the action
                        was began, and he therefore entered judgment for defendants.</p>
                    <p>Plaintiffs received costs up to the time of the entering of judgement for
                        £100; other costs were awarded to defendant. </p>

                            safe in including the whole company in our commendation, the more so as
                            the piece is not unlike Mr. Saymoar Hicks’ other productions, and it
                            might easily be made to appear as rubbishy as "the catch of the Season.”
                            The way any and all the songs and dances are thrown into the bag, and
                            shaken up together, is quite wonderful. It reminds one of a school boy’s
                            experiment in chemistry. A piece so loosely strung together needs
                            clever­ness if it is to go well, and gives the more credit to a company
                            which makes as great a success as it did last night.</p>

                        <head>"THE EXILE OF OTHON.”</head>
                        <p>A political play is ever dear to the Hellenic heart, particularly when
                            the subject has any­thing to do with the Mother Land. This was so last
                            night, when a fall house of Greek play­goers occupied the Zizinia
                            Theatre. The play is to them, no less than to outsiders, one of intense
                            historical interest, for Othon, whose exile was last night so ably
                            portrayed by the Dimitrakoponlou Company, was the first King of Hellenic
                            Independence. Thus there was no small amount of enthusiasm, long-pent up
                            by some unavoidable delay, when the curtain rose on the scene in the
                            Palace at Athens, the climax being reached when Queen Amalia, who was
                            admirably impersonated by Mme El Theodorou, entered. Act I. depicts the
                            over­tures of, Haridimos Ipolochagos Sinomotis (M. B Makris) towards
                            Ioanna Rodogali (Anthi Makri) to fie out the secret of the Palace. She,
                            however, remains true to her Queen. No less stirring is the scene, in
                            the next act, when the King, (Mr. Petros Leon), who was also the the
                            object of ovation on the part of the audience, requests his Ministers to
                            apprehend the leaders of the revolution. They had fled, however, was the
                            excuse ; the number of the'revolutionary leaders tallied with that of
                            the Ministers, and the King, grasping the true meaning of the excuse,
                            bows royally to the inevitable. Mme Theodorou acts the part of the
                            indignant Queen to perfection. A draught of Grecian comedy was enjoyed
                            when next the curtain rose, and revealed an empty street in Athens at
                            night. The symptoms of revolution are most realistically indicated by
                            the discharge of the good old rusty type of guns and pistols, and the
                            entry of a typical band of komitajis in fustanelle, who, led by Kapitan
                            Kyriakos, (Mr. S. Pantapoulos), had descended from Marathon to find
                            Athens asleep. The volley rouses Kyr Dimitris, (Mr. Kandiliotis), who,
                            opening the shatter, imitates the good example of the bandits, by
                            eventually discharging a blank cartridge—eventually, we say, because the
                            tufeki would not go off. Kyra Dimitriani (Mme A. Pantopoulou) was true
                            to life, and mirth provoking, with her <hi rend="italic">pioseine
                            ?</hi>(who is it ?) The final scene on board, when the King and Queen
                            take leave of the faithful few, is teaching. Mr. Petros Leon, as King
                            Othon, delivered a farewell address which was full of pathos.</p>
                        <p>The costumes and staging were excellent: white fustanelle, and the
                            picturesque fez and short coats the men blending very artistically with
                            the blue dress and red plush caps and jackets of the Court ladies.</p>

                    <head>THE LEVANT AND GERMANY.</head>
                    <p>There is a very remarkable passage in Prince Hohenlohe’s Memoirs, which is
                        of special inte­rest to the Levant. It is dated "Mount Carmel, January
                        16,1819,” and anticipates in a remark­able way modern German policy in the
                        Near East, setting up the following theses :— "The influence of Germany in
                        the Bast is calculated (1) to give Germany more power in every way ; (2) to
                        promote German trade and eventually colonization. In order to establish this
                        influence the religious element of the Catholic clergy ought to be employed.
                        More attention ought to be devoted to this subjeot.” With a vision prophetic
                        of Lord Beaconsfield’s policy, Prince Hohenlohe, in the course of a long
                        memorandum, advocates the ultimate acquisition by Germany, if only she were
                        "united, strong, and well-armed,” of islands in the Levant, and especially
                        of Cyprus. In the event of a partition of Turkey "Germany could fish out
                        (sic) Cyprus and more in the general distribution. If by the pacific method
                        of a treaty with the Turkish Government, or if, in a cataclysm of the
                        Eastern question, we could get Cyprus and Rhodes, or something else, we
                        should be acquiring a capital refuge for thous­ands of proletarians; we
                        should obtain harbours and a mercantile marine, a navy and sailors. Nor must
                        Syria and Asia Minor be left out of account, and we must do our best to
                        check the Russians and the English in these regions, to which end it is
                        above all necessary not to send any Protestant Bishops and missionaries
                        thither, but to create for ourselves a base by means of the Catholic world
                        of the Bast German Consulates occupied by able men are one of the most
                        important concerns of the Ministry. But bad Consuls are worse than none. A
                        Consul in the East ought to be a Catholic, he ought to know Oriental
                        languages, to be skilful and experienced in matters of business, and the
                        Consul-General ought to be in every regard a good diplomatist Till mow
                        (1849) what has been known of Austria in the Bast is not much good ; of
                        Prussia all that is known is that she supports the Protestant Bishop and
                        promotes the conversion of the Jews in Jerusalem; of 'Germany* nothing at
                        all is known. It is one of the most depressing sensations to travel as a
                        German in the Bast I lament more than ever the wretched way in which the
                        period immediately succeeding the revolution was let slip without our having
                        ‘ taken any effective and thorough measures--a time when every single
                        Government was still in a powerless condition. But what is the good of
                        lamentations 1 Let us etill try to make the best of it.”</p>

                        active, ,but highly nervous, with constant severe fluctuations. Friday and
                        Saturday were weak, under pressure to sell, and prices fell rapidly about 25
                        points. The whole of this decline was more than recovered by noon yesterday,
                        but to-day’s closing prices are 10 1/2 @ 13 1/2 points below those of last
                        'Thursday. The principal causes of such a state of affairs are, of course,
                        the highly speculative condition into which the markets have been brought by
                        the extremely un favorable weather of the last few weeks throughout almost
                        the entire cotton belt, the lateness of the crop, and the abandonment of the
                        big estimate; of yield. This evening we are awaiting the Ginners’ report
                        made up to the 18th instant, but we do not think too much importance will be
                        attachd to it. A greater danger still exists in the shape of a killing
                        frost, which, should it really occur, even within the next 3 weeks, might
                        prove disastrous. The latest values are delivery :— october 5.94 |d

                            counter-proposals, promising to instruct the delegates to modify their

                        <head>German Opinion</head>
                        <p>A writer in the "Pall Mall Gazette” remarks :—</p>
                        <p>The most prominent characteristic about German professional opinion on
                            this absorbing topic is the identity of the ideas prevailing— all the
                            risks thoroughly understood, but the stupendous results of success
                            warranting almost any conceivable risk to attain it. Let me say that the
                            reliance of Germans for the consum­mation of this their greatest
                            military ambition is based on their capacity to overtake ns in pace of
                            shipbuilding ; upon the growing ten­dency towards economy over naval
                            expenditure in Great Britain ; and to the chances of the casualty list
                            tending still further to diminish their inferiority and the British
                            margin of superiority.</p>
                        <p>With regard to speed in construction, the Ministry were either deplorably
                            misinformed or deliberately mis-stated the fact when telling the country
                            recently that even if we started building later than Germany we could
                            easily make up for it by our superior building speed. Lieutenant
                            Bellairs promptly nailed this Radi­cal inexactitude to the counter, and
                            as a matter of fact, Germany, in building her last four battleships,
                            averaged three years and two weeks, while we averaged three years and
                            eight months over the Albion, Montagu, Domi­nion, and New Zealand.</p>
                        <p>I can say with knowledge that no event in Great Britain was hailed with
                            such acclamation by German Anglophobes as the advent to power of the
                            band of gullible fanatics under Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman who, reckless
                            or ignorant that the Teuton navy is rapidly approaching our own in point
                            of available force, permit themselves to base their policy on
                            demonstrable innaccuracies. And meantime the eager German, joyous at the
                            chance afforded him, proffers a soporific in the shape of aspirations
                            for good­will while doubly and trebly increasing the volume of work in
                            his dockyards and the scale and power of his projected armaments.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, on what a precarious basis our actual superiority exists even in
                            time of pro­found peace, when our squadrons have not to face the risks
                            of war, is brought before our eyes by the striking series of mishaps
                            which have recently befallen British sea power. No loss than four of our
                            most powerful battleships, and one of our best armoured cruisers
                            practically disappeared at one and the same time from the effective
                            strength of the Navy, and had war broken out would have been lost to our
                            defensive strength. Two, if not three, of these are still <hi
                                rend="italic">hors de combat,</hi> while the splen­did Montagu is
                            scrap Iron on the rooks of Lundy. The Duncan, during the salvage
                            operations, injured her hall, and had to go into dockyard bands. Two
                            even more powerful ships of the King Edward class—the Hindustan ' and
                            the Dominion—are at present useless, and the Cape of Good Hope, armoured
                            cruiser, has had to undergo repairs through striking a reef during the
                            last mapoeuvres. At the pre­sent moment another damaged ’ warship is on
                            her way home disabled, while it is notorious in naval circles that a
                            number of ships in the Mediterranean are below the level of war
                            efficiency through the denial of necessary repairs by the reckless
                            economy of a Radical Administration . These facts are being kept dark,
                            but it is important that their significance should not be
                            misunderstood.</p>
                        <p>In time of war such casualties as these would be liable to a considerable
                            augmenta­tion by hostile devices. But when we realise that from 1900 to
                            1907 England will only have laid down nineteen new battleships to the
                            sixteen of Germany, it will be seen that our margin of strength over
                            Germany, as repre­sented by the newest and most powerful ships, is thus
                            becoming perilously attenuated and approaching a point when the Germans
                            might fairly count on the fortunes of war or the chapter of accidents to
                            turn the scale in their favour.</p>
                        <p>Do the people of this country sufficiently realise that the German navy
                            is already most formidable, out of all proportion to the pro­tective
                            requirements of its commerce ; that it is daily becoming stronger, and
                            that if the present programme is adhered to, in eight years' time, or
                            even less, it will have a fighting force in the North Sea and Channel
                            certainly equal, if not superior, to any Fleet which, con­sistent with
                            other pressing naval requirements in other parts of the world, we could
                            possibly bring against it? When that moment arrives, as German
                            strategists will be the first to own, we shall never he allowed time to
                            regain our lost superiority without fighting for it. So much for naval
                            programmes.</p>
                        <p>As for the dogmatic optimism of Mr. Balfour and Mr. Arnold-Forster with
                            regard to the possibility of invasion, I should like them to have heard,
                            as I have, what pome of the greatest German military and naval experts
                            have had to say on the subject. It is enough that every one of these
                            students of modern war ranges himself on the side of the views expressed
                            by Nelson, Collingwood, Napoleon, and Wellington, and not on the side of
                            those recently enunciated by the political and financial stra­tegists of
                            the House of Commons.</p>
                        <p>Said one eminent German soldier, "It is all very well for you to talk of
                            your fleet. But are you absolutely certain that under all possible
                            circumstances and under all conceivable condi­tions your fleet will be
                            at the right spot at the critical moment ?” Are we absolutely
                            certain?</p>
                        <p>| If anybody thinks so, let him consider the fact that in the days of
                            Britain’s roost decisive naval superiority over France 15,000 Frenchmen
                            arrived in Bantry Bay on board a large sailing fleet direct from Brest
                            without any opposition from the large British fleet then cruising off
                            Brest, and without even being seen</p>
                        <p>by it. Can we say that history will never repeat itself at a time when we
                            are allowing the naval power of Germany, with her eyes fixed
                            remorselessly upon our shores, to over­haul ns hand over hand ; and when
                            we re­member the extended interests which call for the protection of our
                            fleet ?</p>
                        <p>Let me conclude with the observation of a German staff friend, a
                            distinguished Prussian soldier, yet with whom Mr. Haldane, a Radical
                            lawyer, will doubtless disagree, for he too be­lieves in the
                            practicability of landing on our shores.</p>
                        <p>“Yon suggest the sinking of our transports,” he observed. "We need hardly
                            contemplate even that, I think. Yon are a humane people, and not
                            cannibals. If we were attacked by a superior British force we should
                            hoist the white flag. Yon would then take a section of the expeditionary
                            corps prisoners and assume their keep, or save yourselves this burden by
                            releasing them. At any rate, even if yon succeeded in catching ns all we
                            should not feel the loss of 50,000 or even 100,000 out of 6,000,000.”
                            The Germans, he maintained, were quite ready to accept the possibility
                            of an expeditionary force being oat off from its base. But if our fleet
                            cannot prevent their landing they oared nothing for what it did
                            afterwards.</p>
                        <p>Landing, he observed, would be hazardous only if Great Britain were a
                            savage country, but, as it was, the troops, once landed, would find
                            numerous sources of supply, not to men­tion plenty of guns and
                            ammunition in our arsenals, and as numbers of horses could be
                            oommandeered, the lightest equipment would suffice to enable them to
                            make an immediate rush for London. Every detail of the country is
                            accurately known, and it would astound most Englishmen, and doubtless
                            Mr. Hal­dane, to hear a German officer refer to farmers and prominent
                            inhabitants of little country villages in England as the owners of so
                            many horses and carts or motor-cars. In fact a German invading force
                            would find itself as much at home in our winding lanes as on the
                            straight chausees of Ger­many.</p>
                        <p>As for the opposition they might expect, the German argument is that,
                            magnificent as our regiments become when fall of five and six year men,
                            the few there are are generally abroad. At home our regular battalions
                            are for the-most part little better than cadet corps, while our Militia
                            and Volunteers are too little trained to be worth considering.</p>
                        <p>Scoff as they may, or continue as selfabsorbed as they like, it is as
                            certain as that the night follows the day that, unless the British
                            people awake betimes to the fact that they are sorely approaching a
                            tremendous ordeal, and that, as their fathers were, and every Empire
                            before them, they in their torn are going to be called upon to prove
                            themselves worthy to retain their wide inheritance by steadfast
                            resolution and the capacity for self-sacrifice they will add one more
                            example to the mournful pages of history of those who have been weighed
                            in the balance and found wanting.</p>
