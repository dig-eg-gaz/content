                    <head> GERMANY AND ENGLAND. </head>
                    <p> An English resident in Germany contributes the following to the “Pall Mall
                        Gazette”:- </p>
                    <p> The eyes of all German Imperialists are fixed with a peculiar intensity of
                        interest upon Great Britain just now. Needless to say, the apparently set
                        purpose of this country to diminish its defensive and offensive land and the
                        power is accepted—with hardly concealed satisfaction— as a further
                        indication of that decline in national vigour which German political
                        students have for some time included in their calculations for the
                        future.</p>
                    <p> I cannot better suggest the picture which we present to this penetrating
                        people at the moment than by quoting the recent observation of a German
                        friend —a man whose word are sometimes echoed in this country—during some
                        references to the future influence of arbitration and the limitation of
                        armaments, in whose interest certain weak-kneed Britons have been acclaiming
                        the retrenchment policy of the present Government.</p>
                    <p> "England most please herself, although we cannot view without some
                        apprehension a growing weakness which, with the certainty of a natural law,
                        most ultimately produce displacement of power and consequently international
                        disturbance. You have your Navy? Certainly; but see, my friend, in precisely
                        the same way does a not possess its shell, but if the kernel of the nut is
                        withered and shrunken, the resisting power of the unsupported shell is very
                        materially reduced. So with a nation. Nothing seems clearer to a close
                        student of your race than that your Navy is covering a withering and
                        shrinking virility and vigour both of body and mind. And I ask you to
                        consider of the result if two nuts—one whose kernel is sound,the other
                        decayed—are crushed together in the strong grip of war. </p>
                    <p> “As for us, your leagues of peace and international arbitrations are as the
                        crackling of thorns beneath a pot. They can never abolish war, for in the
                        society of nattions interests are so interwoven that the arbitrator States
                        can never be impartial. Therefore, we Germans hold with your Lord Bacon,
                        that wars are "the highest trials of right" National existence is dependent
                        on power, and Bismarck spoke for Germany to all time when he said. The only
                        healthy basis for a great State is national selfishness, and not romantic
                        idealism. Not by speeches and resolutions of majorities are great questions
                        decided, but by blood and iron." So Germany, my friend, is determined to
                        rely for her greatness or, blool and iron, and noton beautiful sentiments
                        and foreign investments. The shell of the German nut shall be strong and
                        hard, but behind that the sound kernel of a resolute and vigorous race." </p>
                    <p> Again, another very pregnant remark was made to me by a German merchant
                        prince who has identified himself very closely with the Colonial movement. </p>
                    <p> “Do not you Englishmen,” he said, ‘“ever stop to consider what egotists you
                        are when you talk about leagues for the preservation of international peace,
                        now that you have got all the territory you can possibly want? But you must
                        be very simple egotists as well if you believe that such beautiful
                        sentiments will cause Germany to rest satisfied with the fact that, while
                        England has practically all the colonies in the world, Germany has none" </p>
                    <p> We shall better appreciate the significance of such utterances if we realise
                        that the foundation of Germany's political belief is that "Macht geht vor
                        Recht”-’ Might is Safer than Right " and so long as one powerful nation in
                        the community of nations and rises to this faith it would be the height of
                        folly for any other race or people to omit it from their defensive
                        calculations. </p>
                    <p> Moreover, such a creed has too much historical foundation for us to ignore
                        it. As another German, with the characteristic scholarship of his race, put
                        it to me: “Neither right nor chance, not the instinct and the will of
                        expansion, supported by might, have created British </p>
                    <p> tions. By tbhe right of the stronger, only, England herself has become
                        possessed of her enormous Empire. By the right of the stronger the
                        Hohenzollerns, a poor Swabian family who came to the wilds of Prussia with a
                        handful of retainers a few centuries ago have created modern Germany. To
                        might all States owe the title of their possessions, and by might only can
                        their possessions be retained." </p>
                    <p> And here, touching the question of the maintenance of armaments, let me
                        mention an argument which I have heard in the months of responsible Germans
                        of high standing among their fellows, for it is an argument which ruthlessly
                        exposes the ostrich-like fallacy of estimating national economic progress
                        without any comparative reference to that of commercial competitors and
                        possible foes. Now Germans, when dealing with the question of armaments, are
                        fond of quoting Bismarck's dictum to the effect that “it is true that great
                        armies are a great burden ; but by our armsments we are able to conduct a
                        kind of warfare with the other nations, in which we give blanks with our
                        money-bags” On this text they argue that as their wealth increases they are
                        enabled to employ a portion of it in the increase of armaments to very great
                        advantage, not only in national protection, but in wearing down the
                        resources of their competitors. The game of empire, they very justly argue,
                        is a costly one; it is like bidding at an auction, and the richest win?.
                        “Either,” say they, "by the continuance of expenditure on armaments, we
                        compel our rivals to pursue the same course or to retire from the contest."
                        That Great Britain is beginning to flinch from the burden of the contest,
                        and not that she is in any degree inspired by a genuine humanitarianism at
                        the present moment—that, in fact, she is, in a comparative sense, on the
                        down grade both economically and physically—is the firm conviction of every
                        keenly interested Teuton. </p>
                    <p> Speaking as one who is familiar with the economic conditions of both
                        countries equally well, I am not inclined to contest the validity of their
                        argument. If these relative conditions continue as they exist at the present
                        moment, it is a moral certainty that in process of time Germany, who was
                        never cursed by an evil genuine in the shape of a Teuton Cobden, must become
                        top dog. For in Great Britain, as a result of Mr. Cobden’s brilliant ideas,
                        Free Trade has depopulated the country districts, mined our agriculture, and
                        driven 10,000,000 British workers, with several millions of our national
                        capital, out of Great Britain into Protectionist countries. </p>
                    <p> Through “the blessing of Free Trade” our industries have become partly
                        stationary, partly retrogressive, partly decadent;and our population, whicb
                        in the days of our prosperity used to increase faster than that of any other
                        country, is gradually becoming stationary, whilst that of Germany, in spite
                        of her inferior industrial resources, in spite of conscription, is rapidly
                        growing under the “blighting influence of Protection." For "the supply of
                        men is determined by the demand for men.” And thus, while Great Britain,
                        with a world wide Empire to supply with men and women, can only add every
                        year 400,000 to her population, mostly paupers and unemployed, Germany adds
                        some thing like a million prosperous workers to hers. While the general
                        prosperity of the German race, under Protection, is stimulating national
                        self-confidence, vigour, and push, our once manly British race, babbling of
                        Free Trade hibboleths, is degenerating into a puny, sickly, ill-nonrished,
                        sterile, incapable. and unhappy alum proletarist.</p>
                    <p> Bringing, therefore, his penetrating intellect to bear upon this picture of
                        comparative national evolution, the German has deduced therefrom a
                        conclusion, scientifically irrefutable, that in these rival conditions lies
                        the most desirable solution of his greatest problem. For he argues thus: “As
                        soon as the moral and material decay at present visible in the British race
                        enables us to wrest from it the command of the sea, we shall have no
                        difficulty in creating the Great Germany we require." And as showing the;
                        deep saturation of these ideas there are not wanting sage and thinking
                        Germans who go so far in their speculation as to say: - </p>
                    <p> “Under Germany, the British Colonies, and even Great Britain herself, with
                        her matchless resources, properly developed, could in a few years be made
                        marvellously prosperous by a sensible administration, the enforcement of
                        discipline on the German model, by the development of her natural resources,
                        and, above all, by the protection of her industries. A German administration
                        of Great Britain would care nothing for the cheap applause of the
                        electorate, but would adopt a policy which, however unpopular at first,
                        would give to the workers solid advantages instead of imaginary and
                        superficial ones.” </p>
                    <p> The record of undoubted facts is quite sufficient to show the course of
                        policy with regard to this country upon which Germany his entered, and no
                        professions or manifestations of sympathy and regard on the part of Germany
                        or ourselves can alter or explain away these facts. Germany is not only
                        preparing with feverish haste for a naval struggle with Great Britain, but
                        meantime is endeavouring to weaken this country by fostering ill feeling
                        between ourselves and others, and by undermining our economic strength. </p>
                    <p> The tension, therefore, between the two nations is bound to increase to the
                        breaking, point unless Germany shows by deeds, not words that she means to
                        steer her political ship in another direction. At present she dominates the
                        Continent, but if her frontiers become farther extended, her military,
                        naval, and industrial power might become irresistible. </p>
                    <p> Let me quote my first friend once more. “I am unable,” he observed, somewhat
                        pungently, to understand British ill-will towards Germany. You deliberately
                        choose physical and economic decadence in the interests of Free Trade and
                        German commerce, and you complain if we increase more greatly in wealth and
                        power than you do. It would be just as logical, my friend, to quarrel with
                        the operation of a British ship.</p>

                    <p> DUKE OF CUMBERLAND'S POSITION. </p>
                    <p> Berlin, September 26. </p>
                    <p> The Diet of Brunswick has passed a resolution inviting the Duke of
                        Cumberland to sink his claim to the kingdom of Hanover and assume the
                        rulership of the Duchy. [Reuter.]</p>
                    <p> The Duke of Cumberland is the son of the second Duke,who was King George V.
                        of Hanover, fourth brother of the Duke of Kent, the father of the late Queen
                        Victoria. He is married to a sister of Queen Alexandra.</p>
                    <p> The last Duke of Brunswick was Wilhelm I., born April 25, 1806, the second
                        son of Duke Friedrich Wilhelm and of Princess Marie of Baden; he ascended
                        the throne April 25, 1831, and died October 18, 1884.</p>
                    <p> The heir to Brunswick is the Duke of Cumberland, excluded owing to the
                        refusal to give up the claim to the throne of Hanover.</p>
                    <p> The ducal house of Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel, extinct on the death of Wilhelm
                        I, was long one of the most ancient and illustrious of the Germanic
                        Confederation. Its ancestor, Henry the Lion, possessed, in the twelfth
                        century, the united duchies of Bavaria and Saxony, with other territories in
                        the North of Germany; but having refused to aid the Emperor Friedrich
                        Barbarossa in his wars with the Pope, he was, by a decree of the Diet,
                        deprived of the whole of his territories with the sole exception of his
                        allodial domains, the principalities of Brunswick and Luneburg. These
                        possessions were, on the death of Ernest the Confessor, divided between the
                        two sons of the latter, who became the founders of the lines of Brunswick
                        Luneburg, Elder Line, and Brunswick Luneburg, Younger Line,the former of
                        which was represented in the ducal house of Brunswick, while the latter is
                        merged in the royal family of Great Britain.</p>
                    <p> The Brunswick regency law of February 16, 1879, enacts that in case the
                        legitimate heir to the Brunswick throne be absent or prevented from assuming
                        the government, the Council of Regency, consisting of the Ministers of State
                        and the Presidents of the Landtag and of the Supreme Court, should carry out
                        the government, while the German Emperor should assume command of the
                        military forces in the Duchy. If the rightful heir, after the space of a
                        year, is unable to claim the throne, the Brunswick Landtag shall elect a
                        regent from the non reigning members of German reigning families.</p>
                    <p> The Duke and Duchess of Cumberland left Copenhagen suddenly last week for
                        Gmunden. Their departure is generally believed to be in connection with the
                        Brunswick succession.</p>
                    <p> The Duke is said to be in the mood for compromise, but will only decide his
                        attitude after a conference with his son.</p>

                    <head> “AL LEWA” AND THE SYRIANS. KAMEL'S VITUPERATIONS </head>
                    <p> A very instructive example of the fanatical hatred of the organ of Mustapha
                        Pasha Kamel to all Christians is seen in the “Al Lewa’s" vituperation of the
                        Syrians in consequence of the recent mutiny at Port Said. It was a very bad
                        political stroke on the part of the Pasha's brother, who is the editor in
                        the absence of the former, to manifest, so openly and at each a moment, that
                        dislike of the so-called Nationalist Egyptian Press is not confined to the
                        English and Europeans gone- rally, but equally embraces every race who does
                        not profess the Creed of Islam. It is of course obvious that it is
                        fanaticism which is at the bottom of the whole agitation, but this fact is
                        carefully veiled by Mustapha Pasha Kamel, whose purpose it is to cloke the
                        objects of the agitation by directing his attacks solely against the British
                        Occupation. But the fact should never be lost sight of that the crusade is
                        really directed against all Christians, just as was the former nationalist
                        outburst Lord Milner in "England in Egypt” notes the fact </p>
                    <p> “As a matter of fact, the Arabist movement passed with frightful rapidity
                        from a protest against the abuse of European influece to an attack upon that
                        influence in every form; and it was passing at the moment when it was
                        arrested into an attack not only open everything European, but upon
                        everything Christian. The ever smouldering hatred of Moslem for Copt had
                        been stirred into flame, and in another month the half-million and upwards
                        of native Christians of Egypt, including many of its richest and most
                        intelligent inhabitants, would have gone the way of their hated rivals, the
                        Syrians, and have swelled the list of the proscribed.”</p>
                    <p> The fanaticism of the Nationalists is as comprehensive in its all-embracing
                        character at the present moment as it was in the days of Arabic Pasha. But
                        it was a fatal "faux pas” on the part of "Al Lewa” to make this fact patent
                        to all the world just at the present moment, for it has given all the
                        Syrians and Copts of Egypt an insight into the realities of the present
                        agitation, which would not: have been brought home to them by the most
                        virulent Anglophobe speeches of Mustapha Pasha Kamel. The mattar has been
                        taken up by the vernacular Press and the Coptic daily papers. "Al Watan,”
                        remarks: </p>
                    <p> "We have certainly never seen calumnies so vile, insults so shameful,
                        denoting the extremity of baseness, and the total lack of education, as
                        those which the journal "Al Lewa" has drivelled out a propos of the Assyr
                        incident in accusing the Syrian soldiers of coward ice and low birth. This
                        paper apparently thought that the soldiers who mutinied were Christians, and
                        its shameless fanaticism found therein another occasion to indulge in
                        tirades. If, however, it bad the least good sense or the intelligence, it
                        would have known for all that, that the Syrian soldiers are the real prop of
                        Turkey, and that Syria is the pearl of the Ottoman possessions. It might
                        also have known that it is the Syrians whom it impudently qualifies as of
                        base origin who really have all the power in Turkey, and that it is the
                        politics of these same Syrians which it glorifies with such enthusiasm ; if
                        it were not wholly blinded by its fanaticism it might have known that
                        neither the Sultan nor his Government have yet written the name Syrian
                        without its infallible corollary : honour. And is not the insult of this
                        vile sheet a railing against humanity and opprobrium against itself. And
                        this insult is directed against no other than a country which has already
                        sacrificed 300,000 of its children in the service of Turkey; and it is
                        against all these brave men who are cut down in the Yemen, after nameless
                        struggles and the most terrible sufferings, that the organ of the gutter
                        press has just cast it hideous affront ! We know of nothing more craven,
                        more vile, or ignoble than the shameful soul which drivels execration and
                        ignominy. </p>
                    <p> A Moslem Ulema of Al Azhar University writes to ’Al-Ahram" a long article in
                        which he quotes several ayets of the Koran and some Hadiths of the Prophet
                        to show that Syria, which has been maligned by "Al-Lewa” in the course of
                        its comments on the Assyr mutiny, is the most sacred country in the world.
                        The following is one of the prophet's Hadiths mentioned in the article: </p>
                    <p> “The good being divided into ten tenths, Syria holds nine tenths of it,
                        while all the other countries hold only one tenth ; and the evil being nine
                        tenths, only one tenth of it exists in Syria while eight tenths are spread
                        throughout the other countries ; if the inhabitants of Syria become corrupt
                        there will be no good in ye.” </p>
                    <p> The writer concludes as follows : "I have only written this article to show
                        the people the results of the publications of "Al-Lewa” in the service of
                        Moslems and Islam, and how it mistreats the faith and its principles in
                        writing according to its own ends. "Al-Lewa" separates the Mohamedans from
                        each other, and calls upon them to despise one another while we are in full
                        need of winning the sympathy of all the other nations. </p>

                    <p> BRUTAL MURDER OF A GIRL. </p>
                    <p> Yesterday another of the many tragedies of Alexandria, that have been
                        revealed from the miry waters of the Mahmoudieh Canal, was disoovered. A
                        strange looking canvas sack was seen in the canal near Ramleh and some
                        fellaheen, whose curiosity was aroused, fished it out of the water. They
                        found it very heavy and when they had succeeded in getting it ashore, they
                        were horrified at finding that it contained the mangled remnants of a young
                        woman. She was a young native woman, eighteen years of age, and evidently
                        was of an extremely pre- possessing type of Egyptian beauty. When they had
                        emptied the sack of its contents, they found that the neck had been almost
                        severed by a terrific gash, while the abdomen was covered with gaping
                        wounds, in fact everything tended to show that they had discovered the
                        victim of a most determined and cold-blooded murder. One of the men ran for
                        a policeman, and the body was taken to the Government hospital, where a
                        post-mortem examination was held yesterday afternoon. It was found that the
                        young woman had been about to become a mother, and it is concluded that it
                        is "crime passionnel.” No traces of the murderer have as yet been discovered
                        and there are no clues on the girl’s clothing or body which can in any way
                        be of assistance in disclosing her identity. </p>

                    <p> The second report of the Wellcome Research Laboratories, Gordon Memorial
                        College, Khartoum, describes an interesting discovery of a noval use for
                        asbestos. On opening an ancient grave at Naga in the Egyptian Sudan, the
                        bones of a human being were found, at a depth of 4ft., surrounded with a
                        feather-like substance, which proved to be asbestos. </p>
                    <p> The indications go to prove that this skeleton is more than 1,500 years old,
                        since the brickwork of the grave appears to have come from some building
                        belonging to the town of Naga, which was still flourishing between 300 a.d.
                        and 400 a.d. Whether the burial occurred during the Christian period, or
                        during the Muslim period subsequent to 1500 a.d., the discoverers are unable

                        sympathy will be felt for her husband and family in their bereavement. Mrs.
                        Alderson was a devoted wife and mother and had borne with exemplary patience
                        and resignation the burthen of a terrible malady for some years past. We beg
                        to tender our sincere sympathies to the widower and family. </p>

                    <p> POSTAL ADMINISTRATION. </p>
                    <p> To the Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette.” Sir,—Your correspondent who writes
                        under the above heading has exposed a legitimate ground of complaint —a
                        complaint be it observed which touches Europeans and natives alike who have
                        business and other connections with the United Kingdom.</p>
                    <p> When last year that redoubtable champion of postal reform, Mr. Henniker
                        Heaton, induced the British and Egyptian Governments to lower the letter
                        postage rate it is hard to conceive that he was cognizant of the inequality
                        which such a boon was about to inaugurate, viz : that whilst the charge for
                        letters from the United Kingdom to Egypt was henceforth to be reduced by one
                        penny half penny the half ounce, that for letters from Egypt to the United
                        Kingdom was to be reduced by one penny farthing only.</p>
                    <p> I should like to know why there should be a discrimination against this
                        country of 20% ? It would also be interesting to discover whether this 20 %
                        is retained by the Egyptian Treasury or in what proportion it is shared by
                        other countries which have, by arrangement with Egypt, adopted the reduced
                        rate. </p>
                    <p> As postal officials, like those of other Egyptian administrations, are
                        prohibited, on pain of dismissal, from writing to the Press, and we are not
                        likely to get any enlightenment from that quarter it would, therefore, be a
                        good thing and possibly lead to the removal of such injustice if the Hon.
                        Member for Canterbury could be persuaded to ask from his place in the
                        British House of Commons for this much desired piece of information.—I am,

                    <p> THE SALT MONOPOLY.</p>
                    <p> To the Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette.’ Sir,—I noticed in yesterday’s issue
                        of the "Egyptian Gazette" a letter from a Cairo correspondent complaining of
                        the quality of the salt sold in this country. Your correspondent is probably
                        unaware that, not only in both Alexandria and Cairo, but in all the chief
                        towns and villages of Egypt, the Egyptian Markets Limited have undertaken
                        the sale of the salt of the Port Said Silt Association Limited, which
                        supplies common and ground salt and also table salt from England. As a a
                        sample of the excellence of this salt I herewith submit to your notice the
                        text of the analytical report made at the chemical laboratory of the
                        Norwegian Government at Bergen of the Port Said salt and the Trapani
                        (common) salt:-</p>
                    <p> Port Said Salt. Taipani Salt Sodium chloride (pure sail) 97.40% 86.10%
                        Magnesium chloride 0 16 1.46 Calcium sulphate 0.83 0.57 Natrium sulphate
                        0.02 1.49 Impurities and insoluble matter 0.04 0.24 Humidity 0.90 9.95 99.35
                        99.81 N.B. When the sum of these figures does not reach the 100 % it is due
                        to unavoidable errors in the analyses.</p>
                    <p> “ A mere glance at these figures shows at " once the great difference in the
                        real values “ of these two samples of salt. This difference " is specially
                        marked in the respective proportions “ of humidity and pure salt. " The Port
                        Said Salt has a low humidity " which renders it low to handle and a low "
                        content of magnesium chloride which “ would always tend to keep it
                        comparatively “ dry. The Salt is very strong, the " content of pure salt
                        being very high " (another sample of salt which I am now " examining
                        contains only 88 % pure salt). " The best butter salt can only hold up to "
                        99:50% pure salt. ”</p>

                    <p> THE GREAT PYRAMID.</p>
                    <p> TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE." Sir—When the Great Pyramid is made
                        accessible to visitors, as it soon must be, by eleotric lighting, handrails,
                        &amp;c, it only remains for the Department of Antiquities to cleanse the
                        surfaces of the masonry in the passages, blackened by so many hundred years
                        of smoky encrustations. This can easily be effected by the invention known
                        as the "steambrush," need to freshen the aspect of London buildings. It is
                        merely a nuzzle held in the hand, connected by a flexible tube with a small
                        boiler generating steam at a moderate pressure, and directed on the wall
                        from a ladder or scaffold. The jet, without injuring the stone in the
                        slightest degree, would very quickly restore its colours to those of the
                        original granites and limestones. Yours etc. Cairo, September 27. A.T.F.</p>
                    <p> OFFICIALS AND CIVILIANS.</p>
                    <p> To the Editor or the “Egyptian Gazette." Sir,—I absolutely protest most
                        strongly against the insinuations of your Cairo correspondent who calls
                        himself "Another resident of over 20 years' standing" and his endeavour to
                        throw dirt on the commercial community.</p>
                    <p> His attempt to cast blame on an honourable and well behaved lot of citizens
                        is, it appears, on a par with the want of tact and courtesy with which be
                        has lately been accused in your columns.</p>
                    <p> I know, and am in possession of documentary proof, that some people here
                        endeavour to make it appear a disgrace and belittling to wear or have worn
                        the King’s uniform, but although knowing this I did not imagine that they
                        would attack the whole commercial community in the way he has done-in the
                        hope of covering their own sins.—Faithfuly Yours. P. Plunkett.</p>

                    <p> "Inhabitant” writes from Cairo :—A popular musical programme attracted a
                        large number of people to the the Esbekieh Gardens on Tuesday evening last,
                        when the band of the 1st Battalion Lancashire Fusiliers performed. The works
                        performed included Elgar’s Salut D'Amour, and "Die Zigeuherin” from the
                        Bohemian Girl. One of the most appreciated items consisted of selections
                        from Boito’s Mefistofele, and the Belle of New York was also greatly
                        appreciated. A large number warmly applauded the descriptive fantasia “March
                        Across the Desert,"and the humorous piece "a Darktown Donkey Race” fairly
                        enraptured them. It will be seen that it was one of the beat arranged
                        programmes we have had in the Esbekieh Gardens for some time, as the chief
                        aim of it was to please everybody. In conclusion I should like to say a few
                        words about this band which I have had the pleasure of hearing on many
                        occasions.</p>
                    <p> On making careful enquiry I have found out that this band has always been
                        kept up the high standard of efficiency. In 1895 it took first first at a
                        contest held by the Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland. Since then they have
                        bad the honour of playing on many notable occasions. Daring the visit of the
                        Emperor of Germany to Gibraltar this band was specially complimented by his
                        Majesty, and as I understand that this battalion is shortly to leave this
                        station In write this letter in appreciation of the splendid programmes
                        provided by their band during their short stay in Cairo.</p>

                    <head> EGYPT 100 YEARS AGO. </head>
                    <p> From the "Times" of Friday. September 13, 1806:— The following is the
                        language in which this braggart (General Regnier), whose presumption has met
                        with so severe a rebuke from General Stuart on the plains of Malda, has
                        dared to speak of that glorious band of Britons which achieved the conquest
                        of Egypt. In speaking of the action which took place on on the 13th of
                        March, five days after the British Army landed in Egypt, he says— "The
                        French Army consisted only of 8,830 infantry, 520 cavalry, and 31 pieces of
                        cannon; while the English had 16,000 infantry, 2,000 marines from the fleet,
                        200 cavalry, and 10 pieces of cannon. And yet, notwithstanding this immense
                        superiority of number, the English did not dare to begin the attack." His
                        account of the battle of the 13th of March, which decided the fate of Egypt,
                        is equally candid and correct.—He concludes his account of the campaign in
                        the following words: —"The expedition of the English has succeeded, but they
                        have gathered only the laurels of success; for never did they ensure victory
                        by their military movements, their courage, or their enterprize. Their timid
                        march, not withstanding their enormous superiority, perfectly points out
                        what would have-been their fate, if the Chief of the French Army (Menou) had
                        been worthy of his troops." </p>

       <p>     Insurgents were assembled at Halepa in
            expectation that Prince George would embark
            there They broke through the cordon of the

            were wounded on both sides. The British

             <p>   The Condition of tho Indian Ryots. </p><p>
                
                We cannot agree with Professor Beesley
                that the alleged impoverishment of India is a
                question which could be adequately investigated 
                by a Royal Commission, unless their
                deliberations were preceded by years of patient
                historical research. But, if only because of
                the nefarious uses to which popular ignorance
                is turned by fanatical or unscrupulous agitators. 
                We hold that the question deserves far
                more careful study than has yet been bestowed
                upon it. The results of each study, we are
                convinced, would show conclusively that
                British rule, far from having led to the impoverishment 
                of India, has arrested or largely
                reduced every one of the evils which were still
                draining her wealth even a hundred years ago.
                For it has given India what India never knew
                before—safety against the incursions of predatory 
                hordes from Central Asia, freedom from
                internal strife and turmoil, upright Judges,
                and an upright Administration, and, as a con-
                sequence of all this, security for life and
                property for every caste and race and creed,
                such as can nowhere be traced in the records
                of her chequered history before we gave peace
                to her countless millions. ("Times.")</p><p>

                It is the duty of the executive government
                to see that every section enjoys the liberty and
                protection to which all subjects of the British
                Crown are entitled. Hindus must not be
                allowed to provoke Mahomedans either by
                insult or threats of violence; most be given
                no excuse for taking the law into their own
                bands. The criminal procedure cede is not
                silent on the subject of seditious writing in the
                Press or seditious speeches on the platform;
                and its provisions must be enforced. What,
                perhaps, is most important of ail, people in
                England must understand that imputations
                made against the authorities in India, by a
                little group of retired Anglo Indian officials
                who have come home with grievances of their
                own to ventilate, carry with them their own
                refutation. Quite enough harm has been done
                already by letting it be supposed in India that
                those gentlemen ware educating the public at
                home to believe in the honesty and loyalty cf
                the National Congress. ("Standard.”)</p><p>

                The autumn session has killed the usual
                autumn campaign. Liberal statesmen are busied
                with fruitful administrative work, and ex
                Ministers have apparently nothing better to
                do than to quarrel over Mr. Balfour’s past and
                to clamour for the MacDonnell letters. Oar
                mood is singularly friendly, and while Mr.
                Wyndham makes graceful speeches holding up
                Mr. Gladstone as an example to youth, the
                rest of us are looking forward with a kindly
                welcome to Mr. Chamberlain's reappearance

                In order to live and die unmarried in the
                present day a nobleman must possess at once
                a heart of adamant and a sublime contempt for
                pounds, shillings, and pence. In his youth he
                must withstand all the sirens of the music
                hall and the Gaiely stage. If he escapes them
                in safety, it is only to encounter in his
                more mature years the wily assiduity of the
                professional dealers, who move insidiously in
                polite society, and catch their prey unawares at
                the dinner table, in the drawing-room, at

                We can only be grateful to the Secretary
                of State for War for pointing out that the
                apprehensions cf nervous people regarding the
                concentration of German troops in South Africa
                are baseless, for it is to be hoped that the
                utterance of this respected and reasonable
                man will make a deeper impression on those
                nervous minds than the most explicit declaration
                of the German Press. If we have hitherto
                refrained from setting forth very good reasons
                which would dispel the anxiety felt by Englishmen 
                of an excessively distrustful disposition, it
                is because we did not think that they affected
                any but the very narrowest and unimportant

                The fact of Sir P. Lugard's resignation must
                inevitably direct attention to the various suggestions

                forward with a view to securing greater continuity, 
                and, therefore, greater efficiency in the
                administration of our tropical possessions.
                Attention is being directed to the importance
                of securing ‘continuity’ not merely in our Colonial 
                policy as a whole, but in meeting the needs
                of individual Crown Colonies and Protectorates,
                which in their physical conditions and existing
                institutions demand infinite flexibility and diversity

                Russia.</p><p>
                Yesterday we were told that skeins of wild
                geese were winging their way southwards,
                from which it is surmised that the long Arctic
                winter has set in early. This morning we have
                rumours of a mysterious passage through
                Berlin and across Germany of a Royal train
                filled with Russian Grand Dukes and their
                families, which if true suggests that their
                autocratic northern homes are no longer habitable. 
                Whether it be true or not, the chaos
                in Russia seems to get more hopeless day by
                day. There is a letter in the papers today
                signed by Mr. David L Alexander, Mr Glands
                G Montefiore, and Mr. Leopold da Rothschild,
                as representatives of the Jewish Board of
                Deputies, and the Anglo Jewish Board of
                Deputies, and the Anglo Jewish Association,
                drawing attention to a telegram which has
                just been received from Russia, to the effect
                that during the recent pogrom in Siedlce more
                than two hundred persons were arrested
                haphazard and are being brought before a court
                martial, on which are sitting as judges the
                very same officers who took an active part in
                the terrible events which recently occurred in
                that Polish town. The letter appeals earnestly
                that the voice of the country may be
                raised to prevent the threatened further
                slaughter of Jews in the Russian provinces.

                <p>     (From our Financial Correspondent ) </p><p>
                    London, September 21.</p><p>
                        The Money Market.</p><p>
                The Bank of England is read, in a stronger
                position than it was last week, for although
                the reserve has fallen very slightly, it is
                higher than at this time last year, and the
                larger portion of the Autumn demand has
                been satisfied. It is thought probable that
                the gold coming forward from the various
                gold-fields, amounting to four millions per
                month, will supply most of the farther requirements, 
                with some help from the Bank
                of France. The bold and novel step taken
                by the old lady of Threadneedle Street of
                raising the price of gold bars to 78e./ld.
                (well above the outside market, 77s /11 1/2 d.)
                will have the effect of diverting the demand
                from her, and it is much more sensible than
                increasing the Bank rate, which unnecessarily
                disturbs other markets. Altogether, a cheerful
                view is taken of the money prospects. The
                discount he uses are allowing 3% for call
                money, and 3 1/4 for "notice” money, and are
                charging 3 3/4 to 4% for short paper, and
                4 1/4% for three months' bills.</p><p>
                
                Silver.</p><p>
                Silver has sagged a little during the week,
                but it is again firmer, with quotations same
                as last week, 31 9/16 spot and 31 7/8 two months
                forward.</p><p>
                
                The Stock Markets.</p><p>
                In our last article we expressed the hope
                that the increased Bank rate would be effective
                in improving the monetary outlook, and thus
                affording to the stock markets the support they
                so much need. Unfortunately the past week
                has been even more hopeless, so far as investment 
                business is concerned, than for some time
                past. Further large withdrawals of gold from
                the Bank for America, Constantinople, and
                Egypt have kept the better-class stocks in a
                nervous state, and it is feared that another
                increase in the Bank rate will be necessary
                before a normal state of affairs ran be realised.
                A very disturbing feature also has been the
                rise in the Berlin Bank rate to 5%, which had
                an immediately depressing effect upon the
                gilt-edged and home railway markets.
                In consequence of these adverse influences,
                the amount of business transacted on the
                Stock Exchange has been extremely slight, and
                prices all round show substantial declines.
                Yesterday and to-day being Jewish holidays,
                the House has had a deserted appearance, and
                the tone of markets is quiet in the extreme.</p><p>
                
                Consols.</p><p>
                The gilt-edged market commenced with a
                show of firmness, but the further heavy drains
                on the Bank, and the increase in the rate of
                the Bank at Berlin proved too much for its

                Foreign Bonds.</p><p>
                A satisfactory feature of the foreign market
                at the beginning of the week was the strength
                of Russians, the Fours at one time improving
                to 72 1/2. Subsequently they were influenced by
                the depression in other sections, and relapsed,
                but they firmed up again yesterday, and close
                steady tonight at 72, the script of the new
                loan at 11 discount Japanese are fractionally
                weaker.</p><p>
                
                Home Rails.</p><p>
                This section has had seveveral causes for
                depression—though doubtless some dealers will
                say that home rails can usually, in these days,
                succeed in being miserable without cause. First
                of all, dear money was a bear influence, then
                there was a strike in one of the departments of
                the Midland railway, and to complete the tale
                of misfortunes came the terrible disaster on the
                Great Northern line at Grantham. The result
                has been a week of idleness, with lower quotations 
                in nearly all the shares. On the announcement 
                of the Scotch Express smash York Deferred 
                dropped 2 points, dosing 1 1/2 down on
                the day. In several other cases losses of a full
                point were marked.</p><p>
                
                Americans.</p><p>
                The tone of American railway shares has
                been uncertain, and in the main quotations are
                below last Friday's levels. Readings are the
                only point that have shown any buoyancy,
                there being about 4 7/8 higher at 78 7/8. Baltimore
                and Ohio have gained 3 1/4 at 129, and Unions
                have lost 1/2 at 194 3/4 on our last.</p><p>
                
                The market opened with a better tendency
                to day, Southern Pacifics being a good feature
                with a rise cf nearly three dollars. These leave
                off to-night at 97 7/8.</p><p>
                
                Egyptians.</p><p>
                There is hardly any business doing in the
                Egyptian section, and as the markets in Egypt
                are closed until Monday there is not likely to
                be much revival until next week. National
                Banks are better at 26 13/16, but Agricultural
                Banks are unchanged at 9 13/16. The Debentures
                of the latter are 96 3/4 3 1/4 Corporation of Western
                Egypt have been in request, and are strong
                buyers at 3/8 premium. Daira close about the same
                at 16 7/8, and the Deferred at 100. Daira Sugar
                are unchanged at 2 5/8, Delta Land and Investment, 
                after being 3 5/15, close better again at
                3 1/2, but Delta Preference Bearer are unmentioned, 
                being nominally 11 1/4 3/4, while the
                Deferred are supposed to be 10-13. Egyptian
                Estates close 1 7/8, and Egyptian Markets 1 1/4.
                Salt and Soda have been offered at 1 1/8 without 
                response. Khedivial Mail Ordinary have
                changed hands as high as 36s. 3d. Abyssinian
                Banks are quoted 1 1/4 3/4 discount, and Union
                Fonciere are unchanged at 5 3/4 6. Land Bank
                of Egypt are a fraction harder at 9 middle, and
                Bank of Roumania remain unchanged at 10 1/4.</p><p>

                The uncertainty regarding the prospects of
                money continue to restrict business in the
                South African market, while during the past
                two days the absence of the Jewish members
                has caused the Kaffir section to be particularly
                helpless.</p><p>
                Rhodesians, after being very dull, closed
                rather firmer yesterday, Tanganyikas gaining
                1/16 at 6 7/16. They are now 6 5/8, a rise of 1/8 to-day.

                American Futures -The market this week
                has been fairly active, and prices have experienced 
                constant fluctuations. On Tuesday
                there was an advance of 10 points, but it has
                not been maintained,and today’s closing values
                are practically unchanged from those of last
                Thursday. The general sentiment remains
                bearish, although lets pronouned than of late.
                The accounts of the crop are generally considered 
                favorable, the movement remains smaller 
                than last year owing to the crop being
                about a couple of weeks late, and larger
                receipts are predicted shortly. There is at
                the moment very little speculative interest

                Yesterday the wind was light from the
                N.N.E., and some of the prettiest sailing was
                witnessed that has ever been seen at the
                Yacht Club. The start of the second class was
                particularly so, as the four boats leaving at
                3.45 all got under way with their spinnakers
                set. Owing to the proximity of the boats or
                Class I. finishing as Class II were completing
                the first round a great many fools occurred
                and a great many decisions rested with the
                officer of the day and the sailing committee.
                Some of these have not yet been completed
                but this will not effect the Coot winning the
                monthly prize in Class I. and the Iskindiriyah
                winning Chitty Bey's cup in Class II, against
                which boats no fouls are claimed.</p><p>
                
                Owing to an error the Isis II. was started at
                her wrong time and her finishing time not
                taken.</p>
