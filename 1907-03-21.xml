                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the
                        world. Also the tower or palace, the scene of "Othello'' and of Ford's
                        "Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus in the winter months is
                        delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                        <p>Spring begins to-day, and the conditions are as springlike as one could
                            wish for. The weather is delightfully bright and cool, a light northerly
                            breeze blowing. The past winter at Alexandria has been a dry one
                            compared with 1908, the total rainfall for the season amounting to 7.02
                            inches, 89 against 11.22 inches in the previous season. </p>

                    <head>THE "EGYPTIAN STANDARD."</head>
                    <p>We were recently compelled to express our opinions re the accusations made by
                        "Al Lowa" and its European editions with some vigour, We were not surprised
                        when a few days later a notice large type appropriately labelled
                        "Falsehood," and appearing in the "Egyptian Standard," accused the "Egyptian
                        Gazette" of wilful misstatements, and declared that Mustaplia Pasha's organs
                        had merely reproduced a communication from the Omdeh of Warrak and had in no
                        way accused M. Grandmoulin of wilful murder. Sunday's "Egyptian Standard"
                        contains an article from Mustapha Pasha Kamel, who asseverates that he and
                        his journals have never made any such statement and challenges the Press--or
                        rather that section of the Press which has refused to accept the "ipse
                        dixit" of our new prophet as being final in all matters to prove its
                        assertion. We are ready, nay more, we are delighted, to take up the gauntlet
                        which the Pasha has thrown down. In the "Egyptian Standard" of March 12 an
                        article, entitled "A Victim of Pigeon Shooting," was published by our
                        contemporary. It contained the account of the accident as given by the Omdeh
                        of Warrak and concluded with the remark that the French Consulate must make
                        a thorough | and impartial enquiry "so that people may understand that
                        Egyptians cannot be hunted as I game with impunity." On the following day an
                        article appeared on the third page of the "Egyptian Standard." It contained
                        no mention of the Omdeh of Warrak. After remarking that the affair had cause
                        a painful sensation the writer of this article remarked that "we" looked at
                        the whole incident from an "impartial point of view," but that the fact was
                        that M. Grandmoulin had shot a child either voluntarily or involuntarily.
                        After this excursion into the realms of the obvious and certain "remarks
                        anent the question of trespass, the article closes with two questions, which
                        we I give as they appear in our lurid contemporary "We wish......to ask the
                        following pertinent questions."</p>
                    <p>"1) What right had M Grandmoulin to shoot on land not his property?</p>
                    <p>"2) How is it possible that M. Grandmoulin still keeps his Government employ
                        accused and guilty as he is of assassination?"</p>
                    <p>We therefore reply to Mustapha Pasha Kamel that in accusing us of wilful
                        falsehood and in declaring that no accusation has been made against M.
                        Grandmoulin in his organs, he is not speaking the truth or anything near the
                        truth. His statements are as false as they are malicious, and when we think
                        that their author is regarded as a leader by certain Nationalists, we are
                        tempted to remark with the Anglo-French diplomatists in "The Modern
                        Traveller :"</p>
                    <p>"If such a man as that," said they,</p>
                    <p>"Is leader, they may go their way."</p>
                    <p>There is one alternative explanation which we offer in the hope that Mustapha
                        Pasha Kamel's reputation for integrity may thereby be rescued (at the cost
                        of his reputation for possessing any write whatever). It is this - that
                        neither Mustapha Pasha nor his gladiators know enough English to be aware
                        that the word "assassination" is not used of accidental homicide, and that
                        they are sufficiently unintelligent not to see that the effect of their
                        phrases concerning impartiality is spoiled by the use of a term employed in
                        the description of wilful murder. In this case we should recommend our
                        critic to take a course of elementary lessons in English and the rules of
                        logic. But if, as we fear, our first hypothesis —that a deliberate falsehood
                        has appeared in the "Egyptian Standard"--be correct, we can only inform the
                        Nationalist leader that we have answered his challenge and that we throw
                        back in his teeth his accusation of lying.</p>

                    <p>THE HELIOPOLIS OASIS. Mr. Edward Dicey, C.B., contributes the following
                        article to the "Daily Telegraph" :- </p>
                    <p>The Oasis City, the New Cairo In the desert is now in course of construction.
                        When I visited it in the early part of last spring a few small sticks and
                        stones stuck up in the sand of the Suez dosert were the only outward and
                        visible signs of this huge enterprise, calculated, in my opinion, to change
                        many of the conditions of life in Egypt--which, perhaps, at no distant
                        period, may render the desert city a formidable rival to Kair el Masr (Cairo
                        the Great), to use its Arabic title. When I stumbled over the sand some nine
                        months ago, in company with one of the leading promoters of the scheme, when
                        I learnt from bim the enormous proportions of the project, and when I
                        ascertained the immense capital required for its execution, I confess I felt
                        more than doubtful whether the Oasis City was ever likely to be more than a
                        grandiose conception, which would, have to be abandoned as a practical
                        impossibility. From the extraordinary progress made in less than a year's
                        time towards its completion, I have no longer any doubt of the work being
                        achieved. Whether, when completed, it will prove a success or a failure from
                        a pecuniary point of view, is a question which the unknown future must
                        decide, and concerning which my personal opinion would carry no weight or
                        value. </p>
                    <p>In order, however, to render intelligible the circumstances under which the
                        ideas of a huge suburb to Cairo in the desert came into existence, the
                        difficulties the idea had to encounter before it could be contemplated as a
                        serious proposal, and the progress that has already been made in carrying
                        this gigantic scheme into effect, I will endeavour to narrate as briefly
                        impossible the marvellous story of the Oasis City </p>
                    <p>Everybody interested in Egypt is familiar with the almost fantastic rise in
                        the price of building sites in and about Cairo during the last few years. I
                        fully admit that the suddenness and rapidity of this rise bear a suspicious
                        resemblance to many building booms I have known of in other lands, which
                        went up with a run and then came down with a smash. I confess I have thought
                        month after month that the slump was impending, and month after month have
                        been agreeably disappointed. I have at last come to the conclusion that the
                        boom, though it may be--and, as I think, is--exaggerated by , reckless
                        speculation, rests largely upon permanent causes. From the geographical
                        configuration of Cairo the area of unoccupied building land is extremely
                        limited. On the other hand, owing to the rapid increase of general
                        prosperity under British rule, and, even more, to the high prices of the
                        cotton crop, the staple product of Egyptian industry, the incomes of the
                        landowning classes, from the Pashas down to the fellahs have become far
                        larger than they were. With larger means, there has sprung up a sudden
                        desire to have houses in the capital. </p>
                    <p>This demand for houses has been—and still is--extending, with the consequence
                        that the demand exceeds the supply, and that though there may be a fall in
                        the price of houses, this price is not at all likely to fall to the level of
                        three or four years ago. Houses are daily being pulled down to be converted
                        into flats, and the average rentals for offices or shops or apartments, not
                        to mention private houses, have risen out of an proportion to the means of
                        the poorer class of tenants and the lower ranks of the officials in the
                        public service. As a rule, here, houses are let on short tenancies. The
                        result is that leases are constantly terminating, and that the tenant has
                        either to renew his lease on a largely-increased rental or to remove to
                        inferior premises. The question of re-housing the poorer classes, and
                        especially the poorer native officials, has been under discussion for some
                        time. The Egyptian Government, acting as usual on the instructions of the
                        British Agency, has done what it could to remedy this evil, and has
                        increased the salaries of the higher officials, mostly of English birth and
                        breeding, by assisting them to build villas at Ghezireh, but this reform
                        does not improve the position of the poorer native officials, whose
                        comparatively small salaries barely enable them to make both ends meet. </p>
                    <p>The grievance sustained by the humbler class of public servants owing to the

                        largely to the sympathies of certain enlightened members of the Egýptian
                        community, and Boghos Pasha Nubar, the son and heir of the greatest of

                        they found no trice of any other subterranean rivers in the Suez desert. It
                        was useless to bore beyond this depth, as the cost of raising the water by

                        <p>Mr. Mark Sykes delivered a lecture last week to the Royal Geographical
                            Society on his journey in North Mesopotamia, the region between the
                            rivers Tigris and Euphrates. The rules of war, he said, were as atrictly
                            and decently observed among Arabs as by the white and red knights in
                            "Alice in Wonderland." To kill an enemy in battle was discreditable and
                            savage; to wound slightly was what was aimed at, and to wound a man
                            slightly with a bamboo lance 20 feet long was no small feat of skill To
                            surrender was not discreditable; flight was as justifiable as attack ;
                            to carry on warfare at night would be scandalous and shameful, or
                            productive of inconvenient reprisals. Camps were practically out of

                        <p>No less than thirty-nine earthquakes were noticed at Helouan from March
                            30 to December 26, 1904. They were registered by Milne's Seismograph at
                            Helouan Observatory. The observations are given in the report, which has
                            just been published, containing the routine observations made at the new
                            Observatory during 1904. Various causes have contributed to the delay in
                            publishing this report, and it is hoped that that for 1905 will be
                            published very shortly, and the one for 1906 9 months after the end of
                            the year. Some contributions to the discussion of the climate at Helonan
                            and Abbassieh are ready for publication but it has been deemed best to
                            defer these till the publication of the above reports, so that this

                    <head>AMATEUR THEATRICALS AT MUSTAPHA.</head>
                    <p>The little theatre at Mustapha Pasha last night was filled with a large and
                        fashionable audience to witness the performance of "Our Boys," a comedy in
                        three acts, by some local amateurs in aid of the <orgName>Soldiers' and
                            Sailors' Families Association</orgName>. Outward evidence of the
                        fashionable gathering inside was afforded by the large number of motor-cars
                        which were ranged outside the theatre, while inside the pretty toilettes of
                        the ladies, interspersed by the bright uniforms of the officers of the
                        Dublin Fusiliers, afforded a brilliant scene.</p>
                    <p>The plot of "Our Boys" hinges on the complications arising from the two
                        "eligible" sons of, in the one case Sir Geoffrey Champneys, a county
                        maguate, and in the other Perkyn Middlewick, a "retired butterman," becoming
                        infatuated, in direct opposition to their respective sire's wishes, to two
                        charming young ladies, one Violet Melrose, an heiress, and the other Mary
                        Melrose, her poor cousin. As might be expected, the Baronet desires his son
                        Talbot to make a good match and therefore formally choose the haughty
                        heiress, who by the way is antagonistic to the butterman, the latter
                        favouring her poorer and less haughty cousin. Judge therefore the anger of
                        their respective parents when the drawling, empty-headed, young
                        Champneys(well acted by <persName>Mr. Macauase</persName>) singles out Mary
                        Melrose, wane the debonair, son of Middlewick (<persName>Mr.
                            Hewitt</persName>) falls head over heels in love with her rich cousin. </p>
                    <p>The whole play is very amusing, much of the fun being due to the illiterate
                        butterman, admirably noted by Mr. Chataway. <persName>Mr. Preston</persName>
                        takes the part of Sir Geoffrey very well, Miss MacCallum and Miss Graves
                        making two charming consins. Mention must also be made of <persName>Mrs.
                            Borton</persName> as Clarrissa Chainpneys, Sir Geoffrey's sister, and
                            <persName>Miss Mallon</persName> as Belinda, the lodging house slavery. </p>
                    <p>Another performance will be given this evening, when it is anticipated a
                        large audience will be present.</p>

                    <head type="sub">SIR E. GREY'S DEFENCE OF LORD CROMER.</head>
                    <p>The questions put to Sir Edward Grey by <persName>Mr. Dillon</persName> in
                        the House of Commons last week, regarding the appointment of Fathy Bey
                        Zagloul as Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Justice, were as follows: </p>
                    <p>Mr. Dillon sked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether Fathy Bey
                        Zagloul, who acted as Judge in the Denshawi trial, had been appointed
                        Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Justice; whether the British
                        representative in Egypt was in any way consulted in reference to the
                        appointment; and whether the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for
                        Foreign Affairs had received any protests from Egypt against this
                        appointment. </p>
                    <p>Sir E. Grey (Northumberland. Berwick). — I have received one protest against
                        the appointment purporting to be signed by 31 persons. For the rest, I can
                        only refer to my previous answer, to the effect that I had no information,
                        and it was not a matter in which his Majesty's Government should interfere. </p>
                    <p>Mr Dillon asked whether his Majesty's representative in, Egypt was consulted
                        in regard to all these appointments; and whether the right hon. gentleman's
                        attention bad been directed to the extremely serious effect on public
                        opinion in Egypt of the promotion of this judge so soon after the trial. </p>
                    <p>Sir E. Grey.--This is a point on which I have perfect confidence in the
                        discretion or his Majesty's representative. (Opposition cheers ) </p>
                    <p>Mr. Dillon said that perhaps the right hon. gentleman would be good enough to
                        answer the question whether his Majesty's representative in Egypt was not,
                        as a matter of fact, consulted with regard to all these appointments. </p>
                    <p>Sir E. Grey -I cannot say whether he is consulted in regard to all these
                        appointments. Very likely he is consulted in regard to most of them, and, if
                        so, I have no intention whatever of questioning the conclusion to which he
                        comes. (Opposition cheers.) </p>

                    <head>THE HIGH PRICE OF EGYPTIAN YARNS.</head>
                    <p>Mr. W Tattersall states in the "Financier" that Egyptian yarns as made in
                        Bolton and district are getting dearer and dearer. With each further advance
                        in the raw material spinners have put up quotations, and, owing to their
                        strong position, full rates have been held for. Prices all round are
                        exceedingly high, and - users report that it is impossible to purchase such
                        qualities tollay and produce cloth at a profit <!--blank--> . The
                        consumption, however, of the finer numbers in cotton yarns has considerably
                        increased during the last year or two outside Lancashire, and for certain
                        districts of Yorkshire a good business can now be done. The lace trade in,
                        Nottingham is also an active buyer, and prosperity there means increased
                        work for producers in Bolton and district. The finer numbers in weft are
                        scarce,and users who are underbought are awkwardly situated at a time like
                        the present Combed descriptions are decidedly strong, and carded counts are
                        also very deeply under contract. </p>

                    <head>MINISTERIAL DECISION TO-DAY.</head>
                    <p>"The Council of Ministers has to-day decided that the Assouan Dam shall be
                        raised so as to store water to a level seven metres (23 feet) above the
                        present maximum. </p>
                    <p>This decision has only been arrived at after an exhaustive survey of the Nile
                        Valley between Wady Halfa and Khartoum has proved that no suitable site for
                        the construction of a dam of the size required and a reservoir of the
                        necessary capacity exists on the river channel between these two places.
                        Consequently, the only alternative is to raise the Assouan Dam. </p>
                    <p>The quantity of water thus stored will be more than 2½ times that impounded
                        in the existing reservoir. This will afford sufficient water in summer for
                        the irrigation of about -one million acres. </p>
                    <p>There are at present some 950,000 acres of waste land in the southern tracts
                        of Egypt, and it is proposed to make use of the extra water for their
                        irrigation. </p>
                    <p>The increase of the wealth of Egypt brought about by the realisation of this
                        project will be very considerable The Government will reap the benefit of
                        the sale of these lands and the taxes imposed on them, after they have been
                        brought under cultivation. The landowners will gain by the large increase of
                        the cotton crop, which is estimated at from 3½ to 4 million Egyptian pounds. </p>
                    <p>With regard to the regrettable necessity imposed on the Government, namely,
                        the further subinergence of the Philæ temples and the flooding of certain
                        other Nubian monuments, it is intended to use all possible moans to minimise
                        the injury thus caused. An archælogical survey of Nubia will be taken in
                        hand and a minute record made of every monument situated between Wady Halfa
                        and Assouan. The temples affected by the water will be consolidated as far
                        as possible, and the different archäological societies will be asked to
                        co-operate in this work. </p>
                    <p>The cost of the raising of the dam is estimated at L.E. 1,500,000. </p>

                        above club had leaged for a number of year the premises at present occupied
                        by the Sucreries et Raffineries d'Egypte at Bab-el-Louk, to which the club
                        would be transferred. This rumour is incorrect inasmuch as no decision has
                        yet been arrived at, and none is expected before at least two or three
                        months, when the sub-committee appointed for the purpose will meet to decide
                        the question of the eventual transfer. </p>
                    <p>It should be remembered that the Société du Club Khedivial du Caire, which
                        was constituted in 1884 and all the shares of which are held solely by the
                        members, was for a term of 25 years, consequently the committee have ample

                    <head type="sub">CO-ORDINATION SCHEME.</head>
                    <p>The alteration in the status of the military commands in the Mediterranean,
                        which takes place this year, will result in the complete co-ordination under
                        one General of the work of the troops in Egypt, Cyprus, Crote, and at Malta
                        and Gibraltar. </p>
                    <p>Hitherto the three big commands named bave had separate existence, with only
                        such coordination as might be obtained from time to time under War Office
                        direction. As this is not a desirable state of things, in view of war
                        conditions, the whole of the Mediterranean garrisons will, as announced by
                        Mr. Haldane, come under the control of a single commander-in-chief. </p>
                    <p>In a military sense, the situation in the Mediterranean has altered
                        considerably in recent years, and the protection of Egypt, both internally
                        and on its land frontier across the Suez Canal, is an added problem to the
                        military measures for safeguarding the Canal and the overland route to the
                        Red Sea. It is de-airable that the administration, preparation, and
                        reinforcement of Egypt or India from the Mediterranean should be placed in
                        the hands of one controlling general, and not remain, as now, a scattered
                        responsibility. </p>
                    <p>The creation of a commander-in-chief for the Mediterranean gives to the Army
                        an appointment which, in a measure, will compensate for the abolition of the
                        Commandership in-Chief of the Army At present (excluding the Indian command)
                        there exists no field cominand under the Army Council, except South Africa,
                        to which'a senior general can be sint after service at headquarters, or
                        command ing at Aldershot, or in Ireland ; the now appointment, with
                        headquarters at Malta, will create a post second only to India in strategic
                        importance. The Mediterranean general's pay of £5000 per annum is less by
                        some £1600 than the total amount drawn by the Commander-in-Chief in India,
                        but it is greater than any of the home posts. The General Commanding-in
                        Chief at Aldershot receives £3000, the General in Ireland £3000 and
                        allowances, the Inspector-General of the Forces £4000, and the Chief of the
                        General Staff 23000. The Commander-in-Chief in South Africa receives £4000. </p>
                    <p>The holder of the new post will not have any civil duties of governorship,
                        and he will co-ordinate the work of the three separate commands into one
                        whole for war purposes. </p>
                    <p>The strength of the combined command will be as follows :- </p>
                    <p>Malta (including Creto)............. 7500 </p>
                    <p>Gibraltar .....3800</p>

                    <p>17,120 At Gibraltar there will be two line battalions instead of three, and

                        well-chosen programme calculated to show to advantage his delicate touch and
                        refined interpretation Signor Angelelli is by no means an impressive or
                        forcible pianist ; he would make little enough of the greater Beethovens,
                        Bach, or some of the more formidable Chopins. Schumann's Novelette, the two
                        middle movements of the Grieg Sonata (especially the menuet), Goldmark's
                        Paysage, and the two Schutte pieces really were suited to his abilities, as
                        was the Scarlatti (Pastorale e Capriccio), and he played them very prettily.
                        The Goldmark "Paysage" is a most charming, subdued, and suggestive little
                        composition, and the Schutto Romance and "Etude Mignonne" are both most
                        pleasing. He played Chopin's Nocturne in D flat well, but the ballade that
                        followed did not suit him : it should have far more force, especially in its
                        2nd theme, when one is expectant, then carried away with a quick excited
                        flight of released notes. That effect be entirely missed ; in fact both the
                        Chopin pieces, and perhaps the Bach-Saint Saệns (though that combination is
                        rather unsatisfactory, would have sounded well in a Final room. The Sgambati
                        Prelude and pugue is very pretty and old-fashioned, not at all severe but
                        well defined and carefully connected all through : that he played quite
                        well. He is, in a sense, a miniature pianist, and as long as he keeps away
                        from the great works he is well worth hearing,. </p>

                    <head>ADMISSION DE LA PRESSE.</head>
                    <p>(Compte-Rendu de notre représentant) La Commission Municipale s'est réunie
                        hier à 4 h. 1/2 de l'après-midi sous la présidence du Dr Schiess Pacha. </p>
                    <p>Comme la presse était pour la première fois admise aux séances, le présidenti
                        a lu aux journalistes présents quelques mots de bien venue. Nous profitons
                        de cette circonstance pour f liciter M. Michel Salvago d'avoir proposé cette
                        innovation et, plus heureux que ses prédécesseurs, d'avoir su la faire
                        accepter par ses collègues. Les critiques et observations des journaux
                        seront, en effet, d'un grand profit pour la ville et pour les conseillers
                        municipaux eux-mêmes. Inatile de dire que pour notre part, contrairement aux
                        habitudes municipales, nous passerons rapidement sur les questions d'ordre
                        secondaire pour nous arrê er le plus possible sur celles d'intérêt vraiment
                        général. </p>
                    <p>Ceci dit, passons a l'ordre du jour. </p>
                    <p>Une proposition du Ministère tendant au remplacement comme membre de droit:
                        de l'Inspecteur du 3me cercle des Irrigations par 'Ingénieur des Batiments
                        de l'Etat est accep: tée. Le motif qu'on allègue pour ce remplacement étant
                        les absences fréquentes de l'Inspecteur des Irrigations, Me Padoa Bey fait
                        seulement remarquer que S.E. le Goưverngur et le Directeur Général des
                        Douanes n'assistent pas plus souvent aux séances, et qu'ils ne sont pas pour
                        cela remplacés. </p>
                    <p>La question de la location des terrains pour de longues durées est ajournée
                        pour tudes qne le Comité du Contentieux doit encore faire sur ce sujet. </p>
                    <p>La cession a bail d'un terrain à M. Ralli pour la construction d'un casino d
                        une lieu à une interminable discussion. Les uns s'opposent catégoriquement à
                        ce qu'on vote sur ce cas particulier avant d'avoir tranché la question de.
                        principe, à savoir la location de terrains pour de longues durées, tandis
                        que les autres voudraient que, sans trancher cette question de principe, on
                        votât le projet de M. Rulli clumme d'intérêt g néral. La discussion menaçant
                        de s'éterniser, M Rieti demande Ja clôture du débat et la mise aux voix. La
                        concession est repoussée à la majorité, comme n'étant pas d'utilité
                        publique. </p>
                    <p>Une autre disc ission prèsque aussi longue s'engage au sujet des crédits a
                        accorder pour la réorganisation du service technique. Tout le débat roule au
                        fond sur l'augmentation à accorder à M. Wilner M. l'Administrateur se
                        prévalant de l'urgence pour assurer la bonne marche des services, M
                        Escoffier r clame d'abord un rapport du Comité des Finances et Me. Padoa Bey
                        proteste contre l'urgence "Nos services techniques, dit-il en substance,
                        n'out jamais fonctionné d'une manière remarquable; mais je ne crois pas
                        qu'il guffise de 8 jours pour les désorganiser. Chaque fois qu'il s'agit de
                        questions importantes, on se réclame de l'urgence." M. Salvago propose de
                        voter les crédits demandés, soit L.E 2682 sur la Réserve du Budget ordinaire
                        et L.E. 1620 sur le Budget extraordinaire pour la réorganisation de service
                        technique, et cela sur la proposition de M. l'Administrateur qui, étant mie
                        x place que personne pour connaitre la question, affirme qu'il y a urgence."
                        Mais, comme il existe déjà à cet égard une décision analogue de la Délégatio
                        en date du 26 février 1907, leoture est donnée de cette décision, qui est
                        votée à la majorité, sans en retrancher le dernier paragraphe relatif à M.
                        Wilner. M. Escoffier profite d'un éloge fait de cet employé de la Municipa
                        lité par le Dr. Schiess Pacha pour protester contre les personnalités.</p>
                    <p>Sur le Budget Extr ordinaire, les crédits suivants sont votés sans discussion
                        et à main levée : L.E 100, pour des essais de f migation avec le gaz Clayton
                        ; L.E. 244 pour la confection et la réparation des voitures d'ambulance; le
                        crédit à allouer pour aménagements provisoires du palais municipal actuel,
                        en attendant la construction du nouvel Hotel de Ville, soit LE 1250 pour
                        l'agrandissement des archives et l'installation d'un cabinet de toilette
                        pour les Conseillers Municipaux, L.E. 1500 pour la construction d'une
                        nouvelle pièce pour les ingenieurg, L. E. 200 pour l'installation d'un
                        ventilateur dans la salle des séances et L.E.800 pour enduits et replatrage,
                        au total L.E. 3800. </p>
                    <p>Vient ensuite la question relative à la réglementation des poids. M.
                        l'Administrateur refait l'historiq e de cette question qui trafne depuis
                        deux ans et demi. Le Gouvernement qui voulait d'abord q 'on attendit son
                        règlement, n'a encore rien fait et il a laissé entendre à M.
                        l'Administrateur qe si la ville d'Alexandrie etait pressée, elle pouvait
                        inettre en vigueur son propre règlement. Me Padoa Bey fait observer que, M.
                        Bernardi ayant levé tous les obstacles qui s'opposaient à l'entrée des
                        agents de l'ordre publio dans les magasins, rien p't- tait plus tacile ;
                        mais que le gouvernement devait aussi prendre à sa charge tous les procès |
                        qui en résulteraient à l'encontre de la Munici. palité. La Commission vote
                        la mise en vigue ir du règlement q 'elle avait élaboré à ce sujet. </p>
                    <p>Sur la demande de M. Escoffier, la question des excédents et emprises est
                        renvoyée à la </p>
                    <p>>prochaine séance. | La proposition de M. le Baron de Menasce au sujet de
                        l'évaluation des ziadeta de tanzim est renvoyée au conseil d'évaluation pour
                        essai. Yebia Pacha proteste vivement contre la proposition. </p>

                    <p>Le Dr. Valensin expose sa proposition de donner le nom de Giosué Carducci à
                        une rue ou place de la ville d'Alexan Arie. Le grand poète italien qui vient
                        de mou ir 4, en effet, composé une ode en l'honneur d'Alexandrie où il
                        prédit de façon pour ainsi dire prophétique aon brillant avenir. N'est-ce
                        pas un titre suffisant pour la reconnaissance des Alexaudrins 1 - Yehia
                        Pacha répond que pour donner suite à une telle proposition il faudrait que
                        G. Carduooi ait a journé dans notre ville on da </p>
                    <p>moins qu'il lui ait rendu quelque service appréoiable — M. Salvago so rallio
                        avec enthousiastne, à l'idée de M le Dr Valensin et dit que Yehia Pacha peut
                        se tranquilliser sur l'invasion éventuelle des noms de poètes européens dans
                        nos rues. Il est pon de poetes de l'envergure de Carducci et lar 1 tition
                        fréquente de la proposition actuelle n'est pas à craindre. Me Padoa Bey,
                        tout en se ralliant aussi à proposition, regrette qu'un grand français,
                        Pasteur, qui a rendu divers services à Alexandrie n'ait pas le meme honneur.
                        Il espère q e l'oubli gera répars.—- La proposition Valensin est votée,
                        malgré les protestations de plusieurs membres indigènes. </p>

                        <p>The Guards started 7 goals up and were the favourites, but the goal
                            hitting powers of Captains Dunbar and Bartlett were too much for them,
                            Capt. Bartlett especially playing a wonderful game. Final scores : Staff
                            and Departmental, 11 goals ; Coldstream Guards I., 8 goals. </p>
                        <p>The game was fast and keen throughout. Mr. Tollemache played an excellent

                            rather fell off in their play, a very interesting match ending in favour
                            of the Civilians by one goal. Final scores : K.O.S.B, 4 goals ;

                        <p> House of LORDS.--During the Irish debate Lord Crewe assorted that the
                            Government was not disturbed by Mr Balfour's mock heroics. It was
                            impossible to make any statement till the Bill was produced. Lord
                            Loreburn said that he, like Sir A. Campbell-Bannerman, was a Home-Ruler.
                            The Government did not intend to introduce a Home-Rule Bill, but
                            whatever it did, it must inevitably lead to Home-Rule. </p>

                        <p> The debate in the Duma developed into a wrangle between the reactionary
                            members and the Socialists. A declaration on behalf of the latter was
                            read accusing the Government with abetting the massacre and asserting
                            that the state of the country was worse than ever. The other parties
                            abstained from entering into the controversy. Ultimately a
                            Constitutional Democratic motion declaring that the result of the

                        <head>An American Panic.</head>
                        <p>A sudden storm has burst over the Stock Markets here. It had been thought
                            that the continuous fall which had taken place in American railway
                            securities had got rid of the inflation of last Autumn, but America is
                            nothing if not exaggeration, and in view of the magnificent trade which
                            the country has been doing, it would certainly seem as if the fall had
                            been as much over-done as the rise. There are many reasons mentioned on
                            Change for this extraordinary debacle, but the fact that it communicated
                            itself to Consols, gives the idea that it is not purely local, and that
                            there may be other influences in the air which have led to the
                            remarkable collapse which has taken place all-round. Some think that
                            politics are at the bottom of it, but the best-informed seem to regard
                            America and the money situation there was mainly responsible. </p>
                        <p>It is particularly unfortunate that, at this crisis of events, a new
                            Secretary to the Treasury, whose views are entirely unknown,should be at
                            the helm at Washington, and the relief which he has go far extended, by
                            postponing indefinitely the repayment of 30,000,000 dollars due from the
                            banks, is considered quite inadequate to meet the situation, although
                            there is nothing to show that more relief will not be offered. One thing
                            is certain, and that is that the heavy fall, amounting in some instances
                            to 25 and 30 percent., will largely decrease the amount of money
                            required to carry the large quantity of floating railway securities, and
                            thus the money market ought to be, at any rate, a considerable gainer by
                            this "clear-out." That embarrassment, to a greater or lesser extent,
                            must follow goes without saying, and if we are to believe that the fall
                            in Consols is due to the collapse of the American market, it would point
                            to large sales having been made by English holders to meet the
                            differences on Americans. There would not appear to be any real source
                            of weakness in the positious here, and with trade in its present
                            prosperous condition, there is hardly room for any serious collapse.
                            Indeed, all securities on the list appear to be good investments at
                            present prices. </p>
                        <p>There is nothing in the Bank position to cause anxiety. The Directors
                            have wisely decided to retain the 5 per cent, rate, which must in the
                            end prove effective in drawing considerably larger supplies of gold, and
                            the banking community are getting to work with a view to increasing
                            reserves. </p>
                        <p>Even in these "panicky" times, the Japanese loan, of which £11,500,000
                            was issued in this country, has been a success. Most of the applicants
                            have received only 50 per cent. of what they asked for, and an even
                            larger num. ber of investors came forward in Paris. That such loans can
                            be floated successfully at such a time certainly points to the fact that
                            there is plenty of money to invest if only there was confidence in the
                            value of the securities. </p>
                        <p>When great events of this kind are moving the small Egyptian market
                            passes unnoticed, and, very naturally, prices are marked down. This does
                            not necessarily mean that any large amount of selling is taking place,
                            but rather is the result of neglect.</p>

                        <p>It is 22 years since there was so much excitement in the New York stock
                            markets as during yesterday and Wednesday. Huge quantities of securities
                            have been thrown on the market, not only by weak holders but latterly
                            also by the more important firms who have suffered severely as the
                            result of the slump, and were compelled to throw overboard many of their
                            holdings. Yesterday afternoon a condition of panic reigned in Wall
                            Street. and many brokers lost their heads in their endeavours to sell.
                            Naturally with so much excitement preVailing the stupid rumours which
                            were spread with regard to possible future official action against the
                            railways had the effect of increasing the aların, and although the
                            bears, covering for profit, turned the market sharply, the rally: only
                            lasted about half-an-hour, and was followed by further frantic selling.
                            The day's sales amounted to 2,521,500 shares, which is reported to
                            surpass any previous record on the New York Exchange since the Northern

                        <p>Yesterday morning the tone here was quiet, and under the influence of
                            some buying orders, an improving tendency was noticeable. When the first
                            advices came over from Wall Street, however, a further relapse set in,
                            and in the Street the market was demoralised, and prices fell away
                            heavily without check. </p>

                        <p>Sir,--I was surprised to see that the few observations made by me on this
                            subject in answer to a letter signed "G.J.S.," which you kindly
                            published, have resulted in provoking an unnecessary and uncalled-for
                            defence of Orientals. I do not remember having said in my letter
                            anything against Orientals or which could hurt the feelings of such,
                            for, to make the simple statement that the composition of oriental
                            dishes is unknown to Englishmen is neither an insult to Orientals nor a
                            deprecation of their cuisine. That latter is most excellent I have no
                            doubt whatever ; at the same time, it is not the food to which an
                            Englishman has been brought up : not knowing it, he does not appreciate
                            it perhaps sufficiently well. Again, I am not aware of having suggested
                            that oriental manners are bad. On the contrary, we all know that a real
                            oriental gentleman is the pink of politeness, kindness, and hospitality.
                            In fact, oriental manners are 80 perfect that it is with a certain
                            amount of regret that one sees them being gradually adulterated by the
                            introduction of European manners and ways. At the same time thúy are not
                            the manners of an Englishman. I do not for one moment wish to insinuate
                            that English manners are the best ; this they may not be ; but who are
                            we that we should arrogate to ourselves the right to change the English
                            character 7 For my part, I do not think that the endeavours of "G.J.S.,"
                            or of anyone else for that matter, will meet with much success in this
                            direction. Again, I have never said that Orientals are not intelligent,
                            or that Christianity did not rise in the Levant or was not spread by
                            Orientals. I am afraid t at "G.J.S." is again wandering hopelessly from
                            the point. His original argument was that the English are hated by the
                            people over whom they rule on account of their unsociability. In my
                            first letter I endeavoured to show that this not the case Now, the only
                            fresh argument put forward by "G.J.S." in favour of his contention is
                            the I quoted opinion of an unknown English news paper writer published
                            in an English paper, and primarily intended for the edification of his
                            own people. We all know that people, in their zeal to outshine other
                            nations, will frequently find fault with themselves and their own
                            institutions, very often even when no fault exists, and this tendency is
                            more frequent with the English than with any other race. But is it safe
                            for a foreigner to take for granted this exaggerated national abuse ? Is
                            it fair ? Does it not look like hitting a man below the belt ? Now, as
                            to the real question at issue. What is it that "G.J.S." wishes the
                            English to do in order to become popular with the Egyptians and to gain
                            their affection ? As I understand, he desires that the English should
                            cultivate native society to a greater extent, by frequenting their
                            salons and clubs, by encouraging the native to frequent their houses,
                            and by choosing their friends and acquaintance among them. If this is
                            what he wants, he should know (since he is 90 well acquainted with the
                            Eilish character) that the life of an English official in Egypt would
                            not be worth living. Let the Englishman do as "G.J.S." would have him
                            do, and he will not only be hated but despised into the bargain. We may,
                            I think, take the Turks as a-fair example of "G.J.S.'s" policy. During
                            their administration of Egypt, were they loved ? If history can be
                            credited they were not even respected, and according to "G.J.S." the
                            English are hated only. </p>
                        <p>The principal reason why the Turks were not liked by the Egyptians were
                            that they were not Arabs and next that they were not firm, just, or
                            impartial. In the case of the English their very aloofness encourages
                            the equalities Away from dangerous friendships and temptations, away
                            from intrigues and party disputes, their attitude as rulers of Egypt
                            commands naught but respect and obedience. The French in Tunis and the
                            Austrians in Herzegovina keep themselves as much aloof from the
                            population as their national character permits, but with the English the
                            task is much easier on account of the peculiarities of their national
                            training and character </p>
                        <p>It appears to me that the remarks of "G.J.S." are intended to apply
                            mainly to the English Government official. This being so I will not go
                            out of my way to take up the judgels on behalf of the more civilian. It
                            will be apparent to any fair-minded leader that observations such as
                            those quoted from an English paper apply to a certain class of
                            Englishmen with whom we have all of us at times come in contact, and I
                            think it will be admitted with this clagg the average official has but
                            little in common Moreover I fail to understand how the behaviour or
                            deportment of any individual Englishman can influence the degree of
                            affection or of disaffection with which his race is regarded by the
                            Egyptians or, for that matter, any other subject people. </p>

                        <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers
                            the accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by
                            which they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange
                            them as accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that
                            none of them Bre fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home
                            there are several things to be considered. To begin with there is the
                            difference in climate between Egypt and the various points at which you
                            may arrive in Europe. </p>

                            <p>The most recently built Hotel in Salsomaggiore, and on which no

                                regards hygiene and comfort. The Hotel is directly connected with
                                the New Bathing Establishment by a covered passage, </p>

                            <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for
                                Cairo in January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, aid
                                possibly not so warm as Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than
                                Rome, and more uniformly warm than any other places in Europe. Many
                                people leave Egypt far too early in the year, for as a rule the
                                weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to go to On
                                leaving Egypt is Sicily. Some will want to take into consideration
                                the number of days to be spent at sea, and we therefore subjoin a
                                list showing the time occupied on each of the various routes between
                                Egypt and the Continent of Europe. </p>

                            <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio Rubattino Co's steamers,
                                which leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to
                                TAORMINA, one of the most charming and popular places on the island.
                                Giardini is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to
                                Taormina is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around
                                the town is m chto interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek
                                origin, but restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place
                                for the ascent of Etna, and here also is a fine Cathedral. The
                                Greek, Roman, and Saracenic renmates that are found all over the
                                island, are an endless source of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an
                                interesting history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by
                                Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in BC 212, when
                                Archimedes was slain--his tomb is to be seen. The cathedral was once
                                an ancient pas au temple. PALERMO, with about 300,000 inhabitants,
                                is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful climate. Much
                                of interest is to be found in this fine city he Palazzo Reale is of
                                Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S. Giovannia degli
                                Erimiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum
                                Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a visit.

                                days. </p>
                            <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio
                                Rubattino Co.'s steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach
                                Naples or leave it without wishing to explore some of its islands,
                                besides the lovely places on its bay-Castellamare and Sorrento. The
                                small steamer that takes you to Sorrento (you can drive too] will
                                take you on to Capri. </p>
                            <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours All who can
                                will devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and
                                interesting portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties
                                are too well known to need comment here. </p>
                            <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five
                                hours brings you to FLORENCE, where all other week can well be spent
                                admiring the City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In
                                Florence itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing
                                interest, whilst the local promenades and excurssions should not be
                                omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and fashionable
                                promenade. In Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                                finest walks in Europe opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through
                                the hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion
                                outside Florence is that to Vallum brosa, with its Monastery 3,300
                                feet above the sea level. This is made first by ordinary train from.
                                Florence to St. Ellero, thence by cogwheel railway to Saltino. The
                                ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most striking
                                panoramas are unfolded to view </p>
                            <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is
                                a fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night
                                should if possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the
                                Campanile at sunset. </p>

                                near Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very
                                convenient half-way house between Egypt and England, and where
                                living is reasonable and the air and surroundings exceptionally

                                        stay. The total absence of vehicular traffic strikes one as
                                        very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or bicycle is to be
                                        seen, and yet there is the sound of life at. every turn. The
                                        approach the Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any
                                        other seaport. The town seems to be gradually, like
                                        Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills behind, no stretches of
                                        rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above the
                                        horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a
                                        fairy mirage out of the calm lagoon. Going northwards from
                                        Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian lakes.
