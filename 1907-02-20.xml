                    <p> AN EGYPTIAN QUEEN'S TOMB.</p>
                    <p> Archaeology, it must be confessed, is sometimes dull. Men whose energies are
                        fully occupied with the living present find a difficulty in appreciating the
                        interest of arrow-heads many hundreds of years old, of ancient tumuli and
                        mysterious monuments. But two branches of archaeology arouse an interest not
                        provoked by others: Roman, because it has so much to tell us of a power and
                        dominion not unlike our own ; Egyptian, on account of the vividness with
                        which it spells out stories of one of the most picturesque of civilisations. </p>
                    <p> Egyptology is a very human study. It presents fascinating glimpses which
                        might almost be called visions, and in the bones of history- the history,
                        that is, of the manners and customs of a vanished people- it is rich. We
                        have never, however, in the whole record of Egyptian exploration, hit on a
                        more absorbing bit of history than is recounted and recalled by the latest
                        discovery at Thebes, and, if any intelligent man still believes that
                        Egyptology is dull, we recommend him to study this account of the good
                        fortune of Mr. Theodore M. Davis.</p>
                    <p> Some time back Mr. Davis discovered the tomb of the parents of the Egyptian
                        Queen Teie, and recently has come upon the tomb and mummy of Queen Teie
                        herself. Great is therefore the reward granted to what is properly described
                        as his costly and perservering labours in clearing away the rubbish in the
                        Valley of the Tombs of the Kings and probably every inch of ground there.
                        The tomb, we are told, is a plain square sepulchre cut out of the rock and
                        approached by a descent of twenty steps. Unfortunately it lay in the bed of
                        a watercourse, and, owing to the percolation of the water through the rock,
                        such perishable objects as the wood and the royal mummy have suffered
                        severly. "Apart from this, however, the tomb, when entered, was in the same
                        condition as that in which it had been <cb n="6"/> left by priests amid the
                        throes of a religious revolution that had spent its force before Moses was
                        born." The coffin is a superb example of the jeweller's art. There were
                        bracelets itself on the arms of the mummy, which was wrapped from head to
                        foot in sheets of gold ; and round the neck was a necklace of gold beads and
                        ornaments of gold inlaid with precious stones ; while the head was still
                        encircled by an object "priceless and unique"- the imperial crown of the
                        queens of ancient Egypt. "It was difficult," says the writer who tells the
                        story of the discovery, in the "Times" of the 8th inst., "to avoid a feeling
                        of awe when handling this symbol of ancient sovereignty, which has thus
                        risen up, as it were, from the depths of a vanished world."</p>
                    <p> But, curoiusly enough, the deepest human interest of the discovery lies not
                        in what was found but in what had disappeared. The tomb had been violated :
                        the doorway of piled stones partially broken through, the wooden doors
                        wrenched from their hinges, the great catafalque torn in pieces, and the
                        mummy turned over. As the gold was left, this could not have been the work
                        of thieves. The marks of destruction were very, very old. What, then, was
                        the object of the destroyers?</p>
                    <p> Close examination left no doubt on that point, and history aided in the
                        elucidation. Teie was the mother and inspirer of the famous "Heretic King,"
                        Amenhotep IV., who changed his name to Akh-en-Aten. He it was who broke away
                        from the religious traditions of Egypt and endeavoured to introduce a new
                        and foreign creed. The worship of Amon was proscribed, and its devotees were
                        persecuted. Akh-en-Aten tried hard, according to the methods which in after
                        ages became so dolorously familiar to man, to turn his people from the
                        religion of their fathers to a Pantheistic monotheism, the visible symbol of
                        which was the sun. Bitter was the struggle between him and the priesthood of
                        Thebes, and the priests won. The Pharoah was obliged to flee from the
                        country, and to found a new capital, wherein he raised a temple to the
                        omnipresent deity, and preached, taught, and regulated the new faith by
                        royal decrees.</p>
                    <p> When Teie was buried the effigy of her son was placed in various parts of
                        the funeral furniture and the tomb, and it was to destroy every such trace
                        of Akh-en-Aten that in the far remote past her resting place was disturbed.
                        The significant things which were missing were the vestiges of her
                        relationship to the Heretic King. The mummy was turned over in order to
                        erase the name of Akh-en-Aten, incised on the sheet of gold which lay
                        beneath it. "Wherever the name of the heretic was found it was carefully
                        destroyed, and the figure of the King, adoring the solar disc, which had
                        been engraved on one of the gold plates of the catafalque, is chiselled out.
                        The men, however, who thus violated the tomb were no common robbers ; the
                        jewellery of the Queen and the sheets of solid gold with which the sepulchre
                        is literally filled were left untouched ; the havoc they wrought was the
                        result of religious zeal, and even the needs of 'mother Church' were not
                        sufficient to make them carry away the gold that had been polluted by
                        heresy. Wherever the excavators walked they trod upon fragments of gold
                        plate and gold leaf." </p>
                    <p> But why, it may be asked, was the Queen herself undisturbed? It is plausibly
                        suggested that the priests of Thebes did not make war upon women, or perhaps
                        considered that Teie, being a foreigner, was within her rights in refusing
                        to worship the gods of Egypt. Portrait-heads of the Queen were found in the
                        tomb. One is made of Egyptian alabaster, with the eyebrows and eyeballs
                        represented by inlays of lapis lazuli and obsidian. It shows Teie to have
                        been beautiful. The face is that of a woman "at once masterful and
                        engaging." There are few traces of Egyptian descent about it. The curve of
                        the nose is European rather than African. An alien, Teie had a right to be
                        eccentric in her faith. Thebes respected her in death when it had no mercy
                        for her son. </p>

                        <head> Cairo Circulating Library.</head>
                        <p> The financial statement for 1906 of the Cairo Circulating Library shows
                            a balance of L.E. 15,102 mills. instead of a deficit of L.E. 10.366
                            mills, as in 1905. This improvement in the financial position of the
                            library is mainly due to the increase in the amount received as
                            subscriptions. The number of subscribers at the end of 1906 was 192, not
                            including monthly subscribers; of these, 144 annual, 15 half yearly, and
                            33 quarterly subscribers. There were 350 books added to the library in
                            the course of 1906, including 209 works of fiction, 121 of general
                            literature, and 20 on Egypt. In this connection, it is interesting to
                            notice that the demand for fiction is very much in excess of that of
                            other books, even allowing for the extra time which may be required to
                            read the larger works of general literature. In addition to the new
                            books already mentioned, which was purchaised in 1906, a new and
                            compleete set of the Waverley Novels was added to the library. A new
                            catalogue has been printed, and just at the disposal of subscribers.

                        <head> Sailors and Soldiers' Institute.</head>
                        <p> The concert given last night at the Sailors and Soldiers' Institute was
                            quite a treat. It was essentially a soldiers' concert, and afforded
                            striking evidence of what the gallant bandsmen Fusiliers can do.
                            Vocally, no less than as instrumental performers, the Fusiliers are good
                            musicians, and we particularly enjoyed Boy Wright's song, "Pansy Faces"
                            and "Little Yellow Bird," in which the audience joined in the chorus. No
                            less appreciated was the singing of Bandsman Birch : he gave "The
                            Village Blacksmith" and "The Holy Friar." The flute solo "Le Baillard,"
                            composed by Terschalk, was a pretty piece of playing by Mr. Fawcett. We
                            have almost forgotten the band, who so largely contributed to the
                            success of the evening under the able baton of Mr. Fawcett; they
                            executed a choice repertoire which was much liked by a highly critical
                            audience. Nor must we omit to mention one-and a civilian- whose
                            appearance is always hailed with delight. We refer, to Mr. Dodwell.
                            Although suffering from a cold, he nevertheless rose to the occasion,
                            and "brought down the house" with his clever sketches and recitals. He
                            is a past master in the art-no easy one-making one laugh; and it was
                            with regret that we saw him leave the stage after an enthusiastic
                            encore. He was ably accompanied on the piano by Miss Dodwell. We trust
                            that this is not the last concert we are to hear at the Institure this
                            season.</p>

                            and they had been unable to continue their exploration work. The work
                            done so far had been at a very low cost, and they could congratulate
                            themselves upon the development work that had been accomplished. The
                            strike they had made in the No. 1 shaft exceeded in richness and value
                            their most sanguine expectations. The ancients had worked two parallel
                            seems about two feet in width, and assays had been taken showing 1 oz.
                            per ton. Much higher assays had been obtained in the new strike made by
                            the company, but, unfortunately, the discovery was only made just before
                            the work had to be closed. He would not go so far as to say yet that
                            because they had this strike they had a mine, but if the other
                            developments were as satisfactory they would have a good mining

                    <p> TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                    <p> Dear Sir,- I have today seen in the issue of Saturday last a letter from a
                        shareholder in the North Egypt Land Company Limited, of which I have the
                        honour to be a director, and being in Egypt at present, beg to reply.</p>
                    <p> I do not know if your correspondent is or is not one of those shareholders
                        to whom the letter in question was addressed. If he is, he can have but
                        little confidence in his own judgment, in not having paid calls upon the
                        shares he subscibed for. If he is not, he must surely see that a company
                        cannot develop its property without the shareholders placing at its command
                        the necessary working capital. The founders of this company saw, when they
                        bought the estate at Hamman, the rise which was surely coming in all land in
                        Egypt just as H.H. the Khedive saw it much earlier, when he purchased so
                        large a property in that district.</p>
                    <p> That the view of my colleagues was correct is established by the fact that
                        we have succeeded in selling 1,000 feddans for 25,000 pounds, and in answer
                        to your correspondent's inquiry as to when that money is payable, I have to
                        say only that it has been paid.</p>
                    <p> Your correspondent hopes his letter will induce the directors of the company
                        "to some out in the open." I cannot see how they can more clearly expose the
                        company's position. The circular letter referred to states the present
                        position exactly, and that all information regarding the company can be
                        obtained at the offices at Alexandria, and I have been there during the past
                        week to interview shareholders and answer their questions.</p>
                    <p> The position is perfectly obvious : Either shareholders who are in default
                        must pay their contributions, or, failing that, must suffer the penalties
                        clearly stated in the prospectus, viz, of forfeiting their shares. They
                        cannot stand by and wait to see which way the "cat will jump" and then avail
                        themselves of the priviledge of jumping in the same direction.</p>
                    <p> They have their choice and they must choose, each one for himself.</p>
                    <p> Yours faithfully,</p>

                    <head> HIS HOUSE AT STAMBOUL.</head>
                    <p> General Ahmed Djellaleddin Pasha, who has been living at Cairo for some time
                        past, is still in the Sultan's distavour, as the following story will show.
                        The Sultan is sometimes very generous, but does not always discriminate
                        between his own property and that of other people. When, much against his
                        will, he was forced to allow Kiamil Pasha, Governor-General of Aidin, to
                        come to Constantinople, at the instance of the British Embassy, instead of
                        sending him to exile, the Sultan agreed to show him all honour due to his
                        rank. As Kiamil Pasha's house was disposed of, he had to be lodged
                        somewhere, and the only house that seemed available was one occupied by
                        Djellal Pasha, who had just been dismissed from the post of Minister of
                        Marine. So orders were given for him to clear out in two hours, which the
                        old man had to do, in one of the worst storms of rain and snow seen
                        there.</p>
                    <p> Kiamil did not like the house, and took one temporarily in Stamboul, but the
                        Sultan thought that was too far from the Palace, and finally decided on the
                        house of Ahmed Pasha Djellaleddin, former Chief of Secret Police, who fled
                        to Egypt some years ago for fear of Fehim Pasha. But Ahmed Pasha has never
                        been tried, so his house is legally his, and his power of attorney there is
                        a British subject. Further, the house and furniture is worth 19,000 pounds,
                        on which the Ottoman Bank had advanced T14,000. Disregarding all this, the
                        Sultan gave orders that Kiamil Pasha should be installed there, making him a
                        presentation of the house and furniture. But Kiamil refuses to go there, and
                        the bank and the power of attorney have entered protests against the whole
                        business.</p>

                    <head> A FANTASIA.</head>
                    <p> The base depot at <placeName>Karnak</placeName> was recently the scene of
                        remarkable animation, the occasion being a "Fantasia" given by the
                        Corporation of Western Egypt to celebrate the restarting of work on railway
                        construction. From the early hours of the morning large crowds came
                        streaming in from the surrounding districts, and by afternoon, when Mr.
                        Hornblower, the superintendent, held a reception of local notables, there
                        were several thousand people present.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Johnson Pasha</persName>, who is shortly to join the board of
                        directors in Egypt, together with Mr. Montgomery, a gentleman who is largely
                        interested in the affairs of the Corporation, were all present, breaking
                        their journey at the base en route to the Oasis. Mr. Deering, the London
                        secretary, paid a special visit to Karnak for the occasion, while local
                        interests were well represented by the presence of the Mamour of Nag Hamadi,
                        the police officers of Nag Hamadi and Abou Tisht, etc.</p>
                    <p> Camel, donkey, and foot races were followed in the afternoon by a spirited
                        display of sword and "naboot" dances by local Bedouins and fellsheen until
                        at 6 p.m. some three hundred employes and others sat down to assumptuous
                        dinner in tents erected for the purpose.</p>
                    <p> Later in the evening festivities were resumed by the light of huge bonfires,
                        the dancing being this time supplemented by a troupe of dancing girls from
                        the neighbouring town of Farshut, and it was nearly three o'clock the
                        following morning before silence at last fell upon the camp, and the people
                        dispersed to snatch a few hours' rest before proceeding to the desert to
                        resume their labours.</p>

                    <head> CHILDREN'S FANCY DRESS DANCE.</head>
                    <p> Gedge Pasha and Mrs. Gedge inaugurated their removal to their beautiful home
                        at Rasel Tin by a fancy dress dance on Saturday afternoon. It was specially
                        for children, but a goodly number of the parents and other grown-ups were
                        also present and enjoyed the entertainment just as much. The house was
                        beautifully decorated with Chinese lanterns and coloured paper testoons,
                        which combined to give a very pleasant effect. The festivities opened with a
                        grand march-past, followed by a cotillon and the distribution of favours by
                        Baby Cudmore, Mrs. Gedge's sister's child, who, disguised as a fairy,
                        distributed three or four kinds of favours from a miniature boat- with mast
                        and all- which was wheeled round the room by master Gordon Gedge. Miss Nora
                        Gedge danced a skirt, scarf, and tambourine dance, and with Miss Muriel
                        Murray gave a Japanese dance, which was exceedingly pretty and encored, and
                        a castanette dance. Miss Muriel Murray also gave a tambourine dance. Both
                        she and Miss Gedge are beautiful terpsichoreans and they provided the most
                        charming item in a charming entertainment. The dresses worn by Miss Gedge
                        were entirely out of paper and extremely picturesque. A confetti battle
                        which wound up the festivities made quite a carnival-like conclusion to one
                        of the gayest events of the juvenile calendar.</p>
                    <p> The following, amongst others, were some of the costumes at the dance :-
                        Miss Birch as a peasant ; Masters Stevens as a cook and a sportsman ; Miss
                        Eve Strickland with an Empire costume, her sistter representing Summer ;
                        Master Wilson as a clown ; Master Ronald Morrison as a Red Indian (this
                        disguise being undoubtedly one of the best in the room) ; Master Percival as
                        Boy Blue and his sister as Polly put-the-kettle-on ; Baby Preston as a page
                        ; the two little children of Judge Satow as rainbows; Master Basil Rees as a
                        suffragi; Miss Roberts as Cherry Ripe and her brother as Napoleon (special
                        mention must be made of the latter as the wealth of detail in the costume
                        was enormous whilst the finished article was an exact copy, even down to the
                        medals, of one of the well-known pictures of Napoleon) ; Miss Muriel Murray
                        as Forget-Me-Not, Miss Grafton as Sunshine and her brother as Mephstopheles
                        ; Miss Gentilli as Saturnala ; Master S. Hopkinson as a Toresdor ; baby
                        Lander as a Russian peasant ; Baby Pringle as Kate Greenaway ; Miss Mary
                        Lang Anderson as Britannia (the representation in this case being extremely
                        good) ; Master Grant Lang Anderson as a Knave of Hearts ; Master A. Barker
                        as a cake-walk dancer and Miss B. Barker as Dresden China ; Miss Borg as the
                        Morning Star ; Baby Curwen as a cook ; Miss Letty Loveband and Baby Dixon as
                        Red Riding Hoods ; Miss Carver as Queen Victoria at the age of 17, the
                        likeness to Her Magesty, according to the pictures we have of her at that
                        age, being remarkably well reproduced. Two of Mrs. H.P. Kingham's children
                        were dressed as a Spanish girl and a rose; the third wearing an Empire
                        dress. Miss Norah Gedge looked extremely sweet as Mercis from "The Sign of
                        the Cross," whilst her brother Gordon made a very good Robinson Crusoe. As
                        we have already mentioned, Baby Cudmore (the charming little daughter of
                        Mrs. Gedge's sister) played the part of a fairy. </p>

                        to Goost von Keppel Lord of Voorst, who was a staunch supporter of the
                        Prince of Orange, on the accession of the latter to the English throne. The
                        family is a very old one and has always been distinguished. The present Earl
                        succeeded his father in 1894; and since relinquishing his commission in the
                        Scots Guards has been much interested in various other regiments. For some
                        time he was Colonel commanding the Civil Service Rifles, and he also held
                        the same position with the Norfolk Volunteer infantry brigade. He is a
                        lieut.-colonel in the Army, and lieut.-colonel of the reserve of officers.
                        During the Transvaal war he commanded the infantry of the C.I.V., being
                        mentioned in despatches and receiving for his services a medal and four
                        clasps. He was A.D.C. to the King in 1903 ; and for two years (1892-1894)
                        was M.P. for Birkenhead. The Countess of Albemarle was the Hon. Gertrude
                        Lucia, daughter of the first Earl Egerton of Salton.</p>

                        <dateline> LONDON, February 19.</dateline>
                        <p> HOUSE OF LORDS.- <persName>Lord Lovat</persName> raised an interesting
                            debate with the object of showing the inadequacy of the fleet to protect
                            England from foreign invasion. He pointed out that a great number of
                            troops could be mobilised in German ports at a moment's notice. He also
                            referred to the delay with which the mobilisation of troops would be
                            attended in England.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Lord Roberts</persName> held that it would be unwise to trust
                            the Navy alone for defence. He warned the public against being content
                            with the present state of unpreparedness, especially in view of the
                            facilites for the rapid movement of armies.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName> Lord Tweedmouth</persName> agreed with the necessity for not
                            neglecting the possibility of sudden attack. He denied that foreigners
                            were anxious to attack England, who at present was in agreement with
                            all, and no shade of difference existed that was likely to lead to war.
                            He argued that the country was perfectly prepared to defend itself both
                            on sea and on land. (R.)</p>

                            Address, regretting that social legislation should have been postponed
                            for the purpose of effecting revoluntionary changes in the powers of
                            Parliament over the affairs of the United Kingdom and the constitutional
                            relations between the two Houses, was rejected by 374 votes to 111. </p>

                            from the Throne that the German nation was called upon to decide the

                            Reichstag. It had determined that honour and the property of the nation
                            must be protected in no petty party spirit. "As I am resolved to respect
                            all constitutional rights and privileges, so I am confident that the new
                            Reichstag will recognise that its supreme duty is to preserve our
                            position among civilised nations."</p>

                        <p> (FROM OUR THEATRICAL CORRESPONDENT).</p>
                        <p> At last Escalais has reappeared, and in his favourite part-Eleszar. It
                            almost made up for all the dismal parodies the Cairo grand opera has
                            exhibited. He was in superb voice, and he acted the part thoroughly. It
                            was a consummate relief and enjoyment to hear his fine notes, taken with
                            the ease and mastery one so seldom finds. The only other singer worth
                            mentioning was Mlle. Devilloy, te rest were anywhere and everywhere, out
                            of tune, exaggerated, out of time; they may be most charming and
                            interesting people, and it is detestable to be always criticizing them
                            unfavourably; but what can be expected? One does not want beginners or
                            amateurs on the Cairo stage. Why cannot the directors confess at once
                            that they are not attempting to provide first-class or even fifth-class
                            opera? One would then be less exacting. But no; they talk about the
                            splendid prospects for the season; they put in long and flaming articles
                            about the singers; and then Escalais and Devilloy come on, and literally
                            "show up" the whole caste, orchestra, chorus, and everything, just
                            because the two of them, and they alone, have fine voices and know how
                            to sing. Mlle. Devilloy, in the beginning, and Escalais at the end, of
                            the 4th act put everything else into the shade; the finale of the act
                            was as nearly as possible encored, and it must have been only the strain
                            and fatigue of the part that prevented him from repeating it. I have
                            heard people say he has only two notes in his voice, and that he shouts;
                            those two notes seem to take in about two octaves, and if it was
                            shouting, I for one, and I think almost everyone present on Saturday,
                            would be only too glad to hear five acts of such shouting. And, again,
                            the contrast between Mlle. Devilloy and Mme. Baron. Whatever Mme. Baron
                            or the orchestra did, Mlle. Devilloy was always on the note, pure,
                            delightful and resonant. Surely she might take some of the "Falcon"
                            parts; she certainly can do Marguerite. She does not lack strength, and
                            she is far too good to be left in the background with perhaps a couple
                            of arias or half an act. But what is the use of it all? One has to put
                            up with the ways of Those in Authority, and we can only hope that they
                            will treat us better next year. We have the 'Abbas' as an antidote and
                            saving grace.</p>

                        <p> "Aida" was given again on Sunday night. Signor Arrighetti appeared as
                            Amonasro, and Signor Valls as Radames. Excellent as was Sig. Techierdo
                            in the part, the change was most welcome. Sig. Valls has a splendid
                            voice, and sings the part certainly far better than any tenor I have yet
                            heard in Cairo. Of course he is one of the best of the Naples opera
                            tenors: his singing in the last two acts, and especially in the finale,
                            was as fine as one could hope to hear. Sig. Arrighetti was also
                            excellent: last year his voice was thin and quavery and inaccurate, now
                            it is unrecognisible for its strength and fulness of tone. Signa.
                            Fuosini was charming as Amneris;Signa. Fabris was rather thin, and did
                            not always sing true: her higher notes are trying at times. Sig.
                            Campanini again had a triumph in the "March," and aroused the greatest
                            possible enthusiasm. Really one can no longer call the Abbas troupe
                            second class; what with Signi Valls, Lucenti, Arrighetti, and Signa.
                            Fussini (not to mention Battain when is in form) and Sig. Campanini,
                            they are as good as one could wish to hear, witness the crowded housese
                            they draw-and deserve.</p>

                        <p> The caution "Facilis decensus Averni," however hackneyed, is not always
                            to the fore in criticism, which by a sense of abuses can so easily lapse
                            into mere vituperation. But if we uphold the lofty ideal that its true
                            aim is conscientiously to praise and not maliciously to blame, we should
                            have sheets and pages to say about last night's "Pagliacci." And yet
                            when all were said and done, we should find the superlatives, and the
                            result a plethora of verbosity. We alone of last night's house have a
                            cause for chagrin, namely, we know not whither to turn to vent our
                            captiousness. For it is one thing to cite a principle and another to
                            live up to it, and a trifling shortcoming on the part of the principals,
                            chorus or band might have been thankfully seized upon and made the most
                            of. But, with yesterday's performance, how to satisfy a rampagious
                            editor?</p>
                        <p> That "Paglacci" would be a success was a foregone conclusion, by its
                            popularity, its strength of caste, and the fact that here our opera
                            company is altogether in its elements. Whether the opera, in itself, is
                            really deserving of its usual clamorous reception, may be open to
                            question, but there can be no doubt that in its rendering Signor de
                            Marchi, Signora Berlendi, and Maestro Zuccani throughly earned last
                            night's plandits. Such a household god as "Ride Pagliaccio," spiritedly
                            sung by Sig. de Marchi, was bound to carry the audience off its feet. No
                            less delightful was Signa. Berlendi's Nedds, while Sig. Costa's Tonio
                            was a finished piece of work. We are bound to draw those distinctions,
                            but will not enlarge upon them, for as we have implied the whole
                            performance was a clear triumph.</p>
                        <p> The bill concluded with a ballet in three tableaux entitled "Floreal."
                            This was of special interest, as it was conducted by the composer, Sig.
                            Gianni-Galletti, and proved very pleasing and dainty. Considering the
                            limited resources of the "Zizinia," the ballet was quite a good show,
                            and we should mention the graceful pas seul of Sigre. Ratti and
                            Boiana.</p>

                            K.S.C. professional. The ex-champion was defeated but Hastie, giving an
                            excellent display and completing the 18 holes in 69, established a new

                        <head> FOOTBALL AT PORT SAID.</head>
                        <p> Our Port Said Correspondent writes:- Port Said International Club played
                            their return match with the Government School on Saturday afternoon on
                            the club ground in ideal weather and before a large crowd of
                            enthusiastic spectators. The game at the outset was very evenly
                            contested and a fine break through by our forwards was unsuccessful.
                            Play was taken to our goal, the scholars playing with great dash, Vella
                            saved well, however, and set our forwards on the move, but the defense
                            proved equal to the occasion. The visitors then became aggressive and
                            gave the homesters a busy time. A nice run by Jerry on the wing, again,
                            put the native on the defensive. The subsequent play was tame, but Port
                            Said were the superior in combination. From a corner kick by Griffin the
                            native forwards got away with a five rush and were not pulled up until
                            10 yards from the goal, when Vella relieved them of the ball and went
                            down the field on his own. The natives lost another good opportunity a
                            few moments later. Port Said were soon attacking again, thanks to Field
                            and Munk. The latter put in a fine shot which the native goal-keeper
                            saved grandly, and shortly after the same player made another five
                            cleavance. When half-time was called neither side had scored. </p>
                        <p> In the opening stages of the second half play was very excited and after
                            a short spell of defensive work the natives got away on the right wing,
                            beat Jones and Wallace, and sent in a long dropping shot which Brotsch
                            failed to save. From the kick-off our centre forward showed some of his
                            characteristic elusiveness and tricked the native backs, but his final
                            kick went astray. Shortly after, however, the same player found the net
                            and thus equalized matters amid great cheers.</p>
                        <p> A pleasant game was here interrupted by rough play and fouls which the
                            referee allowed to pass, but which were received with jeers by the crowd
                            of spectators. Mac the club's inside right, was fouled, four yards from
                            goal with the ball of his feet. The injury he received, however, did not
                            prevent him resuming and just before time the player sent the ball over
                            the heads of his opponents' half-backs, clean beat the full backs, and
                            registered one of the prettiest goals he has scored this season. From
                            now on to the end play ruled exciting, but nothing more was scored.
                            Final score: Port Said Club, 2 goals; Government School, 1 goal.</p>

                        <head> "THE EGYPT OF THE FUTURE."</head>
                        <byline> TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE</byline>
                        <p> Sir.- In the notice of <persName>Mr. Edward Dicey</persName>'s new book
                            "The Future of Egypt," which I saw in the "Egyptian Gazette" of the 11th
                            ist., you only gave a single extract on the Capitulations of the
                            gentleman's work. The point of Mr. Dicey's argument against
                                <persName>Lord Cromer</persName>'s proposals is that the abolition
                            of the Capitulations would result in making the British Agency more
                            autocratic than it is at present. Mr. Dicey emphasizes this argument in
                            another passage in the same book. On page 209 he says :-</p>
                        <p> "As things stand, there are various limitations which still furnish
                            certain guarantees against the autocratic power possessed by our
                            representative being carried to any great extent. At the risk of
                            repeating myself, I gladly own that Lord Cromer is as good an absolute
                            ruler as Egypt has ever possessed; and if he should carry out his
                            programme to abolish the capitulations, suppress the mixed courts,
                            establish an advisory legislature nominated indirectly, if not directly,
                            by himself, deprive the Khedive of the right of communicating with
                            foreign Powers except through the British Agency, and thereby convert
                            the Consuls-General accredited to his Highness into commercial consule,
                            the machine of autocracy would work without a hitch or break I doubt,
                            however autocracy, absolute and uncontrolled, proving beneficial even to
                            so high-minded and upright an autocrat as our present Consul General. I
                            remember two or three years ago when I was calling at the Agency I
                            happened to speak to him on the subject of the Caisse de la Dette, and
                            he remarked; 'I have often though when I was in India that if we had had
                            there such an institution as the Caisse de la Dette to check out our
                            Indian expenditure, we might have been saved from many extravagences and
                            errors we have committed there.' Apparently, since then, his Lordship
                            has altered his mind and has come to the conclusion that the
                            disadvantages of any independent institution whatever exceed its
                            advantages- for Egypt. I am myself of opinion that, in the interest of
                            Egypt, the gain she might derive from the abolition of the capitulations
                            would be dearly purchased by the removal of the international
                            institutions which, to some extent, hamper the absolute autocracy Lord
                            Cromer now desires for himself, and which must, of necessity, devolve
                            upon his successors, who may easily be men of far less common sense and
                            'sound judgment."</p>
                        <p> This passage is even more explicit than the one cited in the notice in
                            the "Gazette" as demonstrating Mr. Dicey's standpoint, which simply
                            amounts to the single objection that if the capitulations be tampered
                            with in the way Lord Cromer suggests in his last Report it will result
                            in giving the British representative too autocratic a power.</p>
                        <p> Now this point is absolutely contrary to the line of reasoning of the
                            Italian Chamber of Commerce at Alexandria, which recently declared
                            against Lord Cromer's scheme on the ground that it would be tantamount
                            to handing over the rights and privileges of the Europeans to the
                            natives.</p>
                        <p> Yet, although the decision of the Chamber is diametrically opposed to
                            Mr. Dicey's opinion is enunciated in "The Egypt of the Future," only a
                            fortnight ago that gentleman wrote in favour of it. It appears
                            incredible that such opposite points of view could emanate from the same
                            person, yet here is what Mr. Dicey said in the "Daily Telegraph" a few
                            days ago:-</p>
                        <p> "The Alexandria (sic Italian) Chamber of Commerce has had under its
                            consideration for some weeks past Lord Cromer's proposals for the
                            abolition of the capitulations. At their last meeting they are reported
                            to have passed a resolution declaring that the Chamber, while
                            recognising the good work accomplished by Great Britain in Egypt, is
                            unfavourable to any change of the status quo, as the Chamber considers
                            that in their present state natives are unfit to be entrusted with the
                            security of foreigners in the country. This is, to my mind, sound sense
                            and plain English!"</p>
                        <p> Here we have Mr. Dicey strongly supporting the "sound sense" of a
                            resolution, which opposes any change in the capitulations on the ground
                            that it will lead to the transfer of power to the natives, while he
                            himself argues that the proposals of Lord Cromer will have the entirely
                            different result of transferring all the power to his Lordship. What is
                            the conclusion to be drawn from these inconsistencies?-</p>

                        <p> Dear Sir.- Careless reading of a recent note in the "Gazette" has led to
                            erroneous impressions on the part of some people concerning the position
                            of <persName>Mr. H.R. Hall</persName> with the Egyptian Exploration
                            Fund. While Mr. Hall has not been engaged in an excavations in Egypt
                            this winter, I am informed that he still maintains his connection with

                    <p> Le taux de l'escompte libre a Londres se maintient a 4 3/4 pour cent. Au
                        Stock Exchange, le Consoli le anglais a retrograde hier de 1/8 a 86 7/8.
                        L'Unifiee est restes invariee a 102 3/4, de meme que la National Bank a 28

                    <p/>
                    <p> Ici, au debut de la seance, le marche a montre ce matin de velleites
                        d'animation et de fermete, auxquelles ont succede le calme et la lourdeur,
                        les acheteurs s'etant eclipses ou s'etant transformes en vendeurs. C'est
                        exactement. d'ailleurs, la repetition de ce que nous avons vu dans la
                        plupart des seances precedentes. Il n'en apparait pas moins que le marche ne
                        tardera pas a s'orienter, a condition toutefois que les emissions
                        ininterrompues de nouvelles entreprises lui laissent quelque rept et
                        permettent aux capitaux disponibles de s'engager dans les bonnes valeurs
                        connues, dont les prix deviennent de plus en plus interessants. Et
                        l'orientation se tera des lors forcement vers une reprise stable, suivie
                        d'une hausse, d'autant plus que tout s'y prete aussi bien une position de
                        place fortement allegee que le retour rapide a l'aissance monetaire.</p>
                    <p> Dans le compartiment des Banques, la National, delaissee, a faibli a 28.

                        <p>Considering its many advantages both natural and artificial, its
                            delightful climate, the beauty of its country, its ancient historical
                            associations, and its proximity to Cairo, it is surprising that so few
                            of our winter visitors find their way to the Fayoum. Since very early
                            days it has been known as the Garden of Egypt, and now, thanks to the
                            perfection of its irrigation and the facilities offered by the various
                            railways which intersect it, it is the most prosperous oasis in the
                            country. Lying to the west of the Nile, and about an hour’s railway
                            journey from Wasta, it is watered by the Bahr Youssef, which. with its
                            many tributaries and waterways, intersect its length and breadth and
                            account for its fertility. The journey is by no means an arduous one,
                            the Luxor express from Cairo carrying one smoothly and easily to Wasta
                            in about one hour and a half, and the remaining journey across the
                            desert being made by a branch line of the same State Railway. The track
                            from Wasta to Siala is for the most part across the sterile track of
                            desert covered only by scrub, through here and there are signs of
                            cultivation, and occasionally a deep and grass covered ravine will break
                            the monotony of the rolling sandy plain. Before Edwa. however, is
                            reached rich fields, teeming with their heavy crops and groves of palms,
                            refresh the eye and numerous streams and water courses are to be seen on
                            either side. </p>
                        <p> Medinet el Fayoum, the chief town of the oasis, lies, roughly speaking,
                            in the middle of it and midway between the river on the west and Lake
                            Karoun on the north-est. The modern trend is intersected by numberless
                            streams and canals upon the banks of which are its chief streets, and it
                            is the centre of that network of light railways which are so material an
                            aid to its prosperity. It is quite a fair-sized town, and though the
                            European population is but, comparatively. It is quite a fair-sized
                            town, and though the European population is but, comparatively speaking
                            small, it owns a fair number of good houses and is evidently in
                            prosperous circumstances. Close beside the modern town is the site of
                            ancient Crocodopolis, which is rapidly disappearing beneath the
                            encroaching modern and unsightly brickyards, while the ancient mud
                            bricks and walls are being pulled to pieces and resolved into their
                            original earth to be used for fertilizing purposes. The small hill
                            overlooking the site of Crocodopolis is composed seemingly of nothing
                            but the debris of brick and pottery, and from its summit a good view may
                            be obtained of the surrounding country; on one side of the glorious
                            green of the young crops, on the other the scene of desolation and
                            destruction, a never-ending stream of camels and donkeys and their
                            owners busied among the debris of the old city. The huge Mohamedan
                            cemetery lies between the town and brick yards, and in the vicinity of
                            the latter are also pottery sheds, where many homely and domestic
                            utensils are being fashioned from the native clay.</p>
                        <p> Perhaps Medinet would lose its greatest charm if it ever became another
                            happy hunting ground for tourists : for as yet one can wander through
                            its streets and lanes, making mental pictures of its narrow highways and
                            byways and studying their inhabitants without over much rousing their
                            curiosity, or, more strange- still their cupidity. Bits of glorious
                            colouring and quaint architectural studies are on every side. Note for
                            instance one corner where a huge lebekh tree hangs its thick branches
                            across the street, the shops in the foreground being stacked about their
                            doors with bundles of purple sugar cane with feathery tops. The many
                            canals also add an unaccustomed and picturesque element to the view, and
                            the sound of the water gushing through the sluices is a welcome change
                            to the noise of a great city, and lulls one gently to sleep at night
                            time.</p>
                        <p> The hotels of Medinet are of the primitive order, and visitors to Fayoum
                            must not expect to find there comforts and luxury they en<cb n="2"/>joy
                            in Cairo and the other better-known places in Upper Egypt. But, the
                            accomodation at the Karoum Hotel is clean and very fairly comfortable
                            and the prices very modereate. This hotel also owns a smaller house on
                            the lake Karoun, Hotel Moeris, which is popular in the summer months and
                            especially among those who visit the oasis for shooting and fishing
                            purposes. The scenery about the Lake is very beautiful, and many
                            glorious excursions can be made in the neighborhood. As for the objects
                            of interest in the Fayoum, they are for more numerous than one would at
                            first imagine. There are the very ancient pyramids of Hawara and Lehoun,
                            pyramids of somewhat irregular shape, and which in the days of the XII.
                            dynasty kings, were surrounded by regal palaces and towns. Indeed
                            Herodotus makes mention of the position as being occupied by that
                            labyrinth that owned so many rooms that the unwary traveller who once
                            crossed its threshold was lost for ever more. There are but few traces
                            nowadays of either town or palace and the country round about the
                            Pyraids is a vast stretch of desert, but remains of the ancient days and
                            antiquities of all sorts are constantly being brought to light.</p>
                        <p> Minieh, a modern and fairly prosperous town lying to the south-west of
                            Medinet and on one of the lines of the light railways, is also worthy of
                            a visit, for there are various signs in its neighbourhood that point to
                            the site of the ancient Lake Moeris, also mentioned by Herodotus. There
                            are many contradictory reports as to this lake, some trying to connect
                            it with Lake Karoun, while others declare that the waters so described
                            by the historian were due only to an extra high inundation of the river,
                            but other authorities find in the remains of dykes and other objects
                            near Minieh, sifficient evidence to fix that as the most likely position
                            of the once-famous sheet of water.</p>
                        <p> Within a short drive from Medinet and to the south of it are some
                            interesting remains of a huge granary, like unto those described in the
                            Bible of Joseph's time. The grain was stored within mud-brick erections
                            for all the world like huge beehives, and these were protected by a high
                            wall and fortress. The present remains are most interesting and many of
                            these beehive buildings still stand in their original position with
                            portions of the wall and fortress. A short drive further on will take
                            one to the Coptic convent which dates from very early days. There are no
                            signs of European prosperity about this convent, which is situated amid
                            virgin desert and which consists of a rambling mud brick central
                            building surrounded by many cells with barred windows. Visitors are
                            allowed entrance during certain hours of the day, and are shown with
                            pride over the chapel, etc.</p>
                        <p> Space forbids mention of the other objects of interest which are to be
                            found in and about the Fayoum; but there is much to recommend the oasis
                            to the traveller who really wishes to see the country and who is
                            interested in the native life. Prosperous it is already, and the day
                            will soon come when its value will be even more appreciated. Its
                            facilities are great, and now that European interest and energies are
                            controlling and directing both irrigation and railways we may expect to
                            see great returns. </p>

                    <p>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</p>

                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased

                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night
                        succeeds the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the
                        celebrated life-reviving tonic</p>

                    <p>THE EXPIRING LAMP OF LIFE LIGHTED UP AFRESH,</p>

                    <p>and a new existence imparted in place of what had so lately seemed worn-out,
                        "used up,” and valueless. This wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and
                        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative
                        essence, which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had
                        preceded it for this wide-spread and numerous class of human ailments.</p>
