					<head>A CONTRADICTION.</head>
					<p>The statement of a Cairo contemporary, that the negotiations for the

						the Anglo-American Nile Steamers and Hotels Company were on the point of

						amalgamation of the Hamburg-Amerika S.S. Company with Messrs. Thos. Cook and
						Sons with a view to a new or improved Nile serving. </p>
					<p>The S.S. Oceana, which was expected to be ready by the beginning of the year
						1906 for the Naples-Alexandria passenger traffic of the German company, is
						hardly likely, from the latest accounts, to be completed and through her

					<head>THE VECTIS COLLISION.</head>
					<p>A PASSENGER’S ACCOUNT.</p>
					<p>The P.O. S. Y. Vectis arrived at Alexandria this morning from <placeName>Port
							Said</placeName>. One of the passengers on board the yacht gives us the
						following most interesting account of the collision between the Vectis and
						the Esther R off Constantinople, which he watched from the deck of the
						British vessel. </p>
					<p>It appears that the Vectis was steaming out of the harbour at
							<placeName>Constantinople</placeName> bound for
							<placeName>Beyrout</placeName> when the Italian wooden cargo steamer
						Esther R. appeared steering a course that brought her diagonally across the
						bows of the Vectis. In spite of signals,which were repeated, that she was
						steering across the course of the latter vessel, the Italian continued her
						career without apparently paying any attention, and <persName>Captain
							Thompson</persName>, of the Vectis, realising that a collision was
						imminent, ordered the engines to be put full speed astern so as to minimise
						the force of the impact, and at the same time ordered all the passengers
						between decks to be mustered on deck, those for ward to have the priority,
						owing to the certainty that his bows would suffer. Within about a minute
						from the command the Vectis struck the bows of the Italian vessel with a
						noise that resembled the breaking of a hollow box. The vibration was not
						very considerable, probably owing to the low speed of the ramming vessel but
						the bow of the Vectis rent the side of the Esther R from the rail to the
						water line, bulging out the plates on the opposite side of her victim and
						sending fragments of metal and timber flying in all directions. </p>
					<p>Immediately on the collision Captain Thompson, as a precautionary measure,
						ordered the boats to be lowered. The passengers, most of whom were still in
						bed at the early hour of 6 a.m., were naturally rather startled by the shook
						and the stewards’ warning, and many of the ladies came on deck in decidedly
						incomplete toilettes, but there was a most commendable absence of panic.
						Their coolness was not shown by the crew of the Italian vessel, a number of
						whom leaped On to the bows of the Vectis as the vessels hung together. As
						soon as the interlocked bows of the ships separated; the Esther R, with a
						twenty-foot gap in her side and a huge list, made for the rooks at the
						entrance of the harbour and in two or three minutes grounded on a ledge. A
						few minutes more would have seen her founder. </p>
					<p>The Vectis suffered comparatively light damage: her bows were stovein and
						some plates holed, but no really serious harm was done to the structure of
						the ship. The delay of two days, though of course annoying, did not cost the
						passengers anything, the company merely extending the deration of the
						voyage, and all were agreed that the action of the captain and his officers,
						all of whom were on duty at the time of the collision, was marked by a
						seamanlike resolution and sangfroid,while no unnecessary risks were taken. </p>
					<p>An enquiry will be held as to the cause of the collision, which is believed
						to be done to the employment of an inexperienced pilot on the Esther R,
						which was an old British-built vessel, dating from some 30 years back, since
						transferred to au Italian company. </p>

					<p>FRENCH PRESS OPINION.</p>
					<p>In an interesting article dealing with the hopes entertained by the Egyptian
						“patriot,” <persName>Mustapha Pasha Kamel</persName>, of German intervention
						in Egypt, our contrere "R.C.," of “La Beforme,” says :—“To think that
							<persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q102005">William
							II</persName>. will, from mere disinterested love of Islam; free Egypt
						of the English, is a chimera, and nothing more. Still, it is possible that
						some difficulties might be raised by <placeName>Germany</placeName> in
						connection with the abolition of the Capitulations, and several
							<placeName>Berlin</placeName> newspaper's have recently expressed a
						formal opinion in favor of the maintenance of these secular treaties. The
						Capitulations, which were concluded, first of all, by the kings of France,
						and which every government of our country has hitherto defended, have in
						future for Germany virtues which they did not possess when
							<placeName>France</placeName> was the only one to defend them. It is
						rather late in the day now. They left to France the role of eternal
						"protestataire" while she was in reality the champion of all the European
						States; and it is only when an agreement has been come to between her and
							<placeName>England</placeName>, having as a corollary the modification
						if not the abolition of these Capitulations, that they take it into their
						heads to defend them. </p>
					<p>"Besides, it is not on this ground that our confrere of the "Lewa” wishes to
						draw the <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2677">Emperor
							William</persName> . Native publicists have always been the allies of
						the English in demanding the suppression of these laws, which, it appears,
						affect them injuriously. They have never been able to understand that the
						Capitulations were a guarantee of the relative independence of Egypt:
						internationalism has not had any more resolute enemies— <persName
							ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q336487">Lord Cromer</persName>
						excluded —than the native ruling classes themselves.” </p>

					<head>SWIMMING IN THE NILE.</head>
					<p>AMERICANS ESTABLISH RECORDS.</p>
					<p>A detailed account of a test of endurance and record-forming ordeal in the
						Nile, should interest all lovers of sport, write a Cairo correspondent.
							<persName>Mr. Poss</persName>, the well known American swimmer;
						successfully accomplished the task of swimming from the Anglo-American
						landing-stage (to the south of Kasr-el-Nil bridge) to the Barrage in just
						three hours and a quarter. _ </p>
					<p>The event was preceded by an exhibition of fast swimming by <persName>Tom
							Smith</persName>, the steward of the <persName>Hon. Frederick
							Morgan</persName>. At 9.5 the beautifully appointed launch Rapide, lent
						for the occasion, and having on board as time-keepers and judges Mr.
						Bigge,Mr. Cook,Mr. Delbaxon, Mr. Stephens, and Mr. Bourse, pat out from the
						landing-stage at Kasr-el Doabara, where Smith dived in, and, with a strong
						tide stroke was soon through the swirl of the Kasr-el-Nil Bridge. He reached
						Rod el-Farag in a fraction under thirty-five minutes from the moment of
						diving—an extraordinary feat, considering the condition of the river at the
						present time. </p>
					<p>On Poss entering the water, it was seen at once that he had grasped the
						problem of negotiating the current, and he began his fatiguing journey with
						a powerful breast stroke,whioh he maintained almost continuously. The water
						proved towards the end of the swim somewhat chilly. But Poes never showed
						the slightest inclination to give in. En reute the swimmer was misinformed
						as to the correct reute, and taking the channel to the right, lengthened the
						course by nearly two miles and lost also the aid of the current. He was,
						more over, in constant danger of being ran down by gyhassas, the occupants
						of which were seized with a desire to rescue from the water a man whom they
						supposed to be drowning. </p>
					<p>Smith finished the last four miles with Poss to pace and encourage him, and
						the two were nearly drawn through sluice gates. Poss, after a vigorous
						massage and a walk about the precincts of the Barrage, found himself in
						excellent fettle, and declared that he could do the swim over again. The
						precise time of the start was 10.15 and the Barrage was reached at 1.30. </p>
					<p>The two swimmers to whom we have referred, have done a great deal to dispel
						the many stories which prevailed as to the treacherous character of the
						Father of Rivers, and have established records in swimming in Egypt, which
						we hope others will endeavour in due course to surpass. They proved,
						moreover, that swimming contests in the Nile are as safe as in any other
						river, and we should that after their exhibition natation will be added to
						the list of progressive Egyptian sports. </p>

					<head>H.M.S. POWERFUL v. EXILES.</head>
					<p>Played at <placeName>Suez</placeName> on 1st inst. The naval officers batted
						first, and after <persName>Irwin</persName> had been dismissed by
							<persName>Nosworthy</persName> at 18, the innings for a time resolved
						itself into a procession, the attack dominating over the defence to such an
						extant that seven wickets were down for 29. On <persName>Carne</persName>
						joining <persName>Bush</persName> the visitors' prospects appreciably
						improved, and when Nosworthy broke the partnership the score had been

							<persName>Worthington</persName> reputed one of the finest bats in the
						Navy, was out to hot return to <persName>Mansell</persName> which was
						smartly held Both Mansell and Nosworthy constantly heat the batsmen, but
						they were flattered by a somewhat nerveless defence.</p>
					<p>The task imposed on the home team was not a hard one, but, with the exception
						of <persName>Toms</persName> and <persName>Norton</persName>, it failed to
