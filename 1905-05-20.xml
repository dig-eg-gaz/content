                    <p>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</p>
                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
                        vitality—vigour--</p>
                    <p>VITAL STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY</p>
                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night
                        succeeds the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the
                        celebrated life-reviving tonic</p>
                    <p>THERAPION No.3</p>

                    <p>and a new existence imparted in place of what had so lately seemed worn-out,
                        "used up,” and valueless. This wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and
                        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative
                        essence, which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had
                        preceded it for this wide-spread and numerous class of human ailments.</p>

                            in international politics must for twenty years be grievously
                            diminished. Her real policy for the last half century has been to lay
                            trains for future expansion, and that policy, if her present Government
                            survives, must for a generation at least be suspended. Revolution, it is
                            true, might pour new blood through her exhausted veins, and make her
                            once more a formidable fighting power; bat failing revolution, her
                            Government must devote itself to the reorganisation of the Army, the
                            settlement of the terrible agrarian question, the concession of personal
                            liberty, and the restoration of the national fortune. On every side the
                            mast be passive, as France was after Sedan, and during that passive
                            period there will be changed of attitude in every one of tho many States
                            which she threatens, or upon which she impinges. Her word, for example,
                            will no longer be final at Pekin. Whether the vast Empire of China
                            passes under Japanese leadership, or accepts Anglo-Saxon guidance, or is
                            ruled by the great Vioeroys of the Sonth, the dominance of Russia, which
                            has been in the way of every "improvement," from the reorganisation of
                            the Army to the construction of arterial railways and the exploitation
                            of mineral wealth, will be for a period at an end. The half-dozen men
                            who in Pekin continuously guide the Throne have been possessed with the
                            fear that, if Russia wore defied, she would exert her military force,
                            and termin ate at once the traditions and the profits ol the Manohu
                            dynasty. Relieved of that preoccupation, they must commence some new
                            course, be it reform as Europe understands reform, or a stronger
                            centralisation, or sub mission to some Power or combination of Powers
                            not animated by the Russian spirit or seeking Russian objects, which
                            would involve radical change in all Chinese political methods. The
                            straggle for the greatest market left in the world is certain to
                            contiijuo, hut it will continue without the interference of the Power
                            which has hitherto secretly settled all the conditions of the race. This
                            of itself is a great change, and it is only one amongst many. There are
                            many indications at Constantinople that Turkey, relieved for the moment
                            from the pressure of her secular foe, is tempted to trust once more to
                            the old policy of violence, which at heart Pashas believe to be the only
                            one worthy of the children of the faith. The Divan may cease to
                            diplomatist, and may strike at Bulgaria, at Greece, at its own rebels in
                            Macedonia and Albania, with armies, and if it strikes with effect, will
                            strike to slaughter and to enslave. That would in the end bring down on
                            Turkey the forces of civilization, and as those forces must have an
                            agent, the actual work of expelling her from Europe must fall to
                            Austria, who hopes always for Salonicaaud a new trade, aided perhaps by
                            Italy. Russia will rage at the thought of losing her predominance in the
                            Balkans; but if Russia is paralyzed, only Germany can interfere, and
                            Germany is much more likely to bargain for her there of the spoil. No
                            doubt also the vigour of Germany will be increased by a farther debacle,
                            for she will be relieved from that fear of invasion from two sides which
                            ever since 1875 has been the controlling factor of her policy and her
                            legisla- tion. Her Government mast, for example, attend more sincerely
                            to the protests of her people against heavier taxation ; she may find in
                            her savings on the Army the means of perfecting her Fleet; and she will
                            find the desire of her people for greater freedom and lighter discipline
                            increased by the temporary extinction of that dread which has made her
                            organization as a barrack seem even to her intellectuals a necessary
                            misfortune. As for France, her only course is to exchange her alliance
                            with Russia for an alliance with Great Britain, and try to become the
                            motive-power of a combination of herself, Great Britain, and America,
                            which should steadily seek to secure the liberty of the nations and the
                            general peace of the world. Even our own country, apart from this
                            alliance, which grows naturally out of the entente cordiale, will b£
                            greatly affected by the suspension of ambition in Russia. She will be
                            comparatively free from the fear of a European coalition, and will be
                            released from that preoccupation—the danger of an invasion of India from
                            the North—which has lain at the root of many of her difficulties in the
                            reorganization of national detente. Her only dangerous land frontier—for
                            America does not wish to obtain Canada by conqueet— is that of India,
                            and it will be for many years, as it wore, protected instead of assailed
                            by the huge but necessarily motionless mass in the North.</p>
                        <p>Many of these conseqnenoes may be slow in developing themselves, bat they
                            must, we think, follow if Russia is seriously beaten without being
                            completely revolution. If, on the other hand, she is revolutionized, as
                            so many expect, the result of defeat may be very different, though at
                            least as important to the world. A free Russia, whether under a new
                            dynasty or the old one chastened by a terrible experience, will still
                            contain one hundred and fifty millions of white men, all full of belief
                            in the destiny of the Slav race, and still debarred from free or easy
                            access to the waters of the World. Russia, rilled in accordance with her
                            popular instincts, may—indeed, must—abandon the dream of dominating the
                            Pacific; bat it would be to throw herself more earnestly, and therefore
                            successfully, into plans for forcing an entrance into the Mediterranean,
                            her natural outlet, tho economic strength of Russia lying in her
                            Southern provinces, and obtaining, perhaps by purobase.au ioe-frte
                            entrance into tho Atlantic. There is a possibility of half-a dozen wars
                            in those two projects ; yet it is certain that if Russians were
                            Englishmen, or Prenohmen, or Germans, those are the two which would in-
                            fluence every popular agitator. They would never consent to sit down
                            imprisoned ; and wo cannot conceive why the enormous and stead- ily
                            multiplying Slav race, when once it has released itself from internal
                            oppression, should be expected to sit down either. Those however, are
                            the questions and dangers of tho future. Por the moment tho paralysis of
                            Russia must release China, Turkey, Germany, and Gioat Britain from
                            enormous pressure, must solidify the entente cordiale with France, and
                            ought, therefore, to give humanity a respite from its person banned
                            truce. It may not, for there is a black cloud gathering in European
                            Turkey - perhaps too in Moroco—but if diplomacy lies any executive
                            power—has, that is, the power of making dynasties and peoples act
                            reason* ably towards each other—it ought.</p>

                        of the monthly “Army List”—on which it has ap- peared since September,
                        1900—appropriated to colonels on the active half-pay list The Secretary of
                        the War Office now writes to say that someone in the War Office has
                        blundered, and that there has been confusion between Colonel D. F. Lewis and
                        Colonel J. P. Lewis, and that all will be made right when the June “Army
                        List” appears. The explanation was necessary, for in the "Army List” for May
                        not only is the name of Colonel D. F. Lewis con- supicuous by its absence
                        from the half-pay list, but in column 117 it is distinctly said that he is

                    <p>THE LOCUST PLAGUE APPEARANCE IN MINISH. A telegram received from Minieh
                        Province yesterday reports the discovery of deposits of fresh locust eggs at
                        Zawiet el Gadsma, Magha- gha Marks z, on the east bank of the Nile. The
                        necessary steps are being taken to destroy (hem and to search for similar
                        deposits. Mr. Melville is acting as inspector of Minieh pro- vince, and is
                        being assisted by Mr. Charman in Beni Mazar and by Capt. Wilkinson in Abou
                        Ghirgis Markaz.</p>
                    <p>Although a considerable number of locusts have been observed in Upper Egypt
                        since May 13 they are not in anything like the quantities that arrived last
                        year, and it appears that only a certain number are being carried across,
                        probably from Arabia, by the recent S. and S. E. wind. The prevailing strong
                        N. wind of last week has been most favorable for preventing the locusts from
                        settling long enough to deposit eggs, and though the in- habitants are
                        searching most diligently wher- ever their flights have been seen, none so
                        far have been discovered except at Zawiet el Gadama.</p>

                    <p>CAIRO STREET NUISANCES A correspondent writes :—"Many letters have of late
                        been written to the newspapers by Cairenes complaining of the noise which
                        prevails in the streets of the city almost con- tinuously throughout the
                        night The disturb- ance complained of is chiefly caused by noisy Berboreen
                        who, after regaling themselves at their favourite cafes to counteract the
                        effect of the day’s work, make their way homewards at an early hour of the
                        morning singing, shouting, and often quarrelling. One group of these noisy
                        Berboreen follows another with but short interval, some with and some
                        without musical instruments, and the peaceful inhabitant only falls asleep
                        to be re-awakened time after time. After the last of these noisy groups has
                        passed one may perhaps be able to indulge in a short hour’s sleep, when the
                        beating of carpets close at hand or the hideous yell of some hawker in the
                        streets below robs one of all further chance of rest</p>
                    <p>"To expect that the shawish should stop these noises on his own initiative is
                        to expect too much, for the native policeman never notices a noise; he lives
                        in an atmosphere of it, it never disturbs him, and as often as not he
                        creates or greatly adds to it in the carry- ing out of his duties. The
                        necessary step to be taken to put a stop to such disturbances is for the
                        police authorities to issue spexial instructions to the polixe to arrest
                        anyone singing or shouting in the streets during the night, and should
                        complaints continue to be made, to punish in some way the shawish in charge
                        of the quarter from which the complaint comes. Notice should also be given
                        to house- holders that the beating of carpets at an hour when the city is
                        supposed to sleep, is creating a public disturbance for which they are
                        liable to be summoned.</p>

                    <p>HIGH CAPACTIY BOGIE WAGONS FOR EGYPT In the evolution of modem Egypt, with
                        its many conflicting interests and influences, changes in the types of
                        rolling stock have been frequent, and the result has been that the types
                        used are often strangely assorted. Little by little, however, the rolling
                        stock is beginning to sort itself out into distinct types,and the rapid
                        increase in the requirements of the country have brought hume the fact to
                        the authorities that the best is the cheapest in the long run. Quite
                        recently the Leeds Forge Company delivered to Alexandria six each of two
                        types of “high capacity” coal and grain bogie wagons. As the Egyptian
                        Railways have just placed a further order for thirty of each of these types,
                        it is quite clear that they may be looked upon as the standard wagons for
                        handling coal,grain, and kindred products on a large scale on the more
                        important lines, at all events, of Lower Egypt. It should be noted, however,
                        that with regard to the covered wagons, the repeat order provides for an
                        extra 18 ins. in the height of the roof. One of the types is a thirty-ton
                        coal wagon, with a length over buffers of 37 ft. and a height from rail
                        level of 7ft. 6ins. The inside dimensions are :—Length, 34 ft ; width, 8 ft
                        9 ins. ; and depth, 4 ft., which gives a cubic capacity of 1,185 ft It has a
                        tare of 12 tons 18 oats., which gives a ratio of tare to the gross load of
                        rather over 30 per cent</p>
                    <p>The other type is a thirty-ton covered wagon, destined more particularly for
                        carrying grain and kindred goods. The length over buffers is 87 ft and i in.

                    <p>AMONG THE NIAM-NIAMS A SUCCESSFUL EXPEDITION Khartoum.—The first detachment
                        of the Niam-Niam expedition, which has arrived at Khartoum, report that all
                        is quiet in the Southern part of the Bahr-el-Gazal. The whole trouble had
                        arisen from the opposition of an old chief, named Yambio, who opposed the
                        Government at every turn and influenced his sons and nephews and the chiefs
                        of all the tribes in his district More than once they attempted to ambush
                        some small detachments on duty, and the climax was reached in March, 1904,
                        when Captain Haynes was killed. An expedition was then despatched under the
                        command of Major Boulnois, and Yambio’s village was reached on February 7.
                        Every possible chance was given to Yambio to come in. He sent his son
                        Gangasa to palaver, but was afraid to come himself. After two days of
                        palavering by messenger, Lieutenant Fell, R. N., now inspector in the
                        province, was sent out to interview Yambio, who had by this time retired to
                        the extreme end of his village, six miles off. The old chief was evidently
                        acting treacherously, for a large force of spearmen was found in the
                        village, and his eldest son was stationed on the Yubbo to oppose the
                        advance. Lieutenant Fell offered to talk with Yambio If his men would lay
                        down their spears. This they agreed to do, but took them up again as soon as
                        our people approach- ed. On their doing this the second time, and after full
                        warning, two or three volleys were fired, and the enemy bolted. A couple of
                        days later some prisoners undertook to show Yambio’s hiding place. He was
                        surprised and caught and brought in by Captain Carter. It appeared that he
                        had been badly wounded in the wrist and knee. Everything was done to save
                        him, but either through shock or fear, he died the same afternoon.</p>

                    <p>THE EGYPTIAN QUESTION M.DE FREYCINET'S VIEWS A treatise on the Egyptian
                        question by M. de Freycinet is about to be published. The ex-Premier
                        recognises the magnitude of the work aooompliahed by England, but he"con-
                        siders that her domination over Egypt must sooner or later come to an end.
                        The Powers have done nothing to cut short the British occupation, but at the
                        same time they have not formally approved it From a legal point of view
                        England’s exceptional transitory po- sition, to use the late Marquis of
                        Salisbury's expression, remains unaltered. It is unaffected by the
                        Franoo-English Agreement of 1904. Europe may at any time bring up the
                        question and demand a settlement in conformity with equal rights.</p>
                    <p>M. de Freyoinet thinks, however, that Eng- land will eventually relinquish
                        Egypt sponta- neously in exchange for the full possession of the Sudan, so
                        that here undisputed sover- eignty would extend from the Second Cataraot to
                        Victoria Nyanza. He suggests that Germany’s apparent support of the British
                        claims in 1896 was inspired by a desire to perpetuate a source of friction
                        between France and England.</p>

                        dered a respectable place of entertainment ought to try to attract an
                        audience by such means. The Government in the interests of purity ought, if
                        it be prevented from putting a stop altogether to these entertainments in
                        virtue of the Capitulations, at least to let it be known that no officials
                        should attend a "Soifee Noire.” I regret to hear that some young
                        Anglo-Egyptian officials were present, but I can hardly believe this. Surely
                        the youthful English officials in the service of the Egyptian Government
                        could find a more improving way of spending an evening than in attending a

                            lateness of her arrival is directly due to the new clause in the
                            Australian Govern- ment Mail contract, which compels the ships to carry
                            a white crew in the stokehold as well as on deck. last year, with three
                            boilers and native stokers, these ships always arrived be- fore
                            daylight, and the "Ortona" yesterday, with four boilers and white men
                            below, lost 5 hours in 8 days' steaming.</p>

                    <head>The SUDAN' TO-DAY.</head>
                    <p> The author of “Pyramids, and Progress" has written another delightful work,
                        which is in I fact the best book yet published descriptive of the Egyptian
                        Sudan. “Skip the letter-press, the ; pictures will teach you all you need to
                        know,’’ is the author's own advice to his readers—yet ! he succeeds in
                        turning out books which is i-1 impossible to put down unfinished when once |
                        begun. With four, six, or eight illustrations to each page, he has here
                        presented a sort of sketch, alike of the antiquities and of the present
                        appearance of the Sudan, which leaves the most lively impression on the mind
                        of tho reader.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Ward’s book bears, in some respects, a semi-official character.“Lord
                        Kitohener asked me to dedicate the book to him,” says the author, “and this
                        compliment inspired me with a desire to do my best.” The distinguishing
                        feature is the illustrations. The work is literally crowded with
                        photographs, many hundreds in all, a large number of which are provided by
                        the present Sirdar and Lady Wingate, and others who have had the privilege
                        to penetrate into remote and strange regions. The most gruesome are those
                        representing the last stand of the Khalifa, reproduced from photographs of
                        Sir Reginald Wingate, showing in ghastly realism the dead bodies of the
                        leader and his sons and followers a few minutes after the conclusion of the
                        battle. The most satisfactory are those giving the pictures of the Sudan and
                        the work in its destruction, the “saner war” and “sweeter wars" against the
                        hostile forces of nature, in which lies the real test and triumph of the
                        work of civilization.</p>

                    <div type="item">
                        <head>THE LAND AND ITS FUTURE.</head>
                        <p> The description is exhaustive. Here is the journey to Khartoum, its
                            temples and monu- ments visible along the voyage. Then follows the
                            history in outline of the reconquest. The new cities are described
                            springing up on the land of so many great and terrible memories, the
                            Omdurman and Khartoum of to-day. Mr. Ward passes on to the interior in
                            its possi- bilities of irrigation, the encouragement of peaceful
                            agriculture, and especially sugges- tions for the control of the waters
                            of the Nile, and Sir William Garstin’s great scheme for utilising in the
                            service of man that which is now wasted.</p>
                        <p>At the end Mr. Ward takes his readers up into the remote heart of Africa,
                            through a really astonishing collection of illustrations, to the region
                            of the lakes and expeditions and ex- plorations hitherto unrecorded in
                            literature. The author, in visiting "Our Sudan,” which is almost as
                            large as Europe, and possesses nearly as many nationalities, was struck
                            with the gre.it exec .t and variety of the physical characteristics.
                            What was labelled "desert” in the maps frequently proved to be fertile
                            land. It was once cultivated, and can be tilled again when supplied with
                            irrigation. The land in many parts, he thinks, is admirably adapted for
                            cotton culture.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ward, in applying to his friends of the Government departments for
                            photographs, was almost overwhelmed with their kindness. "I thought to
                            make a selection,” he says, “but tj all were so good and many so
                            curious,represent- / ing places never depicted before, that I said I
                            ‘Let them all come.”' “The advice I give to ' people studying this
                            book,” is his genial com- ment, "is, Skip the letterpress; the illustra-
                            tions will teach you all jrou want to know." Among the most interesting
                            is the account of the tonr of Mr. Dupuis in Abyssinia and the
                            surrounding regions, with illustrations of a country hitherto unknown.
                            There are also accounts of the visits of the Governor-General to remote
                            provinces, where Sir Reginald Win- gate is shown “everywhere welcomed by
                            happy faces and hailed by chiefs and sheikhs and head men and village
                            people, especially by the fomale population, as their deliverer.” Kordo-
                            fan, hitherto almost iuaooessible, here yields up its secrets, and
                            Darfur will come next, “though at present it is impossible to get a
                            single illustration of that region.”</p>

                        <head>NAGA TEMPLE.</head>
                        <p> Mr. Ward supplies a much-needed account of the pyramids at Meroe and of
                            the temples at Naga and Solib, built by Egyptiauisiug longs of Ethiopia,
                            which we have looked for in vain elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>The author's description of the beautiful temple at Naga is set off by an
                            excellent photograph by Eimbashi Lord, R.E. Here is the description</p>
                        <p>But the chief object of interest here, is an exquisite little temple in
                            the classic style, quite a gem. It bears no inscription, but as it is
                            partially buried in the sand, scientific excavation may discover its
                            origin by careful search for a foundation deposit under the door sill,
                            or at the corners, as is so often found in Egyptian temples. We are told
                            that the Romans never settled so far south. Yet here we find undoubted
                            evidonce of Roman in- fluence with distinct Egyptian characteristics,
                            facing lions of Egyptian style, along with pilasters and arched opqnings
                            carved with what might be called Renaissance treatment I The date of the
                            latest buildings cannot be earlier than 200 A.D. while some structures
                            hore may possibly goback to 1,000 years B.(J. These ruins are ft puzzle
                            as to the period of their erection, that can only be solved by
                            scientific search. The danger is, that if not protected till the time
                            comes for legitimn’: inquiry, they are in such a crumbling con : tion
                            that ignorant dig- ging, or search for ti .sure, may destroy them
                            entirely. Several of these temples at Naga, though erected for Egyptian,
                            have been subse- quietly applied to Christian worship, as is shown by
                            the symbol of the cross which they tevr. One of them has been approached
                            by an avenue of sheep, or lambs, of which several remain. This is
                            another Egyptian feature in architecture. The Egyptians had the sphinx
                            "OafStxUor IuPrmal4 4 ProgrtM.” Dy John Wt4. LsadSB i Job* Mam/. 111.

                            style but transformed he sphinxes into figures of the sacred Lamb.
                            Dnemichen carried the cross to the remotest corners of the Snd.-in, and
                            every shrine of the old faith had been converted to Christian
                            worship.</p>

                            ‘“les brave Beiges,’" says Mr. Ward, “do not seem to take our peaoeful
                            treatment of the natives as complimentary to their management of the
                            adjoining Congo State” Captain Bethell's description of a walk and a
                            visit in Bahr el Ghazal is incorporated in the narrative, and forms one
                            of the most interesting chapters.</p>

                        <p> A picture of the statue of Gordon in the principal square of the new
                            city forms the frontispiece to this book. The hero is represented on his
                            camel with all its native trappings correctly shown, just as he was wont
                            to start on his expeditions through the country. It was related in “Tho
                            Times” recently how one day a poor old black woman, who had been .a
                            prisoner of Gordon’s days, came back to Khartonm, and, soring the
                            statne, exclaimed: “God be praised, the pasha Gordou has come again!”
                            Here she had seated herself for an entire day—and she related how she
                            had sat long by his camel, and that still he would not look at her—he
                            who had never passed her without a kindly nod before. "Is he tired, or
                            what is it she said: but after many visits she came home glad at last,

                        <p> The author gives a pleasant picture of the life of the palace, and the
                            energy and devotion which is being thrown into the work of ex- ploration
                            and civilisation. The interior of the Palace is most charming in every
                            aspect I enjoyed many visits to it, thanks to its hospitable hosts, Sir
                            Reginald and Lady Wingate. The Sirdar’s wonderful collection of trophies
                            and relics of his long experience at the Intelligence Department are
                            well worth a journey to Khartonm to see. Every ; day some young officer
                            would arrive unexpect- edly, bringing news from the remoter pro- vinces,
                            and their keen interest in their duties added much to one’s pleasure.
                            All were so young, active, full of life, hope, and thorough enjoyment of
                            their profession. And when there was a gymkhana, and officers and men,
                            white, black, and yellow, all competed together in equality in splendid
                            efforts of field sports and military exercises, it was easy to tell how
                            the Egyptians and Sudanese had become each well-disciplined and
                            effective soldiers.</p>

                        <head>ZUBEIR PASHA.</head>
                        <p> There is an interesting account at the and of the serene old age of
                                <persName>Zubeir Pasha</persName>, once all powerful in this region,
                            whose name became the centre of many violent controversies. He is now
                            very old. He lives on his paternal estates, Geila near Khartonm, and is
                            a great agriculturist. He has laid aside all his old objectionable
                            habits, and is now a tall old man, rather good-looking, and very fond of
                            showing himself in his Pasha’s uniform at all functions, and never loses
                            a chance of potting in an appearance at the Palace. He appears thus in
                            several of tho photographs. Ho is now quite harmless, and his sympathy
                            with us, and antipathy to the Mahdi, joined to a unique knowledge of
                            every remote pro- vince, has made his friendship valuable. Sir Reginald
                            Wingate likes him, and most of those in power have a certain amount of
                            respect for the old, once powerful, Znbeir Pasha. Yet, when there was a
                            deputation of native chiefs, a few years ago, from the Bahr el Ghazal,it
                            was seen that the poor ‘ braves” trembled in every limb, and could
                            hardly be restrained from belt- ing when they saw their old enemy in
                            gold lace standing beside our governing powers—they feared we were all

                        <p> The natives are evidently not encouraged by officials to become
                            Christians, as the following story about Archdeacon Gwynn. the Chaplain
                            at Khartoum, and a would-be Chris tian shows-:— This man came to Mr.
                            Gwynne and asked him to admit him and his family into his church. Mr.
                            Gwynne said ho could not, as he was Government chaplain, and there was a
                            regulation against his doing so. The man went away sorrowful, for ho had
                            three daughters, and he wanted them to be Christians because, he said, a
                            woman had no life she could call her own under Islam. Of course by and
                            by when there is a public church he and his family may become Christians
                            if they so desire. Many other interesting extracts cooed easily be made,
                            but the above suffice to show the varied characteristics of this book,

                    <head>THE ARM AND HEART OF QUEEN ZER. A WARNING TO EGYPTOLOGISTS.</head>
                    <p> By Baroness de Malortie. Monsieur de Naville searches through Historic tombs
                        and temples too, With their faint dusty smell. His mind is fall of
                        Hatshepsut And all the things she did, and knew Deep in his besom dwell.</p>
                    <p>A cloudy moan looked down on Thebes, Where there were other pairs than these—
                        Like phantoms flitting by. T. Davis dressed in stars and stripes, Was
                        wandering on the distant heights, With his last find Queen Thy.</p>
                    <p>Professor Budge goes rather far In excavating Napata— Though hope his bosom
                        fills With aloes, cassia, spice and balm, And pre-historic robes of palm,
                        Beneath those stony hills.</p>
                    <p>At least we heard it Baid at ‘Queen's’ When basking mid the classic scenes Of
                        the Alma Mater A learned one gave ns the news Of Egypt, long before the
                        Jews— To C****r the Dictator.</p>
                    <p>He brought us from tho realms of Death, Fair spirits not of mortal breath,
                        Whispering their story. We heard the tinkling of their beads, The prancing
                        of their warriors' steeds Tales—of love and glory.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps their secrets they confessed, And why they lie so quaintly dressed In
                        faded garlands pale, And seem to point from amber palls To pine and crimson
                        on the walls That could unfold the tale.</p>
                    <p>As in the after dinner time Some gossiped over mellow wine, Within the
                        College Courts. Strange plans evolved before the eyes Of one we deemed, both
                        good and wise— And far away his thoughts.</p>
                    <p>He saw once more a waveless shore Where visions flitted as of yore Beneath
                        the starry host He breathed again—in spacious tombs, And tore the woof of
                        silken looms, The shroud of some poor ghost.</p>
                    <p>They say be did far more than this, On sealed brow e’en breathed a kiss In
                        ecstasy of mind. And clasped an arm, once soft and fair Though many a magic
                        charm was there, Held fast as gold could bind.</p>
                    <p>Poor little arm, thus cast away In some rough spoiler’s hurried day Who threw
                        you from the rest. And married tho dwelling of the Sonl By breaking up a
                        perfect whole How could yon then be blessed.</p>
                    <p>Part of a queen—so precious too— How little they had left of yon When
                        Flinders Petrie came, Who gently took the jeweled bands, Of fine gold chased
                        by skillful hands, And brought them forth to fame.</p>
                    <p>And at the back of those fair bands Were woven tiny fragile strands Of
                        softest human hair, Twisted about with golden thread The Amethyst and Royal
                        Hawk’s head— Turquoise and crystals rare.</p>
                    <p>’Neath centuries of yellow dost Great Mother Earth held you in trust Among
                        the Holy Dead. Swatched and wrapped in unguents rare The spirit still could
                        enter there Waiting Osiris dread.</p>
                    <p>But eh I what now remains to tell, The spoilers did their work so well, Then
                        Ages stole along. That silent land Time’ yet sleeps And over all the
                        sunlight sWeeps In everlasting song.</p>
                    <p>But he, the wise one, sat alone In that small cabin then his home That
                        floated on the Nile. Osiris—Isis—Horns there And many others gods less feir,
                        With their Egyptian Smile.</p>
                    <p>He saw them not, but heard a sigh That echoed as the wind swept by, Among
                        papyrus reed— He seemed to feel a presence there, Whore moonbeams fell
                        across his chair Upon the ‘Books’ dead creeds.</p>
                    <p>A feint voice said—“I cannot rest "Or ever join that throng so blest "But
                        wander everywhere "The issues of our life apart "Are sometimes gathered in
                        the heart "Mine—lies unburied there.</p>
                    <p>“Yes I in an alabaster jar, "Just where the rocky lintels are, "They hid it
                        in their fear, "Go place it ’neath the shaft of light, "That I may find it
                        in my flight, "Until that Day appear.</p>
                    <p>"It never more shall be disturbed, “When all the rites have been observed.
                        "Go—gentle stranger—go 1” The silver river, calm and deep Heard a man matter
                        in his sleep I thought it would be so —!</p>
                    <p>Alas ! that heart cannot be found Within the tomb, or on the ground. So lost,
                        an act of grace, A spirit hovers night and day About the boat, so sailors
                        say— , Of grave Professor Sayce !</p>

                    <p> “At I tayc a-thinking." Inguldsly. ' A few weeks ago it seemed to be a
                        settled thing that steps were to be taken forthwith ' to establish a Rescue
                        Home for girls in con nection with the movement ior the repression of the
                        “white slave traffic,” and it was an nounced that the Jewish community had 1
                        placed a suitable house at the disposal of the j recently formed
                        committee.</p>
                    <p>But alas 1 counsels of another order seem to * have prevailed, and the
                        executive committee f of the newly-formed body bas been informed *■ that the
                        proposed arrangement will not be carried out, and has been recommended to
                        arrange for the police to send to the Rudolph c Home any cases of an urgent
                        nature. One of t these, a Mohamedan girl from Turkey, has, t in fact, been
                        sheltered there for the past c fortnight.</p>
                    <p>Now the Rudolph is an institution having a very different mission to fulfil,
                        and moreover is a building ill-adapted for the re- t ception of these cases.
                        But it is carried on by o a man who is heart and soul devoted to this t good
                        woik, and is not to be easily turned t aside from any course to which he
                        resolves to t devote his energies, while the excellent lady i who is partner
                        in his life’s work is an ideal matron a home of the kind. n Perhaps no
                        better way out of the difficulty could be found than to make each
                        alterations ( in the Rudolph Home by means of additions, would render it
                        adaptable for the purpose for which it is proposed to use it; for surely the
                        willingness of both Mr. and Mrs. Rudolph to undertake these extra duties,
                        relieving the committee as it would of the necessity of providing a paid
                        matron for the proposed home, would be a matter of gTeat importance, ii And
                        for this willingness I can vouch. « ii In other respects, too, the idea
                        seems to be l one that is capable of being carried through. On 8 the side oi
                        the home facing the sea is a piece t of loud belonging to it which is not
                        yet built on, while the committee have in hand a sum ol £350 which they
                        intend to use for building v purposes.</p>
                    <p>This however would not be sufficient, and c would probably require to be
                        supplemented by another XoOU or £400, a matter that sorely should not
                        present any difficulty, seeing that the community that originally proposed
                        to provide the home is not as yet committed to any pecuniary liability in
                        the matter. The plan suggested by Mr. Rudolph would be to remove some of the
                        present temporary 1 outbuildings, and erect in their place, and on the
                        ground at present uncovered, a commo- dious dining-room and a dormitory,
                        while 1 above these could be built three, our, or five rooms, as required,
                        for the purposes of a Girls’ Home, the entrance to which would be quite 1
                        separate from that used by the frequenters of the Home.</p>
                    <p>I think that a proposal such as this deserves careful consideration. While it
                        is quite obvious Xthat no fiat could be hired for the purpose, on the other
                        hand a large house would be quite unsuitable, as no one expects that there
                        will be . many inmates at one time. Everyone too would . be satisfied at the
                        few it would be necessary , to shelter from time to time being under the t
                        care of one who has proved himself so disin- terested a worker in the cause
                        of humanity as Mr. Rudolph.</p>
                    <p>Though the matter is perhaps one more for private than public arrangement,
                        and its deci- sion one for the committees oonoerned, it is at the same time
                        one of great general interest, considering ail that has been written and
                        said on the subject of late, and as snch I have felt justified in
                        introducing it into my notes this week.</p>
                    <p>I have just been reading that very remark- able little book written in prison
                        by Oscar Wilde, and most appropriately entitled “De Profundis.” It is a
                        truly wonderful production, requiring much study in order to be fully
                        understood and appreciated.</p>
                    <p>As the reviewer says in the “Athenrenm" of April 1, “all the old
                        characteristics of the writer’s style are here, with a new one super-
                        added." And it is just this new one that is so remarkable and so difficult
                        to deal with.</p>
                    <p>I do not propose just now to go into an exhaustive analysis of Wilde’s book,
                        containing as it does so many gems of the purest water, while it also
                        embodies much that at first sight appears objectionable and grates on the
                        feol- ings, although the more it is studied the more apparent does it become
                        that a deeper moaning is intended than that which appears on the
                        surface.</p>
                    <p>But perhaps few tilings in the book are more suggestive to the truth-seeker
                        than the following extracts, and they enforce a lesson of "At Christmas I
                        managed to get hold of a Greek Testament, and every morning, after I had
                        cleaned my cell and polished my tins, I read a little of the Gospels, a
                        dozen verses taken by chance anywhere.............. Endless repetition, in
                        and out of season, has spoiled for us the freshness, the naïveté, the simple
                        romantic charm of the Gospels. We hear them read far too often and far too
                        badly, and all repetition iB anti-spiritual. When one returns to the Greek,
                        it is like going into a garden of lilies out of some dark and narrow house.
                        And to me the pleasure is doubled by the reflection that it is extremely
                        probable that we have the actual terms, the ipsissima verba, used by
                        Christ”</p>
                    <p>I have never liked the idea that we knew of Christ’s own words only through a
                        transla- tion of a translation. It is a delight to me to think that as far
                        as his conversation was con- cerned, Cbarmides might have listened to him,
                        and Socrates reasoned with him, and Plato understood him."</p>
                    <p>How a translation of a translation may alter the text,'and how greatly the
                        meaning of the original may be changed, is clearly shown in the following
                        illustration, which appeared in the "Combill Magazine” for June 1899.It is
                        all the more remarkable in that re-translations into the original English
                        were made in each instance, so that in no case was a translation made from
                        one foreign language to another. The following lines were first translated
                        into Greek :— “ I heard that S. would write my life When I gave np my breath
                        ; I felt indeed that this would add A new delight to death.” The Greek
                        version' was then re translated into English by a second expert, whose
                        render- ing was then turned into Latin by another, and after re-translation
                        was successively trans- lated into French, German and Persian, the same
                        method of procedure being followed throughout.</p>
                    <p>The final re-translation gave the following version of the original text:—
                        He. Dear, in my song you still shall live Though under earth yon lio ; She.
                        Ah ! had you now that grace to give I should not need to die.</p>
                    <p>"De Profundis” would be a valuable book, if only for the reminder it gives us
                        that the utmost care is necessary in accepting transla- tions of so called
                        infallible writings of old. Translators are by no means infallible, and
                        revision is from time to time deemed to be necessary, but be the body of
                        revisors ever so learned, the very revision itself shows that the new light
                        which is continually being thrown on things of old renders adaptation to
                        modem and more advanced thought to be imperatively necessary.</p>

                    <head>ORIGIN OF RIGHTHANDEDNESS. </head>
                    <p>The question why the majority of persons use the right hand with greater
                        skill than the left has never been solved definitely. Dr. George M Gould of
                        Philadelphia, has been specially studying the problem, and, writing in the
                        "Popular Science Monthly," he says he believes that right handedness is so
                        thoroughly ingratiated in human nature that it must have been partially
                        developed in the savage an cestors of the race. Primitive man, in his
                        opinion, must have felt a definite need for the exercise of his right hand
                        in preference to his left; and that necessity must have been re- cognized
                        and obeyed for a long period continuously. The impulse could not well have
                        dictated his habits in eating, for knives and forks are of recent origin,
                        the modern gnn had not been invented, and writing was practically unknown.
                        Moreover, in such operations as chipping arrows weaving baskets, and wield-
                        ing clubs,bows and arrows, it could not have mattered much which hand was
                        employed. When warfare had been carried to such a stage of advancement as to
                        involve the use of a shield however that object was probably held on the
                        left side in order to protect the heart. Then as a matter of convenienve the
                        right arm was left free for the more active function of fighting with spear
                        and sword and with habitual exercise came special skill. An attendant
                        phenomenon was a finer organisation of that particular centre in the brain
                        which controlled these movements and which was situated in the left half of
                        the organ. With an increased use of the left hand Dr Gould thinks there must
                        have been greater demande upon the right eye, because vision must precede
                        the order to strike, or to give peaceful signals. In this way there may have
                        been developed a keenor power of vision in the right eye than in the left.
                        Dr Gould assumes that there was and declares that righthanded people are
                        right eyed and that in their brains the centre of vision is on the left side
                        in close proximity to that governing the right arm.</p>

                    <head>EUROPEAN V AMERICAN MANNERS</head>
                    <p>The more familiar an impartial observer may be. with the social usages and
                        habits of Great Britain and of the Continent of Europe, the less en photic,
                        says Mr. Brander Matthews in the "New York Tribune,” will be his feeling
                        that the foreign standard is really superior to American ; and the more
                        inclined he will be to explain away certain apparent disadvantages of onr
                        attitude as the price we pay for what we hold in high esteem—equality and
                        demo- cracy, manliness and self-respect</p>
                    <p>The American theory of manners, if one may attempt to formulate its basis, is
                        founded cot on any artificial distinctions of social position, but on the
                        simple relation of man to man. In Europe bad manners, whether of the upper
                        or the lower classes generally spring from a lack of sympathy. Iu America,
                        bad manners are caused by want of thought rather than by lack of feeling.
                        They are the result of carelessness more than of wilfulness. The American is
                        so busy minding his own business that he has no time to be as regardful of
                        the rights of others as he knows he ought to be. He does not mean to be
                        rude, and if his attention is called to it he mends his manners, if only for
                        the moment.</p>
                    <p>The American is profoundly good-natured— and good nature is an integral
                        element of good manners. The carnival gaiety of an election- night crowd in
                        any American city, no matter how bitter may have been the preceding can-
                        vass, finds no parallel in any other country in the world ; it is an
                        expression of that good- hnmoured toleration which is a chief charac-
                        teristic of the American people, and which every intelligent foreigner notes
                        almost imme- diately upon his arrival.</p>

                        of age, and now I am 54. 0ve When quite a young man I had to walk with |m|
                        cratches or sticks. This went on for over 0[a| three years, and since that
                        time I have never jjne been properly free from the rheumatism, and den never
                        so franc as I am at the present time, since upc using Doan’s Pills.</p>
                    <p>During those 34 years I had several severe ju , attacks of this terrible
                        rheumatism. The one -j in October of 1897, when I was living in Wednesday,
                        was, I think, the severest attack ^ I ever had; it kept me in my bed for 10
                        months, and I became as helpless as a new-born babe. oaf I was attended by
                        one of the best doctors, bnt ^ he seemed unable to do me much good, although
                        ho told me more than once that if I had been a millionaire he could not have
                        tried ^ harder—and I believe him.</p>
                    <p>In March of 1899 I was kept from business . for 17 mouths again with
                        rheumatism and , kidney trouble. There were severe pains in . my back and
                        sides (especially the left side); ,10 my appetite became poor, and I didn’t
                        relish the food I was able to eat There was a nasty 0 . taste in my month,
                        no matter what I ate or drank, and I couldn’t keep my food down. 1 1 Even a
                        pipe of tobacco seemed to go against W£ me, and I became despondent and
                        miserable, mc feeling that life was not worth living. But there was worse to
                        follow : not long 061 after. I began to bo troubled with the kidney
                        secretions, the pain in passing being almost ‘D(.C unbearable at times.
                        There was also a sedi- . ment from the urine. These distressing com- plaints
                        kept getting worse and worse as “ months went by, until one day I couldn’t
                        pass . the urine at all; I was in suoh a terrible “l condition at the time
                        that I thought my race 061 was nearly run.</p>
                    <p>It was then that I heard about Doan’s . Backache Kidney Pills, and they were
                        spoken so highly of that I determined to try them. After I had taken a few
                        boxes I felt easier, and now that I have taken ten boxes I feel quite free
                        from any sign of rheumatism or kidney trouble. I am a new man to what I was,
                        thanks to your Doan's Backache Kidney Pills. They are indeed worth their
                        weight in gold.</p>

                        health and strength, I remain</p>

                    <head>THE STATE RAILWAYS BY "TRAFFIC" (THIRD ARTICLE)</head>
                    <p> The great problem that the Administration of the Egyptian State Railways has
                        to solve is that of the growth of traffic, and it is one that divides itself
                        into many subordinate problems, each requiring elaborate study, special
                        know- ledge, and far-seeing judgment. As it is on the increase of the
                        traffic that the success of a railway system depends for its financial and
                        general reccess, it is obviously the first duty of the administration to see
                        that everything that can be done is done to promote it. For this duty the
                        Commission has made no adequate provisions, apparently ignoring the fact
                        that it is one that demands, on the part of the official to whom it is
                        entrusted, very special ability as well as an intimate knowledge of the
                        country, its trade and commerce, its people, their habits and customs, and
                        many other factors. Under the system of administra- tion that I have
                        sketched this would be the work of the General Manager, whose opinions and
                        decisions, having been revised or approved by the Council, would be carried
                        out by the various departments concerned. Thus it would rest with the
                        Traffic Manager to propose and carry out necessary modifications of the
                        existing traffic arrangements, suggest addi- tional trains, or other methods
                        of meeting the demands for increased accommodation, and in doing this he
                        might have to consult with the Way Department and Locomotive
                        Departments.</p>
                    <p>To the outsider the providing of extra train accommodation seems a simple
                        thing, but it is in reality very far from being so. We are constantly
                        hearing complaints of the over- crowding of the trains, and these are com-
                        monly accompanied by the question, “Why do they not ran more trains 1” and
                        “Why do they not pat on more carriages i" Well, to answer the latter
                        question first, to put on more carriages is not necessarily so simple a
                        matter as the public assume. More carriages mean more powerful engines,
                        increased stock of carriages, and possibly important alterations in the
                        arrangement of stations, etc. To in- crease the number of trains may not
                        only need some or all of these things, but may even necessitate the opening
                        of stations, or halts, the provision of new sidings and other elaborate and
                        expensive modifications of the line. The employment of larger engines may
                        demand the relaying of the whole of the line upon which they am to run, and
                        this might also be required by any considerable increase in the speed of
                        trains.</p>
                    <p>These are but a lew indications of the complicated nature of the problems
                        involved, but they are enough to show that these prob- lems can only be
                        effectively solved by very careful study on the part of thoroughly prac-
                        tical men, and that without the necessary study of all the factors, the
                        ablest experts can at best give nothing more than a mere guess as to what
                        would be the most advisable method of dealing with them.</p>
                    <p>It is important, too, that the fact should not be overlooked that the initial
                        cost of altera- tions and work intended to facilitate traffic is but a very
                        small item compared with the value of the results to be attained, even
                        though that initial expenditure may run into tens of thousands of pounds.
                        If, for example, A and B are two available methods of providing for
                        increased traffic, and we find that A' pounds spent upon A will give an
                        increase of one per cent on the present revenue, and that 6 X pounds spent
                        upon B will yield a five per cent, increase ; if other conditions do not
                        materially affect this result, it is not difficult to see that the
                        expenditure of the 6 X amount will in the end be by far the most economical.
                        Had Lord Farrer’s Commission kept this simple fact in mind, it would not, in
                        all probability, have been so hasty to condemn the Electro-Pneu- matic
                        Signalling installation at Cairo, for if this be effectively carried out it
                        should, by the inoreased security it will give and the facility it will
                        provide for the rapid and effective handling of a largely increased traffic,
                        ultimate- ly prove one of the wisest and most economical investments the
                        Administration has made. There are many other points that one might deal
                        with at some length but space forbids Enough I think has been said to show
                        that it would be a great mistake to accept the Report of the Commision as
                        either an adequate critcism of the Railway Administration or as a
                        satisfactory solution of any ot the problems involved. Indeed its criticism
                        of the signaling arrangements prove conclusively that the Commission did not
                        exercise that care in the acquistion of facts that it should have used if it
                        desired its opinion to be accepted as well reasoned and well founded.</p>

                    <p>L’Affaire Stagna-Salinas Ce matin, k l’audienco civile du tribunal, prd aide
                        par Mr. Beman, a dissented la cause Stagni contra Salinas Bar la question
                        d’exe- quatur par lea tribunaux mixtes da jogoment. et de l’arrfit
                        rendusparla jaridiction Italienne. Me Palagi a soutenu, an nom de M.M. St-i-
                        qui, que les jugements des tribunaux Consnlaires sont toujoure oxdcutoire3
                        par les tribunaux mixtes; qae, par suite, il n’y a pas k apprdcicr le mdrite
                        du jugement du tribunal consulaire; que la Cour d’Ancfine a compdtemment
                        statud puisqae c’est d’elle que relaient les décisions des tribunaux
                        Consulaires d'Orient, qu’au fond il n’y a pas de contradiction entre le
                        dispositif de l’arrfit de la Cour d'AncOne et celui de la Cour mixte, ce
                        dernier arrfit ayant rdsilid le contrat de la National Bank, mais non celui
                        de la maison Salinas.</p>
                    <p>Me Padua Bey, pour la maison Salinas, a répondu qu’il ressort de l’arrfit de
                        la Cour mixte qu'elle seule était compétente; done, le tribunal ne pent que
                        constater l’incompdtetice de la Cour d’An cone; done l’arrfit de cette
                        dernière Cour ne pent fière exécutoire par le3 • tribunaux mixtes.</p>
                    <p>Au fond la question était de savoir s'il y avait légalement un seul contrat,
                        comme le soutenait Salinas, ou deux contrats, comme le soutenait Stagni; la
                        Cour mixte a jugfi qu’il n’y avait qu'un seal contrat, qu’elle ne devait
                        dono prononcer qu’ttne rfisiliation. Au surplus, Stagni avait demands
                        subsidiairement k la Cour Mixte qu'ello lui accordkt ce que lui avait
                        accords la Cour d’Ancdne ; il a 6t6 formellement dfiboutfi de cette demande
                        ; la contradiction dans les dispositifs est, par suite, anssi precise que
                        dans les motifs. Quant aux jugements consulaires, ils ne peuvent fitre
                        exficutfis par l’autorito mixte que lorsqu’ils ont dtd rendus complètement,
                        ce qui n’est pas le cas ; du reste, un jugement frappd d’appel s’absorbe
                        dans l’arrfit qui le suit; on ne comprendrait pas qu’un jugement con- fined
                        pftt fitre exdoutoire alore que l'arret con- firmatif ne le serait pas.

                        Karnak un nombre conside- rable d'objets. On a mis au jour 457 statuette* et
