                    <p>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</p>
                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
                        vitality—vigour--</p>
                    <p>VITAL STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY</p>
                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night
                        succeeds the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the
                        celebrated life-reviving tonic</p>
                    <p>THERAPION No.3</p>
                    <p>than by any other known combination. So surely as it is taken in accordance

                        restored,</p>

                    <p>and a new existence imparted in place of what had so lately seemed worn-out,
                        "used up,” and valueless. This wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and
                        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative
                        essence, which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had
                        preceded it for this wide-spread and numerous class of human ailments.</p>

                        <p>Whether the Czar continue the war to the point of exhaustion, or, to use
                            Moltke’a tremendous phrase, till Russia is "blanched or whether, making
                            peace or a long truce, he betakes himself to the reorganization of
                            Russia, for which he has scarcely the mental power, the weight of Russia
                            in international politics must for twenty years be grievously
                            diminished. Her real policy for the last half century has been to lay
                            trains for future expansion, and that policy, if her present Government
                            survives, must for a generation at least be suspended. Revolution, it is
                            true, might pour new blood through her exhausted veins, and make her
                            once more a formidable fighting power; bat failing revolution, her
                            Government must devote itself to the reorganisation of the Army, the
                            settlement of the terrible agrarian question, the concession of personal
                            liberty, and the restoration of the national fortune. On every side the
                            mast be passive, as France was after Sedan, and during that passive
                            period there will be changed of attitude in every one of tho many States
                            which she threatens, or upon which she impinges. Her word, for example,
                            will no longer be final at Pekin. Whether the vast Empire of China
                            passes under Japanese leadership, or accepts Anglo-Saxon guidance, or is
                            ruled by the great Vioeroys of the Sonth, the dominance of Russia, which
                            has been in the way of every "improvement," from the reorganisation of
                            the Army to the construction of arterial railways and the exploitation
                            of mineral wealth, will be for a period at an end. The half-dozen men
                            who in Pekin continuously guide the Throne have been possessed with the
                            fear that, if Russia wore defied, she would exert her military force,
                            and termin ate at once the traditions and the profits ol the Manohu
                            dynasty. Relieved of that preoccupation, they must commence some new
                            course, be it reform as Europe understands reform, or a stronger
                            centralisation, or sub mission to some Power or combination of Powers
                            not animated by the Russian spirit or seeking Russian objects, which
                            would involve radical change in all Chinese political methods. The
                            straggle for the greatest market left in the world is certain to
                            contiijuo, hut it will continue without the interference of the Power
                            which has hitherto secretly settled all the conditions of the race. This
                            of itself is a great change, and it is only one amongst many. There are
                            many indications at Constantinople that Turkey, relieved for the moment
                            from the pressure of her secular foe, is tempted to trust once more to
                            the old policy of violence, which at heart Pashas believe to be the only
                            one worthy of the children of the faith. The Divan may cease to
                            diplomatist, and may strike at Bulgaria, at Greece, at its own rebels in
                            Macedonia and Albania, with armies, and if it strikes with effect, will
                            strike to slaughter and to enslave. That would in the end bring down on
                            Turkey the forces of civilization, and as those forces must have an
                            agent, the actual work of expelling her from Europe must fall to
                            Austria, who hopes always for Salonicaaud a new trade, aided perhaps by
                            Italy. Russia will rage at the thought of losing her predominance in the
                            Balkans; but if Russia is paralyzed, only Germany can interfere, and
                            Germany is much more likely to bargain for her there of the spoil. No
                            doubt also the vigour of Germany will be increased by a farther debacle,
                            for she will be relieved from that fear of invasion from two sides which
                            ever since 1875 has been the controlling factor of her policy and her
                            legisla- tion. Her Government mast, for example, attend more sincerely
                            to the protests of her people against heavier taxation ; she may find in
                            her savings on the Army the means of perfecting her Fleet; and she will
                            find the desire of her people for greater freedom and lighter discipline
                            increased by the temporary extinction of that dread which has made her
                            organization as a barrack seem even to her intellectuals a necessary
                            misfortune. As for France, her only course is to exchange her alliance
                            with Russia for an alliance with Great Britain, and try to become the
                            motive-power of a combination of herself, Great Britain, and America,
                            which should steadily seek to secure the liberty of the nations and the
                            general peace of the world. Even our own country, apart from this
                            alliance, which grows naturally out of the entente cordiale, will b£
                            greatly affected by the suspension of ambition in Russia. She will be
                            comparatively free from the fear of a European coalition, and will be
                            released from that preoccupation—the danger of an invasion of India from
                            the North—which has lain at the root of many of her difficulties in the
                            reorganization of national detente. Her only dangerous land frontier—for
                            America does not wish to obtain Canada by conqueet— is that of India,
                            and it will be for many years, as it wore, protected instead of assailed
                            by the huge but necessarily motionless mass in the North.</p>
                        <p>Many of these conseqnenoes may be slow in developing themselves, bat they
                            must, we think, follow if Russia is seriously beaten without being
                            completely revolution. If, on the other hand, she is revolutionized, as
                            so many expect, the result of defeat may be very different, though at
                            least as important to the world. A free Russia, whether under a new
                            dynasty or the old one chastened by a terrible experience, will still
                            contain one hundred and fifty millions of white men, all full of belief
                            in the destiny of the Slav race, and still debarred from free or easy
                            access to the waters of the World. Russia, rilled in accordance with her
                            popular instincts, may—indeed, must—abandon the dream of dominating the
                            Pacific; bat it would be to throw herself more earnestly, and therefore
                            successfully, into plans for forcing an entrance into the Mediterranean,
                            her natural outlet, tho economic strength of Russia lying in her
                            Southern provinces, and obtaining, perhaps by purobase.au ioe-frte
                            entrance into tho Atlantic. There is a possibility of half-a dozen wars
                            in those two projects ; yet it is certain that if Russians were
                            Englishmen, or Prenohmen, or Germans, those are the two which would in-
                            fluence every popular agitator. They would never consent to sit down
                            imprisoned ; and wo cannot conceive why the enormous and stead- ily
                            multiplying Slav race, when once it has released itself from internal
                            oppression, should be expected to sit down either. Those however, are
                            the questions and dangers of tho future. Por the moment tho paralysis of
                            Russia must release China, Turkey, Germany, and Gioat Britain from
                            enormous pressure, must solidify the entente cordiale with France, and
                            ought, therefore, to give humanity a respite from its person banned
                            truce. It may not, for there is a black cloud gathering in European
                            Turkey - perhaps too in Moroco—but if diplomacy lies any executive
                            power—has, that is, the power of making dynasties and peoples act
                            reason* ably towards each other—it ought.</p>

                                    between Colonel D. F. Lewis and Colonel J. P. Lewis, and that
                                    all will be made right when the June “Army List” appears. The
                                    explanation was necessary, for in the "Army List” for May not
                                    only is the name of Colonel D. F. Lewis con- supicuous by its

                                    distinctly said that he is "attached to the Japanese army.”</p>

                                <p>THE LOCUST PLAGUE APPEARANCE IN MINISH. A telegram received from
                                    Minieh Province yesterday reports the discovery of deposits of
                                    fresh locust eggs at Zawiet el Gadsma, Magha- gha Marks z, on
                                    the east bank of the Nile. The necessary steps are being taken
                                    to destroy (hem and to search for similar deposits. Mr. Melville
                                    is acting as inspector of Minieh pro- vince, and is being
                                    assisted by Mr. Charman in Beni Mazar and by Capt. Wilkinson in
                                    Abou Ghirgis Markaz.</p>
                                <p>Although a considerable number of locusts have been observed in
                                    Upper Egypt since May 13 they are not in anything like the
                                    quantities that arrived last year, and it appears that only a
                                    certain number are being carried across, probably from Arabia,
                                    by the recent S. and S. E. wind. The prevailing strong N. wind
                                    of last week has been most favorable for preventing the locusts
                                    from settling long enough to deposit eggs, and though the in-
                                    habitants are searching most diligently wher- ever their flights
                                    have been seen, none so far have been discovered except at

                                <p>CAIRO STREET NUISANCES A correspondent writes :—"Many letters
                                    have of late been written to the newspapers by Cairenes
                                    complaining of the noise which prevails in the streets of the
                                    city almost con- tinuously throughout the night The disturb-
                                    ance complained of is chiefly caused by noisy Berboreen who,
                                    after regaling themselves at their favourite cafes to counteract
                                    the effect of the day’s work, make their way homewards at an
                                    early hour of the morning singing, shouting, and often
                                    quarrelling. One group of these noisy Berboreen follows another
                                    with but short interval, some with and some without musical
                                    instruments, and the peaceful inhabitant only falls asleep to be
                                    re-awakened time after time. After the last of these noisy
                                    groups has passed one may perhaps be able to indulge in a short
                                    hour’s sleep, when the beating of carpets close at hand or the
                                    hideous yell of some hawker in the streets below robs one of all
                                    further chance of rest</p>
                                <p>"To expect that the shawish should stop these noises on his own
                                    initiative is to expect too much, for the native policeman never
                                    notices a noise; he lives in an atmosphere of it, it never
                                    disturbs him, and as often as not he creates or greatly adds to
                                    it in the carry- ing out of his duties. The necessary step to be
                                    taken to put a stop to such disturbances is for the police
                                    authorities to issue spexial instructions to the polixe to
                                    arrest anyone singing or shouting in the streets during the
                                    night, and should complaints continue to be made, to punish in
                                    some way the shawish in charge of the quarter from which the
                                    complaint comes. Notice should also be given to house- holders
                                    that the beating of carpets at an hour when the city is supposed
                                    to sleep, is creating a public disturbance for which they are
                                    liable to be summoned.</p>

                                <p>ZAGZIG NOTES (FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT) Zagzig, Thursday. The
                                    cotton worm has appeared on some lands in the Sharkieh Province.
                                    The Ministry of the Interior has already appointed some
                                    officials to destroy the eggs, but more officials are
                                    wanted.</p>
                                <p>The clover worm is prevalent on the Khartema lands near the
                                    Ismailieh Canal. The Moudirieh is taking measures to destroy the
                                    pest. Yesterday afternoon two carts laden with onions,were run
                                    over by a train while crossing the railway line by El Mina. The
                                    carts were broken and the four horses were horribly mangled. The
                                    police arrested the engine river. A private carriage belonging
                                    to Count Shedid, a Coptio notable with a European title, ran
                                    over a native woman. The poiioe arrested the coachman and are
                                    investigating the matter.</p>

                                <p>HIGH CAPACTIY BOGIE WAGONS FOR EGYPT In the evolution of modem
                                    Egypt, with its many conflicting interests and influences,
                                    changes in the types of rolling stock have been frequent, and
                                    the result has been that the types used are often strangely
                                    assorted. Little by little, however, the rolling stock is
                                    beginning to sort itself out into distinct types,and the rapid
                                    increase in the requirements of the country have brought hume
                                    the fact to the authorities that the best is the cheapest in the
                                    long run. Quite recently the Leeds Forge Company delivered to
                                    Alexandria six each of two types of “high capacity” coal and
                                    grain bogie wagons. As the Egyptian Railways have just placed a
                                    further order for thirty of each of these types, it is quite
                                    clear that they may be looked upon as the standard wagons for
                                    handling coal,grain, and kindred products on a large scale on
                                    the more important lines, at all events, of Lower Egypt. It
                                    should be noted, however, that with regard to the covered
                                    wagons, the repeat order provides for an extra 18 ins. in the
                                    height of the roof. One of the types is a thirty-ton coal wagon,
                                    with a length over buffers of 37 ft. and a height from rail
                                    level of 7ft. 6ins. The inside dimensions are :—Length, 34 ft ;
                                    width, 8 ft 9 ins. ; and depth, 4 ft., which gives a cubic
                                    capacity of 1,185 ft It has a tare of 12 tons 18 oats., which
                                    gives a ratio of tare to the gross load of rather over 30 per
                                    cent</p>
                                <p>The other type is a thirty-ton covered wagon, destined more
                                    particularly for carrying grain and kindred goods. The length
                                    over buffers is 87 ft and i in. The height from rail level to
                                    top of roof at centre is 10 ft 2 J ins. The inside dimensions
                                    are Length, 34 ft ; width, 8 ft. 9 ins. ; and depth, 6 ft 4
                                    13-16 ins., which gives a cubic capacity of 1,900 ft It has a
                                    tare of 14 tons 1} oats., which gives a ratio of tare to tho
                                    gross load of just under 32 per cent The covered wagons are
                                    fitted with two sliding doors on each side, these doors having a
                                    width of 4ft 9} ins., and a height of 5 ft 10} ins. The under
                                    frames are of the Fox's patent com- pressed steel type. The
                                    bogie centre castings are provided with exceptionally large
                                    wearing surfaces on account of the sand and dust so prevalent in
                                    Egypt. The wheels have a diame- ter on the tread of 2 ft 9 ins.,
                                    a wheel base of 5 ft 6 ins., and the distance between bogie
                                    centres is 23 ft</p>
                                <p>The Leeds Forge Company, in addition to the above, have on order
                                    for the Egyptian State Railways thirty bogie platform wagons
                                    with steel floors, but without sides and ends, and ten
                                    thirty-ton oil tank wagons. All of these will be fitted with
                                    under-frames and bogies similar in construction and dimensions
                                    to those above described.</p>

                                <p>AMONG THE NIAM-NIAMS A SUCCESSFUL EXPEDITION Khartoum.—The first
                                    detachment of the Niam-Niam expedition, which has arrived at
                                    Khartoum, report that all is quiet in the Southern part of the
                                    Bahr-el-Gazal. The whole trouble had arisen from the opposition
                                    of an old chief, named Yambio, who opposed the Government at
                                    every turn and influenced his sons and nephews and the chiefs of
                                    all the tribes in his district More than once they attempted to
                                    ambush some small detachments on duty, and the climax was
                                    reached in March, 1904, when Captain Haynes was killed. An
                                    expedition was then despatched under the command of Major
                                    Boulnois, and Yambio’s village was reached on February 7. Every
                                    possible chance was given to Yambio to come in. He sent his son
                                    Gangasa to palaver, but was afraid to come himself. After two
                                    days of palavering by messenger, Lieutenant Fell, R. N., now
                                    inspector in the province, was sent out to interview Yambio, who
                                    had by this time retired to the extreme end of his village, six
                                    miles off. The old chief was evidently acting treacherously, for
                                    a large force of spearmen was found in the village, and his
                                    eldest son was stationed on the Yubbo to oppose the advance.
                                    Lieutenant Fell offered to talk with Yambio If his men would lay
                                    down their spears. This they agreed to do, but took them up
                                    again as soon as our people approach- ed. On their doing this
                                    the second time, and after full warning, two or three volleys
                                    were fired, and the enemy bolted. A couple of days later some
                                    prisoners undertook to show Yambio’s hiding place. He was
                                    surprised and caught and brought in by Captain Carter. It
                                    appeared that he had been badly wounded in the wrist and knee.
                                    Everything was done to save him, but either through shock or
                                    fear, he died the same afternoon.</p>

                                <p>THE EGYPTIAN QUESTION M.DE FREYCINET'S VIEWS A treatise on the
                                    Egyptian question by M. de Freycinet is about to be published.
                                    The ex-Premier recognises the magnitude of the work aooompliahed
                                    by England, but he"con- siders that her domination over Egypt
                                    must sooner or later come to an end. The Powers have done
                                    nothing to cut short the British occupation, but at the same
                                    time they have not formally approved it From a legal point of
                                    view England’s exceptional transitory po- sition, to use the
                                    late Marquis of Salisbury's expression, remains unaltered. It is
                                    unaffected by the Franoo-English Agreement of 1904. Europe may
                                    at any time bring up the question and demand a settlement in
                                    conformity with equal rights.</p>
                                <p>M. de Freyoinet thinks, however, that Eng- land will eventually
                                    relinquish Egypt sponta- neously in exchange for the full
                                    possession of the Sudan, so that here undisputed sover- eignty
                                    would extend from the Second Cataraot to Victoria Nyanza. He
                                    suggests that Germany’s apparent support of the British claims
                                    in 1896 was inspired by a desire to perpetuate a source of
                                    friction between France and England.</p>

                                    Nouveautds Theatre here. Why the police allow such exhibitions I
                                    do not know, for they are a disgrace to Cairo, and no theatre
                                    that has any claim to be consi- dered a respectable place of
                                    entertainment ought to try to attract an audience by such means.
                                    The Government in the interests of purity ought, if it be
                                    prevented from putting a stop altogether to these entertainments
                                    in virtue of the Capitulations, at least to let it be known that
                                    no officials should attend a "Soifee Noire.” I regret to hear
                                    that some young Anglo-Egyptian officials were present, but I can
                                    hardly believe this. Surely the youthful English officials in
                                    the service of the Egyptian Government could find a more
                                    improving way of spending an evening than in attending a "Soirde

                                        "Ortona” arrived over 4 } hours late, and this in spite of
                                        perfect weather. I was informed on board that the lateness
                                        of her arrival is directly due to the new clause in the
                                        Australian Govern- ment Mail contract, which compels the
                                        ships to carry a white crew in the stokehold as well as on
                                        deck. last year, with three boilers and native stokers,
                                        these ships always arrived be- fore daylight, and the
                                        "Ortona" yesterday, with four boilers and white men below,
                                        lost 5 hours in 8 days' steaming.</p>

                        <p>The SUDAN' TO-DAY. The author of “Pyramids, and Progress" has written
                            another delightful work, which is in I fact the best book yet published
                            descriptive of the Egyptian Sudan. “Skip the letter-press, the ;
                            pictures will teach you all you need to know,’’ is the author's own
                            advice to his readers—yet ! he succeeds in turning out books which is
                            i-1 impossible to put down unfinished when once | begun. With four, six,
                            or eight illustrations to each page, he has here presented a sort of
                            sketch, alike of the antiquities and of the present appearance of the
                            Sudan, which leaves the most lively impression on the mind of tho
                            reader.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ward’s book bears, in some respects, a semi-official character.“Lord
                            Kitohener asked me to dedicate the book to him,” says the author, “and
                            this compliment inspired me with a desire to do my best.” The
                            distinguishing feature is the illustrations. The work is literally
                            crowded with photographs, many hundreds in all, a large number of which
                            are provided by the present Sirdar and Lady Wingate, and others who have
                            had the privilege to penetrate into remote and strange regions. The most
                            gruesome are those representing the last stand of the Khalifa,
                            reproduced from photographs of Sir Reginald Wingate, showing in ghastly
                            realism the dead bodies of the leader and his sons and followers a few
                            minutes after the conclusion of the battle. The most satisfactory are
                            those giving the pictures of the Sudan and the work in its destruction,
                            the “saner war” and “sweeter wars" against the hostile forces of nature,
                            in which lies the real test and triumph of the work of civilization.</p>

                        <p>THE LAND AND ITS FUTURE. The description is exhaustive. Here is the
                            journey to Khartoum, its temples and monu- ments visible along the
                            voyage. Then follows the history in outline of the reconquest. The new
                            cities are described springing up on the land of so many great and
                            terrible memories, the Omdurman and Khartoum of to-day. Mr. Ward passes
                            on to the interior in its possi- bilities of irrigation, the
                            encouragement of peaceful agriculture, and especially sugges- tions for
                            the control of the waters of the Nile, and Sir William Garstin’s great
                            scheme for utilising in the service of man that which is now wasted.</p>
                        <p>At the end Mr. Ward takes his readers up into the remote heart of Africa,
                            through a really astonishing collection of illustrations, to the region
                            of the lakes and expeditions and ex- plorations hitherto unrecorded in
                            literature. The author, in visiting "Our Sudan,” which is almost as
                            large as Europe, and possesses nearly as many nationalities, was struck
                            with the gre.it exec .t and variety of the physical characteristics.
                            What was labelled "desert” in the maps frequently proved to be fertile
                            land. It was once cultivated, and can be tilled again when supplied with
                            irrigation. The land in many parts, he thinks, is admirably adapted for
                            cotton culture.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ward, in applying to his friends of the Government departments for
                            photographs, was almost overwhelmed with their kindness. "I thought to
                            make a selection,” he says, “but tj all were so good and many so
                            curious,represent- / ing places never depicted before, that I said I
                            ‘Let them all come.”' “The advice I give to ' people studying this
                            book,” is his genial com- ment, "is, Skip the letterpress; the illustra-
                            tions will teach you all jrou want to know." Among the most interesting
                            is the account of the tonr of Mr. Dupuis in Abyssinia and the
                            surrounding regions, with illustrations of a country hitherto unknown.
                            There are also accounts of the visits of the Governor-General to remote
                            provinces, where Sir Reginald Win- gate is shown “everywhere welcomed by
                            happy faces and hailed by chiefs and sheikhs and head men and village
                            people, especially by the fomale population, as their deliverer.” Kordo-
                            fan, hitherto almost iuaooessible, here yields up its secrets, and
                            Darfur will come next, “though at present it is impossible to get a
                            single illustration of that region.”</p>

                        <p>NAGA TEMPLE. Mr. Ward supplies a much-needed account of the pyramids at
                            Meroe and of the temples at Naga and Solib, built by Egyptiauisiug longs
                            of Ethiopia, which we have looked for in vain elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>The author's description of the beautiful temple at Naga is set off by an
                            excellent photograph by Eimbashi Lord, R.E. Here is the description</p>
                        <p>But the chief object of interest here, is an exquisite little temple in
                            the classic style, quite a gem. It bears no inscription, but as it is
                            partially buried in the sand, scientific excavation may discover its
                            origin by careful search for a foundation deposit under the door sill,
                            or at the corners, as is so often found in Egyptian temples. We are told
                            that the Romans never settled so far south. Yet here we find undoubted
                            evidonce of Roman in- fluence with distinct Egyptian characteristics,
                            facing lions of Egyptian style, along with pilasters and arched opqnings
                            carved with what might be called Renaissance treatment I The date of the
                            latest buildings cannot be earlier than 200 A.D. while some structures
                            hore may possibly goback to 1,000 years B.(J. These ruins are ft puzzle
                            as to the period of their erection, that can only be solved by
                            scientific search. The danger is, that if not protected till the time
                            comes for legitimn’: inquiry, they are in such a crumbling con : tion
                            that ignorant dig- ging, or search for ti .sure, may destroy them
                            entirely. Several of these temples at Naga, though erected for Egyptian,
                            have been subse- quietly applied to Christian worship, as is shown by
                            the symbol of the cross which they tevr. One of them has been approached
                            by an avenue of sheep, or lambs, of which several remain. This is
                            another Egyptian feature in architecture. The Egyptians had the sphinx

                            style but transformed he sphinxes into figures of the sacred Lamb.
                            Dnemichen carried the cross to the remotest corners of the Snd.-in, and
                            every shrine of the old faith had been converted to Christian
                            worship.</p>

                            square of the new city forms the frontispiece to this book. The hero is
                            represented on his camel with all its native trappings correctly shown,
                            just as he was wont to start on his expeditions through the country. It
                            was related in “Tho Times” recently how one day a poor old black woman,
                            who had been .a prisoner of Gordon’s days, came back to Khartonm, and,
                            soring the statne, exclaimed: “God be praised, the pasha Gordou has come
                            again!” Here she had seated herself for an entire day—and she related
                            how she had sat long by his camel, and that still he would not look at
                            her—he who had never passed her without a kindly nod before. "Is he
                            tired, or what is it she said: but after many visits she came home glad

                            most charming in every aspect I enjoyed many visits to it, thanks to its
                            hospitable hosts, Sir Reginald and Lady Wingate. The Sirdar’s wonderful

                            competed together in equality in splendid efforts of field sports and
                            military exercises, it was easy to tell how the Egyptians and Sudanese

                        <p>ZUBEIR PASHA. There is an interesting account at the and of the serene
                            old age of Znbeir Pasha, once all powerful in this region, whose name
                            became the centre of many violent controversies. He is now very old. He
                            lives on his paternal estates, Geila near Khartonm, and is a great
                            agriculturist. He has laid aside all his old objectionable habits, and
                            is now a tall old man, rather good-looking, and very fond of showing
                            himself in his Pasha’s uniform at all functions, and never loses a
                            chance of potting in an appearance at the Palace. He appears thus in
                            several of tho photographs. Ho is now quite harmless, and his sympathy
                            with us, and antipathy to the Mahdi, joined to a unique knowledge of
                            every remote pro- vince, has made his friendship valuable. Sir Reginald
                            Wingate likes him, and most of those in power have a certain amount of
                            respect for the old, once powerful, Znbeir Pasha. Yet, when there was a
                            deputation of native chiefs, a few years ago, from the Bahr el Ghazal,it
                            was seen that the poor ‘ braves” trembled in every limb, and could
                            hardly be restrained from belt- ing when they saw their old enemy in
                            gold lace standing beside our governing powers—they feared we were all

                            officials to become Christians, as the following story about Archdeacon
                            Gwynn. the Chaplain at Khartoum, and a would-be Chris tian shows-:— This
                            man came to Mr. Gwynne and asked him to admit him and his family into
                            his church. Mr. Gwynne said ho could not, as he was Government chaplain,
                            and there was a regulation against his doing so. The man went away
                            sorrowful, for ho had three daughters, and he wanted them to be
                            Christians because, he said, a woman had no life she could call her own
                            under Islam. Of course by and by when there is a public church he and
                            his family may become Christians if they so desire. Many other

                        <p>THE ARM AND HEART OF QUEEN ZER. A WARNING TO EGYPTOLOGISTS. By Baroness
                            de Malortie. Monsieur de Naville searches through Historic tombs and
                            temples too, With their faint dusty smell. His mind is fall of
                            Hatshepsut And all the things she did, and knew Deep in his besom
                            dwell.</p>
                        <p>A cloudy moan looked down on Thebes, Where there were other pairs than
                            these— Like phantoms flitting by. T. Davis dressed in stars and stripes,
                            Was wandering on the distant heights, With his last find Queen Thy.</p>
                        <p>Professor Budge goes rather far In excavating Napata— Though hope his
                            bosom fills With aloes, cassia, spice and balm, And pre-historic robes
                            of palm, Beneath those stony hills.</p>
                        <p>At least we heard it Baid at ‘Queen's’ When basking mid the classic
                            scenes Of the Alma Mater A learned one gave ns the news Of Egypt, long
                            before the Jews— To C****r the Dictator.</p>
                        <p>He brought us from tho realms of Death, Fair spirits not of mortal
                            breath, Whispering their story. We heard the tinkling of their beads,
                            The prancing of their warriors' steeds Tales—of love and glory.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps their secrets they confessed, And why they lie so quaintly
                            dressed In faded garlands pale, And seem to point from amber palls To
                            pine and crimson on the walls That could unfold the tale.</p>
                        <p>As in the after dinner time Some gossiped over mellow wine, Within the
                            College Courts. Strange plans evolved before the eyes Of one we deemed,
                            both good and wise— And far away his thoughts.</p>
                        <p>He saw once more a waveless shore Where visions flitted as of yore
                            Beneath the starry host He breathed again—in spacious tombs, And tore
                            the woof of silken looms, The shroud of some poor ghost.</p>
                        <p>They say be did far more than this, On sealed brow e’en breathed a kiss
                            In ecstasy of mind. And clasped an arm, once soft and fair Though many a
                            magic charm was there, Held fast as gold could bind.</p>
                        <p>Poor little arm, thus cast away In some rough spoiler’s hurried day Who
                            threw you from the rest. And married tho dwelling of the Sonl By
                            breaking up a perfect whole How could yon then be blessed.</p>
                        <p>Part of a queen—so precious too— How little they had left of yon When
                            Flinders Petrie came, Who gently took the jeweled bands, Of fine gold
                            chased by skillful hands, And brought them forth to fame.</p>
                        <p>And at the back of those fair bands Were woven tiny fragile strands Of
                            softest human hair, Twisted about with golden thread The Amethyst and
                            Royal Hawk’s head— Turquoise and crystals rare.</p>
                        <p>’Neath centuries of yellow dost Great Mother Earth held you in trust
                            Among the Holy Dead. Swatched and wrapped in unguents rare The spirit
                            still could enter there Waiting Osiris dread.</p>
                        <p>But eh I what now remains to tell, The spoilers did their work so well,
                            Then Ages stole along. That silent land Time’ yet sleeps And over all
                            the sunlight sWeeps In everlasting song.</p>
                        <p>But he, the wise one, sat alone In that small cabin then his home That
                            floated on the Nile. Osiris—Isis—Horns there And many others gods less
                            feir, With their Egyptian Smile.</p>
                        <p>He saw them not, but heard a sigh That echoed as the wind swept by, Among
                            papyrus reed— He seemed to feel a presence there, Whore moonbeams fell
                            across his chair Upon the ‘Books’ dead creeds.</p>
                        <p>A feint voice said—“I cannot rest "Or ever join that throng so blest "But
                            wander everywhere "The issues of our life apart "Are sometimes gathered
                            in the heart "Mine—lies unburied there.</p>
                        <p>“Yes I in an alabaster jar, "Just where the rocky lintels are, "They hid
                            it in their fear, "Go place it ’neath the shaft of light, "That I may
                            find it in my flight, "Until that Day appear.</p>
                        <p>"It never more shall be disturbed, “When all the rites have been
                            observed. "Go—gentle stranger—go 1” The silver river, calm and deep
                            Heard a man matter in his sleep I thought it would be so —!</p>
                        <p>Alas ! that heart cannot be found Within the tomb, or on the ground. So
                            lost, an act of grace, A spirit hovers night and day About the boat, so
                            sailors say— , Of grave Professor Sayce !</p>

                        <p>UNDER THE MOSQUITO NET “At I tayc a-thinking." Inguldsly. ' A few weeks
                            ago it seemed to be a settled thing that steps were to be taken
                            forthwith ' to establish a Rescue Home for girls in con nection with the
                            movement ior the repression oi the “white slave traffic,” and it was an
                            nounced that the Jewish community had 1 placed a suitable house at the
                            disposal of the j recently formed committee.</p>
                        <p>But alas 1 counsels of another order seem to * have prevailed, and the
                            executive committee f of the newly-formed body bas been informed *■ that
                            the proposed arrangement will not be carried out, and has been
                            recommended to arrange for the police to send to the Rudolph c Home any
                            cases of an urgent nature. One of t these, a Mohamedan girl from Turkey,
                            has, t in fact, been sheltered there for the past c fortnight.</p>
                        <p>Now the Rudolph is an institution having a very different mission to
                            fulfil, and moreover is a building ill-adapted for the re- t ception of
                            these cases. But it is carried on by o a man who is heart and soul
                            devoted to this t good woik, and is not to be easily turned t aside from
                            any course to which he resolves to t devote his energies, while the
                            excellent lady i who is partner in his life’s work is an ideal matron a
                            home of the kind. n Perhaps no better way out of the difficulty could be
                            found than to make each alterations ( in the Rudolph Home by means of
                            additions, would render it adaptable for the purpose for which it is
                            proposed to use it; for surely the willingness of both Mr. and Mrs.
                            Rudolph to undertake these extra duties, relieving the committee as it
                            would of the necessity of providing a paid matron for the proposed home,
                            would be a matter of gTeat importance, ii And for this willingness I can
                            vouch. « ii In other respects, too, the idea seems to be l one that is
                            capable of being carried through. On 8 the side oi the home facing the
                            sea is a piece t of loud belonging to it which is not yet built on,
                            while the committee have in hand a sum ol £350 which they intend to use
                            for building v purposes.</p>
                        <p>This however would not be sufficient, and c would probably require to be
                            supplemented by another XoOU or £400, a matter that sorely should not
                            present any difficulty, seeing that the community that originally
                            proposed to provide the home is not as yet committed to any pecuniary
                            liability in the matter. The plan suggested by Mr. Rudolph would be to
                            remove some of the present temporary 1 outbuildings, and erect in their
                            place, and on the ground at present uncovered, a commo- dious
                            dining-room and a dormitory, while 1 above these could be built three,
                            our, or five rooms, as required, for the purposes of a Girls’ Home, the
                            entrance to which would be quite 1 separate from that used by the
                            frequenters of the Home.</p>
                        <p>I think that a proposal such as this deserves careful consideration.
                            While it is quite obvious Xthat no fiat could be hired for the purpose,
                            on the other hand a large house would be quite unsuitable, as no one
                            expects that there will be . many inmates at one time. Everyone too
                            would . be satisfied at the few it would be necessary , to shelter from
                            time to time being under the t care of one who has proved himself so
                            disin- terested a worker in the cause of humanity as Mr. Rudolph.</p>
                        <p>Though the matter is perhaps one more for private than public
                            arrangement, and its deci- sion one for the committees oonoerned, it is
                            at the same time one of great general interest, considering ail that has
                            been written and said on the subject of late, and as snch I have felt
                            justified in introducing it into my notes this week.</p>
                        <p>I have just been reading that very remark- able little book written in
                            prison by Oscar Wilde, and most appropriately entitled “De Profundis.”
                            It is a truly wonderful production, requiring much study in order to be
                            fully understood and appreciated.</p>
                        <p>As the reviewer says in the “Athenrenm" of April 1, “all the old
                            characteristics of the writer’s style are here, with a new one super-
                            added." And it is just this new one that is so remarkable and so
                            difficult to deal with.</p>
                        <p>I do not propose just now to go into an exhaustive analysis of Wilde’s
                            book, containing as it does so many gems of the purest water, while it
                            also embodies much that at first sight appears objectionable and grates
                            on the feol- ings, although the more it is studied the more apparent
                            does it become that a deeper moaning is intended than that which appears
                            on the surface.</p>
                        <p>But perhaps few tilings in the book are more suggestive to the
                            truth-seeker than the following extracts, and they enforce a lesson of
                            "At Christmas I managed to get hold of a Greek Testament, and every
                            morning, after I had cleaned my cell and polished my tins, I read a
                            little of the Gospels, a dozen verses taken by chance
                            anywhere.............. Endless repetition, in and out of season, has
                            spoiled for us the freshness, the naïveté, the simple romantic charm of
                            the Gospels. We hear them read far too often and far too badly, and all
                            repetition iB anti-spiritual. When one returns to the Greek, it is like
                            going into a garden of lilies out of some dark and narrow house. And to
                            me the pleasure is doubled by the reflection that it is extremely
                            probable that we have the actual terms, the ipsissima verba, used by
                            Christ”</p>
                        <p>I have never liked the idea that we knew of Christ’s own words only
                            through a transla- tion of a translation. It is a delight to me to think
                            that as far as his conversation was con- cerned, Cbarmides might have
                            listened to him, and Socrates reasoned with him, and Plato understood
                            him."</p>
                        <p>How a translation of a translation may alter the text,'and how greatly
                            the meaning of the original may be changed, is clearly shown in the
                            following illustration, which appeared in the "Combill Magazine” for
                            June 1899.It is all the more remarkable in that re-translations into the
                            original English were made in each instance, so that in no case was a
                            translation made from one foreign language to another. The following
                            lines were first translated into Greek :— “ I heard that S. would write
                            my life When I gave np my breath ; I felt indeed that this would add A
                            new delight to death.” The Greek version' was then re translated into
                            English by a second expert, whose render- ing was then turned into Latin
                            by another, and after re-translation was successively trans- lated into
                            French, German and Persian, the same method of procedure being followed
                            throughout.</p>
                        <p>The final re-translation gave the following version of the original
                            text:— He. Dear, in my song you still shall live Though under earth yon
                            lio ; She. Ah ! had you now that grace to give I should not need to
                            die.</p>
                        <p>"De Profundis” would be a valuable book, if only for the reminder it
                            gives us that the utmost care is necessary in accepting transla- tions
                            of so called infallible writings of old. Translators are by no means
                            infallible, and revision is from time to time deemed to be necessary,
                            but be the body of revisors ever so learned, the very revision itself
                            shows that the new light which is continually being thrown on things of
                            old renders adaptation to modem and more advanced thought to be
                            imperatively necessary.</p>

                            <p>ORIGIN OF RIGHTHANDEDNESS. The question why the majority of persons
                                use the right hand with greater skill than the left has never been
                                solved definitely. Dr. George M Gould of Philadelphia, has been
                                specially studying the problem, and, writing in the "Popular Science
                                Monthly," he says he believes that right handedness is so thoroughly
                                ingratiated in human nature that it must have been partially
                                developed in the savage an cestors of the race. Primitive man, in
                                his opinion, must have felt a definite need for the exercise of his
                                right hand in preference to his left; and that necessity must have
                                been re- cognized and obeyed for a long period continuously. The
                                impulse could not well have dictated his habits in eating, for
                                knives and forks are of recent origin, the modern gnn had not been
                                invented, and writing was practically unknown. Moreover, in such
                                operations as chipping arrows weaving baskets, and wield- ing
                                clubs,bows and arrows, it could not have mattered much which hand
                                was employed. When warfare had been carried to such a stage of
                                advancement as to involve the use of a shield however that object
                                was probably held on the left side in order to protect the heart.
                                Then as a matter of convenienve the right arm was left free for the
                                more active function of fighting with spear and sword and with
                                habitual exercise came special skill. An attendant phenomenon was a
                                finer organisation of that particular centre in the brain which
                                controlled these movements and which was situated in the left half
                                of the organ. With an increased use of the left hand Dr Gould thinks
                                there must have been greater demande upon the right eye, because
                                vision must precede the order to strike, or to give peaceful
                                signals. In this way there may have been developed a keenor power of
                                vision in the right eye than in the left. Dr Gould assumes that
                                there was and declares that righthanded people are right eyed and
                                that in their brains the centre of vision is on the left side in
                                close proximity to that governing the right arm.</p>

                            <p>The more familiar an impartial observer may be. with the social
                                usages and habits of Great Britain and of the Continent of Europe,
                                the less en photic, says Mr. Brander Matthews in the "New York
                                Tribune,” will be his feeling that the foreign standard is really
                                superior to American ; and the more inclined he will be to explain
                                away certain apparent disadvantages of onr attitude as the price we
                                pay for what we hold in high esteem—equality and demo- cracy,
                                manliness and self-respect</p>
                            <p>The American theory of manners, if one may attempt to formulate its
                                basis, is founded cot on any artificial distinctions of social
                                position, but on the simple relation of man to man. In Europe bad
                                manners, whether of the upper or the lower classes generally spring
                                from a lack of sympathy. Iu America, bad manners are caused by want
                                of thought rather than by lack of feeling. They are the result of
                                carelessness more than of wilfulness. The American is so busy
                                minding his own business that he has no time to be as regardful oi
                                the rights of others as he knows he ought to be. He does not mean to
                                be rude, and if his attention is called to it he mends his manners,
                                if only for the moment.</p>
                            <p>The American is profoundly good-natured— and good nature is an
                                integral element of good manners. The carnival gaiety of an
                                election- night crowd in any American city, no matter how bitter may
                                have been the preceding can- vass, finds no parallel in any other
                                country in the world ; it is an expression of that good- hnmoured
                                toleration which is a chief charac- teristic of the American people,
                                and which every intelligent foreigner notes almost imme- diately
                                upon his arrival.</p>

                                |m| cratches or sticks. This went on for over 0[a| three years, and
                                since that time I have never jjne been properly free from the
                                rheumatism, and den never so franc as I am at the present time,
                                since upc using Doan’s Pills.</p>
                            <p>During those 34 years I had several severe ju , attacks of this
                                terrible rheumatism. The one -j in October of 1897, when I was
                                living in Wednesday, was, I think, the severest attack ^ I ever had;
                                it kept me in my bed for 10 months, and I became as helpless as a
                                new-born babe. oaf I was attended by one of the best doctors, bnt ^
                                he seemed unable to do me much good, although ho told me more than
                                once that if I had been a millionaire he could not have tried ^
                                harder—and I believe him.</p>
                            <p>In March of 1899 I was kept from business . for 17 mouths again with
                                rheumatism and , kidney trouble. There were severe pains in . my
                                back and sides (especially the left side); ,10 my appetite became
                                poor, and I didn’t relish the food I was able to eat There was a
                                nasty 0 . taste in my month, no matter what I ate or drank, and I
                                couldn’t keep my food down. 1 1 Even a pipe of tobacco seemed to go
                                against W£ me, and I became despondent and miserable, mc feeling
                                that life was not worth living. But there was worse to follow : not
                                long 061 after. I began to bo troubled with the kidney secretions,
                                the pain in passing being almost ‘D(.C unbearable at times. There
                                was also a sedi- . ment from the urine. These distressing com-
                                plaints kept getting worse and worse as “ months went by, until one
                                day I couldn’t pass . the urine at all; I was in suoh a terrible “l
                                condition at the time that I thought my race 061 was nearly run.</p>
                            <p>It was then that I heard about Doan’s . Backache Kidney Pills, and
                                they were spoken so highly of that I determined to try them. After I
                                had taken a few boxes I felt easier, and now that I have taken ten
                                boxes I feel quite free from any sign of rheumatism or kidney

                            <p>THE STATE RAILWAYS BY "TRAFFIC" (THIRD ARTICLE) The great problem
                                that the Administration of the Egyptian State Railways has to solve
                                is that of the growth of traffic, and it is one that divides itself
                                into many subordinate problems, each requiring elaborate study,
                                special know- ledge, and far-seeing judgment. As it is on the
                                increase of the traffic that the success of a railway system depends
                                for its financial and general reccess, it is obviously the first
                                duty of the administration to see that everything that can be done
                                is done to promote it. For this duty the Commission has made no
                                adequate provisions, apparently ignoring the fact that it is one
                                that demands, on the part of the official to whom it is entrusted,
                                very special ability as well as an intimate knowledge of the
                                country, its trade and commerce, its people, their habits and
                                customs, and many other factors. Under the system of administra-
                                tion that I have sketched this would be the work of the General
                                Manager, whose opinions and decisions, having been revised or
                                approved by the Council, would be carried out by the various
                                departments concerned. Thus it would rest with the Traffic Manager
                                to propose and carry out necessary modifications of the existing
                                traffic arrangements, suggest addi- tional trains, or other methods
                                of meeting the demands for increased accommodation, and in doing
                                this he might have to consult with the Way Department and Locomotive
                                Departments.</p>
                            <p>To the outsider the providing of extra train accommodation seems a
                                simple thing, but it is in reality very far from being so. We are
                                constantly hearing complaints of the over- crowding of the trains,
                                and these are com- monly accompanied by the question, “Why do they
                                not ran more trains 1” and “Why do they not pat on more carriages i"
                                Well, to answer the latter question first, to put on more carriages
                                is not necessarily so simple a matter as the public assume. More
                                carriages mean more powerful engines, increased stock of carriages,
                                and possibly important alterations in the arrangement oi stations,
                                etc. To in- crease the number of trains may not only need some or
                                all of these things, but may even necessitate the opening of
                                stations, or halts, the provision of new sidings and other elaborate
                                and expensive modifications of the line. The employment of larger
                                engines may demand the relaying of the whole of the line upon which
                                they am to run, and this might also be required by any considerable
                                increase in the speed of trains.</p>
                            <p>These are but a lew indications of the complicated nature of the
                                problems involved, but they are enough to show that these prob- lems
                                can only be effectively solved by very careful study on the part of
                                thoroughly prac- tical men, and that without the necessary study of
                                all the factors, the ablest experts can at best give nothing more
                                than a mere guess as to what would be the most advisable method of
                                dealing with them.</p>
                            <p>It is important, too, that the fact should not be overlooked that the
                                initial cost of altera- tions and work intended to facilitate
                                traffic is but a very small item compared with the value of the
                                results to be attained, even though that initial expenditure may run
                                into tens of thousands of pounds. If, for example, A and B are two
                                available methods of providing for increased traffic, and we find
                                that A' pounds spent upon A will give an increase of one per cent on
                                the present revenue, and that 6 X pounds spent upon B will yield a
                                five per cent, increase ; if other conditions do not materially
                                affect this result, it is not difficult to see that the expenditure
                                of the 6 X amount will in the end be by far the most economical. Had
                                Lord Farrer’s Commission kept this simple fact in mind, it would
                                not, in all probability, have been so hasty to condemn the
                                Electro-Pneu- matic Signalling installation at Cairo, for if this be
                                effectively carried out it should, by the inoreased security it will
                                give and the facility it will provide for the rapid and effective
                                handling of a largely increased traffic, ultimate- ly prove one of
                                the wisest and most economical investments the Administration has
                                made. There are many other points that one might deal with at some
                                length but space forbids Enough I think has been said to show that
                                it would be a great mistake to accept the Report of the Commision as
                                either an adequate critcism of the Railway Administration or as a
                                satisfactory solution of any ot the problems involved. Indeed its
                                criticism of the signaling arrangements prove conclusively that the
                                Commission did not exercise that care in the acquistion of facts
                                that it should have used if it desired its opinion to be accepted as
                                well reasoned and well founded.</p>

                            <p>An artistic wall covering.</p>
                            <p>This celebrated water paint is made in two qualities for Inside and
                                Outside work</p>
                            <p>HALL’S SANITARY WASHABLE DISTEMPER is rapidly superseding wall papers
                                in all tastefully furnished homes. It is made in 70 artistic tints,
                                and only requires the addition of water to make it ready for use. It
                                is quickly and easily applied with a whitewash brush, with half the
                                labour and at one third the cost of paint. HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures
                                cleanliness, and is pleasing to the eye. It appeals alike to
                                artistic and practical house decoration. HALL’S DISTEMPER is of
                                special value in hot climates. Owing to its cool, pleasing colours,
                                great weather-resisting and germ-destroying properties, it lends
                                itself to every kind of wall, wood, brick or stone coating,
                                possessing all the advantages of paint, colour- wash, and
                                disinfectant at one third the cost of oil paint. It never blisters
                                in the hottest sun, and the fact that it can be washed adds greatly
                                to its sanitary advantages.</p>

                            Mr. Beman, a dissented la cause Stagni contra Salinas Bar la question
                            d’exe- quatur par lea tribunaux mixtes da jogoment. et de l’arrfit
                            rendusparla jaridiction Italienne. Me Palagi a soutenu, an nom de M.M.
                            St-i- qui, que les jugements des tribunaux Consnlaires sont toujoure
                            oxdcutoire3 par les tribunaux mixtes; qae, par suite, il n’y a pas k
                            apprdcicr le mdrite du jugement du tribunal consulaire; que la Cour
                            d’Ancfine a compdtemment statud puisqae c’est d’elle que relaient les
                            décisions des tribunaux Consulaires d'Orient, qu’au fond il n’y a pas de
                            contradiction entre le dispositif de l’arrfit de la Cour d'AncOne et
                            celui de la Cour mixte, ce dernier arrfit ayant rdsilid le contrat de la
                            National Bank, mais non celui de la maison Salinas.</p>
                        <p>Me Padua Bey, pour la maison Salinas, a répondu qu’il ressort de l’arrfit
                            de la Cour mixte qu'elle seule était compétente; done, le tribunal ne
                            pent que constater l’incompdtetice de la Cour d’An cone; done l’arrfit
                            de cette dernière Cour ne pent fière exécutoire par le3 • tribunaux
                            mixtes.</p>
                        <p>Au fond la question était de savoir s'il y avait légalement un seul
                            contrat, comme le soutenait Salinas, ou deux contrats, comme le
                            soutenait Stagni; la Cour mixte a jugfi qu’il n’y avait qu'un seal
                            contrat, qu’elle ne devait dono prononcer qu’ttne rfisiliation. Au
                            surplus, Stagni avait demands subsidiairement k la Cour Mixte qu'ello
                            lui accordkt ce que lui avait accords la Cour d’Ancdne ; il a 6t6
                            formellement dfiboutfi de cette demande ; la contradiction dans les
                            dispositifs est, par suite, anssi precise que dans les motifs. Quant aux
                            jugements consulaires, ils ne peuvent fitre exficutfis par l’autorito
                            mixte que lorsqu’ils ont dtd rendus complètement, ce qui n’est pas le
                            cas ; du reste, un jugement frappd d’appel s’absorbe dans l’arrfit qui
                            le suit; on ne comprendrait pas qu’un jugement con- fined pftt fitre
                            exdoutoire alore que l'arret con- firmatif ne le serait pas. Jugement k

                            rapport sur les derniers fouilles d’Egypto. La Chronique des Arts, qui
                            en donne une analyse complète, rappelle au sujet de ces fouilles les
                            paroles de M. Maspero: depuis le Serapeum et les monuments de Marietta,

                            septembro 1903 et le 5 juillet 1904 que M. Legrain a eu la fortune de
                            ddcouvrir dans les mines de Karnak un nombre conside- rable d'objets. On
                            a mis au jour 457 statuette* et statues en diverses matidres; 15 stdles

                            soulptures; puis, parmi les objets en mdtal, un anneau d’or de la reino
                            Nefertiti, femme d’Amdnophis IV; une statuette du roi Tirhakah (693 av.
