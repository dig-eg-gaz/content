                    <head>THE PASSAGE OF THE FLEET.</head>
                    <p>Significant news reaches us to-day from Singapore. Two Japanese battleships,
                        two first- class and two second-class cruisers, and twelve destroyers are
                        said to be near Singapore, steaming West. This is, so to speak, the
                        preliminary to the lifting of the curtain on the, third act of the great
                        Asiatic drama, and the interest therein will naturally be intensified. The
                        first act succeeded in disturbing the equan imity of the whole world, the
                        second is still in process of enactment, as the Russian Admiral and his
                        fateful ships advance across the Indian seas, to that vast dislocated
                        barrier of land which, like the vertebre of some pre- diluvial monster,
                        stretches across his further course into the Pacific. It is at this point
                        that the curtain will ring up on the third and last act. And here also it is
                        just pos able that a certain obscurity may fall upon the movements of the
                        Musovice fees, which, if doomed to press on, may, it is thought, have
                        planned to pass into what is virtually the field of battle by some gate at
                        which it may be least expected. Now, there can be little doubt that
                        Kodjestvensky's first object is not to "find and destroy" his enemy, <cb
                            n="6"/> but to evade him by hook or by crook, and get his ships and inen
                        into Vladivostok before staking everything on an encounter with the
                        sea-kings of the Mikado. If there were any pos sibility of preparing his
                        ships for battle, after their long sea voyage, at any point west of the
                        Straits, he might as presumably his force is intended to fight-enter the
                        China seas with drums beating and banners displayed. But it is his fate to
                        lack any such harbour of refuge nearer than the distant goal to which he is
                        bound, and between which and himself lurk the warships of his redoubtable
                        foe.</p>
                    <p>The momentous question which thus arises is-How does Rodjestvensky hope to
                        reach Vladivostok without fighting? And the solu- tion of this problem gives
                        birth to a situation of unparalleled interest. Whether he succeeds or not
                        mast first of all largely depend upon the passage by which he takes his
                        ships into the Pacific, and the efficiency of the Japanese Intelligence. A
                        reference to the map will show that to pass through the "Gates of the East,"
                        he must make choice of a series of defiles through that great barrier of
                        islands extend- ing for 1,800 miles from the north-western point of Sumatra
                        to Timor on the east, the last 500 miles from the North Australian coast.
                        The two largest of these defiles, the Straits of Malacos and of Sunda, are
                        the usual routes between East and West. The former is in length about 500
                        miles, with a breadth varying from about 300 to 25 miles, and it is here
                        that the Japanese ships spoken of are at present found. There are several
                        islands within the straits, and the exit, in view of a possible attack, is
                        imperilled by a host of islands of various sizes. Purther east the Straits
                        of Sunda, between the great islands of Sumatra and Java, would afford a
                        quicker passage, as they are not more than 90 miles in length. Their
                        passage, however, is similarly endangered by the existence of a number of
                        islands and islets. Moreover, both straits narrow considerably towards their
                        eastern mouths, which must add greatly to their perils from a naval point of
                        view. Further eastward may be noticed a series of minor passes through the
                        long chain of islands, as far as Timor, But these narrow waters, as well as
                        those beyond, swarming with countless archipelagoes, are still very
                        incompletely surveyed, and would be fraught with serious navigating dangers
                        to such a fleet, which it might well hesitate to encounter.</p>
                    <p>There is one other important consideration which will conceivably influence
                        the Russian point of passage, namely, the radius of action. possessed by the
                        Japanese warships. The coal capacity of the latter has largely been sacrific
                        ed to armament. But it must be remembered that Japau now possesses in
                        Formosa a valu able advanced base for any southward naval action, and thence
                        will be able to work fast colliers down to any of the numerous and insig
                        nificant islands, whose neutrality may safely be regarded as a negligible
                        quantity. We may take it, therefore, that there will be nothing" to prevent
                        Togo from operating, with his cruisers and destroyers, in the neighbourhood
                        of the straits, if he so chooses, and there is one possibility which, in
                        view of recent happenings, the Japanese cannot afford to lose sight of The
                        chance that the Ro sians may attempt to force themselves upon the
                        hospitality of the French at Saigon for any final tinkering is one that
                        takes Japanese surveillance of this port a serious necessity. This port,
                        indeed, is the great danger point in the China seas, as any assist ance

                    <p>-The death of the grea philanthropist Menshawi Pasha caused moch profound
                        grief in Tantah that most of the inhabitants neglected their work from the
                        early morning in expectation of the arrival of the mortal remains of the
                        deceased from Cairo for burial. It was 4 pm, when the special train
                        conveying the corpse reached Tantah station, where a multitude of people had
                        gathered. The route taken from the station was through the Mondiriob-street
                        to Bourse-street, which almost entirely belonged to the deceased. Shops were
                        shut, and lanterns, draped in mournful crape, were lit. It was indeed an
                        impressive scene.</p>
                    <p>The cortego was thus arranged:-First came the fikis with flags, then the
                        students of Saied El Badawi, who read some verses from the Koran in a loud
                        voice that caused some disorder. Two bands from Alexandria, consisting of
                        the Porters' School and Urwa el Woska, played mournful dirges, and were
                        followed by the notables of different localities. Then came the bier,
                        surrounded by mounted police, who accompanied it till the procession resched
                        the burial ground, which is in front of the girls' school established by the
                        deceased. Many panegyrios were recited, at the conclusion of which the crowd
                        dispersed.</p>
                    <p>In his will, Menshawi Paaba expressed the wish that a mosque should be built
                        over his grave.</p>

                        took place. We say from first to last, but an exception must be made of the
                        time when the youngsters were regaling themselves in the tos tente. Of
                        these, there were three, all tastefully decorated with evergreens and flags.
                        The Earl and Countess of Cromer arrived on the scene at 5 o'clock, and were
                        escorted by the president of the club to where the children were enjoying s
                        themselves at tea. Something like 120 to 140 English children were there,
                        boys and girls of all ages, from the little mite of one year to the lads and
                        lasses of 15, or even more. The Very Rev. Dean and Mrs. Butcher were
                        present, as well as many local celebrities. A elever ventriloquial
                        entertainment concluded this very enjoyable children's fête, the

                        manner that reflects the greatest credit on the club. Everything was thought

                        it may be recalled that so far back as 1882, shipowners were very
                        dissatisfied with the treatment meted out to them by the Suez Canal
                        authorities, so much so that schemes for rival enterprises were started, and
                        in the end three sets of plans were drawn up. One was for a freshwater canal
                        from Alexandria to Cairo, and thence via Tel-el-Kebir to Suez. Another
                        project was to construct a canal from Alexmndria to Mansourah and Ismailis,
                        and thence to Saes, by s route parallel to the original danal. The third
                        ides was to construct a econd Suez Canal, such as is now proposed by Sir T.

                    <head>COMMISSION MUNICIPALE</head>

                    <p>(Communication officielle)</p>
                    <p>La Commission municipale s'est réunie le 21 Décembre 1904, à 4h. p.m., sous
                        la présidence de S.E. Mahmoud Pacha Sidky.</p>
                    <p>M. Escoffier dit que la fusion des services de recettes, décidée par la
                        Délégation, l'amène à Aire part à l'Assemblée d'une proposition faite au
                        Comité des finances tendant à ce que, pour simplifier les opérations de
                        perception, il soit décidé de rendre les taxes portables et non guirables et
                        à réunir sur une même tête les taxes sur la propriété et les loyers afin
                        d'avoir à faire à un nombre moins grand de contri- buables.</p>
                    <p>M. de Menasce dit que l'adoption de ce sys tème pourrait modifier
                        sensiblement l'organisa tion adoptée par la Délégation pour le service de
                        recettes et qu'il serait done prudent de ne pas ratifier cette organisation
                        avant qu'une dé- cision a'intervienne sur la proposition soumise au Comité
                        des Finances.</p>
                    <p>M. Chataway dit que l'étude de la proposi tion en question demande un certain
                        temps et qu'en attendant le service doit suivre l'organi- sation nouvelle
                        qui constitue une amélioration à l'état des choses existant.</p>
                    <p>L'Assemblée renvoie l'étude de la proposi tion de M. Escoffier au Comité du
                        Contentieux. M. Zouro informe qu'il interpellers le Prési- dent à la
                        prochaine séance au sujet d'une ques- tion relative aux poids publics.</p>
                    <p>M. Suzzarini, en sa qualité de membre du Comité d'hygiène, demande les
                        raisons pour lesquelles ce Comité n'est plus convoqué, chose qui rend
                        son-existence inutile.</p>
                    <p>M. le Dr.Schiess Bey dit que les réunions du Comité dépendent des questions
                        qui lui sont renvoyées soit par la Commission soit par la Délégation. Or il
                        semble que dans ces derniers temps, il n'y a pas eu de questions importantes
                        nécessitant une étude spéciale de la part du Comité. Padoa bey fait
                        remarquer que les Co- mités ayant un droit de contrôle, il leur est loisible
                        de se saisir de toute question qui les intéresse</p>
                    <p>A ce sujet, il dépose une proposition tendant à compléter le Comité des
                        travaux publics, le nombre des membres de ce Comité étant dimi- nué par
                        suite de démissions.</p>
                    <p>Communication est donnée d'une lettre du 6 Décembre de 8. E. le Ministre de
                        l'Intérieur informant que, pour permettre aux administra tions intéressées
                        d'étudier la décision de la Commission relative au Collecteur Eet, il de-
                        mande de tenir en suspens cette délibération. L'Assemblée, sur la
                        proposition de M. Ro- thaker, s'en rapporte à la bienveillance du Gou-
                        vernement pour hiter la solution de cette ques- tion, vu l'urgence qu'elle
                        présente au point de vue du prochain achèvement des filtres, dont ce
                        collecteur gera appelé à drainer les eaux provenant de leur lavage</p>
                    <p>Lecture est ensuite donnée d'une lettre du Président de la Société
                        archéologique informant que M. Maspero a bien voulu accepter de céder A la
                        ville d'Alexandrie deux obélisques prove- nant des mines de Sax.</p>
                    <p>La Commission accepte avec remerciements. Communication est donnée d'une
                        lettre de 8.E. le Ministre de l'Intérieur informant qu'il estime que
                        l'Administrateur près de la Com- pagnie des Eaux ne peut pas être M.
                        Chataway mais que le choix de la Commission doit s'ar rêter sur une personne
                        qui puisse représenter à la fois les deux intérêts en présence de la
                        Municipalité et du Gouvernement, M. Chata way n'étant que fonctionnaire
                        municipal.</p>
                    <p>La Commission se référant à une délibéra- tion de la Délégation sur le même
                        objet, ex- prime ses remerciements as Gouvernement pour les sentiments
                        développés dans sa lettre, et d'après lesquels il reconnait l'importance des
                        intérêts de la Municipalité dans la question des rapports de celle-ci avec
                        la Compagnie des Eaux, mais considérant que le choix le plus judicieux à
                        faire serait celui de l'Administra teur de la Municipalité, en raison de la
                        con- naissance plus intime qu'il doit avoir des besoins de la ville,
                        l'Assemblée prie le Gouver nement de revenir sur sa décision, en ap-
                        prouvant la délibération de la Commission du 3 Décembre, étant entendu que
                        l'Assemblée n'a aucune objection à ce que, dans ses rap- ports avec la
                        Compagnie des Eaux, M. Cha taway puisse recevoir directement des instruc-
                        tions du Ministère.</p>
                    <p>L'ordre du jour appelle la discussion du budget de l'exercice 1905.</p>
                    <p>Il est donné à ce sujet communication du rapport de M. l'Administrateur et
                        des modifi- cations y apportées par la Délégation ainsi que de la note du
                        Comité financier sur, le dit budget.</p>
                    <p>Les propositions du Comité quant aux re- cettes sont approuvées et le chiffre
                        en est arrêté à L.E. 188,000.</p>
                    <p>Au sujet des dépenses, une discussion s'en- gage en ce qui concerne les
                        crédits du person nel, à la suite de laquelle le Comité des finan- ces
                        propose la motion suivante qui est adoptée: "Le Comité des finances propose
                        l'adoption de son rapport, en portant la prévision des dépenses du personnel
                        à LE 46,000, sauf an Comité à étudier le tableau dressé par la Délé- gation
                        indiquant les catégories et le nombre des employés, et après approbation par
                        la Commission du tableau définitif, la Délégation fers les applications
                        individuelles.</p>
                    <p>"En attendant les appointements resteront tels quels avec les gratifications
                        octroyées</p>
                    <p>"en 1904.</p>
                    <p>Les propositions de la Délégation et du Comité concernant les allocations
                        sont adoptées Les subventions théâtrales sont ramenées à 900 LE conformément
                        aux propositions du Comité</p>
                    <p>Il est décidé an sujet des allocations qu'un Comité sers institué au cours de
                        l'exercice prochain pour la revision de toutes les sub- ventions, en vue
                        d'une répartition équitable En conséquence le budget des dépenses est arrêté
                        à LE. 188,000 comprenant une réserve de LE 2090</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>

                    <p>A l'occasion de la discussion du Budget, M. Rothaker propose de demander au
                        gouverne ment de maintenir pour la ville d'Alexandrie le droit de 500 sur
                        les transferts des proprié tés, en affectant à la Municipalité la réduction
                        de 3 0/0 consentie sur ce droit.</p>
                    <p>Cette imposition est équitable, car elle ne frapperait que les classes aisées
                        et serait d'une perception facile, indépendamment de ce qu'elle
                        représenterait la rémunération des sacrifices qu'assume la Municipalité,

                    <p>SHRAGER BROS. CALCUTTA MARKET REPORT FOR WEEK ENDING 10th DECEMBER, 1904. We
                        have yet another advance to record prices on the Gunny market, which checks
                        export business, such orders come in for prompt shipment, and very full
                        prices are paid.</p>
                    <p>Burma and the Far East have been operat ing in both Heavy G and E bags; 8
                        porter wills are in request for the United Kingdom, while for the Bombay
                        markets and country trade requirements, all parcels of 24lb. B Twills and E
                        bags that are offered are readily taken for any delivery up to June. This
                        coupled with the upward reaction in the Jute market and the uniform reports
                        that come in from up country in respect to the early closing of the Jute
                        season, are the main factors which have led to the rise;</p>
                    <p>mitting themselves, and second hand holders show no real disposition to
                        realize on current equivalents.</p>
                    <p>mills are more chary than ever of further com-</p>
                    <p>Hessians are quiet but steady, absence of orders somewhat eases the position
                        for this and next month, but any buying for export must enhance values. Nine
                        porter cloth is very firmly held, and there is a good deal of covering still
                        to be done in both textures. An enquiry for 50 lakhs wheat Pockets at Rs.
                        12-8-18/8d was placed on the market, but there are no sellers nor is the
                        quantity at present available.</p>
