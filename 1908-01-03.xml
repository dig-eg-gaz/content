                    <p>Some interesting criticisms are passed on English officials in Egypt by the
                        correspond. ent of the "Daily Telegraph” in Cairo, who sends the following
                        article on the subject to the newspaper.</p>
                    <p>We have dealt with the subject in another column of to days issue.</p>
                    <p>It is impossible to live long in this country without becoming convinced that
                        many of the reforms, in particular those of a mental or moral nature, are
                        being wrongly applied. Instead of attempting to convince the Egyptian why
                        some rule of conduct or mode of thought is inferior to, and more usefal
                        than, those he at present follows, he is merely told he is wrong, and that
                        he must alter--a course which merely confirms the Egyptian in his error, if
                        error it be, and breeds a mistrust of reform and of the object of those who
                        urge it.</p>
                    <p>No effort whatever is made by the younger Government officials to understand
                        the people whom they are here to govern; they do not attempt to find out
                        what circamstances and what ideals and inner feelings have conduced to
                        forming the Egyptian's habit of thought and mode of life They do not pause
                        to reflect that this has been reached after centuries of experience of
                        religious, mental, and physical conditions of which the Englishman knows
                        nothing. They do not seem to realise that in a philosophy thus arrived at
                        there is much that is good and much that is more suitable to the native than
                        that which has been the outcome of Westeru experience. The young official
                        parti. cularly in the educational department, seems to have no idea of
                        building on what he finds his great idea is to demolish. Hide-bound by this
                        lack of experience of life and by the narrow, conventions of his University,
                        he wishes to force the game outlook and the same ideals on a race totally
                        unfitted for them by religion, training, tradition, and environment.</p>
                    <p>This is the attitude which has erected the barrier between the two races, a
                        barrier which practically precludes all social intercourse; and which will,
                        unless it is destroyed at once and for ever, become one of the most
                        dangerous and effective weapons in the armoary of our political opponents.
                        Set up in our arrogance, let us beware it is not demolished to our
                        humiliation.</p>
                    <p>Another danger is the increasing frequency with which Egyptians are sent to
                        study in England, dangerous because of the way they are treated on their
                        return. While there they are treated in exactly the same manner as are all
                        other members of the community among whom they are made much of, if the
                        reverse they are shunned. But on the arrival of one of these Egyptians in
                        his own country he finds he is treated in an entirely different manner, and
                        in some cases even the very people who were his friends in England and his
                        contemporaries "at the University draw away, and another is added to the
                        enemies of the occupation, and, because of his education and his modern
                        training, &amp; more important one.</p>
                    <p>The Egyptian is often called ungrateful, and in many cases this is absolutely
                        true. But is it not the manner of giving that is at fault ! It is against
                        human nature to be unduly grateful for benefits that are flung to you.</p>
                    <p>Many of the reasons urged in defence of this racial barrier are undoubtedly
                        true, chief among which are the different social position of women, the
                        social conditions, and the ideas of right and wrong, the difference of which
                        springs entirely from the difference in religion. Here, however, the young
                        officials apt to forget that East is East and West is West, and imagines
                        that East can be made into a sort of stucco imitation of the West ; he
                        seldom attempts to discover from what these differences come, so that by
                        &amp; proper realisation of the sources from which they spring they may be,
                        'as far as possible, smoothed away. This latter course was the one followed
                        by the earlier officials here, and is still to a very great extent by the
                        higher ones. A less haughty and exclusive attitude must be adopted by the
                        young gentleman who arrives here fresh from his University and finds himself
                        suddenly placed in a position of considerable responsibility. Otherwise, the
                        magnitude of our task here will be increased. The younger official has a
                        very high ideal of duty, but he seems not to realise that human sympathy is
                        an even more valuable asset in the equipment of those who have to govern,
                        and that an attempt should be made to understand the outlook op life which
                        others have.</p>
                    <p>It cannot be too strongly insisted on that this attitude of exclusiveness is
                        one of the chief factors in the racial antagonism that is undoubtedly
                        growing in Egypt. And it is the English who are most to blame, for he is a
                        rigid adherent to small and unimportant conventions, whereas the East is
                        lavish in its hospitality. How often is an advance made by the Egyptians in
                        all good faith, and with all kindness treated as impertinence? Socially, the
                        Mohamınecans are the most democratic People in the world, are not all Byual
                        in the sight of Allah.</p>
                    <p>If the Egyptian is to absorb the good from our social and official system,
                        and not only Western vices, we must help him to see their advantage by a
                        closer intercourse, and not make them unpalatable in the giving. The barm
                        done by the standers of the average young Englishman cannot be exaggerated;
                        it to great extent counterbalances the benefits conferred by the labours and
                        the genius of the great of our race.</p>

                        Gordon Morrell which took place very suddenly from heart disease. Dr.
                        Morrell was well known at Assouan having spent many winters at the Cataraet
                        Hotel and the deepest sympathy is felt for Mrs. Morell, who has already left

                        back next week.</p>
                    <p>Several people well known in the world of art and letters are sojourning here
                        just now. Mr. Douglas Sladen, with his party which includes Miss Norma
                        Lorrimer the well known author of several delightful books of travel, has
                        arrived from Khartoum where he spent a week gathering materials with which
                        to delight bis readers in the near future. Miss Lorrimer is also writing a
                        book on Egypt. She leaves for Luxor with Mr. and Mrs. Donglas Šladen
                        tomorrow and will spend some weeks there.</p>

                    <p>A small dance took place last evening at the Savoy Hotel and many visitors
                        from the Cataract went over in the launch which was running to and from the

                        and white gown and Mrs Beamount who looked charming in white and silver. The
                        garden at the Savoy, always delightful, is especially so on a starlight
                        night, and the scene from the terrace, with the lights of the town and the
                        steamers reflected in the water, was very beautiful as many of the dancers

                <p>At the meeting of this society yesterday a proposal was submitted for increasing
                    the annual subscription to P.T. 120 to cover the cost of the publication of the
                    proceedings of the society, which will be supplied to members.</p>
                <p>Ever since the foundation of the society the aded has been felt of some public
                    record of its work and the communications made at its meetings, and several
                    times the proposal to publish the proceedings has been brought forward for
                    discussion. On examination of these proposals it was found on former occasions
                    that the cost of publication was so great that it could not be covered by any
                    reasonable increase in the membership subscription.</p>
                <p>But at the present moment a favourable opportunity presents itself of getting the
                    proceedings published at a reasonable rate without involving the society in any
                    financial responsibility in the matter beyond the payment of P.T 100 per annum
                    for each member who receives the published proceedings.</p>
                <p>In October 1906 some members of the Survey Department began the monthly issue of
                    a small journal called "Survey Notes,"contain ing brief records of scientific
                    work done in Egypt. Although only fifteen numbers of this journal have so far
                    been publisbed it has already obtained wide recognition in scientific journals
                    in England and Europe, and next year the articles appearing in it will be
                    indexed in the "International Catalogue of Scientific Literature," so that its
                    position as a recognised scientific journal can now be considered established.
                    The publishing committee have already decided to widen the scope and alter the
                    name of this journal, at the same time omitting personal notes of a purely
                    departmental interest; and they hope to make it a journal in which workers in
                    every branch of natural science in Egypt can publish brief reports on the
                    progress of their own researches that may be of interest to their co-workers or
                    to the general public, as well as resumes of scientific work relating to Egypt
                    but published elsewhere.</p>
                <p>The publishing committee of this journal. agree to publish the proceedings of the
                    society up to twenty pages per month in consideration of payment of P.T. 120 In
                    return for this the members of the Society would receive not only the report of
                    the proceedings of the Society, but also a magazine containing original articles
                    and reviews of scientific work of interest to all who live in Egypt.</p>
                <p>The publishing committee of "survey notes” | consists of three members, and it
                    the present proposal is adopted the society will nominate two additional members
                    to this committee. It at any subsequent time the society agrees to accept the
                    financial responsibility for the magazine, the nomination of all the editors
                    will be imposed on the Society ; but for the present the majority of the
                    editorial committee is constituted by those who bear the financial risk.</p>

                <head>Anglo-Egyptian Officials</head>
                <p>The "Daily Telegraph's" Strictures</p>
                <p>The Cairo correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph" Has condemned in no measured
                    language, the system of treatment to which the Egyptians are subjected by the
                    younger officials of the Ministry of Public Instruction in particular, and the
                    English occupants in general. The article in question will be found on page 2 of
                    today's issue. For much of what he writes there is certainly some justification,
                    for instance when he deplores the fact that greater consideration of Eastern
                    methods and Eastern manners is not accorded to Egyptian institution, for any
                    attempt to change the ideas and prejudices of centuries in the narrow space of a
                    single generation is one which must inevitably end in disaster. But this charge
                    can after all be only preferred against very small number of the English
                    Government officials in Egypt, and then only against the most youthful, while
                    often in the case of these men we are inclined to doubt that things are in such
                    a bad state as the "Telegraph's" correspondent would have us believe. It may be
                    true that a few of the younger members of the Ministry of Public Instruction
                    arrive in this country with a very exaggerated idea of their own importance, and
                    with a very shallow estimate of the capabilities of the young Egyptian with whom
                    they are called upon to deal, and this is the more unfortunate as the rising
                    generation of Egypt is gaining a first impression perhaps of Englishman and his
                    methods from contact with these gentlemen, by which they arrive at conclusions
                    regarding them, which may be correct in as far as individuals are concerned, but
                    are very far removed from being accurate estimates of the character of the
                    English nation in general.</p>
                <p>We believe instances such as the above to be, fortunately, very few and far
                    between, and on the other hand it cannot be denied that large number of the
                    officials, and more particularly the younger officials of this Ministry, devote
                    a very much longer time to the personal supervision of the athletic training of
                    their pupils, than they are called upon to do by the terms of their
                    agreement.</p>
                <p>Therefore, though as we have admitted, some of the points touched upon by our
                    London contemporary are based upon undeniable fact, the article in its entirety
                    is one which world be far more likely to convey a mistaken impression of the
                    methods of the English Administration upon the minds of those to whom the actual
                    facts are unfamiliar than to serve any good purpose.</p>
                <p>We are told that the Egyptian nation is one of the most democratic in the world,
                    all men are equal in the sight of Allah." If the opinions of the average
                    Egyptian are democratic, he certainly contrives to bide them in</p>
                <p>very effective manner, in bin home life the difference of rank may be
                    over-looked, but in the street, the hotel, or indeed in all public places, then
                    is no one more sensible to the Attention of the great than is your Egyptian
                    Aspirant to social standing.</p>
                <p>With regard to the treatment which student receives whilst at an English
                    University, as compared to that which is accorded to him here in his own
                    country, the correspondent, in admitting the difficulty which the Mohammedan
                    manner of dealing with their women folk present, has struck the root of the
                    matter. Social intercourse is impossible between the two nations, that is to say
                    the fullness of the intercourse which exists between two European nations, as
                    long as the feminine element is oppressed, and is consequently non existent on
                    the part of one of the countries concerned.</p>
            </div><div type="item">     <p>HOTEL D'ANGLETERRE.</p>
                <p>Whatever the prospects of the other hotels, the Angleterre has every cause to
                    expect a prosperous season. All its rooms are occupied at the present, and are
                    likely to remain so, for it is quite one of the most comfortable houses in all
                    Cairo. Many of its visitors have taken up their quarters for the entire season,
                    as in the case of Colonel and Mrs. Stuart Davidson, the Rey. R. Somers and Mrs.
                    Somers, Mrs. Nisbet, the Missee Hyde Page and others. Senator Adamoli is also
                    making a long stay with his wife and charming young daughters, the Duke Leopold
                    Torlona is rejoining his son again in few days on his return from Italy. Don
                    Ferdinand Osorio y Elola, the Spanish minister, and his wife are making the
                    Angleterre their headquarters, and among the latest arrivals are Major and Mrs.
                    Hickman, and Mrs. Moly neux and Miss Froom. Though the Angleterre is by way of
                    being a quiet hotel, in comparison with the others, various forms of
                    entertainment vary the proceedings dinner parties often be ing arranged during
                    those evenings when the orchestra is in attendance. This management was the
                    first to acquire the services of the "Imperial Pierrots" who have just arrived
                    in Cairo, and their performance given in the dining hall on Wednesday night was
                    very welcome innovation to the ordinary programme of evening amusements. This
                    troupe is under the leadership of Mr. Harry Sellars, and its to pertoire
                    consists of part songs and solos of a distinctly pleasing and popular variety.
                    Ita members are gifted with good voices and their performances will fill a long
                    felt want. They had a very good audience at their first appearance and made a
                    distinct impression upon their hearers It is Mr. Sellars intention to appear at
                    the other hotels in turn, and doubtless these pierrots will do much to add to
                    the distractions of the season.</p>

                <p>There was a meeting of the Nationalist Party yesterday afternoon at Cairo to
                    consider the question of opening a subscription for the Denishwai prisoners.</p>
                <p>The health of Mustapha Pasba Kamel still leaves a great deal to be desired. On
                    Wednesday evening at 9 o'clock he had a relapre and doctors had to be summoned
                    in haste. On the advice of his medical advisers he has gone to Zeitoun.</p>
                <p>The organ of Mustapha Pasha Kamelis excessively indignant at the interview with
                    the Khedive, published in the "Daily Telegraph," a summary of which appeared in
                    our special service telegram's yesterday.</p>
                <p>The statesmanlike utterances of His Highness on the position of Egypt do not
                    appear to please Kamel and the fact that the Khedive is stated to have deplored
                    "the tendency of a few young Egyptians to self-advertisement, of their country
                    by legitimate means" is taken as referring to Kamel and his fellows. The
                    "Egyptian Standard" says :</p>
                <p>"The insinuations regarding the National Party are so thinly veiled, and so
                    similar to the hackneyed allegations of juvenility and agitation-mongering
                    against men for the most part over thirty and in many cases over fifty years of
                    age who are moreover distinguished for their pacific utterance that we cannot
                    for a moment abuse H.H. the Khedive by believing that the reported interview is

                    Party, bas issued a manifesto on the subject of the daplicity of the attitude of
                    the National Party in regard to the pardon of the Denishwai prisoners. He
                    especially stigmatizes the Nationalists for attributing the pardon entirely to
                    their own efforts, instead of to the clemency of Great Britain.</p>

                <p>The management of the Semiramis Hotel is to be congratulated on the excellence of
                    the dance which was held within its walls on New Year's night, and which was
                    attended by the greater proportion of those whose presence always makes for
                    success. The position of the Semiramis is altogether in its favour lying as it
                    does in the most fashionable quarter of the town and halfway between Cairo and
                    Ghezireh, and now that people are beginning to appreciate its many advantages
                    and comforts it will surely take its place among the most popular and
                    fashionable hotels in the place.</p>
                <p>The ballroom is perhaps the most spacious as it is one of the most beautiful that
                    we have at our disposal, and the parquet floor promises to be well nigh perfect
                    after a little more use. The orchestra is of the very best, and the buffet and
                    other arrangements all deserve the biggest praise. It is evident that the
                    management has spared neither time nor trouble in providing its guests with
                    entertainment of the most attractive quality, and it was gratifying to note on
                    Wednesday evening that those present were appreciating to the full the efforts
                    made on their behalf. Though never too crowded, there were plenty of people to
                    make dancing enjoyable, wbile many others surveyed the animated scene from their
                    comfortable chairs in the spacious hall. A great number of the officers of both
                    the Egyptian Army and the Army of Occupation were present and among the others
                    noticed during the evening were :-Colonel and Mrs. Parker, Mrs. de B. Carey with
                    Princess Irene Duleep Singh and Miss Carey, Mrs. Maclean and Miss Barnes

                <p>"IL TROVATORE."</p>
                <p>Verdi's grand old favorite "Il Trovatore" attracted a large audience at the
                    Zizinia Theatre last evening who were exceptionally demonstrative in their
                    appreciation of the talent displayed by the various artistes concerned. The
                    production on the whole was a good one. There were certain small defects,
                    however, which we are confident will not be in evidence on the repetition of the
                    opera. Among the principals special mention should be made of Signorina Bianca
                    Besolü as Leonors who gave a conscientious interpretation of the character,
                    several of ger numbers being admirably rendered ; also Signor Oreste Benedetti
                    as the Count di Luna. His faithful performance of this rather trying character
                    fully justifies us in our expectations of his abilities, expressed in our notice
                    of "Faust."</p>
                <p>* As Manrico, Signor Mario Gilion excelled himself and was on several occasions
                    vociferously applauded. The famous aria which concludes the third act, "Di
                    quella pira" had to be repeated thrice, the applause being uproarious. His
                    rendering also of the favorite "Oh obe la morte ognora" met with great
                    appreciation. The ballet "Zingaresce" thongh short was well executed and Signor
                    Enza Longhi received a call to the footlights. The chorus was again excellent,

                <p>The Empress Eugénie, who has just arrived in Cairo will not make her first
                    prolonged sojourn in this country under the present dispensation. Close upon
                    forty years ago, in the November of 1869, when Paris was still " dancing on its
                    volcano," and Sedan was in preparation, her Majesty, then with all the prestige
                    of an Empress substantive, led the way in the Imperial yacht "Aigle” to the
                    entrance of the Suez Canal. Of her following were the present Emperor of
                    Austria, the then Crown Prince of Prussia and future German Emperor, Prince
                    William of Orange, the English and Russian Ambassadors at “Constant” and a great
                    company of British and foreign captains of commerce. Monsignor Bager, the
                    Empress's almoner, conducted the Catholic religious ceremony, and thanked her
                    Majesty for the deep interest she had displayed in the work. Do Lesseps had
                    already acknowledged the obligation he was under to General Francis Rawdon
                    Chesney, R. A., when he styled the first authority who pronounced the project
                    feasible 'Tho Father of the Suer Conal.” The procession of forty ships, the
                    Aigle leading throughout, completed the passage to the Red Sea, in some
                    eight-and-forty hours, on November 19, 1869.</p>
                <p>The Empress will pay a visit to Ceylon after leaving Egypt and will be the guest
                    of Sir Thomas Lipton there.</p>
                <p>The Duchess of Aosta, who has much bene." fitted in health since her stay at the
                    Grand Hotel at Khartoum, left the capital of the Su. dan on New Year's Day for a
                    voyage up the White Nile to Gondokoro. The Princess will return by British East
                    Africa.</p>

                <p>The Earl of Sandwich is amongst the many well-known English people who are going
                    abroad in search of sunshine, and is starting for Egypt next week. Lord
                    Sandwich, who celebrated his sixty-eighth birthday in the summer, is apt to find
                    the English winter somewhat trying, and intends to make a prolonged stay in
                    Egypt, part of his time being spent in a journey up the Nile.</p>
                <p>The "Pall Mall Gazette" says:</p>
                <p>Sir John Aird, whose condition is said to be critical, should have many outside
                    sympsthisers, and that not only in Egypt, where the barrage at Assouan is his
                    great memorial, but, a good deal nearer home, at Berlin. That Berlin has the
                    like of its present water supply is due, not to any German, but to the great
                    British engineer, of whom it may indeed be said that his name has been writ, and
                    pretty largely writ, in water. Otherwise, Paddington owes him its first Mayor;
                    Art, a most shrewd and discriminating patron; and the House of Commons an
                    Amphitryon it will long remember.</p>
                <p>Lord Lanesborough, who goes out with the Duke of Connaught to Malta as his
                    A.D.C., is one of the most popular men in the Guards and during the time he was
                    in Cairo with the 3rd Battalion of the Coldstreams he made many friends. He is a
                    very keen sportsman and a first rate shot. Lady Lanesborough is well known in
                    Cairo society. As Miss Tombs she was one of the great beauties for several
                    London seasons. Like her husband, she is immensely popular, and is certain to be
                    much admired in Malta.</p>

                    <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.”</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir, In his report on the finances of the country, the Financial Adviser
                        dwells on the fact that the cotton crop of the country has not increased in
                        quantity for a number of years I think that the reason is to the found in
                        the fact that all the lands in the northern and larger half of the Delta
                        need frequent refresh ings with rice crops to wash out salts and strengthen
                        the soil, and it is owing to the scarcity of water in summer that this
                        beneficial rotation of rice and cotton can be resorted to on but a small
                        fraction of the lands which need it. Until there is sufficient water to
                        allow of a steady rotation of rice with cotton over two thirds of the area
                        in the Delta, I think there will continue to be no advance in the quantity
                        of cotton produced in Egypt. This rotation of rice with cotton is needed in
                        a considerable part of the Fayoum and I think, even in the poorer soil in
                        Upper Egypt. It would be interesting if those of your readers who have
                        special knowledge on the subject would give their ideas to the public.</p>
                    <p>Yours faithfully</p>
                    <p>W. WILLCOCKS. Cairo, December 30.</p>
                    <p>The remarks of the Financial Adviser on the cotton crop are as follows:</p>
                    <p>The year, as regards the yield of cotton, has been somewhat disappointing.
                        Opening with brilliant results, final results have been unequal, and have
                        not in many cases come up to expectation. The area under cotton was the
                        largest on record, as the table below will show, but the total yield is
                        unlikely to exceed that. of last year. The reasons for this are still
                        somewhat obscure. The price of cotton has been satisfactory.</p>
                    <p>Areas under cotton (1898-1907) These are the declared areas, and are probably
                        underestimated, but will serve for purposes of comparison.)</p>
                    <p>The figures after the years represent the area in feddan :</p>
                    <p>898, 1,121,261 ; 1899, 1,153,305; 1900, 1,230,320 ; 1901, 1,249,884 ; 1902,

                    <p>To the EDITOR OF THE “EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                    <p>Sir,- A few days since I read what purported to be an in extenso translation
                        of the inau. gural speech delivered by Mostafa Pasha Kamel at the meeting of
                        some of the National political parties in Cairo. After reading it, I was
                        mueb at a loss to find out what it meant, and, unless Mustafa has been very
                        badly translated, it oe curred to me that it must have been after listening
                        to some such a discourse that the old Romans invented the above well-known
                        saying, The only thing tangible about the whole speech is the joy of Mustafa
                        at meeting his friends and hearing the sound of bis own voice, for when
                        deprived of that element, all that remains accounts to about as much as the
                        residue of a burst soap bubble.</p>
                    <p>I am told that in the original, this may have been a poetical effusion for
                        which some licence is required, but even if that be the case I
            <cb n="3"/>
                
               should like to tell the owner of all “Egyptian Standards" that if he wants
                        poetry it may be used so as to convey some meaning ;-as applied to many of
                        his political sayings, I would suggest something in this style:</p>
                    <p>“Write the characters in dust, </p>
                    <p>“Stamp them on the running stream, </p>
                    <p>"Print them on the moon's pale beam, </p>
                    <p>"And each evanescent letter, </p>
                    <p>"Shall be firmer, purer, better, </p>
                    <p>“And more permanent I ween, </p>
                    <p>“Than the things those letters mean,"</p>
                    <p>Now this is very good poetry, but it is not devoid of meaning, and I think
                        your readers and those of the "Standards” will admit that it has some truth
                        in it.</p>
                    <p>It may be that Mustafa, in his studies of the beautiful language in which the
                        “Revue des deux Mondes" is written, has learnt that "La parole est donnée à
                        l'homme pour déguiser sa pensée"; if so I can only say that he is an apt

                    <p>To The EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir, The chairman at the recent meeting having stated that the board had
                        nothing they desired to hide, the following are a few points upon which
                        further information might be forthcoming: -</p>
                    <p>In the balance sheet to the 31st March 1907 amongst the assets are the
                        following: </p>

                    <p>75.000</p>
                    <p>L.E. 84.251 exclusive of goodwill. land, buildings co. The company does not
                        therefore look as though it should have been in such a terribly unhealthy
                        condition as to require L.E. 54,000 written off as lost. The fact that
                        Messrs Bondi. Pomeroli and Dorling (or the majority of the board) are
                        interested in the businesses bought and résold is a reason why they cannot
                        be too frank in giving their reasons for the steps proposed. It is
                        incredible that the three businesses whilst under the same management which
                        built them up should have so deteriorated in eight months that only a
                        fraction of their cost can be obtained for them on a resale to the original
                        proprietors. If it is a fact surely the board should say who is responsible
                        for the extraordinary depreciation and make them responsible to the
                        company.</p>
                    <p>It is said that Messrs Grant, Bondi and Chinn are to retain the profits made
                        during the current year by their branch upon the company's capital and
                        further that they are to be given free the company's sanitary branch in
                        Alexandria as well as Mr. Pezzi's sanitary business in Cairo.</p>
                    <p>Anyway, apart from the question as to what the management have been doing
                        during the past eight or nine months we want to know what they propose to do
                        in the future. The idea of selling off profitable branches at a cheap rate
                        to strengthen the head office strikes one as similar to a man cutting off
                        his arms aud legs to strengthen his head, but one also wonders what the head
                        office is going to do as a building concern only, without any working
                        capital, (apparently with still a part of the bank overdraft) a large and
                        expensive board of directors, and a manager drawing over a thousand per
                        annum. Has it any possibility of success? Does the present management when
                        judged by its past exploits inspire any confideuce in its ability to pull
                        the company through the mess into which they have landed it. The
                        sharebolders in this concern appear to have been not at all well treated and
                        it is to be hoped that they will accept the chair. man's offer to
                        investigate the position before attending the next general meeting on the

                    <p>The city is generally considered to be very fortunate that possesses a river.
                        But Khartoum crowns and Watches over three and these three amongst the
                        greatest rivers of the world. From the troublesome magic of the Bar El Gazal
                        and its sudd grass, from the hot confines of the Equator, the White Nile
                        fetches its milky waters ; from the axure mountains of Abyssinia and
                        througla the heat of the country's savage heart the Blue Nile flows to the
                        Sudan Created in this fashion, and seeming to have rushed down south, rather
                        than as it does, run northward, the Egyptian Nile is formed, and in return
                        touches the city only to take its course again to the sea. Khartoom is built
                        above this concourse of waters, but the windy currents have less interest
                        for her than has the melancholy, waste whose historio miles make the Sadan
                        famous for both defeat and victory. The desert bay already wrought famine
                        and destruction, aud if not quite so dangerously portentous now, the
                        wilderness is nevertheless always sinister, and it is over this wild
                        territory that Khartoum keeps vigilant guard.</p>
                    <p>There is a desolation, a mystery about it, and of all the mirage that cover
                        the denert's face none gives the feeling of being more ephemeral than
                        Khartoum does, poised, so it might seem, on the face of the African earth.
                        Its history has been so vivid, its destruction so swift and complete, that
                        even its present stolid foundations as yet scarcely seem really to pos. sess
                        the soil. This is only a fancy. Khartoum, when we realise the force that has
                        commanded it once again to take form, and planted its foundations deep in
                        the minds of two nations, must possess a very real identity.</p>
                    <p>One enters the palace from the hot street into the Sirdar's cool ball running
                        the palace's length. Besido cannon once used by Hicks Pasha against the
                        Dervishes, retaken by them, and finally secured by Kitchener in 1898, stand
                        Sudanese guards in unitorm of white linen, bright sashes round their waists,
                        and the richest produot of their provinces-black ostrich plumes - nodding
                        from their turbans. Along the stucco walls, eloquent ag are all trophies of
                        warfare, range the arms and weapons taken from the Mabdi's and Khalifa's
                        troops. Their primitive manufacture make these baroque decorations
                        particulary-touching. They are of steel and brass and iron, of rotten wood,
                        of pi. thy wood, worm-eaten and flimsy, pitiful and rude, at no time ever.
                        fit weapons of defence against Remingtons and Winehesters and West tern
                        flint and steel. Pitiful and rude, these weapons of defeat bristle and
                        dangle, but all the menace they ever had is passed. In front of this savage
                        dado used to wind the staircase which Gordon descended when he faced his
                        companions, and where he stood to fall; and if these paltry weapons could
                        not resist English and Egyptian firearms, they could at least massacre
                        Gordon, and thus they awaken little sympathy as they range along the palace
                        wall.</p>
                    <p>The fresh coolness of the corridor is broken by an arch, through which &amp;
                        vista opens into the wide, big outlook--the doorway upon such a garden as
                        books of childhood all describe. The Sirdar's garden is like a dream come
                        true: one looks with delight into the dense greenness, the feathery softness
                        of vine, tangle, and shrub; into palm shadow and the glare of a tropica
                        paradise. Acacias, mimosa, branches of feathery yellow; oleander and jasmine
                        and tamarisk clus. ter, flower, and perfume; and triumpbant and abundant and
                        all-pervading red roses colour the scene. The fragrance is augmented by the
                        odour of the land itself: river winds, desert winds, the scent of musk and
                        sandal enter by the great doorway and mount the staircase, climb up the
                        ghostly stairway that seems to rise from the floor; and season after season

                    <p>1908 is the twenty-third year of issue of this most indispensable publication
                        It is the object of the Annual to put ready to the hand of the busy man as
                        many as possible of the facts and figures which he is likely to need, during
                        the coming year. To do this it is necessary both to keep a vigilant eye on
                        the past, especially, but not entirely, on the past year; and to anticipate
                        as intelligently and successfully as pos. sible what the course of events in
                        the coming year maybe. The present volume is the resultant of the action of
                        those two forces. Out of the past there bas been taken all that seemed
                        necessary either for the purposes of historical record, or for use by way of
                        reference during 1908.</p>
                    <p>In the case of foreign countries and of British Dominions beyond the sens, it
                        is particularly useful to have at hand a concise account of their political,
                        military, naval, financial, and commercial condition and resources, and some
                        record of the past year which may serve to make present events more
                        intelligible. There is no publication, it is believed, which attempts to do
                        this in the way that the Annual does.</p>

                    <p>(From our own correspondent)</p>
                    <p>Esna, December 30. </p>
                    <p>On Saturday, 18th inst., a football match was played here on the ground of
                        John Aird and Co., Esna, between the employees and the Government School,
                        Esna, resulting in a win for the former ; the school team won the toss and
                        play commenced at 3.80 sharp, At the sound of the whistle the ball was soon
                        set in motion. The school team making a rapid dash for the home goal where
                        they looked like scoring, only the goalkeeper being on his mettle just
                        managed to clear, transferring the ball to midfield, when the home forward a
                        after a few minutes hard play managed to net the first goal. On piay being
                        resumed the ball was confined to one end of the field and after a bit of
                        tricky play the home team managed to peg another notch just as the whistle
                        blew, the score standing, Employees 2 School 0. The play being resumed the
                        school having the wind with them and playing strong they tried hard to
                        change the score and gave the home goalkeeper plenty to do, who saved well
                        and cleared to midfield again where the for. wards were waiting, and having
                        a clear field netted the third goal for the home team. The School tried hard
                        to score but the defence was proof against all attacks and after the play
                        being in midfield for sometime the school got away and were trying their
                        hardest to score when the whistle blow, the score standing Employees 3
                        School 0 ; the school played well bat their opponents seemed too strong for
                        them. A return match will be played at an early date, when probably they
                        will reverse matters. </p>
                    <p>i H. M. S. "DIANA" v. R. A. M. C.</p>
                    <p>Teams representing the above met at Rasel-Tin on Saturday, December 28th. The
                        ground was in good condition and as both teams were at full strength &amp;
                        good game was promised to the large crowd which assembled for the start. The
                        teams turned out as follows.</p>
                    <p>H.M.S. "Diana”: Murphy, Boyd, Crowe, Davies, Thompson (Capt) and Maclean,
                        Mellor, Jeffrey, Jarvey, Ellis, and Stokes.</p>
                    <p>H.M.S. "Diana”: Murphy, Boyd, Crowe, Davies, Thompson (Capt) and Maclean,
                        Mellor, Jeffrey, Jarvey, Ellis, and Stokes."</p>
                    <p>RA.M.C. Speller, Tibbet, Sims, Welsh, Vid dler, Reynolds, Soody, Tripp,
                        WcArthur, Skelly and Barnes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Magee was referee. VH.M.S. "Diana" won the toss and hostilities were
                        commenced by McArthur kicking off for the stripes before 500 spectators.</p>
                    <p>The Navy men then took up the running, Mellor, Jeffrey and Stokes, combining
                        well got close to Speller, who saved at the expense of a corner which proved
                        abortive, Touch was the order for some time until Tripp rushed away for the
                        soldiers, gave to Skelly who went clean through the opposition and with a
                        beauty opened the scoring for the home team. Not being disheartened by this
                        reverse the Navy got away and Speller was treated to several hot shots,
                        coming, however, through the ordeal with flying colours until a splendid
                        combined movement by the Navy front rank ended in Ellis equalizing the
                        score. Play was mostly in favour of the sailors and the home defence was
                        kept busy. The R.A.M.C., pulling theniselves together, Tripp and Skelly
                        perform ed wonders, their play reminded one of the oncé famous Bassett and
                        Bloomer wing. Both teams were in fine fettle and the pace now was a cracker.
                        A free kick for a foul throw in against the R.A.M.C., let the Navy away only
                        for Mellor to spoil a splendid opportuity by getting offside. The visitors
                        were now buckling to and Jarvey when well placed had po difficul. ty in
                        giving his side the lead amidst cheers. Play ruled even froin this to the
                        interval when the scores stood.</p>
                    <p>H.M.S. "Diana" 2 goals, R.A.M.C. I goal.</p>
                    <p>Play in the second half was opened by Jarvey and soon became brisk, the
                        soldiers pressing for all they were worth. The Navy's defence was severely
                        pressed but Soody wher in good position sent past Both teams were going
                        great guns each goal being quickly visited in turn but all to no avail, as
                        both custodians were in good form. Good play by Skelly gave Barnes a
                        glorious opportunity. Taking the ball up he centred to McArthur who promptly
                        popped the ball into the net making the scores equal. Play now became
                        exceedingly keen the spectators urging their favorites to strive for the
                        winning point. Midfield play followed. A free kick relieved matters and let
                        the R A.M.C. away, but over excitement spoiled the attempt to score. The
                        soldiers were now playing hard and the visitors goalkeeper Murphy, had to
                        mind his P's. and Q's. Reynolds was very prominent in this half and some of
                        his shots deserved more result than was fated for them. Mellor on the right
                        for the Navy took the ball up and shot for goal. Speller saved three times
                        in succes. sion before acknowledging defeat to the shot by Mellor, which was
                        to win the match. Full time was approaching fast and play was car. ried to
                        the visitors end in a last try for an equalising goal. Viddler missed by
                        inches and just on the call of time Murphy saved the draw by a neat save.
                        The game resulted.</p>
                    <p>H.M.S. "Diana” 3 goals. RA.M.C. 2 goals.</p>
                    <p>After the match the visitors from H.M.S. "Diana" were entertained to tea by
                        the R.A.M.C.</p>

                    <p>The Duke of Connaught on taking up his duties at Malta an Commander in Chief
                        of the Mediterranean garrisons, will have practically the staff that he had
                        whilst holding the appointment of Inspector General to the Forces He and the
                        Duchess will embark for Valetta about the 2nd January, leaving Marseilles on
                        that date</p>
                    <p>The new appointment will tend to throw Gibraltar more into the shade, as it
                        will be overshadowed by supreme entrol from Malta, but virtually the
                        appointment will not interfere with things in Egypt For a considerable time
                        the Army Council was undecided as to whether Malta or Cairo should be made
                        the Duke's headquarters, but eventually the island garrison was chosen as
                        the most central point. How this will work in wartime is another
                        question.</p>
                    <p>An exchange has been sanctioned between Captain the Honourable A.C. Murray,
                        2nd Battalion 5th Ghurka Rifles, Indian Army, and Captain J.M.V. Stewart,
                        2nd Battalion King's Own Scottish Borderers. Captain Murray, who joined the
                        Indian Staff Corps in 1899, and he holds the China medal for the Boxer
                        campaign of 1900</p>
                    <p>Orders have been given that driver recruites for the Royal Field Artillery
                        must be between 5 ft. 5 in. and 5 ft. 7 in. in height.</p>
                    <p>In the current issue of the Army List, Officers of the Militia, Yeomanry and
                        Volunteers who have seen active service are so distinguished by crossed
                        swords opposite their names.</p>
                    <p>It has been decided that from the commencement of the musketry training of
                        the year 1908, the quantity of small arms ammunition to be expended by every
                        trained cavalry and infantry soldier for practice and exercise under
                        paragraph 1-5, Part 1, shall be limited to 250 rounds.</p>
                    <p>The new torpedo boat destroyer "Tartar" has just established a world's record
                        in fast steaming. At her recent speed trials off Maplin, over the measured
                        core she ran six consecutive trials at an average speed of 85.672 knots per
                        hour, 35.363 knots per hour on the six hours' continuous steaming trial and
                        on the measured mile she recorded a speed of 37 037 knots, or the equivalent
                        of 44 miles per hour. Her builders are Messrs Thorneycroft, and the
                        Admiralty stipulated only for 33 knots. The</p>
                    <p>Tartar," which is one of a flotilla of seven similar boats, measures 270 feet
                        in length, with a beam of 26 feet, and a displacement of 795 tons. She is
                        fitted with turbine driven engines of 14,500 h.p. supplied by oil fired
                        water to be boilers. The armament consists of three 12 pounder quickfirers,
                        and the usual torpedo equipment for the discharge of 18-inch torpedos, of
                        which she will carry a senre, and the crew will consist of 60 of all
                        ranks.</p>
                    <p>Next year's have maneuvers are to be held in the North Sen. Over 130
                        battleships, cruisers, and smaller ships will participate.</p>
                    <p>An idea of the naval strength concentrated in home waters may be gathered
                        from the fact that between Christmas and the New Year some 80,000 men and
                        marines of the Channel, Atlantic and Home Fleets will proceed on leave. The
                        Channel Fleet has not been at home at this time of the year for a long
                        period.</p>

                    <p>Comme vous l'observerez dans la répartition des bénéfices, nons avons jugé
                        utile de porter au Fonds de Renouvellement une somme de L.E. 5.000 au lieu
                        de L. E. 4 000 oomme l'an dernier, et cela en considération de
                        l'augmentation de matériel roulant pendant l'exercice. Nous avons en outre
                        prélevé, sur les bénéfices unesomme de L.E. 500 en prévision de risques
                        éventuels, d'accidents et de procès en cours. Nous sommes heureux de dire
                        que pendant l'exercice que nous venons de clôturer, le trafic n'a cessé de
                        se développer, donnant un résultat des plus satisfaisants. En effet, les
                        recettes ont atteint le chiffre de P.T. 7.268.916, 6, contre P.T. 6.423.077,

                        4.79.634. 2, tandis qne l'exercice passé elles étaient de P.T. 8.702.353, 5;
                        elles n'ont donc augmenté que de P.T. 477.280. 7, laissant une augmentation

                <head>BULLETIN DE LA BOURSE</head>
                <p>Vendredi 8 Janvier. </p>
                <p>On a ouvert ce matin très ferme et avec une Avance générale de la cote. Mais en
                    cours de séance, comme cela arrive à la suite de toutes les poussées rapides, il
                    s'est produit un ralentissement dans la demande et l'on a cloture onlme avec une
                    certaine impression de lour deur. En faveur de la reprise on invoqne la
                    réduction de taux officiel de la Banque d'An. gleterre de 7 a 6 0/0, ce qui est
                    un indice d'une détente monétaire, ainsi que la baisse du tanx privé à 50/0.
                    Cependant, on ne doit pas perdre de vue que la réserve de la Banque a diminue A
                    85 5/8 0/0,contre 40 0/0 la semaine dernière D'autre part, il est probable qu'il
                    passers en core quelque temps avant que nos banques locales se décident à
                    réduire les taux écrasarts qu'elles prélèvent sur leur clientèle. Jusques-là la
                    cberté de l'argent exercera son action sur notre marché. Il n'en est pas moins
                    vrai que la baisse du taux d'escompte, si elle s'accentue en Europe, finira par
                    déterminer ici one redno tion proportionnelle et une reprise générale, dès que
                    surtout le taux sera descendu à un prix inférieur au rendement de la plupart des
                    valenrs de premier ordre.</p>
                <p>Pour en revenir à nos valeurs, la National Bank se relève de 19 13/16 à 20 1/4,
                    la Ramleb ile 4 1/8 4 1/4, l'Alexandria Water de 10 1/4 à 10 3/8, la Daira de 12
                    3 4 à 12 7/8, les Lots Tores de 164 à 165, la Banque d'Athènes de 112 &amp; 114,
                    la Land Bank de 7 1/16 à 71/8, le Crédit Franco-Egyptien de 3 15/16 à 4 et la
                    Banque d'Orient de 112 A 114.</p>
                <p>L'obligation Crédit Foncier reprend égale. mont de 270 1/2 à 274 l'ancienne et de
                    250 12</p>
                <p>251 1/4 la nouvelle.</p>
                <p>Au contraire, la Delta Light réactionne de 9 1/2 A 9 13/32, les Dividendes
                    Tramways d'Alexandrie de 277 à 276, les Privilégiées Bière d'Alexandrie de 115 à
                    112; mais ou la baisse est vraiment sensible, c'est sur les Nun govich Hotels
                    qui tombent de 14 1 2 à 12, en raison d'offres persistantes</p>
                <p>Parmi les titres de moindre importance, les Markets progressent de 22/3 24/la
                    Spinning de 7/32 à 1/4, les Cotton Mills de 1 à 1/3, la Salt and Soda de 13/- à
                    147, la Cassa di Sconto de 44 &amp; 48 1/2, la Delta Land de 1 à 1 1/16,
                    l'Investment de 5/16 &amp; 11/32, les Estates de 11/32" 3/8, le Comptoir de 2 à

                    à 3.</p>
                <p>L'Ordinary Khedivial Mail s'inscrit en baisse de 2 sbellings á 17/9 ex-coupon et
                    la Port-Said Salt fléchit de 11 3 8 11/</p>
                <p>Sur le reste de la cote il n'y a pas de changomont à signaler. Comme nous le
                    disons au début, la tendance est un peu lourde, bien qu'on ait oloturé soutenu.
                    Avec de bonnes nouvelles persistantes du dehors, l'amélioration pourrait
                    toutefois se consolider .</p>
                <p>Un correspondant nous demande si un sim ple actionnaire peut obliger une société
                    Anonyme anglaise établie en Egypte et enregistrée suivant The Companies' Acts, à
                    lui fournir une copie du bilan et du rapport des censeurs. Nous pouvons répondre
                    à ce sujet que dans les débats sur le nouvean "Companies' Bill" on a introduit
                    et adopté un article d'après lequel un actionnaire peut exiger une copie do
                    bilan et du rapport des censeurs à un prix ne dé. passant pas six pence par
                    millier de mots Quant au prétexte invoqué par certaines socié. tés d'éviter la
                    concurrence commerciale, le Ministère estime que toute société anonyme établie
                    sur des basés solides n'a rien à craindre d'une telle publicité et ne doit pas
                    hésiter à foumir les renseignements en question un actionnaire qui lui a confié
                    tout son avoir.</p>
                <p>Nous extrayons du rapport du Conseil d'Ad. ministration de la "Nile Cold Storage
                    Cy. Ltd" la à l'assemblée générale ordinaire qui a eu lieu le 14 écoulé, les
                    renseignements suivants : La balance des comptes pour le présent exercice au 30
                    Juin 1907 qui comprenait une pé. riode de 18 mois, montre pour cette durée une
                    perte de £ 5,535.10.7 contre Latg. 10,000 durant la période précédente qui
                    s'étendait depuis le début des opérations de la compagnie au 31 Décembre 1905.
                    Grace aux mesures prises par le Conseil d'Administration, les pertes ont diminué
                    de mois en mois et récemment ont été remplacées par de légers bénéfices que le
                    Conseil espère maintenir et augmenter considérable ment dans la suite. Les
                    affaires du Caire et de Port-Said sont solidement établies et les
                    administrateurs envisagent la possibilité d'étendre les opérations de la société
                    à Alexandrie A la suite de la démission en Mai dernier, de Sir John Rogers de
                    ses fonctions de président du Conseil d'administration, Mr. Dr. Herbert Milton a
                    été élu président du Conseil. Mr. Astley P. Friend, ayant démissionné de
                    directeur de la société a été nommé ingénieur-conseil. M. A. J. Tweedie, a été
                    confirmé comme administrateur et M. Herbert Milton réélu en la même qualité. MM.
                    Russell, Kerr and Wyatt ont été réélus comme censeurs.</p>

                <p>TO OUR VISITORS.</p>
                <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                    accompaning description of some of the many interesting routes by which they may
                    travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as accurately and
                    concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them are fraught with
                    difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several things to be
                    considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate between Egypt and
                    the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. <hi rend="italic"
                            >Giardini</hi> is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to
                        Taormina is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the
                        town is much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                        restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of
                        Etna, and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic
                        remains that are found all over the island, are an endless sources of
                        pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a Greek city,
                        which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in
                        B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be seen. The cathedral
                        was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with about 300,000 inhabitants,
                        is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful climate. Much of
                        interest is to be found in this fine city. <hi rend="italic">The Palazzo
                            Reale</hi> is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of <hi
                                rend="italic">S. Giovannia degli Eremiti</hi> with its picturesque
                        cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal
                        Park are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—<hi rend="italic">Castellamare</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Sorrento</hi>. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento [you can
                        drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        <hi rend="italic">City of Flowers</hi> and its surrounding country. In
                        Florence itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst
                        the local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. <hi rend="italic"
                            >The Cascine</hi> is the most attractive and fashionable promenade in
                        Florence, whilst the <hi rend="italic">Viale dei Colli</hi>, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to <hi rend="italic">Vallombrosa</hi>, with its <hi
                            rend="italic">Monastery</hi> 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is
                        made first by ordinary train from Florence to <hi rend="italic">St.
                            Ellero</hi>, thence by cog-wheel railway to <hi rend="italic"
                                >Saltino</hi>. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                        striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool

                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,

                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea. No hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi> you make the tour of the
                        beautiful Italian lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come <hi rend="italic"
                            >Tremezzo</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Cadenabbia</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"

                                    >Bellaggio</hi> opposite. The walk from <hi rend="italic">Tremezzo</hi>

                        by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt,” by Bramantion.</p>
