                    <head>WEDNESDAY, JULY 11, 1906</head>
                    <p>TURKISH CUSTOMS DUES. Lord Newton is to be congratulated for initiating
                        Monday’s discussion in the Upper House on the proposed increase of the
                        Turkish Customs, and it is satisfactory to have the assurance of the Under
                        Secretary for Foreign Affairs that such a discussion cannot be injurious to
                        the pending negotiations between the Porte and the Powers. A certain
                        uneasiness had been created recently among critics of our policy in the Near
                        and Middle East owing to the cot unfounded rumour that his Majesty’s
                        Government had already consented to the proposed it crease without
                        sufficient guarantees as to its employment. It had been known for sometime
                        that Sir Edward Grey had consented in principle to the Turkish request, and
                        his somewhat vague replies to recent questions in the Hon e of Commons
                        contributed to a belief that the terms of the new arrangement were
                        practically agreed upon. Monday’s discussion elicited tin valuable
                        information that the British conditions were unacceptable to the tarte, and
                        that, in Lord Fitzmaurice’s own words, the negotiations stand “at almost
                        exactly the same point at which they stood when the late Government left
                        office.” </p>
                    <p>There are three classes of people in England for whom the suggested increase
                        of the Turkish Customs has a particular interest. First in consideration,
                        from a practical point of view, are the British manufacturers and export
                        houses on whom, in spite of the Cob- denite faith, will fall the additional
                        3 per cent., their share of Turkish imports attaining the large proportion
                        of three fifths of the whole import trade of Turkey. In the second rank must
                        be placed those politicians and patriots who desire that the duties shall
                        not be raised unless the object to be gained be the permanent strengthening
                        of British Imperial interests in both the Near and the Middle East, in the
                        third place is the large humanitarian class who are careless of anything but
                        the immediate alleviation of the condition of the unfortunate Macedonian
                        peasants, for whom the suggested increase is ostensibly intend ed. To the
                        humanitarian class, composed of well-meaning English men and women, it may
                        be pointed out that too much value may easily be attached to the very
                        doubtful efficacy of a regulated Macedonian Budget. Lord Lansdowne, whose
                        term of office as Foreign Secretary covered the first active pourparlers on
                        the suggested increase and whom nobody would accuse of indifference to the
                        anarchy in Macedonia, would appear to be sceptical as to the absolute
                        necessity of the increase and as to its use as a remedy for the ills of the
                        Macedonian peasantry. Other competent critics admit that the Financial
                        Commission which needs the funds will certainly have a greater power for
                        good work, bat that at best that power will be very ineffectual for purposes
                        of genuine administrative reform Other candid authorities roundly assert in
                        opposition to the Austrian opinions quoted to-day by our Vienna
                        Correspondent that European interference in Macedonia is necessarily a free
                        owing to international jealousies, and the somewhat pathetic official
                        admission that the British demands have been watered down for the sake of
                        unity lends colour to this assertion. It is therefore but natural that the
                        “pending negotiations” should not be dominated by a desire to apply the
                        wrong remedy to an admittedly active disease. It is another matter when we
                        consider the claims of British traders and manufacturers, and it is
                        satisfactory to have official assurance that so far as Great Britain is
                        concerned, consent will not be given to the 3 pier cent increase except on
                        condition of the valuable quid pro quo of proper collection and better
                        administration of the entire service of the Turkish Customs. </p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>As regards the purely political aspect the whole question Lord Fitzmaurice,
                        beyond stating the truism that the chromic Macedonian unrest is a menace to
                        European quiet, was not ready with very illuminating arguments in favour of
                        the proposed increase. Every speaker, the Under Secretary himself with
                        apparent disrelish, departed from the ostensible to the real reason. The
                        demand for the 3 per cent. increase is only a Turkish demand in a secondary
                        degree ; the proposed earmarking only an ostensible earmarking— a
                        topographical inexactitude It is notorious that a German financial group,
                        the promoters of the Baghdad Railway, desire, the increase as a sore means
                        of facilitating at least the second and third sections of their great
                        undertaking. It is also notorious that British policy has hitherto elected
                        to discountenance if not to obstract the constriction of the Baghdad
                        Railway, and it is perhaps not straining criticism of his able exposition
                        too far to say that between the lines of Lord Fitzmaurices statement one may
                        read the admission that German capitalists are powerfully interested in the
                        British decision on this important question. So far back as the year 1901
                        the Agents of the Deutsche Bank were looking to an increase in the Turkish
                        Customs as the only feasible and satisfactory guarantee of the kilometric
                        guarantee necessary to the saoos3sfil construction of this great trunk line
                        to the Persian Gulf. A section of the line has been built in haste in order
                        to secure or confirm the concession ; but a halt has been called at the foot
                        of the Taurus Range—even German capitalists enthused with the dream of a
                        German Asiatic Turkey cannot proceed without a guarantee of the Turkish
                        Government — and it were really idle to suppose that the brilliant
                        combination of diplomacy and finance at Germany’s disposal in Constantinople
                        will not find a way, by means of the increased Customs, to set free other
                        Turkish revenue for the purposes of the auxiously needed kilometric
                        guarantee. To assert and believe this it is by no means De- ci38ary to adopt
                        what the Under Secretary suggests would be a “dog in-the-manger policy.'
                        Detraction to the Baghdad Railway scheme is not necessarily the best British
                        policy. Lord Lansdowne confessed on Monday that he had attempted and failed

                        of 1903. But with the German cuds upon the table it would be distinctly
                        naive to throw up the game before consulting oar own. It is extremely
                        doubtful whether an additional £600,000 a year, under the poor
                        administrative powers vouchsafed to the Financial Commission and the
                        gendarmerie, will do much for the Macedonian peasantry; it is certain the 3
                        percent. increase will fall upon British trade with Turkey more heavily than
                        upon any other, and it is highly probable that this increase will be on
                        verted into rails and sleepers across the Taurus to the plain of Adana until
                        at least s junction is effected between the Baghdad and Hedjaz Railways. The
                        Under Secretary in his opening remarks spoke of “the more difficult and
                        delicate question of the Baghdad Railway he referred again to it as “one of
                        the greatest questions of the time,” to be “carefully weighed and
                        considered,” and perhaps not the least satisfactory portion of his statement
                        was the delicacy with which he treated this part of his subject. If it is to

                        Railway is a likely sequel • the present impasse, British interests in
                        Asiatic Turkey will have made an important advance from their previous

                    <head>TURKEY’S REGENERATION. SUPPORT</head>
                    <p>The recent presence of Ghazi Ahmed Mukii- tar Pasha and the Khedive in Vienna
                        has (writes the “Standard’s” Vienna Correspondent) caused some discussion in
                        diplomatic circles as to the recent action of England in Egypt. In Turkish
                        and Egyptian opinion, the attitude of England wa3 unnecessarily harsh. One
                        of my informants exploded himself as follows: — “The Mecca Railway is not
                        only a strategic, but a financial necessity for Turkey, which pays forty to
                        fifty thousand a year at present to the Canal. It could not by any stretch
                        of imagination be believed by England that we wanted in any way to endanger
                        her position in Egypt. </p>
                    <p>“Of course, Turkey would like very much to get Egypt back, and thinks that
                        she still has right to it, having never, in any firman, given more than a
                        lease of it to the family of Mohamed Ali. But she knows very well that the
                        day has gone for any such dreams, and that she never can have the slightest
                        chance of shaking England’s hold. What she does want, though, is to be
                        allowed to keep Arabia for herself, and to ensure her communications. If
                        England had let her have half of the Sinai Peninsula, it would have pleased
                        her, and could have done no harm to Great Britain. The sending of cannon to
                        Akabah hurt the feelings of both Turks and Egyptians as a piece of
                        superfluous abuse of power. England knows that with a couple of ships in the
                        Sea of Marmora she can do what she likes. It is a pity, in the eyes of Turks
                        and Egyptians, that the English Government persist in regarding every effort
                        of Turkey towards strengthening herself as if it were directed against
                        England, or against Christians. The present Government of Turkey may not be
                        all that it should be, but that is the reason why the 'Young Turks’ think
                        that they have a right to look for support to the Power which most blames
                        the misrule, and which is the best able to help them. </p>
                    <p>‘The regeneration of Tut key must come from within, and not from without. If
                        only the reforming element were to be backed up by a Power like England, it
                        would soon prove that the Ottoman Empire is as capable as, for example, the
                        Japanese of adapting itself to the progress of civilisation. The vaunted
                        friendship of Germany is a personal friendship, or agreement, between the
                        Emperor and the Sultan, but no Moslem ever dreams of looking to Germans for
                        help or protection in national aspirations. On the other hand, m spite of
                        the persistent coldness, not to say hostility, shown by England to the
                        Turkish Government, the people of Turkey have never lost faith in England as
                        the Power on whom they must rely ultimately when the time comes.” </p>

                    <p>(From our Correspondent.) Jerusalem, July 5. It is with deep regret that I
                        have to announce the death of Mr. John Dickson, F.R.G.S., H.B.M.’s Consul
                        for Palestine, which occurred yesterday afternoon at Ramallah, a village in
                        the suburbs of this city, from heart failure Deceased had been laid up for
                        nearly two months with malarial fever, which rendered him so feeble that h8
                        expired calmly without suffering any pain, surrounded by the members of his
                        family. </p>
                    <p>The decoded had been taken to Ramallab, a summer healt resort, only the day
                        before, the advice of his medical attendants, who thought that the continual
                        fever might disappear by the change, all medical skill and care having
                        proved unavailing. </p>
                    <p>The funeral was one of the most magnificent and impressive sights witnessed
                        in Jerusalem. The cortege left the house of the deceased, where the body had
                        been brought in last night, at 4 o’clock this afternoon. It was preceded by
                        fifty Turkish soldiers, followed by city guards and policemen, after which
                        came the janissaries of the various consulates, to the number of forty. The
                        coffin, made of solid oak, was carried on a hearse drawn by four horses and
                        covered with the the Union Jack, over which was placed the consular uniform
                        of the deceased and numerous wreaths and crosses. It was followed by the
                        family and after them came the Consuls and their staffs, as well as
                        representatives of the local authorities, all in fall uniform, and a large
                        concourse of people of all nationalities, besides the entire British colony. </p>
                    <p>On arrival at the Jaffa Gate, the principal members of the British colony
                        carried the coffin as far as Christ Church. The church was draped with
                        black, and the Rt. Rev. Bishop Blyth, assisted by Canons Marriott and
                        Carnegie-Brown and five clergymen, conducted the funeral service. At the
                        church assembled delegates of the various churches and communities, amongst
                        them being the Archbishop of Mt. Tabor, Monseigneur Stefano, representing
                        the Greek Patriarch, and the Syrian and Armenian Bishops of Jerusalem. </p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the service Mr. Haydn Righton, the organist, played the
                        Dead March j in “Saul.” From the church the procession continued its way to
                        the English Cemetery on Mount Zion, where the body was interred; I the hymn

                        of tears, terminated the solemnity. </p>
                    <p>The late Consul Dickson was greatly esteemed by ail who knew him. He was very
                        popular for his unfailing courtesy and kindliness. As a zealous and
                        conscientious public servant he was devoted to his duty, which he always
                        performed with great taot and ability, bat unfortunately a good deal of hie
                        valuable time during the latter period of the fifteen years which he spent
                        in Jerusalem was wasted in being called upon to answer malicious inventions
                        and frivolous imputations by two very |eccentric Irish women, who did not
                        think he was well qualified for match-making, which they imagined was part
                        of the counsul’s duty. Although a somewhat tardy stop was pat to those
                        wanton imputations by headquarters he Was, however, vexed and worried so
                        much that his health was affected thereby. </p>
                    <p>The late Consul Dickson was born in the year 1846; was an M. A. of Edinburgh
                        University; was nominated vice consul at Mo8sou1, December 19, 1872; passed
                        an examination March 14, 1873; was acting vice-consul at Damascus in 1875 to
                        1876, when he was appointed H.M.’s Vice Consul at Beyrout, where he acted as
                        Consul-General on several occasions. Io 1882 he was transferred to Damascus
                        as Consul and in 1890 was promoted as Consul for Palestine to reside in
                        Jerusalem. He was mule created a Squire of the Order of St. John of
                        Jerusalem. He leaves a widow, a son, and three daughters. </p>

                        Darlaston Hall and Chatcull, Staffordshire, took place on Monday week at St.
                        Paul’s Church, Knightsbridge. The bride, who was given away by her uncle,
                        Colonel W. N. Jervis, wore a white satin gown covered with lace embroidered
                        with silver, tulle veil, and coronet of orange blossoms. Her banquet was

                    <head>ESBEKIEH THEATRE. </head>
                    <p>A most excellent variety entertainment is at present being given at the
                        Esbekieh Theatre, Cairo, and is certainly deserving of patronage. Not only
                        are the several “tarns” well varied, but the performance is altogether free
                        from the vulgarity which is so often evident in local music-hall
                        representations. The best items presented by the troupe are those of the
                        four Salvinos, the Moustiers, the Brothers Fakitos, and the Brothers Bonnes.
                        The performances of the four Salvino children on their bicycles and single
                        wheels are really marvellous and are equal to any which we have witnessed at
                        home, while the turn of the Moastiers is an excellent illustration of the
                        high state of training to whioch dogs may be brought. The two Brothers
                        Fakitos are described on the programme as “eccentric singers.” One of these
                        has a mellow tenor voice, though of no peculiar distinction, but the second
                        emits most weird bass sounds in perfect tone, which might almost be
                        described as a compromise between a fog horn and a violoncello! The effect,
                        however, is most laugh able. The Brothers Bonnes are “strong men” who
                        perform wonderful feats of strength in the way of supporting each other in
                        peon liar positions, and many of their feats, are mo9t extraordinary. Of
                        other items of the programme the Sisters Gluckstern deserve mention for
                        their singing and dancing ; Evariste, a boy of some twelve years of age,
                        plays most excellently on the xylophone, and Miss Ella gives an
                        exceptionally good exhibition of tight-rope performances. We can say no word
                        of praise in favour of the cinematograph, which is exceptionally poor—even
                        for Cairo! </p>

                        UNPREPARED FOR WAR WANTED- AN EFFICIENT ARMY</head>
                    <p>London, July 10. House of Lords.—Lord Roberts, in a speech, drew attention to
                        the unpreparedness of the nation for war. He emphasized the fact that the
                        Navy could not defend the Empire’s frontiers. He appealed for a sufficient,
                        effiCient, and regular Army Reserve</p>
                    <p>Lord Portsmouth said that Mr. Haldane, on Thursday, would make a statement
                        showing that he had considered the question of a territorial army, bat that
                        a drastic scheme of reorganisation which could not be completed for several
                        years was necessary. He hoped Parliament would agree to make the Militia a
                        real support to the Regulars and liable for foreign service. </p>
                    <p>The country was opposed to conscription. The Government's first task was to
                        ensure a regular army, as efficient as consistent with reasonable
                        expenditure, and its second was to promote expansion outside the regular
                        forces. (Reuter</p>

                        yesterday. Numerous addresses were presented to him. In his speech he dwelt
                        on Tariff Reform which he said was necessary in order to unite the Empire.
                        He was confident that the Free Trade superstition would go. They were not
                        moving as fast as some might desire, but fast enough for him and he hoped to
                        see his cherished ideas successful at an early date. </p>

                        economy for party purposes than for the maintenance of our naval

                    <head>NOTES FROM SYRIA THE PROTESTANT COLLEGE</head>
                    <p>Beyrout, July 4. The Syrian Protestant College celebrated its thirty seventh
                        annual commencement-day on Wednesday last, after the usual varied exercises
                        on the two preceding days. The same solemnity of the processional march of
                        the Faculty and instructors into the imposing Gothic assembly hall,
                        preceding the impressive annual address of the President, and the
                        administration of the oath of office to the medical graduates by the
                        Imperial Ottoman Commission, the same enthusiasm attending the distribution
                        of diplomas and the award of prizes and certificates of merit, and the same
                        thrilling pathos of valedictory greetings when old chums meet, perhaps, for
                        the last time, marked those different functions as they did last year. </p>
                    <p>The number of students this year exceeded 760, of whom 135 are Egyptians, 84
                        Armenians, 75 Greeks, a few dozen of other nationalises—such as English,-
                        French, German, etc.— and the remainder Syrians. And this large gathering of
                        picked youth is divide 1 not only by race but also by religious belie there
                        being 290 Greek Orthodox, 125 Protestants, 100 Moslem*, and 100 belonging to
                        churches affiliate 1 with the Roman Catholic Church, besides a scattering of
                        Jews, Druses, etc. It needs more than mere ability of management to worthily
                        preside over an institution composed of such heterogeneous elements, racial
                        and religious. lt needs also broad human sympathy and high- minded
                        toleration, qualities that the old President Emeritus possessed in a high
                        degree. Fortunately the son succeeded the father with the same broad and
                        high-minded aims, and further equipped with youthful energy and enthusiasm. </p>
                    <p>College Chief Aim</p>
                    <p> Although for plausible reasons the Syrian Protestant College has been
                        founded with a denominational name, yet it is the constant endeavour of the
                        new President to emphasize the tact that the chief aim of the college
                        teaching is the inculcation of the spirit of the Christian doctrine with its
                        high moral code, and the elimination of all dogmatic and denominational
                        tendencies. In fact this is the only rational system applicable to an
                        institution of such a mixed character, and a narrower one is sure to end in
                        failure. Indeed, although the Syrian Protestant College has always seen and
                        still maintains its position as one of the great, if not the greatest,
                        educational factors in Beyrout and the Levant, yet from the mere standpoint
                        of instruction the good it has done and is doing is shared by other foreign
                        and native institutions, such as the Jesuit College, the College Maronite de
                        la Sagesse, the College of Antoura, and others. </p>
                    <p>It is in the formation of character that the Syrian Protestant College claims
                        the honour of being the unique educational factor. Character indeed, is
                        almost the only element lacking to bring the Oriental near the ideal of
                        modern civil zed manhood. The Oriental, especially in this part of the
                        world, has an alert and versatile intellect, and a vivid and rich
                        imagination, and with these natural endowments, were he to be blessed with
                        the educational means contributing to the building up of his character and
                        the training of his will, he would accomplish remarkable achievements in the
                        various departments of social and political life. Add to this
                        character-building and will- training the development of the spirit of
                        organization, and the knowledge of the use of the individual energy in
                        harmony with the national energy, the intelligent subordination of the
                        individual to the collective will, and yon will have created a great people
                        and a great Government. </p>

                        of this scheme. The concession has been granted for 99 years in the name of
                        Selim Effendi Raad, the brother-in-law of Negib l'asha Melhamd. The
                        capitalists that have bought the concession at £40,000 have had to pay,
                        moreover, £10,000 as a loyal donation to the Hedjaz railway, and deposit a
                        certain sum of money at the Imperial Ottoman Bank by way of guarantee for

                    <head>Electric Tramway (continued)</head>
                    <p>scheme. The company is to exist under the style of the “Societe Ottomane
                        Anonyme des Tramways et Eclairage Electrique de Beyrouth,” and its
                        headquarters are to be at Constantinople. Its capital is fixed at "six
                        million francs of 60.0 shares of ICO francs each, of which 3.600.0 francs
                        are to be fully paid up, and the balance completed when required. Each
                        administrator of the company must possess at least fifty shares. </p>
                    <p>There are to be four obligatory lines and three optional ones, as follows
                        :—The first to start from Khan Fakhry Bey, near the Custom House, and pass
                        by the barracks and military hospital, issuing at the square and continuing
                        eastward along the Beyrout river road until the Lebanon frontier, a little
                        beyond the bridge. The second is to start from the Seraglio, and pass
                        northward through the square along the Damascus road until Furn Uch Chebbak,
                        at the Lebanon frontier again. The third obligatory line will be a sort of
                        connection between the two above mentioned lines starting from that point of
                        the first trunk line near Edris Gate and traversing the Dew street known as
                        Souk el Fasbks,—and of which a great part had been widened, thanks to the
                        fearless initiative of one of our former Valis,—to meet finally the second
                        trunk line at the Seraglio. This line will shorten distances enormously. </p>
                    <p>All that remains to be widened of the old street is a short stretch of about
                        100 metres, and the chief obstacle lay in the shape of an old mosque. It
                        would be a pity if, for the 83ke of a superstitious prejudice, a deviation
                        will have to be made. Anyway we may feel certain now that the clearing op of
                        this most vital of the town’s arteries is eventually to be accomplished,
                        since one of the obligatory lines of the tramway will have to pass through
                        it. The fourth obligatory line will constitute another ramification,
                        starting from the first trunk line Lear the Telegraph Office to pas3 along
                        the Bachonra load, that bisects ore of the most important and populous
                        Moslem quarters. </p>
                    <p>Optional Lines. </p>
                    <p>As to the optional lines the first will have its beginning at the military
                        hospital and its terminus at Al Masaitebe, the south-western quarter of the
                        town ; the second will lie between Minet U1 Kamb and Ras Beyrout, while the
                        third will run from Khan Antoun Bey to the ligh house. This last will be a
                        boon to the lower classes, who would then be able to enjoy this most
                        beautiful of drives— now accessible only to the rich—for not more than
                        twopence. </p>
                    <p>Our enlightened Vali, who has passed the last few weeks at Bir Hassan, lying
                        about half way between Beyrout and the Uzai, and has had the occasion to
                        appreciate the salubriousness of that spot and its idyllic charms, told a
                        friend of mine that he means to exercise all his influence in conjunction
                        with the Mayor of the town towards the inducement of the engineer of the
                        Tramway Company, who has just arrived, to make a special extension to the
                        above-mentioned spot. This, indeed, will not necessitate more than a mile of
                        rails on a level ground. This should hasten the realization of the Uzai
                        garden city scheme which seems to be, so far, in the stage of conception. </p>
                    <p>Rational Drainage</p>
                    <p>The remarks I made in my last article about the tramway necessitating better
                        roads and a more rational system of sewerage have been a sort of an
                        unconscious prophecy that came to be anticipatingly fulfilled. The
                        Municipality has already got all the proprietors of the buildings on both
                        sides of the Damascus road to sign engagements f >r the contribution to the
                        expenses of a large covered sewer similar to those of modern European towns,
                        and to be built along the middle of that road. The assessment is made on the
                        basis of 100 plastres per metre of built property. Will all the money
                        collected be spent in the right way? And is our municipality on the eve of
                        an awakening? Our Mayor is both enlightened and intelligent, and has a
                        better education than his co-religionists generally possess; and being
                        rather advanced in age and childless the ambition of his last days should be
                        to do a great act of public good to stand as a worthy and lasting memorial
                        after him. </p>
                    <p>A Famous Smuggler. </p>
                    <p>The famous smuggler of arms and ammunition, Abydo Inkidar, who has been
                        carrying on his illicit trade for years past with absolute impunity, and,
                        indeed, flaunting the luxury of his spoils in the face of the public and the
                        authorities has at last been arrested and sent as an exile to Rhodes by the
                        small coaster Prince Georges, chartered for the purpose. A few months ago
                        the brother of lnkidar, a great leader of the Moslem rabble, was
                        assassinated by a dismissed officer, and it is believed that had he been
                        alive he, with the most traculent section of the Moslem mob at his back,
                        might have caused a revolt in the town. Even as things were, the authorities
                        bad to line the streets leading from the prison to the landing place with
                        125 soldiers to forestall any agitation. </p>

                    <p>The publication early last year of the third volume of the Sahidic Coptio
                        version of the New Testament preserved in the manuscripts at the Borgian
                        Library complete C4asca’a edition of this version of Scripture. The work is
                        by the Rev. P6re Balestri, and illustrated by 40 specimen phototypes of
                        manuscripts. </p>
                    <p>Many of these fragmentary texts have been published before but very
                        inefficiently by Noide and Amelinean, because they did not, as Pere Balestri
                        has done, absolutely adhere to the text (even with errors) of the
                        manuscript. </p>
                    <p>The value, however, of Pere Balestri’s edition is much minimised by his
                        curious determination not to utilise in his notes upon these Coptic
                        parchments any other manuscript texts than those in the Borgian Library. It
                        will be seen immediately how decidedly this diminishes the value of his work
                        as a contribution to the textual history of the Sahidic New Testament. It
                        will not be until all Sahidic manusoripts are collated, and thus what may be
                        called a basic Sahidic version established, that a really vain' able
                        comparison of it with the text of Clement of Alexandria and the citations of
                        the New Testament by other Egyptian Christian authors can be made. Farther,
                        until this has been done the final comparison between the Egyptian family of
                        texts and the Greek and Syriac texts is the celebrated manuscript, such as
                        the “Alexandrinus” and “Sinaiticus” and Peshita ones, cannot be really
                        fruitful. </p>
                    <p>The Coptic manuscript No. 408 of Berlin, which gives a very complete specimen
                        of the Sahidic Apocalypse, contains also part of the 2nd Epistle of John and
                        the Epistle to Philemon. These have been edited and compared with Balestri’s
                        Borgia edition M.L. Delaporte in the “Revue Biblique” 1905, p. 377 etc., who
                        adds in an appendix a list of the Greek words1 interpolated into the Coptic
                        text. </p>
                    <p>Mr. E. O. Wiostedt, of Oxford, has completed, in three Memoirs in the
                        “Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology,” his edition of Bodlean
                        Sahidic New Testament texts. A few more from a Paris manuscript are given by
                        M.Chaine, of Beyrout University, in the Italian Clerical journal
                        “Bessarione.” </p>
                    <p>A more important work is that to he found volumes 3 and 4 of the Clarendon
                        Press, “Coptic version of the New Testament in the Northern, or Memphitic
                        Bohairic Dialect,” which give the Pauline Epistles and the other Epistles
                        and the Acts and Apocalypse. The manuscript chosen as chief exemplar for the
                        text is No. 424 of the British Museum, dated A.D. 1308. The scribe, Abu
                        Said, states however his text is a copy of one of A.D, 1250 which also was a
                        careful copy of two more ancient ones. For the Apocalypse the editors have,
                        however, preferred a manuscript of the Curzon collection dated A.D. 1320. </p>
                    <p>Altogether 34 manuscripts are utilised, and unlike Pere Balestri the editors
                        as apparatus criticus use the evidences of every known New Testament version
                        and especially all Coptic ones. A complete English translation is furnished
                        and the work is a monument to British scholarship. </p>

                    <p>Played on Tuesday, and rather easily won by the A. C. C., whose first wicket
                        put on 105 runs. W. E. Peel, J. C. Maclaren, and R. Maclaren hit very
                        freely, and the innings closed for 292. The F. F.’s began badly but a good
                        stand by H. P. Carver and Bailey improved matters considerably. Once they
                        were dismissed the bowling of Marsden proved irresistible and the innings
                        closed for the rather poor total of 141. </p>

                    <p>Mr. Alfred Pleau, an expert machinist, 178 St. John Street, Quebec City,
                        Can., writes: </p>
                    <p>“Two years ago, an accident necessitated my confinement for several weeks.
                        The good health I had enjoyed was slipping away and there developed a
                        complication of diseases. My physician said my case was one of general
                        debility. </p>
                    <p>“Among the many ailments which developed was a serious attack of ca- tarrh,
                        which annoyed me considerably and kept me awake whole nights. </p>
                    <p>“I decided to give Peru ns a trial and soon found It acting as a wonder- ful
                        tonic to my system. The catarrh grew less severe and shortly after- ward
                        disappeared, as did also the various other maladies. </p>
                    <p>“I attribute my prompt relief and ulti- mate cure entirely to the use of
                        Perune and gladly recommend it.” </p>
                    <p>For special directions everyone should read “The Ills of Life,” a copy of
                        which surrounds each bottle. Pe- ru na is for sale by all chemists and
                        druggists at five shillings per bottle or six bottles for twenty five
                        shillings. </p>
                    <p>Those wishing direct correspon- dence with Dr. Hartman and can wait the
                        necessary delay in receiving a reply should address Dr 8. B. Hart- man,
                        Columbus, Ohio, U.S.A. </p>

                    <head>EXCAVATIONS IN THE EGYPTIAN DELTA. INTERESTING EXHIBITION OF ANTIQUITIES. </head>
                    <p>The annual exhibition of the discoveries made by Professor Flinders Petrie
                        and his assistants in connection with the British School of Archeology in
                        Egypt was opened last week at the University College, London, last Seaons
                        relics being from the Egyptian Delta. </p>
                    <p>Foremost among the results of the excovations was the identification of the
                        ruin of the Temple of Ouias, described in our columns some time ago by
                        Professor Petrie, and the discovery of the Hykios capital of Avaris. </p>
                    <p>Conspicuous among the exhibits is hall of the front of a temple from the city
                        of Raamses. It is a fine piece of sculpture of the XIXth dynasty, and has an
                        interest, a9 being a work undoubtedly familiar to the Israelites just before
                        the Exodus A slab bearing an inscription of a “chief archer, keeper of the
                        storehouses of Syrian produce, keeper of the palace,” is important as
                        showing that this city was a “store city” like its sister city of Pithom,
                        eight miles distant</p>
                    <p> THE ACCURACY OF JOSEPHUS. </p>
                    <p> In an interview with a “Daily News” representative, Professor Petrie made
                        the following interesting statement : </p>
                    <p>“One result of our expedition has been to establish the absolute accuracy of
                        Josephus in many passages that were thought to be corruptions from his
                        original text. This is especially so with regard to his references to the
                        Hyksos. The results depend not so much upon inscriptions, as upon the
                        physical nature of the places we excavated. You get a far wider range of
                        information in this way than yon would ever get from records. Then, if you
                        find that your discoveries agree with the fragments of records you feel that
                        the whole thing crystallises.</p>
                    <p>“We left England in November, and spent from December 1st to the middle of
                        April on the eastern side of the delta, between Cairo and Ismailia</p>
                    <p>“I worked there about 20 years ago in search of inscriptions. Our party of
                        five lived in tents, though personally, if I stay more than six weeks in a
                        place, I prefer living in a hot. We had a staff of between 50 and 100
                        workmen who thoroughly understand the work. As I always pay the local value
                        of what they find I always manage to get gold and silver objects which
                        others engaged in similar work do not get because they do not pay for them.
                        Our arrangement with the Government is that half of what we find goes to the
                        museum at Cairo, by no means a safe place for these treasures in case of a
                        local disturbance. </p>
                    <p>"Have I any difficulty with the native workmen ? Well, I find that the best
                        plan is to be suave but firm. Any show of weakness is a great mistake, and
                        is always misunderstood.</p>
                    <p>DESTRUCTION OF ANCIENT MONUMENTS</p>
                    <p>“1 have not been able to write much about Egypt because my time has been
                        taken up in saving these relics of the past from destruction. As for the
                        protection of ancient monuments, there will soon be none left in Egypt to
                        protect. At the city of Raamses the natives are digging away as hard as they
                        can, and they have brought away every brick they could find from the town of
                        Onias. Sand and potsherds are carried away in carts to form foundations for
                        houses, and brick-earth is laid on the fields.</p>
                    <p>"I regard the town of Onias and the Hyksos Fortress as the most interesting
                        discoveries this year. Next year we go to the Pyramids containing early
                        tombs; and we also hope to work part of the upper country, and look for more
                        remains of the great chiefs who ruled Egypt about 3.COO B.O. in the XLIth
                        dynasty. One of our great difficulties, by the way. is the alteration in the
                        level of the Nile, which is now 45 yards higher than it was in the time of
                        Hyksos or Shepherd Kings.”</p>
                    <p>Professor Petrie gave further details to the London correspondent of the
                        “Manchester Guardian.” </p>
                    <p> “One of the most interesting things about the Jewish settlement,” he said,
                        “is that it completely justifies the accounts of it given by Josephus, on
                        whom, as on Herodotus, it was the fashion to cast aspersions. The fortified
                        town contained about four acres of houses, and the highest point was
                        reserved for the temple and its courts. This was a copy of the temple of
                        Jerubabel at Jerusalem, and it is clear that Onias, the legitimate Jewish
                        high priest, who fled from the persecutions of Antiochus Ephiphanes,
                        intended the whole place to be a new Jerusalem. The masonry is in the style
                        of that at Jerusalem, and on the top we find a portion of the builder’s
                        account, showing bricks to have been delivered by a Jaw named Abram.” </p>
                    <p> “The camp of the Hyksos is particularly interesting because we have never
                        before come upon any trace of this strange people. The camp was about 1,500
                        feet wide, and the bank, some 200 feet thick at the base, was faced outride
                        with a slope of white stucco 70 or 80 feet long at an angle of about 40
                        degrees, which served as a glacis for the archers, who stood on the top of
                        the bank. Later on the Hyksos made the Egyptians build a great stone wall,
                        with about 80,000 tons of the finest limestone all round the camp. This wall
                        was, within the memory of many natives, fairly intact, but within recent ■
                        years it has been regarded as a quarry for j ail builders in the district,
                        and very little j now remains.” Naturally Professor Petrie was j indignant
                        at this being allowed, and he said j that if a couple of sheikhs were paid

                        However, he had no hope of this, and as a matter of fact, he added, the wall
                        had so far disappeared as hard’y to make it worthwhile. Still he was just in
                        time, which, after all, is the great thing. </p>
                    <p>Mr W. St. CHAD BOSCAWBN’S EULOGY. </p>
                    <p>Describing the exhibition in the “Tribune,” Mr. W. St. Chad Boscawen, the
                        well known writer on the subject of Egyptian research, says - -The British
                        School of Archaeology in Egypt may be congratulated on their first season’s
                        work in Egypt. The exhibition now open at University College, Gower street,
                        is a proof of the important result* obtained. The district assigned by the
                        Egyptian authorities to Professor Petrie namely, the Delta—was one in which
                        it was hoped to find the solution of several important problems in Egyptian
                        history and archaeology. Here the professor expected to find some traces of
                        the Hyksos or Shepherd Kings, who invaded Egypt on the fall of the Twelfth
                        Dynasty, and ruled it until driven out by Aahmes, the founder of the Theban
                        kingdom. Here, too, the land of Goshen, in which the Israelites dwelt, was
                        situated, and it was hoped that explorations would lead to the
                        identification of the store city of Raineses, built by them. A third problem
                        was the identification of the site of the New Jerusalem, and its temple
                        built by the high priest, Onias, who tied from the persecution of Antiochus
                        Epiphanes. </p>
                    <p>It speaks well for the excellence of Professor Petrie’s work that all those
                        problems have been solved by his researches. The centre of work was the
                        mourd of Tel-el-Yehudiyeh, about 20 miles north of Cairo. Here was
                        discovered the great fortified camps of the Asiatic invaders, and the model
                        of it which is exhibited shows what a remarkable work it was, and places its
                        non-Egyptian character beyond doubt. It was a vast rectangular enclosure,
                        about five hundred yards across, and surrounded by an embankment of earth,
                        sixty feet in height, and over two hundred feet thick at the base. The
                        entrance was not by a gate, but by an inclined roadway about two hundred
                        feet long, leading to the top of the wall. The occupants depended entirely
                        upon archery for their defence. Egyptian influence caused several changes to
                        be made. Flanking towers were built on either side of the entrance slope,
                        and later on the whole was surrounded by a massive stone wall. This camp
                        Professor Petrie identifies with the Hyksos city of Avaris. Some hundreds of
                        graves of these Asiatics were found, and the pottery and scarabs from them
                        are exhibited. The non Egyptian character of the black incised pottery is
                        clearly shown, and it was probably imported from Syria. After a time the
                        invaders learned to make pottery for themselves, using Egyptian models. </p>
                    <p>The explorations at Tel er Ketabeb, in the Wady Tamilat, resulted in the
                        discovery of a large city and temple of the time of Rameses II., the Pharaoh
                        of the Oppression. There are exhibited some fine pieces of sculpture from
                        the temple representing the King slaying an Asiatio. More important still is
                        a small slab inscribed with the name of the “chief archer and keeper of the
                        Syrian store house in Saoojth,” which firmly establishes the identity of the
                        rains with the store city built by the Israelites. The sister city of
                        Pithom, discovered by Dr. Na- villo, is eight miles distant. Among the
                        antiquities from this site mention mast be made of a fine earthenware
                        coffin, richly painted and inscribed with the name of Men, an official. Here
                        also were found stela dedicated to the Asiatio divinities Resaph and
                        Anatio</p>
                    <p>A large mound at Tel-el-Yehndiyeh was explored, and here Professor Petrie
                        found the site of the Jewish temple built by Onias, a model of which is
                        exhibited. From this site come some large clay oven3 used for roasting the
                        Pascal lambs. The pottery and bricks exhibited are non-Egyptian in
                        character, resembling those of the same period found in Jerusalem. An
                        inventory of brick3 delivered by a Jew named Abram was found. In the outer
                        room there is a Urge collection of amulets, beads, and glazed pottery from
                        the great cemetery of Goihen at Shaft-el Henna. Of the Ptolemaic and Roman
                        period a most interesting series of objects is shown, including some fire
                        swords and excellent specimen of glass. Especially interesting are some Arab
                        toilet vessels and a Sassauian coin, which show how Asiat’c influence was
                        finding its way in Egypt before the Mohamedan conquest. The exhibition is
                        open daily until the 28th just. </p>

                    <p>A British Empire Club</p>
                    <p>The British Empire Club, which is shortly to be set on foot, and which will
                        secure a house among the leading clubs in the West-end, has enlisted the
                        support, personal and financial, of a remarkable number of distinguished
                        men, belonging to both political parties and representing every kind of
                        interest and occupation. The venture is one to which we can heartily wish
                        every success. but there is one condition which is essential to that
                        success. The distinguished persons who have promised to support the club
                        mutt do more than merely lend their names and their contributions. They mast
                        make the club their own club and take part in its life. (“Times”) </p>
                    <p>Naval Efficiency all Important, </p>
                    <p>To secure the future safety of this country and the continued existence of
                        this Empire, it is not enough to say “more ships”—we most say “more
                        Dreadnoughts,” and it most be made clear to all whom it may concern, as the
                        unmistakeable and inflexible will of the country, that the attempt to
                        balance a party Budget by reviving the fatal policy of retrenchment at the
                        expense of the efficiency and sufficiency of the Navy will never be
                        tolerated from any Cabinet or from any Minister. When we hear cf any foreign
                        nation suppressing an army corps, abating its naval estimates, or suspending
                        the effort to create armaments to the utmost of its strength by land and
                        sea—then, may the question of pausing in the work of maintaining the
                        overwhelming supremacy of the British Fleet become a legitimate subject for
                        discussion. (“Telegraph.”) </p>
                    <p>The Shah’s Cognac</p>
                    <p>Shortly before the Shah was ill, there arrived from Paris an automobile.
                        Almost before it was unpacked his Majesty wished to see it worked. “Sire,”
                        said the Grand Vizier, “there is no spirit available for the motor.” “No
                        spirit!” exclaimed the Shah. “And my old cognac of 1868 ? Get some flasks of
                        it.” And the Persian monarch’s automobile was heated with cognac at £2 the
                        flask. (“L’Eclair”). </p>
                    <p>Theatre Free-Lists. </p>
                    <p>A lady recently asked for two stalls at a certain theatre, and when asked
                        what claim she had, replied that her father was a great friend of Charles
                        Dickens. She seemed surprising that her application would not be
                        entertained. It is a remarkable fact, testified to by many people, that a
                        theatre goer who pays for his seat usually enjoys a play better than those
                        who have got free tickets. The man who pays is there to be amused ; the man
                        with the “pass” sits down to criticise. (“Daily Mail.”) </p>
                    <p>Abdul the Wily. </p>
                    <p>For nearly two years the Sultan has appealed for sanction to raise the tariff
                        by three per cent. In October last Lord Lansdowne demanded that, as a quid
                        pro quo, administrative control over the Balkan provinces should be granted
                        to the Powers. In other words, if the Sultan’s necessities were to be
                        relieved the price was to be the freedom of Macedonia. The Sultan has
                        resisted these terms; bat be still pleads for his three per cent. He maust
                        be made to pay for the delay. (‘ Daily News.”)</p>
                    <p>Gold at Capetown. </p>
                    <p>The Cape Town correspondent of a contemporary telegraphed yesterday that
                        there is a persistent rumour there, to which considerable importance is
                        attached in well informed financial oircle3. that gold in payable quantities
                        has been discovered within twenty miles of Cape Town. Should the report
                        prove trne, one probable result would be a charge in the views od Cape
                        politicians on the labour question. (“Financial New.-L”) </p>
                    <p>Horus, King of the Assyrians. </p>
                    <p>In the course of an interesting speech by Dr. Pinches at the University
                        College some little- known facts came out in connection with a certain king
                        of the Assyrians. On one of the monuments at the British Museum is the
                        following inscription “The eggs of an owl given for three days in wine bring
                        on a drunkard’s weariness. The dried lung of sheep taken beforehand drives
                        away drunkenness. The ashes of a swallow’s beak ground up with myrrh and
                        sprinkled in the wine which is drank will make secure from drunkenness.
                        Horas, King of the Assyrians. found this out.” We like the idea of this
                        convivial monarch and his researches. We seem to see him ' finding this
                        out.” People who object to paying police- court fines should never go about
                        without a swallow or two and a pinch of my rb in their pockets.

                    <head>GERMANY AND THE WORLD’S COTTON SUPPLY. </head>
                    <p>The Hamburg correspondent of the “Tribune” contributes to that journal an
                        instructive article dealing with the position of Germany in regard to the
                        world’s cotton supply. He writes:— </p>
                    <p>The International Federation of Master Cotton Spinners’ and Manufacturers’
                        Associations, which is the fall official title of the union, was called into
                        being, as maybe remembered, at the time of the unexampled havoc played with
                        the cotton industry by the gigantic speculations, directed by Mr. Sally,
                        which at one time were an ever-increasing menace to the entire cotton
                        industry in every part of the world. Consumers resolved that, so far as lay
                        in their power, they would no longer leave the trade at the memory of
                        American operators, and ways and means were to be found for ridding the
                        industry of the tyranny that was being exercised in view of the fact that
                        the United 8tatea are famishing two- thirds of the world’s cotton supply.
                        Naturally, the importance of the American crop to German users can hardly be
                        over-estimated, and is shown in the comparative entry figures for the past
                        three years. In 1935 they totalled in raw cotton 402,8S$ tons, and in 1904
                        398,117 tons, as against 382,466 tons in 1903; and ot these totals the
                        United States supplied 299,761 tons, 281,280 tons, and 268,087 tons
                        respectively. The next important source of supply is the East Indian, bat in
                        quality there is hardly a fair basis of comparison with the American. As
                        regards the German Colonies, only East Africa is at present a factor of any
                        importance ; bat the Western Colonies in the African Continent, especially
                        Togo, is achieving fair success. Just in the same way as Germany, the other
                        European countries are intent on encouraging their Colonies to foster the
                        production of cotton in every way, so as to contemplate, within a measurable
                        time, the emancipation of their market from American influences or
                        dictation. </p>
                    <p>The preponderant position of the American markets is a matter of very serious
                        concern to spinners at present, owing to the fluctuating results of the
                        crops and the ever varying level of quotations. Thus, quotations in Bremen,
                        where the Cotton Exchange is in constant teach with the American markets, in
                        1903 fluctuated between 44pf. and 71ff. per lb., thus making the rise from
                        the lowest to the highest point, 27pf., rather more than 50 per cent
                        Naturally the hamper year, in which prices ware rushed up by the
                        machinations of the Sally clique, was followed by a correspondingly
                        disastrous collapse. Shortly before the outbreak of the war in the Par East,
                        the pound of cotton was selling in Bremen at 85pf., but when the progress of
                        that struggle had undermined the Sully plans, prices fell away in 1904 to
                        35pf., making the shrinkage greater than 50 per Cent. When the Solly
                        syndicate was disposed of, the coarse of values became considerably more
                        regular, and yet the highest and lowest of 1905 were marked at 63pf. and
                        36pf., being a difference of 27pf. It was not until the first half of the
                        present year that matters assumed a more settled complexion for the spinners
                        ; hot there is a growing disposition to adopt the policy of various Utopian
                        members of the federation, and to oppose t h 3 preponderance of the United
                        States of America, by an economic effort on what may in the circumstances
                        best be described as the United States of Europe. Of course, German
                        industrial papers, seeing how relatively large a share the Empire takes in
                        the manufacture of cotton textiles, are distinctly sympathetic in their
                        references to the aims and objects of the onion. </p>

                        <head>MOUNT TROODOS CYPRUS</head>
                        <p>A limited number of paying guests can be received by a Lady daring the
                            Summer Months. Cyprus is 24 hours by sea from Port Said. Troodos 6,406
                            feet above the sea is a delightful and healthy place amongst the pine
                            forests where the troops and Government Officials spend the hot season </p>
                        <p>Terms 21/2 Guineas per week. For farther particulars apply to Miss YOUNG,
                            Nikosia, or to the Editor </p>
                        <p>Further Particulars. POSITION. The pine covered slopes of Mount Troodos
                            where Miss You NO has a camp, are about 6406 feet above the sea ; the
                            troops stationed in Cyprus and the Principal Government Officials live
                            there during the hot season from about June till October. </p>
                        <p>Routes. Troodos is about 55 miles from the port of Limassol from which
                            there is a good carriage road to Platres 31 m. Beyond Platres the road
                            is good but steep and from that point people often ride on mules for the
                            rest of the journey. There is also an excellent road from the Capital.
                            Nicosia, by which persons going from that side of the Island drive all
                            the way (about 16 miles). </p>
                        <p>Climate. The climate is very dry and healthy; ii the daytime it is
                            delightful ; the nights, especially afte the end of August, are often
                            rather cold. </p>
                        <p>Dress. There is a good deal of red dust on the hills, and ladies should
                            be provided with washing skirts. White is a good deal worn, but it is
                            advisable to have some brown, fawn, or dust-coloured linen dresses which
                            do not shew dust stains as the washing is not first rate. A warm woolen
                            “coat and skirt” costume is also indispensable. </p>
                        <p>Rides. There are plenty of delightful rides amongst the hills, but the
                            roads and bridle paths are too steep for bicycles. Mules and ponies can
                            be hired for the season. </p>
                        <p>Expeditions. Places of interest to lie reached on mule or pony Iwtek are
                            Kykko Monastery. Kalopanaioti, Trooditissa Monastery, etc. </p>
                        <p>Games. There is a Tennis Club with two good Courts, there are also one or
                            two private tennis and croquet grounds. </p>
                        <p>Church. An English Church Service is held twice on Sundays at the
                            Regimental Recreation Room. </p>
                        <p>Water. The water supply is good and the drinking water pure and
                            wholesome. </p>

                        <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but
                            which few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down,
                            as it were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what
                            may be its causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are
                            much the same; the more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of
                            prostration or weariness, depression of spirits and want of energy for
                            all the ordinary affairs of life. Now, what alone is absolutely
