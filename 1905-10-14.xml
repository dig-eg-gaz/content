                    <p>HALL’S SANITARY WASHABLE DISTEMPER is rapidly superseding wall papers in all
                        tastefully furnished homes. It is made in 70 artistic tints, and only
                        requires the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is quickly and
                        easily applied with a whitewash brush, with half the labour and at one third
                        the cost of paint. HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures cleanliness, and is pleasing to
                        the eye. It appeals alike to artistic and practical house decoration. HALL’S
                        DISTEMPER is of special value in hot climates. Owing to its cool, pleasing
                        colours, great weather-resisting and germ-destroying properties, it lends
                        itself to every kind of wall, wood, brick or stone coating, possessing all
                        the advantages of paint, colour- wash, and disinfectant at one third the
                        cost of oil paint. It never blisters in the hottest sun, and the fact that
                        it can be washed adds greatly to its sanitary advantages.</p>

                            <p>We understand that the request recently published by the Post Office
                                Administration, asking the public to put on their correspon- dence
                                the name of the street, or failing that the name of the quarter of
                                the resident recipients of letters, has met with little or no
                                attention. The administration will soon be compelled to discontinue
                                the practice of send- ing letters addressed to A. Cairo or B. Alex-
                                andria to the addresses, and though their action is likely to meet
                                with considerable criticism from those members of the Egyptian
                                Public who regard one of the most useful and necessary State
                                departments in the same fashion as an exacting mistress regards an
                                overworked housemaid, a short historical account of the methods
                                employed by the Post Office should prove that hostile criticism is,
                                in this case, misplaced and undeserved by the very energetic and
                                efficient administration against which it may be aimed.</p>
                            <p>Previous to 1890 a few people used to re- gister their addresses at
                                the local Post Offices and pay a charge of P.T. 5, so that their
                                letters might be forwarded to them. In 1890 the charge was abolished
                                and the public were invited to register their names and addres- ses
                                free of charge. This they did in steadily increasing numbers. Owing
                                to the streets being unnamed, no other address byt Alex- andria or
                                Cairo etc., could be put on cor- respondence. The numbers registered
                                increased and it became necessary to ask the public to give the name
                                of the street where the addresses lived or, failing the street, the
                                quarter. In Alexandria the numbers registered is now 39,000 odd, of
                                whom 22,700 are Europeans. In Cairo there are half as many again and
                                while there are a few employes of the Department who have grown up
                                with the service and know where most people live , the younger
                                generation cannot be ex- pected to acquire this knowledge. After all
                                the Administration is only asking the public to do what is done in
                                every civilised country. Indeed letters addressed to Smith, London
                                or Dubois, Paris, are usually sent back at once to the office of
                                origin.</p>

                                informally assured Germany of the baselessness of the report
                                published by the "Matin," but the tone of the semi official press
                                indicates that Germany is not satisfied, and wishes an official
                                repudiation. This, however, is generally regarded in England and in

                            end poured a quantity of petroleum on her clothes, and then applied a
                            lighted match. Just as she had committed this insane act her husband
                            appeared on the scenes and tried to save the woman, but the flames
                            caught hold of his clothes. A cavass of the Greek consulate, who was

                        <p>Yesterday was a great day in the annals of the Khedivial Yacht Club. At
                            an early hour in the forenoon all the merchantmen in the harbour had
                            dressed ship in honor of the occasion.</p>
                        <p>At about 3 p.m. the club began to present a very animated spectacle, as
                            the members with their guests began to arrive. The club build- ing had
                            been very tastefully decorated with flowers and plants and looked very
                            charming.</p>
                        <p>Punctually at 4 p.m , as previously arranged, His Highness the Khedive
                            with his suite arrived at the club. The Egyptian Army band played the
                            Khedivial Hymn and the Khedivial standard was broken at the club’s mast.
                            This was a signal for all the government ships and departmental
                            buildings to dress with their bunting. His Highness was received at the
                            Club steps by his Highness Prince Aziz Pasha Hassan, Commodore of the
                            Club, and Admiral Sir Maasie Blomfield K.C.M.G, RN. Vice-Commodore, and
                            the members of the committee.</p>
                        <p>His Highness then proceeded to the reserved portion of the_verandah,
                            whence he watched the races, taking a great interest in all the contests
                            of the regatta.</p>
                        <p>The first event of interest apart from the event of the day, was the race
                            between native sailing boats. These were all made fast to a rope by
                            their sterns, with canvas stretched, and at a given signal all cast off
                            and sailed away. The nine boats pre¬sented a very pretty sight, and his
                            Highness the Khedive expressed great pleasure at the scene. Soon after
                            this came the finish of the sailing race, for the challenge cup of his
                            Highness the Khedive for which the entries were as follows :— Boat Time
                            of Start Jessica \ 2.30 Akraba ) 2.32 Cattelaya 2.38 Tantah 2.40 Gumrook
                            2.43 Mssr 2.45 Calipso 2.56 Laurea</p>
                        <p>Prince Aziz’s magnificent cutter Laures first crossed the finishing line
                            in fine style, with every stitch of canvas stretched, pre¬senting a fine
                            spectacle which was greatly admired by the spectators watching from the
                            club verandah. She was sailed for the Prince by Sagh. Phillips of the
                            Coastguard Administration.</p>
                        <p>Then came the six-oared gig race, when, as usual, the gig of Prince Aziz
                            came in an easy first, with the coastguard Harbour Depart- ment’s boat
                            second, the Aida boat third, and coastguard training ship's gig
                            fourth.</p>
                        <p>The last race was the final of the Rowing Club competition ; when the
                            Canottieri easily best the German Sport Verein, drawing away from the
                            start and gradually increasing their lead until they crossed the line
                            six lengths ahead, although the Germans put on a very plucky spurt at
                            the finish.</p>
                        <p>The Khedive then presented the prizes to the winners, each of whom he
                            congratulated on his individual success. He then expressed to Prince
                            Aziz and Admiral Blomfield the pleasure which his visit to the Club had
                            afford- ed him, and wished it every success.</p>
                        <p>The Alexandria city police rendered great service in keeping the road
                            clear, and the coastguards had formed a cordon entirely round the club,
                            thereby ensuring the place being kept free from intruders.</p>
                        <p>The Egyptian Army band played during the afternoon. The detailed times,
                            etc. of the vari- ous races will be published on Monday.</p>

                        will be entirely European, most probably half of the members will be English
                        and the other half Belgian. Maltre Carton do Wiart, through whom the
                        negotiations have been brought to a successful issue, will sit on the Board.
                        It is intended to considerably increase the original capital, with the view
                        of extending the present line of 164 kilo¬metres and introducing many
                        improvements. The company also intends taking advantage of the falls in the
                        town of Fayoum by uti- lising their motive power of 4,000 horse power for
                        driving the machinery of the differ¬ent factories by electricity. </p>

                    <head>NEW BUILDINGS IN CAIRO.</head>
                    <p>The Societe Belge-Egyptienne de l'Esbekieh in conjunction-with the Daira
                        Khassa have decided upon demolishing all the small tem¬- porary buildings
                        now existing on the property purchased from the Djellal family some three
                        years ago and situated behind Shepheard’s Hotel and in their place the
                        company will erect nine immense blocks of residences similar in size to the
                        one just completed at the corner of the Boulac road. The cost of these new
                        buildings is estimated at £250,000 and it is expected that they will take
                        between two and three years to construct. The foundations of the first are
                        now finished and building operations will commence at once.</p>

                    <p>Some of the local papers have stated lately that diphtheria is largely on the
                        increase in Cairo, whilst our contemporary Le Phare d'Alexandrie contradicts
                        the statement, and further avers that the Sanitary Department denies the
                        existence of the disease. From enquiries made by our Cairo correspondent
                        yesterday it seems that the number of daily cases is greatly exaggerated.
                        From the returns issued by the statistical office we find that there were 11
                        new cases and 14 deaths reported during the week ending 30th September, and
                        that the weekly average during the past four or five weeks does not exceed
                        ten cases. Assuming the correctness of these records there is nothing to
                        cause any alarm or to justify the statement that the disease exists in an
                        epidemic form at present. </p>

                        <dateline>Port Said, Friday.</dateline>
                        <p>During the last few days, great efforts have been made to get the salvage
                            material for raising the Pharaon II into working order. It will be
                            remembered by your readers that this large sucking dredger was sunk one
                            night over five months ago, in the Dutch Basin owing to the carelessness
                            of those who were responsible for the night watch ; and that, whilst
                            bunkering sho quietly filled and sank. Subsequently the collision
                            between the Congal and a Harrison boat occurred, which resulted, in the
                            sinking of the former vessel, and which entailed many weeks of hard and
                            difficult work, resulting in the successful refloating of the ship. All
                            this, followed again by the general upset canned by the Chatham, greatly
                            delayed the salvage operations on the sunken dredger, and to cause more
                            worry, at the trials of the raising plant shortly before the Chatham
                            caught fire, one of the doable lighters collapsed and had to undergo
                            con¬siderable repairs and modifications.</p>
                        <p>However, all’s well that ends well, and the ffour pairs of lighters, each
                            pair having a dis¬- placement of 250 tons, were yesterday placed in
                            position, two-pairs on each side of the dredger (which by the way lay in
                            29 feet of water) and were all lashed with heavy chains to the cradle
                            and each other, in such a manner that the air pipes, of which there were
                            eight, protruded some few feet above the surface.</p>
                        <p>All being ready, soon after midnight, the pumping was started by several
                            centrifugal and Grindl pumps under the supervision of M. Dormay, who has
                            been in charge of this work since the day on which the Pharaon sunk.
                            About seven o'clock this morning, the dredger and her four "attendants”
                            suddenly rose more than two feet, and she has steadily continued to
                            risen since ; till, at the time of writing she lies almost at her normal
                            water line level. The salvage pumps of the Canal Company’s Progres were
                            got to work on the water in her hold and engine room about noon, and she
                            will go into the floating dock probably to-day.</p>
                        <p>Like the Congal, she now resembles nothing so much as a rock strewn coast
                            after the tide has fallen ; festoons of yards of seaweeds hang from
                            every point about her decks ; she is covered with slime and ooze, rusty,
                            one mass of barnacles and dirt; a truly desolate and pitiable sight ; as
                            for possibilities of future work with her I should fancy there are none.
                            She is so covered with dirt and all manner of weeds that I would be
                            surprised indeed it she can be made anything of, after her five and a
                            half months’ submersion.</p>

                            ranch harm to the crops owing to the heavy rains which had fallen.
                            Unhappily they are now more numerous than ever, and may yet do
                            considerable harm. It is very difficult to persuade the natives to take
                            any measures against them, for the Arabs of this district leave
                            everything to Providence.</p>

                            on the steamer. A sailor who witnessed the terrible sight, threw himself
                            into the water and tried to save the wretched boy, but the reptile
                            escaped with its prey. The generous Bimbashi on his return gave the
                            mother of the boy a large sum of money. The sailor, who risked his life
                            to save his friend will, I hear, be generously rewarded by the

                    <head>OBITUARY. SIR HENRY IRVING.</head>
                    <p>John Henry Brodribb, who assumed the name of Henry Irving, was born on
                        February 6,1838, at Keiton near Glastonbury, and educated at Dr. Pinches’
                        school, in George Yard, Lombard Street, London. He made his first public ap-
                        pearance at the Sunderland Theatre, Sept 29, 1856, and after a series of
                        engagements at Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester, and Liverpool, extending over
                        nine years, he was engag- ed on July 30,1866, to play, with Miss Kate Terry,
                        at Manchester, by Mr. Dion Boncicanlt, in an original play of his, entitled
                        "Hunted Down.” This led to a London engagement, when he came out at the St.
                        James’s Theatre as Doricourt in the "Belle’s Stratagem." He sub- sequently
                        played at Drury Lane, the Hay- market, and the Gaiety theatres. In May,
                        1870, he transferred his services to the Vaudeville Theatre, playing Digby
                        Grant in Mr. Albery’s comedy of the “Two Roses”, which character he
                        sustained for 300 conse- cutive nights. His representation of “Hamlet” at
                        the Lyceum Theatre (October 31, 1874) produced a great sensation among the
                        play- going public, and opinion was at first much divided as to the merits
                        of the performance, but it is now generally admitted that by his rendering
                        of this and of other Shakespearian parts, Mr. Irving has placed himself at
                        the head of English tragedians. "Hamlet” was played for 200 nights, the
                        longest run of the play on record. He appeared in ''Macbeth’’ Sept. 18, 1875
                        ; in “Othello" in 1876 ; and next as Philip in Tennyson's drama of "Queen
                        Mary” One of the parts in which he made his work and by which he will be
                        best remem- bered by many, was that of Matthias in "The Bells” a powerful
                        drama which had a long run at the time of its production, and has been fre-
                        quently reproduced. Afterwards Mr. Irving played his Shakespearian parts in
                        the provinces, in Scotland, and in Ireland. When in Dublin, he played
                        "Hamlet" by the request af the Univer- sity, he having been presented with
                        an address in the Dining Hall of Trinity College. In Jan., 1879, he added to
                        his Shakespearian repertory by playing "Richard III." at the Lyceum. The
                        withdrawal of Mrs. Bateman from the Lyceum gave Mr. Irving supreme control
                        over the theatre, of which he had long been the mainstay. It opened under
                        his management on Dec. 30, 1878, when he again played ''Hamlet" for 100
                        nights. The most remarkable incidents of Mr. Irving's manage- ment have been
                        the production of “Othello" (in which he alternated the parts of the Moor
                        and lago with Mr. Edwin Booth), "The Mer- chant of Venice," 'Much Ado about
                        Nothing," The Cup," "Twelfth Night,” and "Faust," all which have been played
                        in conjunction with Miss Ellen Terry. A public banquet was given to Mr.
                        Irving at St James’s Hall, on July 4, 1883, shortly before his departure
                        with the Lyceum company for a theatrical tour in the United States. A second
                        visit to America was made in 1884, and before its close Mr. Irving delivered
                        an address to the students of Harvard University on the art of acting. He
                        also delivered an address by the invitation of the Vice Chancellor (Prof.
                        Jowett) at Oxford, on June 26, 1886, On May 5, 1887, Mr. Irving was elected
                        a life trustee of Shakespeare’s birthplace. On June 1 he produced Byron’s
                        "Werner" at the Lyceum Theatre for the benefit of Dr. Westland Marston, with
                        the fine result of giving over £800 to the distressed dramatist. On October
                        17 he visited Stratford- on-Avon for the purpose of making the dedica- tory
                        speech at the presentation of a public fountain by Mr. G. W. Childs, of
                        Philadelphia, and the next day left Liverpool for a third tour in America,
                        lasting until March 24 1888. During his stay in the States he was given, on
                        March 15, a reception by the American Geethe Society, and on March 19, by
                        special desire :of the War Department, he took his company to the Military
                        Academy at West Point where, with Miss Ellen Terry, he gave "The Merchant of
                        Venice" in Elizabethan dress and without scenery of any kind. On March 12
                        the great blizzard occurred which paralysed New York for a week, and on that
                        evening the Star, there Mr. Irving was performing, was the only theatre
                        open. After a short season at the Lyceum he took "Faust” on tour, and at
                        Bolton laid the foundation-stone of a new theatre. On Nov. 28 he was
                        entertained at a publio banquet 5 in Birmingham. On'. Dec. 29 he produced '
                        Macbeth at tho Lyceum, with Miss EUeo v Terry as Lady Macbeth, andran it
                        until the following surnmor, nearly 200 nights, which is the longest run of
                        the play on record. In April of the year 1889 he visited Germany, where
                        "Julius Caesar" and “The Merchant of Venice” were presented for him at the
                        Berliner Theatre by Herr Barnay ; and on his return home he played, with
                        Miss Ellen Terry, before the Queen at Sandringham. On Sept. 28 he revived at
                        the Lyceum Watts-Philips’ play “The Dead Heart." The play ran the whole
                        season, ending in the summer of 189-, after which, with Miss Ellen Terry, he
                        made a short provincial tour, giving recitals of "Macbeth” with the
                        accompaniment of Sir Arthur Sulli- van’s music. On Sept. 20, 1890, he
                        produced “Ravenswood,'' by Herman Merivale, founded on Sir Walter Scott’s
                        "Bride of Lammermoor." This was followed in 1891 by a revival of "Much Ado."
                        "The Lyons Mail,”' and The Corsican Brothers.” During the season of 1892 Mr.
                        Irving’s company played "Henry VIII.," a notable revival, at the Lyceum, the
                        great actor taking the part of Cardinal Wolsey. His next part was not
                        dissimilar to this, for he appeared as "Becket” in the late Lord Tenny son’s
                        great play of that name. At the end of 1893 Mr. Irving gave numerous
                        revivals of familiar pieces in his repertoire. He then took his company to
                        America, and, on his return to the Lyceum in the spring of 1894, revived
                        “Faust.” In September 1894, he appeared at Bristol in a little play by Dr.
                        Conan Doyle, in which be figures as a Waterloo veteran. In 1899 he withdrew
                        from the management of the Lyceum Theatre and has since made several tours
                        in America, and also frequent visits to the provinces. He was knighted in
                        1895 and received the honorary degrees of LL.D. of Dublin, Cambridge and
                        Glasgow Universities.</p>

                        qu’en Europe, oul’on parle d’aug- menter encore le taux d’escompte. Aussi
                        les affaires sont-elles peu importantes sur notre marche, en depit d’une

                        Behera.</p>
                    <p>On espere une amelioration a la suite du versement de 10 £ par action que
                        doit faire la Daira Sanieh lu-di prochain. Ce versement auquel les princes
                        khediviaux avaient fait op- position vient d’etre autorise par, le juge de

                        differend. L- Somme considerable que ce paiement va mettre en circulation
                        faciliters surement les operations de notre place.</p>
                    <p>Les Sucreries sont en pleine debandade a 30 francs. La direction du Caire a
                        ferme les usines de Rodah, Magaga et Bibeh par raison d’eco- nomie, et M.
                        Willcocks est en tonrnee d’ins- pection dans la-Hante-Egypte. </p>
                    <p>Une bonne operation a ete dernierement conclue par l’Egyptian Land and
                        General trust a Alexandrie. II a’agit de l’achat des terrains Gourbal a des

                        parlant des Oasis le directeur a dit que le sous-sol contenait des nappes
                        d’eau inepuisables. II suffit de creuser les puita artesiens a des distances
                        suffisantes les uns des autres pour maintenir la pression.</p>
                    <p>Un heureux envenement pour les porteurs d’Anglo American Nile e’est l’entente

                        hausse.</p>
                    <p>Un autre evenement de la semaine qui est digne de remarque e’est l’achat de
                        la Fayoum Light Railways par un groupe de financiers anglo-belge qui se
                        propose d’augmenter de beaucoup le capital initial (L.E. 200,000) en vue
                        d’une extension considerable du reseau et d’autres amelierations. La
                        Compagnie se pro- po¬se egalement d’utiliser les chutes d’eau de Fayoum dont
                        la force atteint 4,000 chevaux vapeur comme force motrice des diverses
                        usines de la localite.</p>

                    <head>CYPRUS COTTON FIELDS.</head>
                    <p>The Colonial Office has published a report by Professor Wvndham Dunstan on
                        the agri- cultural resources of Cyprus, with special reference to cotton
                        cultivation, and with it correspondence on the subject which has passed
                        between the Colonial Office, the High Com- missioner of Cyprus (Sir C. A.
                        King-Harman) Professor Dunitan, and', the British Cotton- growing
                        Association. Professor Dustan’s re- port is nearly eighteen months old, for
                        he visited Cyprus in April, 1904, and his report was received at the
                        Colonial Office in the following June. In recent years the produc- tion of
                        ootton in Cyprus has not exceeded 1,000,0001b. per annum (of which aboot one
                        half goes to Trieste add Marseillas), but for- merly the production was very
                        much larger; during the Venetian oooupation the annual exports sometimes
                        fose to 15,000,0001b., and Cyprus ootton was especially esteemed in Bogland.
                        The industry is now in the hands of small proprietors and leaseholders, and
                        as tbs rainfall is very variable the crop is liable to wide fluctuations.
                        During the American Civil War, American “Orleans" seed was in- troduced and
                        did well on irrigated land*, bat it has sinoe degenerated, and Bgyptian seed
                        is generally considered unsuitable, thongh this o mchnion is probably not
                        well foonded. The varieties now grown are two, known as "wet" and "dry"
                        ootton, from the nataro of the soil in which they do best The yield is good,
                        sometimes es much as 550lb. of lint being obtained per acre, and the average
                        in a poor season not falling below 260lb. to 3001b. The ’,’4#” outton is not
                        manured, bnt farm- yard manure is often applied to the "iret" ootton.
                        Chemical fertilisers appear to be un- known. The "dry" ootton is harsh to
                        the touch and short in staple, bnt of satia- fno wry oolour. It commands a
                        lower prioe than irrigated ootton. “Wet", or irrigated ootton is usually of
                        longer staple and of finer quality. This ootton obtains in Marseille/ and
                        Trieste a rather batter price thau ordinary American “Upland," ranking next
                        to the “JumeT' ootton of Bgypt; but in Manchester and Liverpool itU usually
                        valued rather lower than American ’Upland,” bnt slightly above short-stapled
                        Bast Indian ootton. “Dry” ootton is valaed at about one half penny a pound
                        less than “wet” ootton. The cultivator considers 4d. to 5d. per lb. a
                        remunerative price for ginned cotton. Professor Dunstan considers that- the
                        three main obstacles to the revival of tho ootton- growing industry in
                        Cyprus are tho absence of an effective system of irrigation, the want of an
                        Agrioaltural Department, qualified and equipped to conduct systematic
                        experiments with a view to the improvement of cotton oulture, and to supply
                        information and advice to the native oultivator and the absence of shipping
                        facilities—especially a direct servioe to Bogland with low freight rates.
                        After a long correspondence/between Professor Dan- stan, Mr. Lyttelton, and
                        8ir C. A. King- Harman, the report was oommnnioated on April 8 to the
                        British C.vton-growing Associa- tion, who ooncsrred in tho view that, exueri
                        mentel work eBould be carried out with differente kinds of -reed?, sown at
                        different seasons and in vsrfpus soils, in order to test the commercial
                        possibilities of the industry.. Tho Asrociation.offered to contribute £iflOa
                        year towards the expense of sneh work, if tbb Government wool 1 appoint a
                        oimpeteqt agri cultural superintendent, with the necessary staff; and (her
                        farther offered to oontribiio seed sod to look after the disposal of ai y
                        ootton seot home. Mr. Lyttelton, however, decided that the Cyprns
                        Goversnment ooold not.afford the expense whioh would, be in- volved in
                        embarking on any large eolysme for the improvement of the indostry, and Use
                        offer of the Association was therefore dr dined. This result is very
                        disappointing, for Professor Danstan’* report iudiested that the prospects
                        of snroeerfol cultivation with scientific methods uitable feed were
                        distinctly good.</p>

                    <p>It has been a cardinal principle of Russian policy, says “Engineering," that
                        the construc- tion of a Southern Asiatio railroad was by all poaajMe means
                        to be prevented, and as snoh a system would have beefi fostered by railway

                        mainly through her lien on Persia that Roasia. proposed to. . render

                        Mediterranean and the Yellow Sea. Now that Russia cannot play, in Aaiatfo

                        would command the interoommuqioation of three oontinenta ; and as the
                        ambitions of- Ger- many cover so large a surface, it is_ in the last degree
                        undesirable that thei key of the Asiatio railway system should ooma into
                        German-hands. 'A Southern Asiatio railway system whioh- shOnld start within

                    <p>The NILE COLD STORAGE Company, Limted, having found it necessary to increase
                        the size of their shop premises, have now taken over the Shop and business
                        known as the "English Butcher" situated at Nos. 148, 149, and 250 in the New
                        Market, Cairo.</p>
                    <p>These premises will provide increased ac- commodation for the Company's
                        numerous Clients, and for the more effective display of the goods imported
                        by the Company, which are now well-known and appreciated in Cairo. The fresh
                        stocks which are being imported for the approaching season will include
                        MEAT, GAME, POULTRY, BUTTER, FISH, etc.</p>
                    <p>The Clients of the "ENGLISH BUTCHER" will also be able to obtain at the same
                        address the class of goods which they have hitherto purchased there, and for
                        which they may have a preference. In addition, they may, should they desire,
                        make a choice of the imported goods of the Company, which are all of the
                        finest quality.</p>
                    <p>The former proprietor of the "English But- cher" remains in charge of the
                        shop, and notice is desired to be given that all accounts owing to him
                        should be paid at the shop, or to the Nile Cold Storage Company.
