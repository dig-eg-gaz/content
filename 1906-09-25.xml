                    <head> THE POLICE OF EGYPT </head>
                    <p> Perhaps one of the most difficult and serious
                    problems with which the Egyptian Government 
                    has to deal is the creation of an efficient
                    police force throughout the country. No adminis 
                    ration comes so prominently before the
                    eyes of the public as that of the police, and
                    probably none receives such undeserved and
                    adverse criticism. The European of Cairo
                    and Alexandria is apt to unreasonably demand
                    a service equal to that to which he has
                    been accustomed in the principal cities of his
                    own country. To expect the same attributes
                    here as belong to the police of London, Paris,
                    Berlin, and such towns is quite irrational, and
                    that the shawish should be distinctly inferiror 
                    to the European constable is only
                    natural, the materials from which the two
                    are created being so widely different. What
                    do we look for, and moreover find, in the
                    London guardian of the peace? A terroriser
                    of malefactors, a guarantor of security,
                    an autocrat of the traffic, an ally of the
                    weak, a succourer of the helpless, an deviating	
                    supporter of justice, and a discriminating judge
                    in cases of emergency. And is it such a man
                    that we can expect to find in the shawish of
                    Egypt, recruited as he of necessity is, from 
                    the lowest classes of a none too highly intellectual
                    race? By nature he is indifferent, not 
                    infrequently indolent; of discrimination he
                    has none; he is inclined to argue rather than 
                    act with promptness; he may frequently be
                    turned from the performance of his duty by	
                    bakshish; he is possessed of no initiative; and
                    he is of an extremely excitable temperament.
                    Such is the material out of which the Egyptian
                    policeman must be made and though there
                    are exceptions to the rule, their number is
                    not great. </p>
                    
                   <p>  No one can object to honest, reasonable, and
                    dispassionate criticism- such, indeed, is courted;
                    but only harm can come of intolerant animadversion.
                    When circumstances incline us to 
                    decry the manner in which the police service
                    is administered let us moderate our judgement
                    by the consideration of the difficulties under
                    which the administrators labour. A great work
                    has been done by bringing the service to its
                    present state of efficiency, imperfect though
                    that undoubtedly is, and the work is not going
                    backwards, nor is it at a standstill. The need
                    for improvement is fully recognised  by the	|
                    authorities, who make no attempt to deny it,	I
                    but boldly declare it to the public, and they
                    know far better than the public the
                    innumerable shortcomings of the men, which constitute
                    a more effective barrier to progress than any
                    administrative obstacles. In his report to Lord
                    Cromer two years ago Mr. Machell drew
                    attention to the fact that on account of the
                    insufficient sum devoted to the police administration
                    the ranks of the police were of 
                    necessity filled by men who, having originally
                    been drawn to the lowest strata, are expected
                    to make the law respected, and to 
                    maintain themselves and their families on
                    L.E. 1 per month, Mr. Machell concluded
                    his report as follows:- “With a careful selection
                    of candidates who must be attracted to
                    the Administration by gradually improving 
                    the conditions of service, and with a thorough 
                    system of instruction of young police officers, 
                    moawins, and policemen, coupled with an 
                    annual importation of the very best young
                    sub-inspectors we can get from England, I
                    hope in due course to see that improvement
                    which the absence of neceesary funds has
                    delayed for so long." The police budgets of
                    1905 and 1906 showed a very welcome increase,
                    and special credits have, besides, been devoted
                    to the construction of a police school, new
                    stations, outposts,etc. Improvement has, therefore
                    been made possible and it is gradually
                    being effected, though it may not, as yet, be
                    apparent to all. The work must necessarily
                    be gradual, for certainly no harder task than 
                    turning the material which we have described
                    into a capable police force was ever undertaken
                    Rivers may be spanned and confined,
                    desert lands may be converted into highly
                    cultivated regions, towns may be built, bankruptcy
                    may be changed into prosperity, and
                    enslavement replaced by liberty, all in a
                    comparatively short period of time, but the
                    moulding of human character is a slow and
                    tedious process, which can only be achieved 
                    by infinite patience. </p>
                    
                  <p>   The shawish can, however, be readily trained
                    to some of the simpler and less responsible
                    duties of a constable, as is evidenced by the
                    excellent manner in which the vehicular traffic
                    of Alexandria is directed. Unfortunately, we
                    cannot say the same of the Cairo police, who,
                    except on special occasions, are altogether
                    heedless of the constant stream of carriages,
                    which rush along pell-mell and ungoverned,
                    though here again the regulation of the traffic
                    over Kasr el Nil bridge at the time when the
                    world of fashion takes its afternoon promenade
                    round Ghezireh shows how much might be
                    done in this direction in other parts of the 
                    town. The shortcomings of the native policeman
                    was forcibly impressed upon us at the 
                    Denishwai trial. One of the witnesses for the 
                    prosecution was the onbashi of police who
                    had accompanied the officers to the village	
                    and was afterwards sent to inform the omdeh
                    of the arrival of tho officers. It had been decided
                    by the prosecution not to call upon the man to
                    give evidence at the trial in consequence of the 
                    proved untruths which he had told when
                    questioned during the preliminary inquiry.
                    Counsel for the defense, however, asked that
                    he should be called, whereupon Helbawi Bey
                    expressed his willingness, and the onbashi was
                    immediately summoned. The result is known.
                    He was guilty of grow and patent perjury
                    and, in his address to the Court, Helbawi
                    Bey remarked that the only reason why the
                    prosecution had not called for the evidence of
                    the onbashi until requested to do so was that
                    they saw no reason for impressing upon
                    public shortcomings of the Egyptian police.
                    He was not only guilty of neglect of duty by
                    not carrying out the instructions of the officers;
                    he endeavoured to exculpate himself by bearing
                    false witness. Such is the Egyptian policeman.
                    We can but watch the steady progress
                    which is being effected, and in the meantime
                    we must not lay too great a stress upon the
                    imperfections which must be evident for some
                    time to come. </p>

            with interlocking signalling apparatus. It is
            to be hoped that the Railway Administration
            will see its way to build a terminus hotel at

                <p>     New Engines for Egypt. </p>
                    <p>    An important new type of locomotive is
            to be used by the Egyptian Government Railways. 
            It is known as the new class of Atlantic
            type engine (4.4 2.) and will be employed
            on the Cairo and Alexandria express trains.

            of 160 kilometres, will be of immense advantage, 
            especially from the commercial point of
            view, to the country through which it passes,

                <p>  “The Emancipation of Egypt.” </p>
                    <p>  Some months ago we criticized at great
            length a work published under the title of
            “The Emancipation of Egypt.” It is worth
            noting that this anonymous and able treatise
            has now been published in French, German
            and Italian. We hear that the sales of this
            book have been considerable in Europe, and
            although we absolutely disagree with the political
            standpoint of the author, we would in
            fairness confess that it is written in a most
            plausible and  moderate tone. </p>

             <p>     Port Said, Monday.</p>
             <p>    The affair of the mutinous soldiery on the
            Turkish troopship has at last been happily
            settled, as far as Port Said is concerned. The
            Turkish authorities despatched another vessel,
            which arrived on Sunday. Five hundred of the
            troops were transferred to her, leaving some
            five hundred with the Syrian mutineers on
            board the Assyr. Both vessels entered the
            Canal at 1 a m. on Monday. They were preceded 
            by H.M.8. Proserpine and followed by
            one of the Canal Company’s launches having
            on board a company of Egyptian troops with
            several English Officers and the Commandant
            of the Suez Canal Police. The affair has caused

         <head>   “AL GERIDAH.” </head>
         <p>   A NEW ARABIC NEWSPAPER. </p>
          <p>  Ahmed Effendi Loutfy, brother of Omar Bey
     Lonufy, the well known advocate and the former
            director of the Khedivial School of Law, is now
            in Europe busily engaged in studying the
            latest journalistic methods and printing presses
            now in vogue. H’s new Arabic newspaper is to
            represent the views of the Legislative Council,
            which do not appear to have found sufficient
            vent in the official journal. What exact position
            this newspaper will hold amidst the many and
            various organs of the Nationalist Press, it is
            at the present moment somewhat difficult to
            premise, but it is generally believed that it
            will occupy a moderate place somewhere
            between “Al Lewa,” which may be taken to
            represent the opinions of the extreme left wing
            of the so called Nationalist Party, and “Al
            Moayad,” which may be considered to embody
            all the most stable elements of thoughtful native
            opinion. </p>
            
         <p>   It may be remembered that Ahmed Effendi
            Lonufy is the gentleman whose name will
            be handed down to posterity as the leading
            advocate for the defence in the notorious
            Denishwai case. His abilities have been most
            fully recognised in the White Papers laid
            before the Houses of the British Parliament,
            which deal with the affair. Mr. Findlay,
            the British Charge d'Affaires, has given his
            testimony to his forensic pre-eminence, a point
            upon which opinions may possibly be allowed
            to differ. We wish our new Arabic contemporary 
            all the success it deserves, for although
            its new editor is devoid of journalistic experience, 
            that fact may be taken as a high recommendation 
            in some quarters. </p> </div>

            <p>    INNOVATIONS AND REFORMS. </p>
           <p>     Among the many innovations, which are
                being introduced into the State railway system
                in Egypt is the introduction of the signalling
                interlocking apparatus, which is gradually
                being fitted at every necessary point on the
                main line between Cairo and Alexandria. Many
                stations, such for instance as Benha, have
                already been installed with this most necessary
                part of a modern railway equipment. The
                work is being pushed on in other stations, and
                by next year it is hoped that not only will
                the main line between Alexandria and Cairo
                be fitted with interlocking signals, but that
                also the installation will be complete in
                Upper Egypt as far as Wasta. </p>
                
              <p>  Among other improvements now being
                carried out is the fitting of all the large
                railway stations with modern restaurants in
                the latest European style. This work has been
                entrusted to the International Sleeping Car
                Company, Limited. A splendid restaurant is at
                present under construction at the Alexandria
                terminus. </p>
                
              <p>  Considerable improvements are being made
                in the system of ventilation in the International 
                Sleeping Car Company’s carriages. An
                up-to-date system is being installed with ice-box
                apparatus. </p>
                
              <p>  Many alterations have just been begun at
                Tantah station. A new platform for the cotton
                bales is being constructed there and increased
                facilities for handling goods and for transhipping 
                merchandise to the Mansourah line are
                also being provided for at this most important
                junction in the Delta. </p>
                
            <p>    The Egyptian Railway Administration is
                also providing better facilities for handling
                cotton at Damaohour station. </p>
                
             <p>   A new goods platform has been opened at
                Gabbari station and a new inward marshalling
                yard is being made there. Big waggon sheds
                are to be built in the neighbourhood of
                Alexandria. The site of these sheds has
                not yet been decided upon, but they will
                be either at Max or Gabbari. Here the
                waggons will be received and repaired. It is
                out of the question to enlarge the area of the
                land occupied by the Egyptian Railway Administration 
                in the Boulac quarter of Cairo,
                as the price of real estate in that quarter of
                the Capital is quite prohibitive at the present
                time. A site at Mex or Gabbari will consequently 
                be far more practicable. By making
                the miner headquarters of the Railway Administration 
                at Egypt’s commercial capital a
                great deal of the present expense of hauling
                will be obviated. </p>
                
             <p>   The Railway Administration has of late
                wisely adopted a liberal system of advertising. 
                By this means it is hoped that not only
                will visitors be attracted to patronise the
                railways, but that tourists from all parts
                of the world will be drawn to Egypt and the
                valley of the Nile daring the Winter season.
                During the last few months the Railway
                Administration has distributed from ten to
                fifteen thousand enormous placards of a most
                artistic and attractive design throughout all
                the countries of Europe. Thousands of handy
                guides to Egypt have also been sent to
                Europe and at the present time a colossal
                scheme of advertising Egypt throughout the
                United States is under the consideration of the
                Administration. </p> </div>

             <head>   THE COMING SEASON- </head>
            <p>    GOOD PROSPECTS. </p>
            <p>    Messrs. Thos. Cook and Sons (Egypt)
                Limited have received at their Cairo offices
                satisfactory assurance* from London in regard
                to the prospects of the coming season. A large
                number of advanced bookings have already
                been received and things tend to show that,
                not withstanding the publicity given by the
                London Press to the Denishwai affair and
                similar disquieting incidents, Egypt will still
                maintain its popularity during the present
                winter. Messrs. Cook have in fact such confident 
                anticipations of the development of the
                Egyptian tourist traffic in the immediate future
                that they are now engaged in building what is
                destined to be the most gigantic tourist
                steamer that has ever floated on the bosom of
                the Nile. It is to he called "Egypt" and will
                have accommodation for at least one hundred
                first-class passengers. </p>
                
             <p>   The Hamberg and Anglo-American Nile
                Company have launched the new Nile tourist
                steamer Nubia and bops to launch the Germanais, 
                which will take the piece of the Mayflower 
                next week. The Germania is of the type
                of this Company’s well-known river steamer,
                the Victoria. The Nabia, as already announced,
                will be confined to the Second Cataract service
                between Shellal and Wady Halfs. The Company
                will initiate this season a new bi weekly express
                service and will employ the Mayflower for
                this purpose. This service will be of great use
                to those passengers, who cannot afford the 
                time for the twenty days’ trip. The Company 
                anticipate a good season, and do not seem
                to have any anxiety that the political situation
                will in any way have a bad influence. </p> </div>

            <head>    EGYPTIACA </head>
              <p>  BY JOSEPH OPFORD. </p>
             <p>   The South Kensington Museum contains a
                magnificent collection of ancient textiles, but
                so crowded together at present that their
                inspection is difficult. </p>
                
           <p>     Mr. A. R. Guest has been deciphering the
                inscriptions upon them. Nine of these texts
                present names of interest in Egyptian history,
                after the Arab conquest. </p>
                
            <p>    The earliest is that of a Khalil named Marwan, 
                either the father of the celebrated Abd-el-Malik, 
                or the last of the Umaiyad Khalifa.
                Another is of El Mutadid who was Khalif
                from 892 to 902 a d. </p>
                
             <p>   The third is El Hakim, a Fatimite Khalif of
                996 to 1021 a d. The fourth reads “Ali is the
                Vicar of God, prayers be to them both." This
                is one of the Fatimite period princes. </p>
                
           <p>     Numbers 5 and 6 are of El Mutansir Fatimite 
                Khalif of 1036 to 1095 a.d. Number 7 is
                of a certain “glorions lord Yumn-ed-Daulah
                Abu Yumn, or it may be read Nasir-ed-Daulah. </p>
                
             <p>   Number 8 refers to El Fa'iz, Fatimite Khalit
                of a.d. 1149. Whilst the ninth, dates from
                between a.d. 1293 and 1341 for it relates to
                the famous Mamluk Sultan of Egypt, Muhammed-ibn-Tala’un. </p>
                
            <p>    These inscriptions should be added to the
                Corpus of lapidary Arabic subscriptions because
                they all contain additional texts to the titles 
                which, only, are given here. </p>
                
            <p>    The same remark applies to a series of eight
                inscribed vessels shown at an exhibition of
                Mahommedan art in Paris. The text upon
                these have been described in the journal of
                the German Palestine Society by Herr Soberheim. 
                Their inscriptions date from the time of
                the second Egyptian Mamluk dynasty, and
                contain the titles of officials Khalifa, a Sultana
                and Sultan, which are of considerable historical
                interest. </p>
                
             <p>   The last report of the British Museum Egyptian 
                Department, gives special space to an
                account of the placing in the gallery of the
                South Wall of the Chapel of the chief pyramid,
                of the northern group of Pyramids on the 
                island of Meroe in the Sudan.
                This edifice was built for one of the Candaces, 
                or Queen's, of Ethiopia probably during 
                the first or second century of our era, and its 
                chapels, pylons, and courts were ornamented 
                with sculptured reliefs representing the Queen’s
                funeral procession and the offering's made at
                her seulehee. </p>
                
            <p>    Her name is not written in the texts and 
                the cartouches provided for it have been left
                blank. At one end of the wall she is seen seated
                with her consort, who is also nameless. She
                wears a hinged garment with cords and tassels, 
                and on her arms are richly ornamented
                bracelets. </p>
                
             <p>   The reliefs on the walls include a table of
                offerings ; the Hall of Osiris, the judgment
                scenes, and rows of deities and other figures 
                pouring out libations before the queen. Four
                bulls also are being led for sacrifice. These
                sculptures are typical of the best class of such
                work on the island of Meroe of which, until 
                now, there were no representatives in the 
                British collection. </p>
                
            <p>    The Museum has also acquired a splendid 
                rectangular limestone slab from the tomb of 
                Pari the priest of Ptah, and superintendent 
                of the estates of Amen-Ra’s temple at Thebes. 
                He lived under Amenhotep III about B.C. 
                1450. The King’s throne name is graven on the 
                stone. </p>
                
            <p>    The stones of the Mastaba from Sakkara
                recently sent to Brussels are suffering from
                their change of climate; it is possible that the
                surface of the reliefs may gradually disintegrate 
                so as to in time cause serious deterioration.
                The same difficulty has arisen with many 
                Assyrian reliefs in the British Museum basement 
                rooms and it is one more argument for 
                antiquities being retained in the countries 
                they belong to, whilst casts of them should be 
                liberally offered to foreign collections. </p>
                
             <p>   Two important treatises upon Coptie studies 
                have been recently published in Paris by M. 
                Delaporte, both of which also are of value for 
                the history of early Christianity. One of these 
                gives the first edition of two pages of a Coptie
                manuscript written in the Sabedic Dialect
                giving part of the book known an "The 
                Shepherd of Hermar," a work which was most 
                popular in the early Christian communities. 
                Some 60 years ago an Ethiopic version was
                found and edited by M. Abbadie. These two
                pages of the Coptie one will perhaps suffice to
                prove whether the Ethiopic text is a translation 
                from the Coptie, or direct from the Greek. </p>
                
              <p>  The second work of M. Delaporte gives all
                the at present known Sahidieo Coptic fragments 
                of the Apocalypse. In addition to those previously 
                published he adds seven new ones, from
                Paris or London. Probably further search in
                libraries and Museums would considerably
                augment the collection for many, Coptie
                fragmentary manuscripts have been neglected.
                M. de Ricci procured many for the French
                Academy, and others are in private collections 
                in England. </p>
                
           <p>     Among the De Ricci manuscript is a unique
                one containing the last chapter of Saint Mark
                which before the last twelve verses which it is
                well known are absent in several early codices,
                inserts a note, "But this also is counted as
                forming part." A papyrus codex of 30 pages
                gives the first 8 chapters of St. John. The date
                of the text is the 6th century. </p>
                
             <p>   The last number of the "Recueil de Travaux
                Epyptiens" edited by M. Maspero, has a varied
                series of articles on Egyptology. M. Georges
                Legrain discusses the ancient Egyptian method
                of editing a genealogy or family tree,"incidentally
                comparing it with the Hebrew plan as
                shown in the Bible. The tree (or stem) of Jesse
                seems to have been quite on the Egyptian
                system. Herr Von Bissing follows with a note
                upon the value of the genealogies of private
                families for Egyptian history and chronology.
                M. Maspero writes upon the Royal names of the
                XII dynasty equating the Greek forms as
                given by Manetho, with their hieroglyphic
                counterparts. One of the newly published
                Hibeh papyri mentions a priest darned Manetho
                who it is quite possible is the famous historian
                himself. </p>
                
            <p>    Ahmed Bey Kamal writes upon two ancient
                sites in the Delta, the most important of which
                is Tell-Mokdani in the province of Dakshlieh,
                which is evidently the Leontopolis of Strabo.
                M. G. Daressy elits some valuable mathematical
                calculations preserved upon some wooden
                tablets in the Cairo Museum. But the ohiet
                essay is that by Professor Golenisehef; of St.
                Petersburg, on the papyrus there containing
                the story of the shipwrecked sailor and its
                derivatives in the Odyssey and the “Story of
                Sinbad." The article is a long one and
                apparently proves the indebtedness of Sinbad
                to the old Egyptian romance, whilst the position 
                of Homer in the matter is very uncertain. </p> </div>

                is returning from Europe on the 2nd or
                3rd October. He has been engaged during a
                considerable portion of his holidays in studying 
                the latest up to date methods in vogue in
                the English and Continental railway systems. </p>

                State Railways is Mr. Macnamara, who was
                lately the chief electrical engineer to the
                world-famed firm of Vickers, Son and Maxim,
                Limited. Mr. Macnamara has been spending
                the summer in the United States, where he
                has been studying the latest American inventions 
                in electric traction and coal conveyers.
                During his summer leave he has not only
                visited most of the important railway centres
                of the United States but he has also paid visits
                to England, Holland, Belgium, Germany, and
                France and has in each country carefully and
                conscientiously inspected every one of the
                moat recent railway inventions, which can be

                discovery on the part of the Custom Hones
                Administration, will be interested to hear that
                this gentleman is now one of the most active
                and vigilant members of the secret police of
                Saint Petersburg. His devotion to the cause
                of the autocracy is most keen, and he is displaying 
                extraordinary energy and intelligence
                in his attempts to counteract the revolutionary

                decorated with exquisite taste, each room
                having its own characteristic embellishments,
                while the profusion of the electric illumination
                is so beautifully arranged that it in no wise
                detracts from the richness of the Oriental
                tapestries and furniture. Our excellent confrere

                 <p>        Le taux de l'escompte libre à Londres a
                 été élevé de 1/8 mercredi passé à 4 1/4 ;
                 vendredi et samedi, il a encore monté de
                 1/8 par jour, de sorte que nous le trouvons
                 actuellement à 4 1/2 pour cent. C'est une
                 hausse de non moins de 8/8 en quatre jours,
                 déterminée par l'accroissement des demandes
                 d'or pour l’Egypte et notamment pour l'Aœériqee 
                 du Nord. </p>

               <p>  Nous détachons d’une lettre de Londres, en
                 date du 17 Septembre, le passage suivant: </p>
                 
              <p>   "La Banque d'Angleterre recueille aujour
                 d’hui les fruits de la précaution qu'elle a eue
                 de fortifier longtemps à l’avance sa situation
                 en prévision d’une exode de l'or ; les fortes saguées 
                 pratiquées ces jours derniers pour compte 
                 des Etats-Unis et de l’Egypte établirent
                 que les directeurs avaient raison de se montrer
                 excessivement prudents. On dit que tout sera
                 tenté pour empêcher la tension de tourner en
                 orise; ainsi, dès maintenant, on envisage Top- 
                 portunité d'un prêt de 3 millions de livres
                 sterling d’or à faire à la Banque d’Angleterre 
                 par la Banque de France. Au surplus, même
                 avec l'aggravation des expéditions au-delà de
                 l’Atlantique, ce ne sont que quatre mauvais
                 mois k passer d'ioi an 15 Janvier. Somme 
                 tonte, on pent mesurer la durée, sinon l’intensité 
                 de ce resserrement monétaire, très grave !
                 assurément, mais qui trouve un marché pré
                 paré.” </p>
                 
               <p>  On affirme de bonne source que la nouvelle,
                 donnée par divers journaux, suivant laquelle
                 le conseil d'administration de la Cassa di Soon
                 to se réunirait vers le fin du mois pour délibérer 
                 sur l'opportunité d'augmenter le capital 
                 de cette Société par une nouvelle émission 
                 d'actions est dénuée de tout fondement. </p>
                 
              <p>   En effet, le directeur général, le président ,
                 do conseil d’administration et la plupart des
                 membres de ce conseil étant actuellement en
                 Europe, il n'est guère vraisemblable, ni possible,
                 qu'une pareille décision soit prise en leur
                 absence. </p>
                 
             <p>    On ajoute, d'ailleurs, que des démarches
                 seraient faites entre temps à Vienne pour
                 obtenir que la prime de 60 fis. primitivement 
                 fixée pour les 25,000 actions attribuées au 
                 groupe de l'Union Bank soit majorée. </p>
                 
              <p>   La "Réforme" se dit en mesura d'affirmer
                 que le Comptoir, Financier n’a pas fondé de 
                 succursale à Londres, comme l’avait annoncé
                 un autre journal d'Alexandrie. </p>
                 
               <p>  Pour ce qui est de la distribution d’en dividende
                 de 12% aux actions et de $2 aux parts 
                 de fondateur, la "Réforme" ajoute: </p>
                 
             <p>    "Laseemblée générale ordinaire sera proobainement
                 convoquée, probablement dans la 
                 seconds quiezaine d’octobre, et les actionnaires 1
                 auront alors tous les renseignements de nature
                 à les intéresser.” </p>

                 Les actionnaires de la Société d’Eutieprises
                 Immobilières et de Travaux sont informé» que
                 le conseil d’administration a décidé de faire
                 l’appel du Séme quart, sût LR 1 par action
                 Les versements devront être effectués an siège
                 de le Société, 18 rue 81 El Medabegh, au Caire,
                 au plus tard le 15 Octobre prochain. Il est
                 rappelé qu’aux termes de l’article 7 des statuts,
                 toute somme non payée le jour de son exigibilité 
                 porte intéret de plefs droit en faveur de
                 la Société, au taux de 9% l’an. </p>

               <p>  {Aujourd’hui à midi et demie.) </p>
            <p>     Il n'y a eu ce matin que fort peu de transactions, 
                 mais loi prix sont fermes et l’on
                 constate même une hausse partielle déterminée
                 par le bas niveau atteint. </p>
                 
            <p>     C’est ainsi qu’on a demandé dès l'ouverture
                 l’Union Foncière à 5 7/8, mais devant l’abstention 
                 des détenteurs on est allé jusqu’i 6 livres,
                 prix qui n’a pas non plus trouvé de vendeurs. </p>
                 
              <p>   Il en est de même de plusieurs autres titres,
                 tels que le Cré lit Foncier Egyptien, les Non

            <p>     Par contre, que'ques valeurs continuent à fléchir:
                 ainsi la Cassa di Sconto tombe à 221 1/1, la
                 Nile Land à 111/9, l’Ordinary Khédivial Mailà
                 84, la part de fondateur Comptoir à 31 1/2, etc. </p>
                 
             <p>    Mais le clou de la matinée, o’est sans contre
                 dit la Central Building. Cette action qui avait
                 été émise à £5 et dont il n'avait plus é'é
                 question depuis, s’est tout è coup réveillée
                 avec une hausse prodigieuse. On a débuté ce
                 matin avec une demande active et le coure a
                 été poussé jusqu’à £12. En clôture on est
                 revenu à £10. Il faut d’ailleus convenir que

              <head>   BRITISH ARMY MANOEUVRES. </head>
             <p>    GREAT IRISH VICTORY. </p>
              <p>   The War Correspondent of the “Daily Telegraph,”
                 writing from Chichester under date
                 of Monday week; gives the following interesting
                 account of Ireland’s victory over the British
                 force-It has been a great day for “Oireland”
                 entirely. The British forces have had a terrible
                 "basting.” Are coming events casting a shadow
                 before? Whether or not the lesson conveyed
                 of what befalls the unready is obvious and
                 sound. In this mimic campaign the invading
                 Irish troops, the “Blue" army, otherwise the
                 Aldershot Army Corps, have easily scored a
                 complete victory over the British forces. And
                 without straining judgment or conscience, the
                 beginning and ending was as would be in
                 actual warfare. Although there were two
                 British Army Corps being mobilised, they were
                 not prepared to take the offensive, so an
                 infantry division, under Colonel Scott-Kerr,
                 with cavalry and guns, was sent in advance to
                 occupy the South Downs, delay the invaders,
                 and protect London at all costs. Behind him,
                 but afar in the rear, were Regulars. Yeomanry,
                 and Volunteers, all, no doubt, figuratively
                 tightening their belts and eager to be led to
                 meet the daring foemen who had scorned
                 the inviolability of our shores Against the
                 single British divisions were three divisions
                 infantry, a cavalry brigade, and artillery.
                 General Sir John French, who commanded the
                 “blue” forces, somewhat equalised matters
                 by sending his three infantry divisions,
                 Major General Hutton commanding—less a
                 brigade of artillery and another of infantry 
                 -away to his left to Westbourne and
                 Hambleton to reconnoitre. It was not expected
                 that they would see any British troops in that
                 direction. They did not. The Irish cavalry
                 brigade and the Royal Horse Artillery batteries
                 were dispatched eastward to “Blues" right to
                 Binstead and Reading. From there westward
                 for six miles, were the First. Division troops
                 (General Paget's) and the Second Division
                 (General Bruce Hamilton’s). Britain's “Red"
                 force, so called, though khaki clad, was en
                 trenched upon the Downs, north of Chichester,
                 along the uplands to be seen cast and west of
                 witching Goodwood, from Madehurst to
                 Stoughton. Dawn broke smiling and breezy, and
                 thongh dark and rolling clouds at times filled
                 the sky, yet did the son keep his hononr and
                 the ship-hand, and so throughout the day remained 
                 fine. A few drops of rain fell when the
                 ans were going, but there was not enough to
                 moisten the tongue of a road. The wind was too
                 boisterouss for captive ballooning; but the Irish
                 army flew their war kite to a height of over
                 1,500ft. Reposing cosily and calmly in a hammock 
                 beneath the strange box like apparatus
                 lay an officer, taking note of "Reds" dispositions, 
                 and talking by wire to his friends below.
                 Poised aloft, like a strange bird, the kite did
                 not seem to move, but lay perfectly still. It
                 would be a difficult object to hit with a shell,
                 and even then little or no injury would befall
                 the apparatus, which even with the cord severed
                 descends safely to the ground. </p>
                 
             <p>   There was, after all, quite a late start for
                 the opening of hostilities. They were timed for
                 9 30 a. m., but, of course, by that hour all the
                 troops were in position to begin fighting hammer 
                 and tongs. It may be that I did an unconscious 
                 injustice to others when I said yesterday
                 the astute Japanese had sent three officers to
                 watch these manoeuvres. But the Germans are
                 not a whit behind them in that respect, and
                 that is not taking count of visitors who may be
                 in mufti. In the course of a chat I had to-day
                 with an attache of a neighbour nation, he
                 expressed his regret that more of his military
                 countrymen did not cross to study these operations. 
                 They were shy of visiting without an
                 invitation, and he hoped to see many of them
                 next year. The silly thing was that on the
                 Continent they persisted in thinking England
                 had no army, whereas, though the force was
                 small, it was a unique soldiery, far better
                 equipped and smarter handled than any to be
                 seen elsewhere in Europe. And he spoke neither
                 through his cheek nor through his hat, but
                 straightforwardly, as a soldier and a gentleman. 
                 The capacity to bear and to wield
                 arms is not exhausted in the islands of the tea. </p>
                 
             <p>    What a charming region is this south
                 country! Velvety downs, wide fields, stately
                 woods, and parks whose giant trees and long
                 avenues remind one of the Forest of Compiegne. 
                 It it a country with a history to every
                 hill, fur tumuli and Roman encampments
                 abound in all directions. What a great struggle
                 the early Britons most have made, for here
                 abouts are camps by the score, and Chichester
                 is but a mile and a half from a navigable
                 waterway. A little after nine a.m. I found the
                 "Blue" cavalry brigade, the 5th Lancars, the
                 8th Hussars, and a brigade of the Royal Horse
                 Artillery, under Colonel Phipps-Hornby, lying
                 in wait a little to the north of Binstead, seven
                 miles east of Chichester. They were in a "dip,”
                 surrounded by timber, near London, so that
                 you almost tumbled upon them before seeing
                 guns or troopers. Conninngly they detached a
                 Royal Horse Artillery battery and a squadron
                 of Lancers to ride straight northward, whilst
                 the remainder galloped off to the north-east,
                 towards Madehurst and the extreme left of
                 their enemy's position upon the Downs. Their
                 ultimate object was to effort a lodgment upon
                 the high ground upon “Red’s” left and rear by
                 Bignor Hill, Burton Down, and Upwaltham
                 Hill. A little way beyond Slindon were a few
                 mounted “Red” scouts, further north there were
                 more, whilst holding Halnaker, on Windmill
                 Hill, and other dominant points were infantry
                 end artillery. Colonel Scott Kerr, with wonted
                 prescience,had made the best possible use of the
                 ground. Not knowing where his enemy would
                 attack, he had sent forward outlying detachments 
                 to hold various positions and force the
                 “Blues" to dicclose their strength end purpose.
                 Behind he had a second line of defence along
                 the Ridgeway Down, which afforded him a
                 serviceable means of intercommunication across
                 his whole front. He had a battery upon Windmill 
                 Hill, and another to the west, whilst upon
                 the ridge road, or near, there was disposed his
                 main artillery, field guns, howitzers, and heavy
                 gnns—the big 6O pounders. But I fancy the
                 “Red” leader thought the blow to be driven
                 home would fall mainly upon his right, some
                 where near Goodwood. </p>
                 
              <p>   When “Blue’s” cavalry, at 9.30 a.m., set
                 spurs to their horses, other gone galloped for-
                 , ward with the troopers. They plongeJ by
                 bucky reads or lanes, screened from observation, 
                 and meeting with little or no opposition.
                 The few “Red" scouts were brushed aside, and
                 "Bine’s" cavalry held straight upon their
                 mission. Oh, for a battalion of riflemen, to.
                 I have held them op and scattered them to the
                 winds! But despite perfect signallers and
                 field telegraph wires, there, was just the usual
                 incident of mischance, which has won and
                 wrecked kingdoms and empires as well as mere
                 men and women. Nature always fights on the
                 side of the defence, but it follows that if there
                 be neglect by the children of the land, an enemy
                 may profit by nature’s advantages. What a wellmarked 
                 countryside is this South land—a fat
                 district, embroidered lavishly with bushes,
                 woods, and noble parks. The bold South Downs
                 and sentinel foot-hills look upon the expanse
                 of the glinting, dancing Channel waters. The
                 infantry of the first “Blue” division, General
                 Paget’s, advance northward by Aldingbourne
                 towards Sethurst Park, and westward as far as
                 the Trundle by Goodwood. Moving in the low
                 gronnd, they quickly came into contact with
                 “Red’s” infantry extended south of Windmill
                 Hill. A few more “Red” cavalry would have
                 helped to stay and control the advance of the
                 invading infantry. Although in a sense it was
                 not a cavalry country, yet does skill convert to
                 its own use the most unlikely situations. So
                 General French, by his bold and resolute
                 handling of that arm, made the occasion and
                 the day an ideal one for getting splendid
                 results from his troopers and Royal Horse
                 Artillery. For over two hours the contending
                 infantry fought around Halnaker Hill,a billowy
                 upland, surmounted by a picturesque, mined
                 windmill. There was a mournful suggestion of
                 the mighty gibbet about the uncanny thing.
                 The dilapidated wheel hung with the skeletons
                 of two centuries of gone-by millers. The few
                 Grenadiers who he'd Halnaker had a red flag,
                 which in indicated that some two companies of
                 men were manning the old Roman earth wall
                 and the rained mill. Their battery blazed way
                 at a section of the infantry and the squadron
                 of Lancers who stopped to engage their
                 attention, whilst their comrades robde unseen
                 to the north. Paget brought a battery to
                 bear upon Windmill Hill from the south,
                 by Boxgrove, and the squadron of Farriers
                 with the battery opened upon it from the east.
                 Rifla fire rose and fell at times, shrieking in
                 fall chorus in the woods. But parsimony stultifies 
                 in many modes the soldiers' efforts to learn
                 in field manoeuvres the lesson of war. In
                 France there is no stinting of ammunition for
                 cannon or small arms, but it is otherwise with
                 guns, and as ammunition has to be carefully
                 husbanded you have to imagine at times that
                 continuous rifle and cannon firing is going
                 forward. </p>
                 
             <p>    By 10.50 a.m., if not earlier, the Blue or
                 Irish cavalry, having rushed upon the British
                 left, seized Selhurst Park, and beyond the
                 ground Buxton Down, theoretically, if not
                 practically. This lost the day to the "Red”
                 leader, and had he been anxious to save his
                 guns and division he would have withdrawn
                 his left and fallen back, for, remember, in front
                 he war being assaulted by two full divisions of
                 infantry and a brigade, and not even his
                 hastily constructed entrenchments could have
                 saved him. It could and would have been
                 a sauve qui pent had “Blue” forged the fighting, 
                 but it was the British leader's duty to
                 die hard, and interpose himself between the
                 enemy and the road to London. “Blue’s”
                 cavalry were so lodged and had so struck home,
                 that “Red's” position grew hourly worse. But
                 woods and bills, hearths and homes, England
                 — our England—were worth dying for than
                 living to be dispossessed of them. Events
                 hastened, sod before eleven a.m. Windmill
                 had to be evacuated, the "Reds” retiring
                 upon the Down Ridge road. From eleven a.m.
                 until noon, and later, the conflict surged to
                 and fro, for “Blues” infantry were beginning to 
                 press upon Goodwood. Guns were booming
                 in all directions, and over a front of seven
                 miles there rose and fell the rattle of battle 
                 in full roar. The "Reds” were clinging to 
                 Silhurst, busily fighting with facet turned to
                 east and west. About 12.40 p.m. they began 
                 moving off their howitzer and field batteries 
                 to the west, towards Goodwood. Their heavy
                 guns were still further to the west than the
                 racecourse. Silently through the woods from
                 Molcomb, over a mile south, almost without opposition, 
                 had penetrated the Leinster Regiment, 
                 General Alderson’s brigade of Paget’s division.
                 They reached the ridgeway, and spread along it 
                 to the west, bagging “Reds” scouts. The British
                 artillery were in a tight place, and the Irish 
                 were within an ace of bagging two batteries of
                 “Red’s” field guns and ditto of his howitzers 
                 But the gunners, warned, slipped away over 
                 hill and due to the north, and still the battle 
                 raged. Infantry of the “Red” force were 
                 caught between the upper millstone of cavalry 
                 and guns and the nether of swarming infantry
                 Those that were not killed were made prisoners.
                 Paget's force on his immediate left broke in
                 upon the racecourses at Goodwood. Alas, poor
                 British force its left was lopped off and gone,
                 and the centre was broken, and their strength
                 wasted. What was happening farther West
                 ward was of snall moment. The day was
                 lost, a famous victory without a Blenheim
                 tinge. About 1.30 p.m. up went the signal
                 balloons that the fight wss over for the day.
                 Back to their camps marched the troops ready 
                 to renew the contest on the morrow. </p>

         <head>    THE SALT MONOPOLY. </head>
          <p>   To the Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette."
             Sir,—Cannot something be done to improve
             the quality of the salt usually purveyed
             which is more tasteless than any I have ever
             used in England or upon the Continent?
             Would it be too much to ask the authorities
             that they should test its quality and insist
             upon its being up to a certain standard of
             strength? It was imagined at the time when
             the price was reduced last year that the too
             generous concession granted by the Government, 
             whereby it deprived itself of working its
             own salines for the next twenty years, would
             be an inducement to the Egyptian Salt and
             Soda Company to provide the public with the
             best quality possible. Unfortunately our expectations 
             have not been realised, and I can
             only hope that the Government, now that its
             attention has been drawn to the fact, will
             institute a more rigorous supervision and
             insist on its quality being raised. Truly Yours,
             X. Y. Z. </p>

        <head>     EGYPTIAN POSTAGE. </head>
           <p>  To the Editor of the “Egyptian Gazette.”
             Sir,—No one more than myself is more
             willing to acknowledge the enormous progress
             which the Egyptian Postal Administration has
             made under the guidance of our admirable
             Postmaster-General, Saba Pasha. However, I
             should like to make a few suggestions on this
             Administration as I am sure they will be taken
             in good part by bis Excellence. For example,
             the letter postage from England is four
             farthings for one half ounce and less. But
             from Egypt to England it is five milliemes or
             five farthings, leaving, therefore, an excess
             charge of one farthing per half ounce as
             against Egypt. At first sight that may appear
             very small, but when one comes to one ounce
             it is already one half-penny, two ounces one
             penny, and so forth. The percentage must be
             enormous and the discrimination against this
             country must therefore be very great. Why
             should this be the case? It was understood in
             England when the rate was reduced that it
             would be reciprocal, and this I believe to be
             the case throughout the Empire, wherever
             penny postage has been introduced. The
             argument that the small piastre consisting of
             five milliemes is the unit of coinage might
             possibly be brought forward by some in
             search of an excuse. But this will hardly hold
             water when we remember that the postage in
             Cairo is three milliemes.—I am, Sir, Yours
             obediently. </p>

        <head>     REVELRY BY NIGHT. </head>
         <p>    To the Editor op the "Egyptian Gazette.”
             Sir,—I happen to live in one of the most
             select quarters of Cairo; in fact in the smartest
             part of Sharia Kasr el-Nil. I have selected
             my flat there because I thought that as that
             district of the Capital of Egypt was inhabited
             by Anglo-Egyptian officials and equally respectable 
             persons, I should therefore have
             some guarantee of the repose which I requite
             from my studious labours. Unfortunately I
             appear to have been baulked of my expectation, 
             for last night, (Friday, September
             22nd) the flat over my head, which is occupied 
             by a British Official, was the theatre
             of a most terrific orgy. Only a few day ago
             I read the following paragraph in a French
             newspaper published here, entitled “Un pen
             ie calme” :— </p>

          <p>   When I read the above I thought that it
             had been only inspired by “Little Englander"
             sentiments, but judging from the inexpressible
             uproar last night, this is not the ease. Surely
             instructions might be given from the various
             Ministries that such rowdyism is most unseemly 
             and only calculated to bring contempt
             upon the British name. I much regret having
             to make snob a suggestion, but I can think of
             no other way of bringing this scandalous state
             of things to the notice of the authorities, and
             of checking the thoughtless indifference to the
             comfort of others, which so frequenntly marks
             the conduct of those who should be the first
             to set an example. I am, Sir, truly yours, </p>
