                    <head>N ATI VH PRESS OPINIONS. LORD CROMER’S SPEECH.</head>
                    <p>In discussing Lord Cromer’s speech, “A1 Moayad” remarks that the better the
                        relan tions between Abdeen and Buckingham Palace, the better for Egypt, and
                        that the attitude of the extremists, whose idea of patriotism is a
                        systematic opposition to all that has to do with the'l )ccupation, is
                        brainless and even opposed to the principles of the Koran. With Lord
                        Cromer’s four conditions the “Moayad” expresses its agreement subject to one
                        or two reservations. While admitting that a direct control of Egyptian
                        affairs by Parliament would injure Egypt, it remarks that Parliament must
                        never lose its control of what are, after all, its agents in Egypt, and must
                        be able to check any abuse of their powers. In this connection, it is
                        earnestly to be desired that some means existed of bringing the Egyptian
                        point of view before Parliament as clearly as Lord Cromer’s point of view is
                        set forth in the Blue-books. The caution in the introduction of Western
                        ideas must not be exaggerated, for Egypt has made great strides, and
                        finally, while there is no question of Lord Cromer’s sincere devotion to the
                        good of Egypt, many of his projects have been diverted from their end by
                        those charged to carry them out. </p>
                    <p>“A1 Lewa” expresses its disagreement with “A1 Moayad’s” views. Opposition to
                        the British Occupation is an absolute necessity, and it is strange that ‘ Al
                        Moayad,’’‘‘after 14 years in opposition, should abandon its policy and
                        support Lord Cromer’s views. The opponents of the Occupation are the only
                        veritable patriots. If Lord Cromer’s wishes for the welfare of the Egyptian
                        people are sincere, he should permit them to occupy many of the important
                        positions now reserved for Englishmen, and reduce the expenses caused by the
                        Occupation. The Egyptians were the first civilised race in the history of
                        the world and are to-day as capable of assimilating modern civilisation as
                        the Japanese or the English themselves. The future will show their capacity
                        beyond dispute. </p>

                        <p>—It appear? that automobiles and carriag^R are frequently driven at great
                            speed over tnlf level crossinj on the Ramleh Railway, especially at
                            Bulkeley, which renders the precautions taken by the company valueless,
                            notwithstanding the special watchmen placed on duty at these crossings.
                            The dangers to which automobilists and carriage drivers expose
                            themselves are most serious, as with this exaggerated speed it is
                            certain that more often than not the watchmen have hardly time to signal
                            to them before they are on the line. Consequently, we are asked by the
                            company to appeal to the public, when driving over these crossings, to
                            slacken speed in order to avoid any chance of accident. </p>

                    <p>-For over three decades the Syrian Protestant College stood, as it were, on
                        an eminence as a beacoYof knowledge shedding a growing light on Syria, and
                        in its later phases of development it has' plainly become one of the most
                        potent educational factors in the Near East. One has but to glance at the
                        latest edition of its prospectuses, of Which à judicious distribution is
                        annual’y made, to realise the magnitude of its infiuen o and the scope of
                        its field of action. This magnifioent institution recruits its army.of about
                        * 700 stadents from various countries. Its radius of power extends from
                        Armenia in the East to Greece and the Ionian Isles in the West, and from
                        Asia Minor in the down to Egypt in the South. But ils influence has been
                        mostly felt in Egypt, directly through the preponderant number 6Î seekers
                        for knowledge that the Land of ’ the haraohs has always supplied, and
                        indirectly but no less mightily through the Syrian settlers who constitute a
                        strong intellectual element in Egyptian life, and who, under the strong,
                        capable, and judioious guidance of British rulers, are contributing largely
                        to the progress of the country. Therefore any event of public character in
                        this birthplace of learning should not fail to appeal to the interest of the
                        readers of the “Gazette.” </p>
                    <p>The commencement exercises this year began on Saturday, 24th June, ten days
                        earlier than the usual and traditional time. This has been determined by the
                        early arrival of the Imperial Medical Commission from Constantinople.
                        Although the exercises commenced on Saturday yet they may be considered to
                        have been publicly inaugurated by the Baccalaureate service on Sunday, when
                        President Howard Bliss delivered his annual valedictory and exhortatory
                        address to the medical and pharmaceutical graduates. The scene was, as it
                        may easily be imagined, one calculated to call forth deep aud stirring
                        emotions and inspire thoughts of the noblest kind, and the young President’s
                        fiery eloquence rose splendidly to the occasion. The meeting was well
                        attended by students and many of the public. The blessing was fitly given by
                        the old President Emeritus, whose appearance in public functions at the
                        college is still inspiring and recalls to the hearts of older students happy
                        memories of the godd old days. </p>
                    <p>The exercises closed on Wednesday with the ceremony of thé distribution of
                        prizes And diplomas. The principal and striking féature of that day was the
                        processional march. At Ada Dodge Hall the procession, consisting of the old
                        graduates, the faculty, and the staff of teachers, formed* and proceeded to
                        the Memorial Hall at 3.30 p m. preceded by the American Consul and the
                        Imperial Medical Commission. The President and members of the Faculty wore
                        their "academic gowns, and as it marched forth with measured step and took
                        ito-feeats on the platform in the Memorial Hall* the procession presented a
                        sight of unusual solemnity. </p>
                    <p>The closing event was a delightful entertainment on Wednesday evening at the
                        President’s, Marquand House, wound up by a series of hilarious and comic
                        songs, lustily sung by a part of the American staff of teachers. The
                        entertainment is given principally in honor of the Imperial Medical
                        Commission, composed this year of General Mahmoud Hakki Pasha, a
                        distinguished officer, Colonel Ahmed rehmi Bey, and Major Escret Roushen
                        Bey. The reception wa3 held in the president’s class-room, a hall of
                        spacious dimensions, but which, owing to the large crowd, could afford only
                        standing room. This, coupled with the orrid heat of June, made it
                        particularly ncomfortable to the invités, and called forth uggestioiis from
                        some of them for an enlargement of the hall, which would not be inadvisable
                        considering the growing importance of the' college. Bat the welcome was so
                        hearty, and there was such a general air of conviviality, that the heat and
                        other little, discomforts were forgotten. Besides, to those blessed with a
                        sense of hnmonr and that rare power of selfdetachment, there wag afforded a
                        rich fund of /amusement by the presentation of the ijhtés to the Imperial
                        Commission. This distinguished body was victimised by a presentation of
                        almost all the large crowd of Quests, and for about half an hour there was
                        something like a pantomimic show of a fFe of ladies and gedtlemen coming
                        forward with lifferent degrees of grace and awkwardness to hake hands with*
                        the three commissioners, who cut curious figures, repeating with lutomatic
                        sameness the stiff, jerky, and deep German bow in reply to each
                        introduction. After the ordeal they withdrew to the cooler recesses of the
                        garden on which the hall opens, to indulge in timely refreshments and the
                        necessary accompaniment of the fragrant weed. </p>
                    <p>These entertainments form a cheerful ending for the graduates of a year of
                        hard study, wakeful anxieties, and stirring emotions, and no doubt
                        they-procure the hospitable President and his charming wife many a farewell
                        word of blessing from the grateful pupils who are to face the hard realities
                        of life. </p>
                    <p>I had almost forgotten to add that 28 medical students were presented to the
                        Commission for the final examination. Of these one did not complete his
                        examination, one failed to pass, 36 took the oath of office before the
                        commission and received their oollege diplomas. Their Turkish diplomas will
                        he sent to them later. </p>
                    <p>Nine pharmacy students were presented to the commissioners for final
                        examination. Of these all passed pud took the oath and reomy-eft diplomas.

                    <byline>(From a Correspondent.)</byline>
                    <p>Now that the summer has begun in earnest, many dwellers in inland towns will
                        be thinking of making a move soon to some favored spot by the seaside where
                        the invigorating ocean breezes will once more brace the jaded residents of
                        the interior. For those who have the means San Stefano is incomparably the
                        Queen of Egyptian summer resorts,but-to those to whom money is a primary
                        consideration, and others who prefer a free-and-easy and happy-go-lucky
                        existence, I know of ho better place olose at hand than Ras-el-Bar, not far
                        from bamietta. </p>
                    <p>I very much doubt whether the frequenters of this little place, which springs
                        into life with the advent of the great beat, would seek to qualify its
                        attractions by comparison with those offered elsewhere, say at Ramleh or
                        Port Said, but I do not hesitate to say that it possesses a charm of its
                        own, and I am not surprised when I discern the same familiar faces there
                        £®ar after year. ' </p>
                    <p>» The season proper at this Egyptian Margate, if I may term it so, does not
                        commence in earnest until the middle of July, and is in full 8 wing until
                        about the end of September, iothat the hotel-keepers and others who minister
                        to the wants ot the strangers have, in a sense, to make hay while the sun
                        shines, although, considering the shortness of the season, no one can say
                        that the prices charged are exorbitant. The majority of the visitors are
                        Levantines and Egyptians, leavened by a fair number of Europeans of all the
                        nationalities that inhabit this country. </p>
                    <p>The hotels, if one can honor them with this name, and dwellings ajfe mainly
                        if not entirely constructed of the native rush mat fastened to wooden
                        uprights and are slighly raised from the land or ground in the same manner
                        as bungalows in India. Naturally, in a country like Egypt, where rain is
                        unknown for nine months at least of the year, snch habitations are possible,

                    <p>Work on the submerged dredger “Pharaonrp’ II.” is now being rabidly pushed
                        towards com- ‘ pletion. t learn that the vessel is to be raised by qaite a
                        novel method,' which' should prove most interesting. As I noted some time
                        back, she lies bn her side, and a kind of bed is being .dredged ont along
                        her side, at the bottom'of whioh is to be placed a patent slip cradle. A
                        cutting is to be made in the hank into which the dredger lying on the cradle
                        is to be towed. The entrance to the basin will be closed, and it is then to
                        be pumped out and the vessel attended to as if she lay in a dry-dock. Hopes
                        are expressed that the “Pharaon II.” will be hanled into the basjn in two
                        weeks’ time. </p>

                    <p>The massed bands of H.M.S. “Suffolk” and ’Lancaster,” by permission of the
                        captains and offioers of the vessels, are giving a concert on Saturday
                        evening in aid of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The
                        concert is to he held in the garden of the Eastern Exchange, which is being
                        very prettily arranged. </p>

                        monsoon 'rain of an hour’s duration. </p>
                    <p>Of course, of amusements of the fashionable kind there are none to hegnile
                        the time, but for those who love sea-bathing, fishing, and an bnt-of-door
                        life, Ras-el-Bar is a small paradise. The bathing ui the best in Egypt, and
                        eaoh hotel has a hnt wherein batherrssan undress and dress. There are a few
                        shops, sujch as the inevitable bacals, a good barber, ^chemist, and last,
                        hut not least, a branch post-office. There is also from June, to October a
                        small body of police under the orders of a native officer. </p>
                    <p>» I should not omit to mention, for the information of would-be new-comers,
                        who may like to give the place a trial, that there is a regular steam boat
                        service that carries the mail between Damietta and Ras-el-Bar, the trip
                        occupying about an hour and running in coincidence with the arrival of the
                        passenger trains from Mansourah. Daring the busy season the Egyptian Railway
                        Administration runs an express train weekly each way whioh starts from Cairb

                    <head>THE CAIRO HOTELS.</head>
                    <p>In reference to the recent rise in the shares of the two leading hotel
                        companies of Egypt, it is worth noticing that the principal reason of the
                        rapid appreciation within the past few months of this class of securities is
                        the enormous increase since two years or so in the value of the land on
                        which the Grand Continental and the Savoy Hotels are built in the case of
                        the Nungovich Hotels Company, and in the case of the Egyptian Hotels
                        Company, of the land at Ghezireh, which has been and is being 3old at
                        rapidly increasing prices, </p>
                    <p>The former company bought $he New Hotel, now the Grand Continental, àboùt
                        six years ago, including the land it stands on and the furniture it
                        contained, for £105,000, which, at the time, was considered the lull value.
                        The presentvalue of the land alone, which measures 11,000 squarè metres, at
                        the modest price of £20 per square metre, represents an increase of no less
                        than £4 per share on the entire share capital of the company, not reckoning
                        the building, furniture and good-will of a concern that pays yearly
                        dividends of ten per cent. </p>
                    <p>The Savoy Hotel, as it is, was bought about a year later than the other from
                        Prince J)jemil Pasha Toussoum,we believe for £55,000. The land is 5,000
                        square metres in extent, but owing to the' extraordinary increase in the
                        price of land in the best part of the Ismailia quarter the site alone to-day
                        is worth the fifty five thousand pounds, without counting the palatial
                        buildings erected on it. This* repre-^ sente an increase in value of at
                        least £2 per share on the whole of the share capital. With these figures
                        before us can one wonder that the £4 shares of the Nungovioh Hotels are now
                        worth £10 or thereabouts, and those of the Egyptian Hotels at an equally
                        high premium ? . </p>
                    <p>As we mentioned a few weeks back, the former company have pnrobased by
                        preemption a portion of the estate of the late Sabet Pasha, adjoining the
                        Savoy Hotel, and on the ground so acquired they are to ereot additional
                        buildings to accommodate the large and ever-increasing clientèle that
                        patrorises this hotel during the winter season, besides enlarging the
                        restaurant and making other mnoh-needed improvements. </p>

                        <p>Mr. W. L. Lawton, of the Jewell Export Filter Co., having just completed
                            the installation of a plant of these filters at the new waterworks in
                            this town, entertained his numerous friends on the dahabieh “Ariadne,”
                            kindly lent for the occasion by Mr. Dale, yesterday. Anchored in
                            mid-stream, the rigging dressed with the flags of all hâtions, that of
                            the star-spangled banner predominating, with a tapestried awning
                            overhead, and palm-branches arched over the columns around the sides,
                            file dahabieh made a gay show by day. At night, the numberless coloured
                            lights, strung on high amongst the rigging and all </p>
                        <p>quite a fairy-hkè appearance. On the island in mid-stream two cannon had
                            been plaoed, the thunders of which were interrupted by the authorities,
                            it being against the Government regulations to fire artillery within 250
                            metres of the town, but our oourteous Moudir : kindly the fireworks,
                            rockets, Roman candles, etc., on this special occasion, the first time,
                            in the annals of Mansourah, that this American fête has been celebrated
                            in such a public maimer. Unfortunately the members of the American
                            Mission were absent, having been called away the previous day to attend
                            a meeting at Alexandria, so that Mr. Lawton was^ the only oitizen
                            present, but he war a host in himself, and reoéîved his guests for
                            afternoon tfh at 5 o’clock on the deck of the dahabieh. This fonction
                            over the company crossed over to the island amid-stream, where the
                            gentlemen entertained the ladies by engaging in athletic sports. On
                            their return to the boat, they found a sumptuous dinner spread out on a
                            table which had been prettily decorated with flowers and plants by Mrs.
                            Dale. Toasts, songs, and musio followed to a late hour of the night. </p>
                        <p>Mr. Lawton was ably assisted in the efforts to celebrate his national
                            fête-day by Messrs, McCrae, Anderson, and Holeman, whose hearty
                            co-operation went far to make the affair the success that it was. During
                            the evening, muoh was said in praise of our most energetic Moudir,
                            Mustapha Pashà Maher, for the many improvements he has introduced into
                            the town, amongst them the paving of the main streets, their present
                            cleanliness and order, and the construction of a, carriage drive and
                            promenade along the hanks of the river, south of the town into the open
                            oountry. This drive is to be planted with trees, which will form a shady
                            avenue*, A new street has already been commenced, orossing the town, and
                            opening up a route from the river to the open fields by the cemeteries.
                            Not only has the Moudir had “Beni Adam” at heart in his endeavours to
                            benefit the town, but his establishment of a branch of the Society for
                            the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has been so successful, with the
                            active and able support of his officers, the police, and our veterinary
                            surgeon Dr. Trydel, that it is an exception now-a-daysto fin da siok
