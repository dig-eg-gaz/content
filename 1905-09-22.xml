                    <head>SANATORIA FOR WORKPEOPLE.</head>
                    <p>We should like to call the attention of our readers to the appeal published
                        in oar issue of yesterday on behalf of the National Committee for the
                        establishment of sanatoria for workmen suffering from tuberculosis. The
                        importance of the subject from a national point of view is enormous, for no
                        country suffers more than Great Britain from this terrible malady, and in no
                        country are the signs of physical degeneration more apparent among sections
                        of the working classes. The yearly loss of life among the working classes of
                        London alone from this cause equals the death roll of the greatest battles
                        that have been fought, and the direct and indirect loss to the community
                        must be proportionately heavy. Moreover the partial segregation of oases,
                        which is so necessary in this disease cannot be applied in the case of the
                        sick among the working classes, for financial reasons. The great employers
                        of labour in Germany have constructed sanatoria for the special use of their
                        workmen and have benefited both themselves and the nation. The German
                        insurance companies have followed suit and in consequence the mortality from
                        the disease in Germany has enormously decreased in the last fifteen years. </p>
                    <p>The present movement aims at securing the support of the Friendly Societies,
                        after the first expense of finding a site and patting up suitable premises
                        has been met There is to be no constant appeal to public, and private
                        liberality, as is too often the case in England. Charity will see that the
                        initial expenses are met, and the class for whose special benefit the
                        sanatoria are provided will maintain them through the medium of the great
                        Friendly Societies, Trades Unions, and cognate organisa- tions. The self
                        respect of the working classes will be maintained, for those who profit by
                        the scheme will know that they owe the benefits they receive from it, in a
                        large measure, to their own thrift and self-help. Indiscriminate charity is
                        useless and dangerous, but a combination of charity and business -the
                        intellectual quantities being allowed to plan and carry out the good work
                        which the emotions of sympathy and pity have first suggested—cannot fail to
                        do good to all whom it affects. The movement, therefore, deserves the utmost
                        support from all classes,aud its success may yet furnish our Sanitary
                        authorities with precious data as to the best means of meeting the extension
                        of the disease in Egypt </p>

                    <head>THE CHOLERA IN GERMANY.</head>
                    <p>About a month ago, an outbreak of cholera occurred in the region where the
                        provinces of West Prussia and Posen border upon the Russian Empire. The
                        outbreak cannot be called an epidemic, for the disease has neither spread to
                        other districts of the German Empire, nor has it claimed many victims in the
                        neighbourhood where it first appeared. From day to day only a few new cases
                        axe observed, and the number of fatal attacks up to the present has amounted
                        to no more than 40% of the whole. In towns outside the restricted cholera
                        area, only such persons have become infected with the disease, who have
                        recently travelled from or to the district in question. By strictly
                        isolating each patient, the spreading of the cholera to other localities has
                        been successfully guarded against. As the weather is now becoming cooler,
                        and since according to all experience the cholera spreads with great
                        rapidity only daring the hot season, it may now be hoped that the disease
                        will soon come to an end also in the frontier territories of West Prussia
                        and Posen. </p>
                    <p>That the efforts to localise this outbreak of cholera have been so far
                        successful—and as we hope will be so for the future—is due in the first
                        place to the strict preventive regulations, which have been enforced. One of
                        the very first precautions adopted was to provide a number of supervising
                        stations along the rivers in the infected area, in order that all persons
                        passing to and fro on the barges might be made to undergo a medical
                        examination, so that if necessary in case of any suspicions of cholera, they
                        could be stopped and at once isolated in the temporary cholera hospitals
                        provided for that purpose. As the cholera first appeared among the people
                        living on barges, it was necessary to watch the river population especially
                        carefully. When any suspicious case was noticed, not only was the sick
                        person isolated, bat also those of his immediate neighbourhood. Such a
                        process of isolation on a large scale took place in the case of the railway
                        brigade, which had sent two complete companies (500 men) to take part in the
                        fortress manoeuvres at Thorn, a place lying within the infected area. Owing
                        to one of there 500 soldiers having shown symptoms of cholera in Thorn, the
                        whole of the 500 men on their return to Berlin were sent to the cholera
                        isolation barracks, and placed for eight days under the strictest
                        supervision ; and no exception was made in the case of officers or
                        non-commissioned officers with regard to this very unpleasant restriction of
                        their personal freedom. In short, precautions were taken everywhere on the
                        principle that an excess of care was far preferable to too little, in the
                        case of such a frightful sickness as cholera. It is worthy of remark also
                        that from the very first no attempt was made to hash up the real State of
                        affairs. On the contrary, in order to put the public on guard for their own
                        safety, all the measures adopted were discussed with the utmost publicity,
                        and all cases of cholera were immediately announced through the Press. It is
                        a great advantage, and of great importance for the foreign trade of Germany,
                        that the district infected with cholera is a purely agricultural one, and
                        without any connection with trade or industry. All districts, which are in
                        touch with foreign trade, whether through manufacture or export, have
                        remained free from cholera. </p>

                        its prospectus in the latter half of October. The capital of the new company
                        will amount to L.E. 500,000 in L.E. 4 shares, and its operations will, we
                        understand, be confined to the purchase of land which it will sell in
                        allotments of all sizes to the peasantry ; and to the lease of lands which

                        to buy, but can afford to pay a moderate rent. The company will be purely an
                        Egyptian concern, its head-quarters will be in Cairo, though we hear that a
                        locality has not yet been selected. This, however, is of small importance to

                    <head>SUEZ.</head>
                    <p>Mr. pro Consul Laferla reports that the trade of Suez for the year 1904
                        amounted to L.E. 1,486,420 showing an increase of L.E. 161,182 over the
                        figures of the previous year. Of the imports, coal fell off, only 10,497
                        tons being landed against 55,644 tons in 1903 and we do not notice any
                        reason given for this curious fall. The imports of tobacco, spices and live
                        cattle and sheep showed an increase, 15,202 more sheep and cattle being
                        imported than in 1903. The prevalence of cattle plague in Egypt in 1904
                        explains this increase, while the failure of the Indian indigo crop in
                        Madras and Bengal brought down the import very considerably. Cotton twist
                        yam and raw silk showed an increase, and raw sugar, mostly from Batavia and
                        the East, was imported to be refined in Egypt for re-exportation. </p>
                    <p>The export trade from Suez for the year 1904 shows an increase of L.E.47,599
                        as compared with the previous year. This increase is attributed mainly to
                        the steady demand and the revival of trade generally with the Red Sea and
                        Eastern ports. </p>
                    <p>The exportation of gum was 6,510 tons, valued at L.E. 146,522. This shows an
                        increase of 2,450 tons, valued at L.E. 58,781, over the previous year.
                        Nearly one-fourth of the above quantity was shipped to France, the remainder
                        being distributed between the United Kingdom, Germany and America. 17,848
                        tons of Egyptian cane sugar, valued at L.E. 191,149 were exported during the
                        year 1904, less than the previous year. Of the above quantity, 12,217 tons
                        were sent to India and other British possessions in the Far East; Turkish
                        Arabia taking 4,910 tons and Massawah 420 tons. 13,346 kilos of ivory,
                        valued at L.E. 7,721 were exported. This shows a decrease of 1,198 kilos.,
                        valued at L.E. 1,316, compared with the previous year. Nearly the whole of
                        the above quantity was shipped to the United Kingdom. 13,346 kilos of
                        ostrich feathers, valued at L.E, 7,721 were exported, as against 5,454
                        kilos., valued at L.E. 11,217 in 1903; the United Kingdom took nearly the
                        whole of the above quantity. The customs valuation of ostrich feathers has
                        been considerably reduced. This accounts for the increase in weight and the
                        decrease in value for the year 1904. 159,000 kilos, of cotton were exported,
                        valued at L.E. 10,037, more than one-half of which was shipped to India, the
                        remainder to China. 24,808 ardebs of wheat, valued at L.E. 20,484, were
                        exported, as against 26,011 ardebs, valued at L.E. 24,153, in the previous
                        year. </p>
                    <p>The total value of goods which passed in transit through Suez was L.E.
                        21,392. Of this amount nearly one-half came from the United Kingdom, and the
                        remainder from China and Eastern possessions. </p>

                    <head>ELECTRIC TRAMWAY SCHEME.</head>
                    <p>(From our Correspondent.)</p>
                    <p>Beyrout, September 15. A long-felt need that Beyrouth has required for years
                        is at last to be realised. Locomotion lies at the root of economic
                        development and is essential to the creation of populous industrial and
                        commercial centres, while for already fairly large towns, which like
                        Beyrout, have grown simultaneously in area and population,—Beyrout being
                        like a vast village, several of its houses being surrounded with more or
                        less large gardens, even in central quarters — a superior mode of
                        locomotion, such as an electric tramway, is of vital importance. From east
                        to west Beyrout measures over three miles long and from north to south over
                        two miles wide, and this is considerable for a town whose population is not
                        more than 120,000 souls. The initiator of the present scheme is Mr. Selim
                        Eid, who, indeed, bad conceived the humbler plan of a tramway drawn by
                        animal power, as far back as 1895, and who, after several disappointments
                        and failures, has by his perseverance and energy, finally attained his end,
                        and in a more successful manner than he had ever dreamed of. When Mr.
                        Pilling obtained the concession for the Caiffa-Damascus railway, the
                        so-called débris of which has since been bought up for, the Hamidié-Hedjaz
                        railway, he got in the same firman a secondary concession for a tramway tor
                        Beyrout, but with animal traction. This, concession Mr. Eid bought up, and
                        after many reverses of fortune, he finally found the necessary capital for
                        the realisation of the scheme; but as he was lately going through the, final
                        formalities at Constantinople, a Belgian company, finding apparently in the
                        scheme. alluring prospects of profit, stepped in to oust Mr. Eid's company,
                        and to attain their end, proposed to the Turkish Government the superior
                        mode of locomotion by electricity, and, to further engage the Sultan’s
                        favor, offered to make a donation of L.T. 10,000 to the Hamidié-Hedjaz
                        railway, in which the Sultan takes such a deep and personal interest There
                        was nothing left for Mr. Bid’s company but to concede the same terms. The
                        rival company, however, persisted keenly in the competition, and made a
                        higher hid of L.T. 2,000 more, but thanks to the influence that Mr. Eid had
                        at his back, his rivals’ second offer was declined, on the delicate ground
                        that the matter could not be brought down to the level of a public auction. </p>
                    <p>Armed with vizierial orders, Mr. Eid came with the engineers to Beyrout to
                        discuss matters with the Vali and the Municipality. Our governor, being an
                        enlightened man, of course lent his full support to a public enterprise
                        calculated to affect so deeply the future prosperity of the town and its
                        environs, and the welfare of the inhabitants. The original plan of the
                        company was to bisect the town with two long lines crossing each other at
                        the square, one to start from near the Lighthouse at Ras Beyrouth, ran by
                        the Syrian Protestant College, then along the Deaconesses road, then the
                        barracks, the square, and on through the Dog River road, up to the bridge
                        near the Lebanese frontier, while the second line is to start from before
                        the Custom House in front of the leading-place, wind round Khan Antoun Bey,
                        then up to the barracks, the square, thence northward along the Damascus
                        Road to Furn El Shebbak, again at the Lebanese frontier. These of course are
                        vital lines, but the Vall remarked with justice that the benefits accruing
                        therefrom would be derived chiefly by the Christian quarters, and as the
                        Moslems were in almost equal proportion it was only fair that they should
                        also receive their share from a public enterprise of this nature, where-fore
                        he proposed that another trank line should be laid along the main road that
                        passes through Al Bashoura, one of the most populous and important Moslem
                        quarters, occupying the south western hill of the town ; to which the
                        concessionaires reasonably ac-quiesced. The Vali then further proposed that
                        a small branch should be extended to the municipal hospital and school of
                        industry, the foundation of which was lately inaugurated with such solemnity
                        on the occasion of the anniversary of the Sultan's accession. These
                        institutions are specially dear to the Vali's heart, for the original
                        conception and the materialisation thereof, such as the collection of fends
                        etc., are mainly his, and he looks to them as memorials, to live after him,
                        of bis philanthropy and his devotion to his Imperial Master. Again the
                        concession-naires acceded to this demand of the Governor, who, encouraged by
                        their complaisance made to them a third proposal, which, however, could not
                        admit of the same obliging acquiescence, inasmuch as it involves an
                        expenditure of about £30,000. This represents the cutting of a straight and
                        wide road from the Custom House right through the old town, emerging on the
                        other side near the Maronite Cathedral of St. George, opposite the convent
                        of the Sisters of Charity. This part of the old town, consisting as it does
                        of an agglomeration of old buildings mostly several stories high, thè
                        cutting of the wide road proposed would necessarily cause the demolition of
                        a great deal of property, and the L.T. 80,000 demanded by the Vali from the
                        concessionaires represents a loan to be contracted by the municipality for
                        expropriation account, and to be sank in a certain term of years. Despite
                        the guarantees of municipal revenues, the concessionaires were quite
                        justified in their reserve, considering the comparative largeness of the
                        sum, and the heavy indebtedness of the municipality. They nevertheless
                        promised to take into consideration the question of a smaller loan, say of </p>
                    <p>£10,00 This demand of the Vali is indicative of the progressive spirit that
                        actuates his actions, and a great deal of courage on his part, for the
                        execution of such a scheme is likely to create a storm of opposition on the
                        part of the proprietors of those old buildings, most of whom are more or
                        less illiterate Moslems of the old conservative type. Had not one of the
                        pro-gressive and enlightened Valis of Beyrout undertaken a similar task, and
                        actually started the work of enlargement of the Souk E Fashkha, and had
                        finally to stop halfway. The cutting through of that thoroughfare would have
                        shortened distances considerably and proved invaluable to the general
                        traffic. There had been some differences between the engineers and the
                        municipality. The former had proposed to macadamise that part of the road
                        only on which the rails are to be laid, but as our roads are on the whole in
                        a wretched condition and have not even a thin foundation of pebble layer,
                        such partial repair might prove a serious obstacle to the general traffic,
                        on account of the inequalities of level that would result. I have since
                        heard that this point was at last settled satisfactorily . The total length
                        of the lines according to the present plan is to be about ten kilometres,
                        and I believe the company will have the option of certain extensions. The
                        motor force is to be probably hydraulic. It is not known yet which of the
                        waterfalls will be chosen, that of Anteliss or Nahr El Kalb. Both are said
                        to have been found sufficiently powerful for the instalment of the company's
                        electric plant. I have been told by one connected with Mr. Bid that if the
                        company should meet with difficulties, in obtaining the use of either of
                        these waterfalls, they would finally decide on petroleum for the production
                        of electricity. The limit accorded for the completion of the work of
                        construction is said to be one year end four months. </p>
                    <p>On the basis of snob an agreement as roughly sketched above Mr. Eid and
                        engineers sailed last week for Constantinople with a regular Mazbeda from
                        the municipality. What is needed now is the final Irade, which Mr. Eid has
                        every chance of getting, in view of the influential support that he has from
                        high quarters at the Capital. </p>
                    <p>Every intelligent man in Beyrout wishes Mr. Eid success in his scheme which
                        if realised will certainly prove an incalculable benefit to Beyrout, and a
                        lasting memorial to the foresight, perseverance, and untiring , of one of
                        its distinguished inhabitants. </p>

                        <p>Sir,---I will be pleased if you will publish the following with regard to
                            your article “The Scandinavian Quarrel" in your issue of the 19th inst
                            Sweden has never demanded the dismantling of the old Norwegian
                            fortresses of Kongsvinger and Fredrikatain, but the question now raised
                            by Sweden concerns the new fortresses constructed by Norway on the
                            frontier since 1890, and which dominate railways and roads on the
                            Swedish territory. </p>
                        <p>Sweden will no longer tolerate what no other nation in the world would
                            stand ; fortresses which from the frontier’s immediate closeness could
                            cannonade extensive districts of the neighbouring country. </p>
                        <p>The fortresses of Fredrikstein and Kongs-ringer can be considered as the
                            legitimate protection, but the frontier fortress erected since 1890 as
                            illegitimate threats. </p>
                        <p>Sweden has not thought it necessary to erect fortresses on the frontier
                            against Norway as a united state but now when the separation of the two
                            countries has to take place, owing to the Norwegian revolution of the
                            7th June. Sweden considers a neutral zone a better and more justified
                            guarantee of peace between the two countries than the erection of
                            fortresses on the Swedish territory opposite the frontier fortresses
                            quite unneccessarily constructed by Norway. </p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, Sir, Yours faithfully, </p>

                        <note>[Our correspondent forgets that the mete fact that a fortress commands
                            roads or positions in another country does not of itself justify a
                            demand for its demolition by the threatened party. The guns of the outer

                    <p>Les administrateurs-délégués des sucreries, qui viennent de se montrer d’une

                    <head>THE HEDJAZ RAILWAY.</head>
                    <head>THE YEMEN RISING.</head>
                    <p>A correspondent writes to the “Times” as follows:—</p>
                    <p>Of all railway undertakings in his empire, none lies nearer to the Saltan's
                        heart than the construction of the Hedjaz Railway, which will ultimately
                        render his communications with the Sacred Places of Arabia and the transport
                        of his troops independent of maritime highways. On September l.Kiazim Pasha,
                        the commander of the 5th Turkish Army Corps, declared a new section of the
                        Hedjaz Railway, 30 kilometres in length, open to traffic, and the camp at
                        Ma'an was, doubtless, the scene of patriotic demonstrations in honor of the
                        Saltan’s accession day. Early in October the Deraa-Haifa branch of the line,
                        the only section which is likely to be of much economic importance, will be
                        completed, and the Turkish military authorities and Herr Meissner, the able
                        German engineer who is responsible for the construction of the line, will be
                        able to look with satisfaction on a successful year’s work. South of Ma’an
                        the engineering difficulties are not great There is nothing to match the
                        series of steep gradients which the railway climbs above ’Amman, or the
                        ravines crossed by a huge viaduct on the east bank of the Jordan, and all
                        railway material required for the south extension of the Hamidieh-Hedjaz
                        railway will be Bent up to railhead far more cheaply and rapidly than in the
                        past, when every sleeper came op from Beyrout by the French company’s
                        Lebanon railway to Damascus, and paid a rather heavy freight charge into the
                        bargain. </p>
                    <p>The railway will reach the Hedjaz in another three years, unless the
                        prophecies of an Arab upheaval are fulfilled, and though, taken as a whole,
                        it will never pay, its military importance, more especially when it is
                        linked with the Anatolian and Baghdad systems, must be obvious to any
                        student of Eastern politics. Its defensive value, in the case of an outbreak
                        in the Hedjaz, will be immense ; it may perhaps be used for offensive
                        purposes, and even to-day, after making every deduction for bad management
                        on the part of ignorant or venal subordinates, it can transport a fully
                        equipped division to railhead in less than a month. About 20,000 Syrian
                        Redifs (reserve) and Nizam (regulars) were entrained at Damascus or’Ammam,
                        concentrated at Ma’an, and marched to Akaba in little over a month this
                        spring. The French company's Damascus-Mezerib line supplied any deficiencies
                        in rolling stock, the German railway officials successfully averted
                        collisions, and though the Redifs lacked equipment and suffered, as Turkish
                        reservists alone can suffer, the line was shown to be a valuable military
                        asset. </p>
                    <p>Some of the critics of the Ottoman Government assert that the Bedouin of
                        Midian and the Hedjaz will make any extension of the line south of Tobuk
                        impossible. I doubt it, for the Bedouin is a poor fighter, unlike the
                        settled Arab of Azir and Yemen, and 4,000 to 5,000 soldiers and a few
                        hundred Circassian colonists have guarded the line with success up to now
                        and fresh troops will always be forthcoming to secure the path to the Holy
                        Cities. If the Yemen insurrection spreads northward to the Syrian frontiers,
                        the line and Turkish power in Arabia with it will be destroyed; but though
                        its construction has caused much heart burn ing among the Arabs, who hate
                        and despise the Turk and his rule, the population of North-West Arabia is
                        too sparse and too divided to offer much resistance. Indeed, the Yemen
                        revolt has had more effect in Syria, where certain sections of the
                        population are arming fast, than in North Arabia, where the Bedouin are
                        neither more nor less troublesome than usual. </p>
                    <p>But in South Arabia the Yemen is in revolt, and, though I believe that the
                        Turk will win in the end, his victory will be dearly bought. Since Mukhtar
                        Pasha's conquest in 1872, the province has been the scene of constant
                        rebellions, both political and religious, against the Osmanli garrisons. The
                        population of the Yemen consists mainly of Zaidis—settled Arabs—whose sect
                        derives its name from Zaid, a grandson of Ali Asgbar, the Fifth Imam and
                        great grandson of Ali, who was executed in 739 a.d. by the Caliph Hisham.
                        While they resemble the Shiahs in refusing to acknowledge the Sultan of
                        Turkey as commander of the faithful, they approach the Sunnis in matters of
                        dogma, holding, for instance, that the first three Imams were legitimate, a
                        position which every Shiah declares is untenable. Ruled till the Turkish
                        conquest by Imams, who claimed descent from Fatima, they felt the loss of
                        their political and religious autonomy most keenly, and the Sunnis of the
                        province soon made common cause with them against the misgovernment and
                        arrogance of their Turkish and Circassian masters. One abuse was
                        particularly felt. The Remenis pay the askarieh or military exemption tax,
                        as do the Druses and Ansairiyeh of Syria, and avaricious functionaries
                        supplied them with forged receipt which were not recognised by their
                        successors who forced the luckless Arabs to pay again and again.
                        Restrictions upon commerce irritated the traders. Moslems from Egypt and
                        India informed the people that Moslem lands under infidel rulers were justly
                        and humanely governed, and the Bedouin, with whom plunder is the first
                        consideration, were not averse to combining with the other elements of the
                        population against a Government which did its best to make brigandage a
                        State monopoly, The ground was prepared, and, when the Imam Yahya, son of
                        Hamid ed-Din, who unsuccessfully attacked Sana'a in the nineties, took the
                        field, no Arab of the Yemen but wished him success. At the beginning of the
                        revolt the Imam's forces did not exceed 5000 men but a scries of successes
                        added to their numbers and confidence. The system of "petits paquests"
                        ruined the chances of the Turks. </p>
                    <p>Attempting to bo strong everywhere, they were beaten in detail, and by the
                        end of February the situation was so serious that it was decided to mobilise
                        the greater part of the reserves of the 5th (Syrian) Army Corps. The
                        decision was a fatal one : for, though the Nizam of the 5th Army Corps
                        includes Turks from Europe and Anatolia, the Redifs are almost all Syrian
                        Moslems, who, though good enough soldiers when fighting for a cause that
                        appeals to them, are not anxious to fight other Moslems on behalf of the
                        Turk. The 7th (Yemen) Army Corps is largely recruited from Syria, and the
                        fact that not more than 25 per cent, of the yearly contingent ever return
                        from the vilayet, and that half of these are incapacitated for field work by
                        malaria, did not encourage the Redifs, most of whom were married men, to go
                        cheerfully to the front. Some 24 battalions actually left Syria, two-thirds
                        of which were composed of Redifs. Their sufferings on the Hedjaz Railway and
                        in the crowded transports that conveyed them from Akaba to Hodeida were very
                        great. There were many desertions, but the staff of the 7th Army Corps
                        ordered up the first battalions which arrived to Sana's at once, in the hope
                        of checking the spread of the revolt. The first reinforcements, arriving in
                        driblets, were of little service. Some deserted and more refused to fight,
                        and by the beginning of April Riza Pasha found the Arab host swollen to
                        35,000 men, threatening Sana’a. The town was hardly fitted to stand an
                        investment, much less a siege. The citadel, on a steep and barred hill, was
                        surrounded by a strong rampart, but the majority of the wells and the
                        gardens were situated outside the wall. The station had never been healthy ;
                        the Arab town, in spite of the execution of its chief Sheikh, was openly
                        hostile ; and, if ammunition was running short provisions were absolutely
                        lacking, for Riza Pasha does not seem to have realised that even Turkish and
                        Arab soldiers required food. Meanwhile large bodies of Arabs captured the
                        passes between Sana’a and Menakha, and by mid-April the ten battalions
                        holding out in Sana’a were suffering from famine. </p>
                    <p>Riza Pasha appears to have left Sana’a before its complete investment and to
                        have hurried to Hodeida to hasten the relief columns. In the third week of
                        April some 10,000 men, mostly 8yrian Redifs, with a convoy of 4,000 camels,
                        left the coast and advanced on the passes. A description of the disaster
                        that followed, received through a trustworthy intermediary from one of the
                        survivors, explains the defeat. The advance was delayed for six days after
                        the last contingent had disembarked at Hodeida, which wore taken up by the
                        loading of the camels with provisions and ammunition. The rebels meantime
                        fortified the passes and blockhouses which they had captured. As soon as the
                        troops entered the mountains the attack began, and the advance soon came to
                        a standstill in the face of a heavy fire, and a rain of boulders rolled down
                        the precipitous sides of the defiles. The Redifs, out of humour with the
                        campaign from the first, lost heart, and their commander finally ordered the
                        troops to cease firing while he proposed a surrender "The Arabs rushed down
                        on us like vultures, crying ‘Sellim, sellim !'-i.e. ‘Surrender!’ He who did
                        not lay down bis arms was shot or cleft in twain by the marvellous swords of
                        the infernal Arabs.” The troops were disarmed, six guns and the camels and
                        their loads fell into the hands of the rebels, and the miserable procession
                        of beaten men was led to Sana’a and driven into the starving town Prisoners
                        were forced to train the captured guns upon its ramparts. Within the walls
                        famine and disease claimed hundreds of victims, and the wretched soldiers
                        devoured roots and grass. The failure of the relief column made surrender
                        necessary, and the remnant of 20 battalions (including the relieving force)
                        with 12 gnus gave themselves up The commanding officers and the rank and
                        file were spared, but many of the functionaries and regimental officers were
                        haled outside the walls and shot. Some of the Turks, weakened by famine, are
                        said to have shown cowardice hot the Albanians and Circassians went proud’
                        ly to their death. The executions over the survivors were sent back to
                        Hodeida. Of 20,000 men, over 8,000 had perished or disappeared. </p>
                    <p>The victorious Imam now sent letters and proclamations to all the chiefs of
                        Arabia, calling on them to join him, and, to the horror of the pan-Islamic
                        party, struck coins bearing the title of "the Commander of the Faithful :
                        Hamid-ed-Din I.” He encouraged traders to enter the country, maintained
                        order by just severity, cutting off the hands of thieves and blinding spies,
                        and drove the remaining Turkish detachments to the coast His agents or
                        supporters, some of whom are believed to be Syrian Christians, spread the
                        news in Syria and Egypt, and prophesied the coming of the Arab awakening
                        (Nahda Ara-biya), but I doubt whether the "young Turk” or Syrian journalists
                        who have hinted at the restoration of the glories of Haroun el Rashid in the
                        Continental Press have very much in common with the redoubtable Yahya, end
                        the majority of Eastern Christian, will require come very solid guarantees
                        before they support an Arab chieftain against the Turk. Yahya himself,
                        despite bis proclamations and coins offered to pay a tribute to the Sultan
                        on con-dition that the religions and political autonomy of the Yemen was
                        guaranteed, but the Porte refused to negotiate with a schismatic and a </p>
                    <p>Meantime events of some importance had taken plane In the Nejd. As early as
                        Novem-ber, 1904 ten battalions received order to leave Bagdad and march into
                        inner Arabia Subsequent reports credited the Ottoman military authorities
                        with the extraordinary design of despatching this force to he Yemen by way
                        of Hail and the southern pilgrim route which runs behind the coast range
                        from the Holy Cities Abbs and Sana's. But to believe that this was the
                        original design credits the Turkish War Office with truly prophetic
                        foreknowledge of the disasters of April and May, 1905, and with stupendous
                        folly in sending forces overland which could have been transported by sea to
                        Hodeida in one-fifth of the The real motive of the expedition was the desire
                        of Turkey to establish her influence in the Nejd. Abdul-Aziz ibn Rashid of
                        Hail, nephew of the great Emir Mohamed, having lost the southern oasis of
                        Riadh to Abdul-Aziz ibn Saud, a descendant of the Wahabi rulers of the Nejd,
                        and having had none the best of a desultory war with Sheikh Mubarak ibn
                        8abah of Koweit, forsook his great uncle’s policy and called in the Turk.
                        The Ottoman Government had long coveted the Neid, and to that end had at
                        first aided Mubarak and the Wahabis in their campaign against the Shammar
                        Emir. But recent events in the Persian Golf had made Mubarak an object of
                        suspicion, and it was decided to support the Emir of Hail. After some delay
                        at Meshed Ali, the Turkish column entered the wastes, and reached Hail, as
                        per haps was the intention, too late to save Ibn Rashid from defeat
                        Mubarak’s men had come up from the Persian Gulf, joined the Riadh army,
                        inflicted a crushing defeat on Ibn Rashid, and were on their way back to the
                        coast Rumours, industriously spread by the Turks in Syria and Arabia,
                        ascribed their success to the presence of two British officers. </p>
                    <p>The Hail Emir was now compelled to welcome the Turks, who showed no anxiety
                        to recover the Riadh oasis for their protege. A timely naval demonstration
                        relieved Mubarak from all apprehension of Turkish reprisals, not without
                        increasing Turkish resentment The Turks remained for at least six weeks at
                        Hail and then received orders to proceed to Medina, where they arrived in
                        May. The news that greeted them was serious. The vilayet of Azir was
                        beginning to follow the example of the Yemen, the Hedjaz Bedouin, in spite
                        of a severe lesson which they had received from the Egyptian escort of the
                        Cairo Mahmal in April, were giving trouble, and the Sherif of Mecca was
                        believed to be in correspondence with the Imam. The Turkish column was
                        therefore ordered to push on to Mecca, where it quieted the Bedouin, and
                        prevented the discontented Meccans from intriguing openly against the
                        Government If reports from the Red Sea and Syria are to be believed, it was
                        then that Marshal Ahmed Faizi Pasha, who was joined there at the same time
                        by Albanian troops, received the news of his appointment to the chief
                        command of his forces in the revolted provinces. Shortly after his departure
                        the Sherif Avn Er Rafik died very suddenly. </p>
                    <p>The rare official despatches from the Yemen are, as a rule, intentionally
                        vague as to the recent movements of the Turkish forces and the whereabouts
                        of their commander. The balance of rumour asserts that Ahmed Faizi marching
                        from Mecca to Taif and thence along the southern pilgrim road, relieved Abha
                        in the south of the Azir vilayet early in July. It may safely be assumed
                        that the Pasha has not accompanied a detached force whose means of
                        communication with the armies based on Hodeida and Mocha are merely nominal,
                        and a despatch received from Shakir Pasha, head of the Yemen Inspection
                        Commission, states that the Turkish commander was at Beit-el Mehdi, near
                        Menakha, on July 17. From a comparison of the data available it appears that
                        three Turkish forces are converging on the capital of the Yemen. The first,
                        composed in part of Ahmed Faizi’s old force, has relieved Abha and is moving
                        south towards Sahran, where the Zaidi territory begins ; the second and
                        largest force, based upon Hodeida has apparently reoccupied Menakha and
                        defeated bodies of rebels at Bury-Sahid on the Sana’a, and Beit-el-Neyd on
                        the Sanfour roads ; while a third force of eight battalions is moving via
                        Taiz towards the road which leads to Sana’a from the south. Cooperation
                        between these last two columns, not to speak of the Azir force, is expected
                        to be a matter of ex-treme difficulty. </p>
                    <p>Some 50.000 Turks are ip the field, and, should they be able to force on a
                        decisive action, the result cannot be doubtful. But, whatever the results of
                        this fresh campaign, it may be safely predicted that before the Saltan’s
                        rule is permanently established and consolidated in the Yemen, many a
                        Turkish reservist will echo the words of my informant :—"Allah grant the
                        Sultan victory ; but that land, my master, is not fit for men. Burning heat,
                        no water, and everywhere desert, no wonder that the Sultan's troops were
                        overpowered by those Arabs who seem to be the offspring of the Jinns.” </p>

                    <p>It is eight o'clock, the present hoar of the evening at the little restaurant
                        on the Ring which is handiest to the bourse and central telegraph station.
                        It is kept by a Jew, and, with the clannishness which still binds the lost
                        tribes, a good half of its customers are of the chosen people. Many of them
                        are journalists, who give each other rendezvous here instead of taking their
                        snack in the journalists’ room the telegraph office. On the pavement outside
                        there are half a score of tables shut off from passers-by and public
                        observation by an ivy-grown trellis, and inside thirty or forty more. A
                        telephone at the disposal of patrons in a box like a confessional, and an
                        electric fan clears the atmosphere. There is no reservation of tables, which
                        are of various dimensions - from the Gesellschafts, or party table, down to
                        the little Doppeltisch for two. </p>
                    <p>Statistics on the subject are not available, bat probably half the population
                        of Vienna prefers to dine out at the hour which happens to suit rather than
                        keep time for fixed at home. Some go to the big hotels, where they get
                        expensives wines, smart service, and comparatively smart company. Others
                        choose the out-of-door dinners in place of which the "Volksgarten” may stand
                        as a type. Here there are seven or eight hundred tables, and a very
                        first-class military band, which publishes its selected evening programme in
                        the afternoon. Half of the seats are under the trees and sky half under
                        cover. </p>
                    <p>No sooner is a customer seated than he is attacked by one of the waiters, who
                        flourishes programme before him, and proceeds to enumerate the chief
                        delicacies it contains A foreigner may be a fair German scholar, and able to
                        translate the stiffest Parliamentary debate without understanding more than
                        a word or two of the shibboleth of a Vienna waiter. The language of a menu
                        is a thing apart, but as it repeats itself in the coarse of a week in every
                        establishment in the city it does not require very long study to master its
                        intricacies. The two great failures are fish and mutton, the standing fish
                        items seldom embracing more than one or two fresh water sorts of bony habit
                        and muddy flavour, and mutton or lamb being conspicuously absent. On the
                        other hand, there are twenty separate preparations respectively of beef and
                        veal with lots of salads and sweets, but very little fruit We seat ourselves
                        at a fortuitously vacant table for four or five, order a macaroni soup and
                        take a look around us. In the middle of the room is a family party. The
                        father is grizzled, bloated, and squat, the mother.- quatter still. The girl
                        is handsome and large, with the high colour and the fall red lips of her
                        race, a gipsy straw hat and ostrich feather, a scarlet bow at her throat and
                        ribbon to match in her black hair. The young man is obsequious, sleek, and
                        admirative, as becomes him, of the words of wisdom from the old people and
                        of wit from the maiden. He is probably the promising apprentice, living on
                        nothing bat the prospect of marrying his chiefs daughter and succeeding to
                        what must be a prosperous business, to judge by the reckless manner in which
                        the old man orders a full portion of each dish per person. </p>
                    <p>Gradually the place fills, and all the other tables are occupied as a young
                        fellow comes in with a fair-haired girl of about seventeen Finding no chairs
                        elsewhere, they ask, for forms sake, if they may sit at our table, and do so
                        forthwith. He is a good-looking boy of perhaps one and-twenty, with dark
                        straight hair, a nascent moustache, and a big ring on his forefinger. She is
                        fresh with the unspoiled freshness of first feminity, which would make her
                        pretty even if she wore not naturally well favored. She wears an untrimmed
                        Panama hat, set rakishly back over her curly hair, struck through with a
                        deadly looking pin. a neat transparent cambric blouse, and spotless collar
                        and cuffs. Before long another man of about the same age comes up and has
                        room made for him, and the dinner-card is consulted carefully. It ends in
                        their ordering two plates of soup one of meat, and one of vegetables. Out of
                        this, with cheese and beer, they all three dine gloriously for about two
                        shillings. During dinner Moritz is generally clasp-ing Mizzi's hand without
                        occa-sionally popping titbits between her strong young teeth, which open for
                        them like a fledgling birds. She has slender white hands innocent of ring;
                        so they are not yet mar-ried. She is probably a "Laufmadl." or errand girl,
                        and he a shopman or clerk. If all goes extra well, there will be a notice of
                        their betrothal in the "Tagblatt"one day. </p>
                    <p>Whilst we are at table, a succession of beggars and pedlars file in and out.
                        In most cafes these poor folk are ruthlessly barred, but perhaps the
                        proprietor was once poor himself. At any rate, many of his customers cordore
                        with his allowing his co-religionists to pester them in a way eminently
                        calculated to drive them elsewhere, and which possibly does damage him to a
                        certain ex- tent. Their wares are of every description, from opera glasses,
                        which must have been stolen out of a fire to be offered at the price, down
                        to matches and toothpicks. There are, of course, heaps of postcards, and
                        packets of superfine notepaper and envelopes, cardboard oases of -sticking
                        plaster, penknives, shirt studs, and so on, with back numbers of comic
                        papers at a farthing apiece, and all the latest penny shockers, while tee
                        literary can bay Heine or Schiller, bound in doth of gold, for about
                        eighteen-pence. </p>
                    <p>As we are drinking our coffee, the fly-sheet of the "Zeit” from round the
                        corner comes in, with the latest telegrams from Washington and Pesth, and
                        after a cigarette we call for the bill. Though for years past too legal
                        tender is kronen ana heller, the café keepers have not been able to get the
                        gulden and kreuser out their heads, and our account is made out in the
                        ancient coinage. After paying it we must give at least three separate
                        tips—one to the head waiter, one to the man who served us, and one to the
                        "piccolo,” or beer-bringing boy. But the three together do not come to much
                        more than six-pence, and for that we are bowed out as barons at least We
                        must not forget to salute the Panama hat at our table, acknowledged by a
                        merry “Servus.” and we stroll out on to the Ring to the accompaniment of a
                        chorus of “Good-nights,” from everybody we pass. It has not been a bad
                        dinner, and nobody is the worse tor seeing a little of how the other half of
                        the world lives. </p>

                    <head>IRELAND AND JAPAN.</head>
                    <p>In the “Irish Rosary,” a bright monthly magazine conducted by the Dominican
                        Fathers. the Rev. Ambrosio Coleman gives a sketch of "Japan To-day." He
                        notes that Japan, with a population of 47 millions, contains only 15 million
                        acres under cultivation, or 18 per cent. of the land:- "Ireland with its
                        twenty million acres, three-fourths of which are under crops or pasture, has
                        exactly the same amount of cultivable land, and yet is only able to support
                        a diminishing population of four and a quarter millions. In Ireland, the
                        land where cows increase and men decay, we possess about ten million large
                        quadrupeds-that is, two and a half for each unit of the population. Japan,
                        on the contrary, is only able to feed three million quadrupeds including
                        1.500.000 horses, and 1 300 000 horned cattle, making the proportion of one
                        animal to sixteen units of the population. Carrying the contrast still
                        further, while Ireland imports most of the cereals from abroad to feed her
                        people, Japan not only feeds her enormous population on the same amount of
                        cultivable land that we have, without any assistance from other countries,
                        but is able to export agricultural produce. Japan is the most congested
                        district in the world, the ratio of human beings to the land being twice
                        high as in China, with its teeming population of four hundred millions. To
                        bring the case home to ourselves, it is just as if the whole population of
                        England and Scotland had to live here in Ireland, and obtain their whole
                        food supply from the area of land now under pasture and crops, no food being
                        imported from America or any other country. </p>
                    <p>Towards an explanation of this contrast, the writer remarks that rice, which
                        is the principal food of the Japanese, gives two prolific crops in the year.
                        He touches on a deeper difference </p>
                    <p>"Again there is not a large leisured class in Japan which preys on the vitals
                        of the population riches are very evenly divided among all classes, and
                        nearly every one has to work in some way or other for the wel1-being of the
                        nation. The evils of landlordism are not felt to any appreciable degree,the
                        Government having bought out the old feudal proprietors and enabled most of
                        the. farmers to become peasant proprietors, Though heavily taxed it is they
                        who tax themselves, and the money is spent in their own country, whereas we,
                        after paying our just contribution, are overtaxed to the tune of three
                        million sterling at least for the common needs of the British Empire.” </p>
                    <p>It is only fair to add that the writer finds the chief reason of the
                        difference in the Japanese spirit of economy, as opposed to the Irish and
                        English and American wastefulness. The Irish neglect oats supersede milk by
                        tea, despise fish, and overvalue flesh meat :— to the varied vegetables
                        which grow so plentifully in our climate, and supply the various elements of
                        nourishment to the human body, there seems to be a stolid determination
                        among the working classes, in spite of long-contìnued economic teaching, to
                        have nothing to do with any, except the well-known cabbage and potato. On
                        the other hand, the Japanese live on rice, Indian corn, and millet, which
                        they grow themselves ; they drink their own tea and smoke their own tobacco.
                        They set a high value on the fish they catch around their coasts and in
                        their lakes and rivers, and use meat but very sparingly. They utilise as
                        important articles of diet not only various vegetables out of which they
                        make soups, but different kinds of seaweed and nuts. By these means the
                        Japanese Blacksmith will live on 13, a wee, or 58s a month," </p>
                    <p>In japan there are no large handed proprietors. The farms average about two
                        acres. Twelve acres would be a large holding. Of the increase of factories
                        the writer says::- </p>
                    <p>"The Government is fully aware of the deteriorating influences on the workers
                        if the manufacturers were allowed to run their factories regardless of all
                        considerations except the money, so the best sanitary regulations have been
                        made for the comfort and well-being of the operatives, who work in the
                        large, well lighted, and well-ventilated apartment kept with scrupulous
                        cleanliness." </p>
