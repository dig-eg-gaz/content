                            breeze from the eastward. Towars sunset the barometer began to fall, the
                            weather became cooler, and the wind veered to the south, remaining so
                            throughout the night. The day opens dull an threatening with every

                        <head>THE RAILWAY REPORT. </head>
                        <p>The State Railways Commissioners append to their Report much detailed
                            information as to the expenditure proposed by them and which, based on
                            approximate figures, amounts to practically two and a quarter millions
                            of pounds. Roughly speaking, another three quarters of a million are
                            entered for “new lines” and we are thus brought back to the figure of
                            three millions which has been talked of for some time as necessary for
                            railway purposes. To us it is very satisfactory to observe that the
                            needs of Lower Egypt in general, and of Alexandria and Gabbari in
                            particular, are held to be the greatest and the most pressing, but, as
                            additions and improvements find their places under all possible heads
                            and at all parts of the system, satisfaction must be generally felt.
                            Incidentally reference is made to the provision of four lines of rails
                            between Cairo and Alexandria. In onr opinion, this work will prove of
                            earlier and greater importance than some of the proposed extensions, and
                            we think it, or our end of it, might well have found its place in a
                            3-year programme of expenditure. The most urgent need, and one of the
                            largest provisions, is for "rolling stock.” Engines are said to have
                            been kept alive too long, the necessity for which is to cease, and
                            improved types are the capital which will secure both economy and
                            efficiency. The theory that it is best to work an engine to death fairly
                            quickly is a somewhat new one from the other side of the Atlantic, but
                            it is being very generally accepted as correct all over the world. More
                            carriages are to be supplied in view of increased passenger traffic
                            induced by a reduction of the lowest class fares. We are ourselves
                            inclined to think the increased facilities, even without any serious
                            decrease of charges, will bring a large additional passenger traffic.

                        <p>meet the increased demand for them, and to prevent such traffic as
                            properly belongs to the railways being diverted to water and other
                            routes. The requireménts of the public are fully considered in this
                            matter, and the details specified show that train safety, convenience,
                            and comfort have been studied. This consideration, indeed, appears to
                            have been carried to an extreme, and while we do not accept, as a
                            necessity, the provision of bogie carriage-, for the lowest class
                            traffic, we do not either under stand the affection shown for the 10 ton
                            goods wagon. </p>
                        <p>Taken as a whole, the improvement effected of late years in the condition
                            of the “Perina nent way” seems to have been very great, and apparently
                            the attention devoted to this in. Lower Egypt has, to some extent, stood
                            in the way of other requirements which will now be seen to. A great deal
                            is to be taken in hand in respect of improved station and siding
                            accommodation, which will facilitate the working of the traffic and make
                            it safer. Unfortunately, from the remarks on the subjects of
                            “Signalling” and ‘Fencing,” there is an all too present and even
                            unnecessary danger to travellers upon the railways and to persons
                            crossing the lines. All wants of this sort appear to have been seen and
                            their rectification provided for to a reasonable extent. The above
                            requirements,, and the doubling of the line from Wasta to Minieh in
                            Upper Egypt and from Palais de Koubbeh to Matarieh on the local line out
                            of Cairo, practically total up to the recommendation of the Commission
                            to expend a sum of £2,224,000. </p>
                        <p>A sum of £700,000 is added for “projected lines,” but the Commissioners
                            wisely discriminate between reporting upon open lines of railways and
                            giving an opinion upon those projected. This they leave to those who are
                            better acquainted with and have larger opportunities of studying the
                            requirements and the prospective values of the districts intended to be
                            served. Our own view is that a line from Salhieh to Kantara must kill
                            that recently constructed between Kautara and ismailia, and the line
                            from Zagazig to Zifta is no longer necessary in an already well served
                            district, if, as we are compelled to, we regard Port Said as the natural
                            outlet for the Zazazig district. We probably shall not hear much more of
                            these new lines at present, and in the meantime we shall expect other
                            projects to claim attention. The proposal to widen the gauge between
                            Luxor and Assouan is set aside for what appear to be excellent reasons,
                            including due appreciation of the fact that even a large first-class
                            passenger traffic for a short period in the year does not, from a
                            business point of view, justify a big outlay. In the place of this
                            proposal one is put forward to connect the Egyptian and Sudan railways
                            by supplying the missing link between Assouan and Wady Haifa. It is only
                            a distance of 200 miles or so, and the recommendation of the
                            Commissioners is doubtless based, in a general way, upon their
                            experience that it pays to “link up” under such circumstances. We are
                            ourselves inclined to think so in this case, if no great natural
                            obstacles present themselves, and, in addition, we see in the project
                            great advantage for administration and military purposes. </p>
                        <p>The different “Notes” in the Appendix contain much of interest, and to
                            those who feel so inclined we commend a perusal thereof. The tables
                            which give comparative working results of the Egyptian State Railways
                            with others in India and South America, are instructive to those who can
                            understand the conclusions and the inferences to be drawn from them. The
                            separation of the Port of Alexandria from the Railways is a matter which
                            may well be for the advantage of both, in leaving each administration to
                            deal with the work for which it is best fitted. Working arrangements
                            need in no way be disturbed, while decentralisation will more readily
                            disclose the responsibility for defects in these. The impression clearly
                            left upon our minds is that both the quay accommodation of the port and
                            the wagon stock of the railways have been insufficient in the past. The
                            railways are to be supplied with some wagons, we trust the port may be
                            so with more quays. In the meantime the discontinuance of stacking coal
                            thereon, the provision of lighters and cranes, etc,, may afford
                            considerate relief. </p>
                        <p>We have left to the last our remarks upon the explanations offered by the
                            Chairman of the Railways Administration. They are brief, pointed, and
                            dignified. The conclusion we base upon them is that this high official
                            does not object to the report in toto, or even in great measure, but
                            considers that reasons, good in themselves, sufficiently explain certain
                            defects noticed. On such a matter we cannot offer any opinion, neither
                            are we acquainted with the system usually adopted in dealing with such
                            inspections, but if there is a weak point in the report, which appears
                            so admirable iu its preparation, it is that room should have been left
                            for any explanations at all, so far as the public are concerned. Their
                            publication, under the circumstances, is held by the Government to be
                            right and proper. It is so by us also.</p>

                        There are 10,000 Japanese along the Niu-Chwang-Kao-Pan-Tse line, which it is
                        expected the Japanese will seize on the ground that it has long since ceased
                        to be neutral. This raid, in conjunction with the advance of the Japanese
                        left, is considered to indicate that Oyama’s armies are enveloping the
                        Russian Hanks while holding the centre. (Reuter.) </p>

                        Four Japanese divisions can be seen 11 miles westward of Mukden, in

                        terrific bombardment by 100 of the biggest guns is concentrated against
                        Putiloff and Novgorod Hills on the Russian centre. The Japanese have made
                        great gains on the Russian left by night advances. Rumours are current that
                        Mukden has been evacuated. (Reuter.) </p>
                    <p>St. Petersburg, March 3. According to telegrams received here, the Japanese
                        furiously assailed the Russian centre. They advanced twice to storm Putiloff
                        hill, but twice were driven back with heavy losses. General Kuropatkin
                        reports that he is holding the Japanese at bay and recapturing some
                        positions from which the Russians had been driven. He asserts having
                        inflicted enormous losses on the Japanese at several points. (R.) </p>

                    <p>TSAR’S CHANGE OF FRONT </p>
                    <p>St. Petersburg, March 3 Another meeting of the workmen’s electors took place
                        yesterday. It was decided that, unless their demands are conceded to-day, a
                        general strike is to proclaimed. There is general apprehension here, and at
                        Warsaw and Moscow, that disorders on a large scale will take place on
                        Saturday, which is the anniversary of the liberation of the serfs. (Reuter.) </p>
                    <p>St. Petersburg, March 3. A manifesto of the Tsar exhorts the people to defend
                        the Throne against foreign enemies. Another rescript appoints the Minister
                        of the Interior to preside at the conference which is to draw up the scheme
                        of legislative elections. (Havas.) </p>
                    <p>St. Petersburg, March 3. The group of Ministers who were engaged in drafting
                        a Constitution have fallen into disfavour, and the reactionaries have
                        regained the ear of the Tsar, who has issued a manifesto reaffirming the
                        autocracy and appealing to the whole nation to unite against internal
                        enemies, and their obstinate foreign foe. (R.) </p>
                    <p>Warsaw, March 3. The strike affects every trade here. The strikers are
                        assuming a threatening demeanour and are using revolvers and bombs. Unless
                        the Government can force the gasmen to resume work, the city will be in
                        darkness on Sunday. The Tsar’s manifesto has produced a bad effect. The
                        authorities are hastily concentrating troops at Warsaw and Lodz. (Reuter.) </p>

                        the 17th inst. owing to the demands of their numerous clientèle. Mr. Fritz

                        take orders for next season, and has a number of designs with him. Clients

                        be kept open all the year round. If the scheme is realised, it will no doubt
                        prove a great boon to both visitors and residents, for at present there is
                        ample room for another up-to-date hotel-in Alexandria, and under the
                        personal management of Mr. Aquilina its success will be assured. </p>
                    <p>Egypt and the Russian Fleet. — A correspondent of the “Pall Mall Gazette,”
                        after reviewing the arguments contained in Mr. Mcllwraith’s recent letter to
                        the “Times,” remarks, “In offering an explanation for the facilities offered
                        to the Baltic Fleet, the Judicial Adviser has rather done the opposite of
                        what he intended, and his argument leads one to infer that there was a
                        slight error of judgment in the 1898 incident, and that the letter to the
                        ‘Times’ was a very ingenious attempt at throwing the onus of it on to Sir
                        Julian Pauncefote’s reservation to the Suez Canal Convention.” </p>
                    <p>Merchant Seamen’s Home. — The usual weekly concert was held in the Seamen’s
                        Home last night, when there was a good audience and a very interesting
                        programme was presented. The artistes were Messrs. Tulloch, Allit, and
                        Fordan, and the Messrs. Tookey, from Bulkeley, who generously gave their
                        services for the evening. The Messrs. Tookey set themselves especially to
                        entertain the audience, and from the vociferous applause their various songs
                        provoked it was evident that they were highly successful. Frequent encores
                        were enthusiastically demanded, and they were as heartily conceded. A place
                        was found for the gramophone on the programme, and for a real good hearty
                        concert last night’s entertainment would be hard to beat. The Rev. H. P.
                        Reid presided and Mr. Wm, Wood acted as accompanist. </p>

                    <p>STATE RAILWAYS. </p>
                    <p>We are authorised to state that the Egyptian Government has no intention of
                        bringing out a new general manager for the State Railways from England or
                        elsewhere. Major L’Es-trange Johnstone will retain his functions as head of
                        the railways. </p>

                        Company, Ltd. </p>

                        page 4 of to-day’s issue. An examination of the prospectus shows that the
                        company is to be constituted on a sound basis, and there is every prospect
                        that it will attract investors both at home and in this country. The board
                        of directors and the advisory board are very strong in men connected with
                        large and successful enterprises in Egypt. </p>
                    <p>P. &amp; O. COMPANY. </p>

                        Marseilles regularly leave Port Said at 5 p.m. every Monday after the
                        arrival of the 11 o'clock morning train from Cairo, and a steam tender
                        awaits the train to convey passengers on board. 25518-12-2 </p>

                    <p>The Cunard S.S. “Cypria” arrived on Thursday at Liverpool. She experienced

                    <p>The S.S. “Carib Prince” left Manchester on the 2nd inst. with passengers and

                    <p>DEPARTURE OF ARTILLERY. </p>
                    <p>The hired transport “Dilwara” arrived at Alexandria from Southampton and
                        Malta this morning with details for the Army of Occupation, including four
                        companies of the 1st Battalion King’s Royal Rifle Corps and headquarters.
                        The troops were disembarked at once, and left for Cairo by special train
                        from Gabbari at 11 o’clock. They will arrive in Cairo about 5.40 p.m. and
                        will proceed to Abbassieh. </p>
                    <p>The 56th Battery Royal Field Artillery left Cairo at 9.15 a.m. to day and
                        arrived at Gab bari at half-past one. Their embarkation on the transport for
                        conveyance home was proceeding as we went to press. </p>
                    <p>The company of the Royal Malta Artillery which has been stationed at Fort Kom
                        el-Dik for the last 5 years, also embarked on the “Dilwara” for passage to
                        Malta. </p>
                    <p>The “Dilwara” sails for Malta this evening. </p>
                    <p>The following Special General Order was issued yesterday :— </p>
                    <p>The G.O.C. does not wish the 5th Company Royal Malta Artillery to leave his
                        Command without expressing his satisfaction at the creditable manner in
                        which their duties have been carried out during their tour of service in
                        Egypt. </p>
                    <p>Their conduct has been excellent ; their professional work has been extremely
                        well done; whilst the general efficiency and skill-at-arms reflect great
                        credit on Major Balbi and all ranks in the Company. </p>
                    <p>In bidding them farewell the G.O.C. wishes them every success and a hearty
                        welcome on their return home. </p>
                    <p>SEASONABLE CANARDS. </p>
                    <p>Nothing whatever is known at the British and German Agencies of the rumoured
                        visits of H.M. the King or H.I.M. the German Emperor to Egypt in the near
                        future. Rumours have been more circumstantial this year than usual, but we
                        have noticed that “canards” of the kind generally fly about at this time of
                        the year. </p>
                    <p>THE PILGRIMAGE. </p>
                    <p>The Khédivial Co.’s S.S. “Minieh,” the first ship to bring back the returning
                        pilgrims, left Jeddah yesterday for Tor and Constantinople. </p>
                    <p>Owing to the cool weather, and the good state of public health prevailing at
                        the Holy Places, the pilgrims are delaying their return home. </p>
                    <p>COAST GUARD SEIZURE. </p>
                    <p>The following contraband was seized on board the Italian S.S. “Armonia”
                        yesterday afternoon by the Coast Guards :—2 revolvers, 2 breech loading
                        rifles, 281 revolver cartridges, 50 rifle cartridges, 290 cartridges
                        (various kinds), 20 rockets, 1,159 Havana cigars, and 19 kilos tobacco. </p>
                    <p>A. L. M. &amp; D. S. </p>
                    <p>The concert given at the New Khedivial Hotel on Wednesday evening was a great
                        artistic success, and was thoroughly enjoyed by the large number of members
                        present. The programme was extremely well chosen, if too classical for the
                        majority of those present, containing as it did such names as Mme Briend,
                        Mme Haddad, Dr. Keller, and Mr. Afendoulis. Mme Briend, who is the wife of
                        the Inspector-General of the Quarantine Board, contributed three numbers,
                        Air de Chimène, from Massenet’s Le Cid,“L’Attente” (Saint Saëns), and “Si
                        mes vers avaient des ailes” (Reynald Halhn), besides singing the duet “Près
                        aux Clercs” with Dr. Keller. In each Mme Briend was magnificent, and
                        enthralled her hearers by her exquisite singing. Mme. Haddad, whose mastery
                        over the pianoforte is well-known, gave an Impromptu by Rubinstein and “Le
                        Rossignol” by Liszt in the first part, and Liszt’s “Rhapsodie Hongroise No.
                        12” in the second part. All three pieces were given with that perfect
                        execution which distinguishes Mme. Haddad’s playing, and called forth the
                        sincere appreciation of the audience. Mr. Afendoulis, the famous Greek
                        violinist, who took the first prize at the Brussels Conservatoire a few
                        years ago, has not been heard of late and was warmly welcomed,
                        Notwithstanding his being severely handicapped by having lost his usual
                        accompanist, Mme Foscolo, through influenza, he delighted and astonished
                        everyone by his performance of Tirindelli’s Airs Hongrois and in the second
                        part received a hearty encore for his two pieces by Simonetti and Scambati.
                        Dr. Keller, besides singing in the very beautiful duet by Auber with Mme
                        Briend, sang two solos, and his fine voice was shown to great advantage in
                        Mario Costa’s Serenata. The Choral Union, who had only received their part
                        music from London a fortnight before the concert, sang a glee, a madrigal,
                        and two part songs. They appeared a little nervous in the first number, but
                        gradually gained greater confidence and did best in Schumann’s “Gipsy Life.”
                        We hope to hear more from this youngest branch of the A.L.M. &amp; D.S. and
                        that next time they will be able to get their music by heart, which adds
                        immensely to the decision and ensemble of choral singing. Great credit is
                        due to their conductor, Mr. Sarjeant, whose energy and enthusiasm would fire
                        any chorus to excel itself. The accompanist, Mrs. Crafton, deserves sincere
                        thanks for her excellent playing and indefatigable pains in working with the
                        Choral Union.</p>

                    <head>ABRIDGED PROSPECTUS. </head>
                    <p>This Company is formed for the purposes set out in its Memorandum of
                        Association, and in particular to conduct business in Egypt and the Soudan,
                        as opportunity affords, and more particularly :-</p>
                    <p>To purchase, lease, hire and secure concessions of land either in town or
                        country.</p>
                    <p>To reclaim, improve, cultivate, develop, lease, or otherwise deal with
                        Properties when acquired.</p>
                    <p>To develop building land by the erection of houses or otherwise. </p>
                    <p>To advance money on mortgage or otherwise, to acquire mortgage or other
                        securities either individually or jointly with others. </p>
                    <p>To instal irrigation works, supplying the necessary plant for the purpose ;
                        to construct canals, drains, roads and tramways, and to carry on industries
                        connected with Agricultural enterprises. </p>
                    <p>To carry on any business which may be profitably or conveniently worked in
                        connection with any of the foregoing enterprises. </p>
                    <p>Egypt presents a large field for profitable employment of money in lending on
                        safe mortgage. The gross value of land in Egypt is put by experts at
                        £300,000,000, an average value of £50 per feddan on 6,000,000 feddans. </p>
                    <p>The advance in prosperity of the country owing to British Administration, the
                        Anglo-French Agreement, and the recent proposed official introduction of the
                        English language into the Mixed Tribunals is well known. The value of land
                        in Egypt for agricultural and building purposes is shewn by innumerable
                        sales and re-sales at constantly enhanced prices, and by the market
                        quotation of Land Companies operating in Egypt, and it is believed that
                        opportunities will occur of securing land which should greatly increase in
                        value within a short space of time. </p>
                    <p>Owing to the increase in the population of the larger towns of Egypt, there
                        is a very healthy and steady demand for well-built houses, and in the
                        purchase, development and re-sale of estates for residential and other
                        purpose, ample scope for remunerative business is afforded ; it is
                        considered that from this source the Company should derive a fair income. </p>
                    <p>The opening of Government lands in the Soudan should not only afford
                        favourable opportunity for investing large Capital amounts on mortage for
                        many years to come, but also offer favourable opportunities for purchase and
                        development. The conversion of basin land to canalised summer cultivation in
                        Middle Egypt, the regular reclamation and improvement of salt land in Lower
                        Egypt offer additional occasion for profitable business. </p>
                    <p>The Climate of Egypt is such, and the richness of the soil is so great, that
                        crops can be grown continuously, the land not requiring to lie fallow. The
                        land in Lower Egypt grows a winter crop of beans, wheat, barley, clover,
                        &amp;c., and again a summer crop of,cotton rice or maize, besides minor
                        crops of numerous kinds of vegetables. The chief products are cotton, wheat,
                        maize, barley, rice, beans, lentils, peas, rape, lettuce, mustard, saffron,
                        capsicum, aniseed, sugar cane, figs, dates, oranges, lemons, melons,
                        mandarins, limes, &amp;c., &amp;c. </p>
                    <p>The Articles of Association provide as follows :— </p>
                    <p>As remuneration for his services as a Director, the Chairman shall receive
                        rémunération at the rate of £250 per annum, and the other Directors shall
                        each receive remuneration at the rate ot £200 per annum. In addition to the
                        said fixed rémunération there shall be divided between the Directors in such
                        manner as they may determine a sum equal to 10 per cent, on the profits
                        certified by the Auditors of the Company to have been made in each year in
                        excess of a sum sufficient to provide a dividend of 7 per cent, upon the
                        amount paid up or credited as paid up on the Ordinary Shares for the time
                        being, having regard to the provisions as to thé division of profits herein
                        before contained, but without making any provision for a Reserve Fund. The
                        Directors for the time being may from time to time appoint one or more of
                        their body to be the Managing Director or Managing Directors of the Company,
                        either for a fixed term or without any limitation as to the period for which
                        he or they is or are to hold such office, and may from time to time remove
                        or dismiss him or them from office and appoint anohter or others in his or
                        their place or places. The remuneration of a Managing Director or a Director
                        or Director acting as managers shall from time to time be fixed by the
                        Directors, and may be by way of salary or commission or participation in
                        profits, or by any or/and all of these modes. If any Director, being
                        willing, shall be called upon to perform extra service, or to make any
                        special exertions in going or residing abroad, or otherwise, for any of the
                        purposes of the Company, or act as Trustee for the Company or its Debenture
                        Holders, and shall do so, the Company may remunerate such Director, either
                        by a fixed sum or by a percentage of profits, or otherwise, as may be
                        determined by the Directors, and such remuneration may be either in addition
                        to or in substitution for his remuneration above provided. </p>
                    <p>Applications for Shares should be made on the accompanying form and forwarded
                        with cheque for the amount payable on application to the Company’s Bankers.
                        If no allotment is made, the Application money will be returned in full, and
                        where the number of Shares allotted is less than that applied for the
                        surplus will be credited in reduction of the amount payable on allotment,
                        and any excess will be returned to the Applicant. </p>
                    <p>Failure to pay any instalment when due will render the previous payments
                        liable to be forfeited. </p>
                    <p>A copy of the Memorandum of Association, with names, addresses and
                        descriptions of the Signatories thereof and the number of Shares subscribed
                        for by them respectively will be found in the fold of the Prospectus, of
                        which it forms part. </p>
                    <p>The minimum subscription upon which the Directors may proceed to Allotment
                        has been fixed by the Articles of Association at £100,000. </p>
                    <p>The estimated preliminary expenses of the Company, including registration
                        fees and advertising and issuing this Prospectus in this country and in
                        Egypt, and all other expenses, except brokerage on application for shares,
                        and Stamps on Share Warrants, amounts to six thousand pounds; and in
                        relation thereto a Contract dated the 22nd day of Feburary, 1905 has been
                        made between George Hamilton Craig, of the one part, and Sydney William

                    <head>EGYPT AND SUDAN MINING CAPITAL INCREASE </head>
                    <p>The report for the year to September 30 states that there is a not profit of
                        £84,460. The direc-tors recommend a dividend of 5s. per share in cash, or
                        £13,125, and a distribution of 39,375 fully-paid shares of the Sudan Gold
                        Field ( Li-mited). The shares will be distributed in the proportion of three
                        Sudan shares for every four Syndicate shares. Proposals have recently been
                        submitted to the directors in regard to two properties in the Sudan, in
                        connection with which, after very careful consideration, they have entered
                        into provisional arrangements whereby this Syndicate will, in the event of
                        the preliminary inspection proving satisfactory, acquire further options for
                        dealing with the areas. The directors recommend that the capital be
                        increased from £52,500 to £80,000 by creation of 27,500 shares of £1 each,
                        to be offered, in the first instance, to the shareholders at the price of £1
                        10s. The issued would be in the proportion of one new share for every two
                        shares now held, leaving a balance of 1,250 shares for which applications
                        would be entertained independently of the proportionate allotments. </p>

                    <p>THE SINDH EXPERIMENTS. </p>
                    <p>“Indian Engineering” remarks : Every reported improvement in Indian cotton
                        produce, if correct, means a step in the right direction, and from this
                        limited standpoint the reported improvement, by which a profit of Rs. 200
                        per acre is declared to be possible from produce costing Rs. 50 per acre and
                        saleable at Rs. 250, takes its place as part ot the fulfilment of a great
                        hope. But what the country demands, in the place of these spasmo-dic, if
                        valuable enough, efforts, is information whether this improvement from
                        imported Egyptian seed is methodical or partly accidental, the result only
                        of the new seed or of that and con-tributary experiments in soil; and if the
                        latter, what these exactly were, and why they were restricted to Sindh, when
                        soil like that of Sindh abounds in fifty other localities in India. The time
                        has come when the need of some gigantic development of Indian exports has
                        become indispensable to the placing of Indian finance on a sound basis ; and
                        at a time when the great problem of economic develop -ment, by an
                        intelligent control of commerce, has been subordinated to some small
                        official game of readjusting the bundles of existing departments, and
                        increasing mere official appointments at great cost, it is quite seasonable
                        to insist that larger views should find expression in departmental action,
                        and show some result for the money being spent. No one will grudge the
                        expenditure, if large, results follow. </p>

                        us to remove the erroneous impression that might be conveyed by the
                        statement contained therein to the effect that “visitors need no longer wai
                        t for steamers arriving at Port Said from the Far East at irregular
                        intervals to take them home. Messrs. Haselden add that the P. &amp; Co.’s
                        main line steamers to Marseilles leave Port Said regularly at 5 p.m. every
                        Monday after the arrival of the 11 o’clock morning train from Cairo, and a
                        steam tender awaits the train to convey the passengers on board. We may
                        state, however, that in making the statement we did we only referred to the
                        steamers of the North German Lloyd Company, which, in cousequence of the
                        long voyages which they make from Eastern Asia and Australia, arrive at Port
                        Said at irregular intervals. It is patrons of this company’s vessels who

                    <p>Never make rash promises ! Last week I ended my notes by saying that I would
                        return to the subject on which I was writing, this week. But in the meantime
                        a friend has lent me his “Commonplace Book” and I have found so much in it
                        of anything but a commonplace nature, that I want while I have the
                        opportunity to cull a few of these gems of thought, and place them before
                        readers of the "Gazette." </p>
                    <p>But a promise is a promise, and should always be kept, unless really urgent

                        forgotten, while I am afraid still more are made without the slightest
                        intention on the part of the persons making them of keeping them, and cause
                        much of the bitterness of life that we all more or less experience. </p>
                    <p>Few, too, stop to consider the disappointment felt by children when
                        promises—made to them, perhaps, to dry their tears, perhaps to console them
                        for the non-fulfilment of previous promises, or for many other reasons—are
                        not kept. Poor little things they often have to become initiated in the ways
                        of the world at a very early age and practical lessons such as these are not
                        lost upon them, but in their turn bear fruit. </p>
                    <p>So the world wags on.—And so I go wandering on, as I pen the thoughts that
                        come to me under the mosquito net. But now revenons à nos moutons. </p>
                    <p> Last week I quoted a, passage from Sir Howard Vincent’s address on the Suez
                        Canal, —a passage in which he very happily hit off England’s true
                        relationship to Egypt. There are other passages in this most admirable and
                        lucid sketch of the history of the Canal, that I should be only too glad to
                        think were fully borne out by facts. Optimistic as I am myself as to the
                        present condition and future prospects of this country, I know enough to
                        make me hesitate to commit myself to all the statements made by Sir Howard. </p>
                    <p>“How nobly it (i.e. British influence) has been exercised for the good of the
                        Egyptian people, under the auspices of Lord Cromer and his assistants, only
                        those can appreciate who knew the Egypt of 30, 25, and 20 years ago, and
                        know the Egypt of to-day.” Probably it would be difficult to find the man
                        who would call in question the truth of this statement. </p>
                    <p>“Life and property are absolutely safe from one end of the country to the
                        other.” This I think would be a bold statement to make, even as regards
                        England itself, but substitute “comparatively” for “absolutely,” and few
                        would dispute the correctness of the assertion. One of the contrasts between
                        England and Egypt that struck me most forcibly on my arrival in this
                        country, was that while in London the windows of jewellers’ shops are
                        generally after dark —and sometimes by daylight—protected by iron railings,
                        in the most brilliantly lit streets, here in Cairo and Alexandria they
                        remain quite unguarded, even in such a dimly lit thoroughfare as the Sharia
                        Kasr el Nil is (or was two years ago). I used to reflect that it was quite
                        as well that the fact was not known to the London thieves, who, were they
                        aware of it, might perhaps be tempted to take advantage of such
                        opportunities for the exercise of their predatory operations. </p>
                    <p>“ There is equal justice for all.” ‘ No hardships and no tyranny.” Why, if
                        these statements are true Egypt must be a sort of pars, dise,— a real
                        Utopia! Surely Lord Cromer’s work here is done, and he is more wanted in
                        England than in Egypt ! But I fancy that his lordship would shake his head,
                        and opine that the gallant Colonel was just a leetle out in his
                        calculations, and should have come a little further than the Canal to
                        ascertain the truth on these points. No ! This ideal has yet to be realised. </p>
                    <p> “The resources, of science have converted desert wastes into fertile
                        plains.” The only fault I find in this sentence is that it wants
                        supplementing by another to the effect that, far from this work being
                        finished, much has to be done before the full benefits of even the already
                        partially completed works can be enjoyed. </p>
                    <p>There are one or two other statements that might be challenged and which to
                        say the least are premature, but no exception can be taken to Sir Howard’s
                        concluding words on the results of the British occupation of Egypt, and they
                        emphasise a fact that is too often lost sight of, and too little brought
                        prominently forward, by those who are best qualified to testify to its
                        absolute truth. </p>
                    <p>“As the Englishman passes up the great waterway of the Nile, or over the
                        crowded </p>

                        multitude of animals tethered on the luxuriant pastures, he may well feel
                        pride in the work, civil and military of his countrymen, and rejoice that in
                        H.H. Khedive Abbas II. they have an illustrious fellow-worker, whose delight
                        it is to convert poor lands into rich, and by agricultural virtues to repair
                        the once shattered fortunes of his House.” </p>
                    <p>All this I steadfastly believe. Bat may I ask the gallant Colonel one
                        question ? What, are “agricultural virtues” ? Agricultural pursuits I could
                        understand, but virtues! Well, well, we ail make slips and occasionally get
                        our tongues into tangles, and one need not be hypercritical on so admirably
                        expressed (this slight blemish excepted) a description of the picture
                        presented by the Egypt of to-day. </p>
                    <p>To understand a little as to the work that remains to be done in Egypt the
                        reader has only to refer to the paper on “The Nile Fens,” by D. G. Hogarth,
                        the first part of which appeared in the “Gazette” yesterday. This is a
                        delicious bit of writing too, and should But be missed by readers with an
                        imaginative turn of mind. </p>
                    <p>I have not much space left for referring to the Commonplace Book, on the
                        contents of which I should never tire to dwell. For it is veritable
                        thought-provoker, and also a good index to the mind ot the compiler. In this
                        respect it is incomparably superior to a diary, the entries in which must be
                        greatly determined by physical conditions. </p>
                    <p>But here you see at once the food that the mind-the real man-enjoys, and
                        although the most opposite opinions on important questions find places, the
                        key to the whole is not only the subject selectedm but the appreciation of
                        the way in which it is presented by the author.</p>
                    <p>Here is a charming hit of Tennyson :— Thou canst not prove that thou art body
                        [alone, </p>
                    <p>Nor canst thou prove that thou art spirit alone, Nor canst thou prove that
                        thou art both in [one: </p>
                    <p>Thou canst not prove thou art immortal, no, Nor yet that thou art mortal—nay
                        my son, Thou canst not prove that I, who speak with [thee, </p>
                    <p>Am not thyself in converse with thyself, For nothing worthy proving can be
                        proven Nor yet disproven : wherefore thou be wise, Cleave ever to the
                        sunnier side of doubt, And cling to Faith beyond the forms of Faith !”</p>
                    <p>I thought of underlining some of the above, but if I once commenced, it seems
                        to me that I should have to underline it all. I commend the whole quotation
                        to the consideration of the good people whose minds have lately been
                        somewhat exercised over various matters that I have dealt with in this
                        column. T. A. </p>

                        Ismaïlia. </p>
                    <p>Le major Ross avait trouvé que le pétrole était le seul remède à employer
                        pour débarrasser la ville de ces parasites. Le remède préconisé par ce
                        spécialiste a été d’autant plus efficace que dans la ville d’ismaïlia les

                    <p>La Compagnie du Canal, soucieuse de la santé publique, pour détruire les

                        British Museum, Mr. W. E. Crum has undertaken to prepare a dictionary of
                        that language, upon a scale considerably larger than any hitherto realized.
                        In the seventy years which have passed since the appearance of Amedeo
                        Pey-ron’s ‘Lexicon,’ the material, both published and available in MS., has
                        very greatly increased, as has, to a still higher degree, our knowledge of
                        the foregoing periods of the Egyptian language. It should therefore be
                        possible today to till a want of which all Egyptian philologists are
                        conscious, in a manner more adequate to their requirements than was
                        attainable in Peyron’s time. There is reason to hope that the Clarendon
                        Press may undertake the publication of the work. </p>

                    <p>CONSECRATION OF A NEW LODGE. </p>
                    <p>A Masonic correspondent writes : — As previously notified in your columns,
                        the Masonic event of the week was to be the consecration of the “Rising Sun”
                        Lodge of Cairo, No. 91, working in English, under the National Grand Lodge
                        of Egypt. This important and imposing ceremony was carried out on Monday
                        evening, last in the splendid temple of the Grand Lodge in Sharia Boulac.
                        His Excellency the Grand Master of Egypt Idris Beÿ Ragheb deputed Wor. Bro.
                        Fred. A. Beale, P.M., P.G. Arch., 30°, &amp;c., to perform the necessary
                        ceremony, which was carried out with due solemnity. W. Bro. R.R. Smithard,
                        P.M.,P.G.D„ &amp;c,, as Grand Director of Ceremonies, duly formed a
                        procession of the members present iu the ante-room and they were marched
                        into the temple, where the consecrating officer was received in due form. W.
                        Bros. T. M. Chinn and W. R. Johnson acted as S. W. and J. W. respectively,
                        whilst W. Bro. P. Plunkett, Gd. S.D., acted as Secretary, with W. Bro.
                        McIntosh as I. G. </p>
                    <p>The lodge was duly opened in the three degrees when the D. of C. formed the
                        petitioners up in their proper places whilst the order authorising the
                        consecration was read, the brethren standing to order. The petition was read
                        and the petitioners assented to the officers named therein as being the
                        first officers of the new lodge. </p>
                    <p>The ceremony of consecration was next proceeded with, and was carried out in
                        a most satisfactory manner. The vessels containing the corn, wine, oil,
                        salt, and the censor, were very kindly lent by W. Bro. A. Hanauer, those of
                        the Grand Lodge being in use in the provinces, where a new lodge in Arabic
                        was being consecrated. </p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the ceremony, at which the following brethren assisted,

                        Foster-Smith, Plunkett, and King, the Worshipful Master designate, the
                        installation was proceeded with. </p>
                    <p>Wor. Bro. W. J. King was presented by W. Bro. R. R. Smithard, the D. of C.,
                        for the benefit of Installation, which had been ordered to be carried out by
                        W. Bro. Beale, P.M., etc. </p>
                    <p>The W. M. designate, having assented to the antient charges and regulations

                        the already long roll of those working under the banner of the National
                        Grand Lodge of Egypt. </p>
                    <p>The newly-installed W. M. appointed his officers as follows, and duly
                        invested them, they being conducted to their respective positions and
                        saluted: W. Bro. Fred. A. Beale, I. P. M. and I. G. ; Bro. A. T. Roche, S.

                        Forces, was appointed chaplain, but owing to a previous engagement was not
                        able to attend to be invested. This will be carried out at the next meeting. </p>
                    <p> The newly-installed W. M. was duly proclaimed as such, and the usual
                        addresses were delivered, on the conclusion of which he said his first and
                        most pleasant duty was to tender his personal thanks to the consecrating and
                        installing officer, and expressed the great pride he felt in having been
                        chosen to occupy the first chair of the “Rising Sun” Lodge. The next duty
                        which he felt proud to perform, was that of proposing the names of his
                        Excellency the Grand Master, Idris Bey Ragheb, and his Excellency Rt. Wor.
                        Bro. Michel Bey Saleh, Grand Secretary, as honorary life members, which was
                        carried with acclamation. </p>
                    <p>Good wishes were received on behalf of the M.W. the Grand Master, who was
                        unable to attend on account of not yet being out of the doctor’s hands, from

                        Paschel, Albu Caly, Delbourgo, etc., etc. The following additional names

                    <p>The ceremony being concluded the lodge was duly closed and the brethren

                    <p>It may be of interest to your readers to know that the spread of Freemasonry
                        has been so great, and is so steadily increasing, that i t is in
                        contemplation to found other- English-speaking lodges, both in Lower and
                        Upper Egypt. We may mention Tantah and Assiout as the first two that will
                        receive attention </p>
                    <p>We are glad to see that the old-time ideas of an interchange of visits
                        amongst the members of the fraternity to their lodges, no matter in what
                        language they may be working or what their nationality, are gradually
                        increasing, and we find that visits are frequently exchanged amongst English
                        speaking Masonic and other Lodges under the G. L, of Egypt, no matter what
                        the nationality of the members. We know that Freemasonry is universal,
                        irrespective of nation ality, colour or position in the world, and it is
                        satisfactory to learn that the spread of Masonry is to a great extent
                        answerable for the strengthening of those ties which are inseparable from
                        the well-being of the oldest end most world-renowned - association whoso

                    <head>CAUGHT BY THE GRIP. RELEASED BY PE-RU-NA. </head>
                    <p>"The world of medicine recognize Grip as epidemic catarrh."- Medical
                        Talk.</p>
                    <p>LA GRIPPE Is epidemic catarrh. It spares no class or nationally. The cultured
                        and the ignorant, the aristocrat and the pauper, the masses and the classes
                        are alike subject to la grippe. None are exempt—all are liable. </p>
                    <p> Have you the grip? Or, rather, has the grip got you? Grip is well named. The
                        original French term, la grippe, has been shortened by the busy American to
                        read “grip.” Without intending to do so a new word has been coined that
                        exactly describes the case. As if some hideous giant with awful Grip had
                        clutched us In its fatal clasp. Men, women, children, whole towns and cities
                        are caught in the baneful grip of a terrible monster. </p>
                    <p>The following letters speak for them- selves as to the efficacy of Poruna in
                        cases of la grippe or Its after effects. </p>
                    <p>After Effects of La Grippe Eradicated by Pe-ru-na. </p>
                    <p>Mrs. Fred Weinberger, Westerlo, Albany County, N. Y., writes : </p>
                    <p> “Several years ago I had an attack of la grippe whiçh left my nerves in a
                        prostrated condition. Then I had another attack of la grippe which left, me
                        worse. I had tried three good physicians but all in vain. I gave Peruna a
                        trial. In a short time I was feeling better and now I am as well as
                        anyone.”—Mrs. Fred Weinberger. </p>

                        most esteemed men of Omaha, 1 Neb. He has done much to make it </p>
                    <p>what it is, serving on public boards a number of times. He endorses Peruna in
                        the following words: </p>
                    <p>“I am 68 years old, am hale and hearty, and Peruna has helped me attain it.
                        Two years ago I had la grippe—my life was despaired of, Peruna saved me."-

                        has the honor of being third cousin to Abraham Lincoln. He writes: </p>
                    <p>"I had la grippe five times before using your medicine. Four years ago I
                        began the use of Peruna, since which time I have not been troubled with that
                        disease. I can now do as much work at my desk as I ever could in my life, I
                        have gained more than ten pounds in weight.”—S. S. Lincoln. </p>
                    <p>Pe-ru-na Not Only Cured La Grippe but Benefited the Whole System. </p>
                    <p>Miss Alice M. Dressier, I3I3 N. Bryant Ave., Minneapolis, Minn„ writes: </p>
                    <p>“Last spring I suffered from la grippe and was partially cured but the bad
                        after effects remained through the summer and somehow I did not get strong
                        as I was before. One of my college friends who was visiting me asked me to
                        try Peruna and I did so and found it all and more than I had expected. It
                        not only cured me of the catarrh but restored me to perfect health, built up
                        the entire system and brought a happy feeling of buoyancy which I had not
                        known for years.”—Alice M. Dressler. </p>

                        the Aubrey Stock Co. She writes the following : </p>
                    <p>“During the past winter of 1901, I suffered for several weeks from a severe
                        attack of grippe, which left a serious catarrhal condition of the throat and
                        head. </p>
                    <p>“Some one suggested Peruna. As a last resort, after wasting much time and
                        money on physicians, I tried the remedy faithfully, and In a few weeks was
                        as well as ever.”—Jean Cowgill. </p>
                    <p>A Southern Judge Cured. </p>
                    <p>Judge Horatio J. Goss, Hartwell, Ga„ writes : </p>
                    <p>“Some five or six years ago I had a very severe spell of grippe, which left
                        me with systemic catarrh. A friend advised me to try your Peruna, which I
                        did, and was immediately benefited and cured. The third bottle completed the
                        cure.”—H. J. Goss. </p>

                        1903. new discoveries include a representation in has relief of the wars of
                        Amenophis II. against the Retennu or Syrians. This shows for the first time
                        the group of the chariot-borne Pharaoh smiting his enemies, which was later
                        made into a conventional type by Amenophis IIIn Seta I., and Rameses II.
                        There are also a geographical list of the same king’s victories a
                        well-preserved and beautiful group in blank granite of Thothmes IV. and
                        Queen Tia ; and a series of bas-reliefs from Amenophis IV.'s Temple of

                    <head>CHRONIQUE FINANCIERE </head>
                    <p>(Vendredi, après-midi) </p>
                    <p>Les hauts prix atteints dernièrement ont donné lien à de fortes réalisations
                        de la part des capitalistes et des marchés européens qui étaient abondamment
                        pourvus de titres égyptiens. Il en est résulté ici un tassement. Les petits
                        spéculateurs surtout ont vu leurs posi tions surchargées, à tel point qu’une
                        réaction était inévitable. Elle s’est produite cette semaine, mais elle a
                        été. de peu d’importance.On a parlé à ce propos d’une tension monétaire qui
                        sévirait sur notre place ; mais c’est là un bruit dénué de tout fondement.
                        C’est plutôt le contraire qui est vrai. </p>
                    <p>Les valeurs les plus en vogue cette semaine ont été la Banque Nationale,
                        l’Agricole, la Daïra, l’Egyptian Investment et la Salt &amp; Soda. </p>
                    <p>Bien que le dividende soit au-dessous de ce qu'on espérait cette année,
                        l’avenir de la Banque se présente sous les meilleurs auspices et justifie
                        pleinement la hausse des cours. On débute à 27 1/2, fléchit à 27 1/16 et
                        reprend en clôture à 27 1/4. </p>
                    <p>Très ferme d’abord, la Daïra fléchit peu à peu sous la pression des
                        réalisations et d’une vague rumeur suivant laquelle des princes de la
                        famille khédiviale auraient l’intention d’attaquer la société pour vente de
                        biens wakfs. Il va sans dire qu’il s’agit là d’une vague rumeur qui mérite
                        confirmation et que le fait, fût-il exact, n aurait pas de conséquences
                        graves pour la société, puisque celle-ci ne manquerait pas en ce cas d’en
                        tenir responsable le gouvernement qui lui a accordé la concession des
                        susdits terrains. S’il fallait en cruire les racontars, la Daïra liquiderait
                        à 30 livres, mais nous croyons être plus proches de la vérité en fixant ce
                        chiffre entre 28 et 29 livres. Le cours a débuté à 26, fléchi à 25 3/8 et
                        repris eu clôture à 25 1/2. </p>
                    <p>L’Agricole reste toujours en faveur auprès du public, bien que la dividende
                        de 6 shellings ait un peu déçu les capitalistes. Eu effet, l’augmentation
                        croissante des affaires ,de cette société laisse entrevoir un dividende
                        toujours plus élevé. La valeur debute à 11 1/2 pour clôturer à 11 1/4 ex
                        coupon. Les parts de fondateur ont été pratiquées entré £ 730 et 745 mais en
                        nombre excessivement restreint. </p>
                    <p>L’Egyptian Investment débute à 2 1/4, fié chit à 2 1/8, remonte ensuite à 2
                        11/32 et clôture enfin à 2 1/4, prix d’ouverture. Il parait que 1a société a
                        en vue plusieurs affaires auxquelles le marché réserverait un bon accueil.
                        On parle même da lancement d’une banque de report au capital de £ 1.000.000.
                        Le chiffre des transactions est énorme : plusieurs milliers de titres par
                        jour. Les actions n’étant pas encore sorties, les spéculateurs en profitent
                        pour travailler sur de gros paquets et vendre et acheter aussitôt qu’une
                        fluctuation favorable se produit. </p>
                    <p>On fait circuler la rumeur d’un dividende satisfaisant pour les actionnaires
                        de la Sait and Soda. Aussi l’animation reprend-elle sur cette valeur ; le
                        nombre des transactions a été considérable cette semaine. Le prix a ouvert à
                        41/9, baissé à 40/6, remonté à 42/1 1 /2 pour clôturer à 41/9. </p>
                    <p>Les Tramways d Alexandrie étaient tout-à-fait délaissés au début à 146. Peu
                        après, cependant, une reprise a eu lien à 147 1/2, avec beaucoup
                        d’animation. On clôture à 147. Les dividendes ont fluctué entre 355 et 360
                        et clôturé à 358. </p>
                    <p>La Delta Light, qui était également délaissée d’abord à 14 3/16, reprend à
                        141/2. La Société, parait-il, chercherait à obtenir du Gouvernement
                        l’autorisation d’émettre 350,000 £. d'obligations 4 %. </p>
                    <p>La Béhéra fluctue entre 50 1/2 et 51 1/2 pour clôturer à 50 1/2 nominal. </p>
                    <p>La Ramleh Railway demeure faible toute la semaine à 8, prix auquel elle
                        clôture offerte. </p>
                    <p>Calme aussi la Banque d’Athènes entre 120 et 121 1/2. Elle clôture à 121. </p>
                    <p>La Nungovich ouvre à 10 7/8 pour retomber à 10 1/2 ; la tendance, toutefois,
                        reste bonne. </p>
                    <p>L’Anglo American Nile reste stationnaire à 5 5/8- et les Markets à 23/9. </p>
                    <p>L'animation a bien diminué en Oasis. Le cours débute à 1 9/32, atteint 1 3/8,
                        mais retombe en clôture à 1 1/8. </p>
                    <p>On a traité la New Egyptian Cy. entre 37/6 et 38/6 ; on a clôturé à 37/9. </p>
                    <p>En résumé, si l’on peut s’attendre à ce que la réaction s’accentue encore
                        légèrement, l’ensemble du marché n’en est pas moins excellent et la
                        situation complètement saine. La baisse provient en partie d’anciennes
                        positions pour échéances qui ont été liquidées fin février. </p>
                    <p>(Aujourd'hui à midi et demie) </p>
                    <p>Le marché reste à peu près sans changement.</p>
                    <p>Il y a baisse, pourtant, en Agricole à 11 5/16, en Banque d’Athènes à 120
                        1/2, en Daïra à 25 7/16, en Sait and Soda à 41/9, en Delta à 14 3/8 et en
                        Ramleh Railway à 7 15/16. </p>
                    <p>Il y a hausse, au contraire, de la Wardan à 7 3/8, des Markets à 24 et
                        del’Anglo-American Nile à 5 11/16. </p>
                    <p>Les affaires font défaut. </p>

                        of members up to 156 as against 109 in 1903 ; the entrance fees of these new
                        members, as shown by the balance sheet, amounts to L. E. 97, which is
                        practically the balance L.E. 102 we have in hand to carry forward to the
                        current year. </p>
                    <p>Under the heading of “ Furniture etc. ” L.E. 77.760 m m has been spent; this
                        includes sufficient chairs and tables and tea-cups, etc., to render the Club
                        capable of entertaining the maximum number of persons (about 200) it can
                        accommodate on any special occasion without having to resort to hiring or
                        borrowing. </p>
                    <p>Now that the Club is put on a firm footing and the colours of the flag have
                        been definitely settled, the House Committee have taken in hand the
                        designing of a suitable blazer and the settling of the Club colours, hence
                        the large expenditure of L.E. 21.847 m/m. as against receipts L.E. 12.555
                        m/m under head ing of “hat ribbons etc.,” but this leaves a quantity of
                        these materials in hand. and next year we reckon that the receipts under
                        this head will be more than the expenditure. </p>
                    <p>With reference to the large item of L.E. 85.250 m/m. for repairs, etc., this
                        includes several large repairs which were absolutely necessary, such as
                        replastering the roof, which has leaked badly and injured the ceilings,
                        which have also had to be repaired ; the masonry’ steps also on the sea side
                        have needed constant overhauling due to the bank subsid ing. The starters
                        kiosk has also been altered and the mast has been put on the harbour side ol
                        the same ; this year a lower-mast is being added and the old mast used as a
                        top mast to render the starting flags more con spicuous, as a difficulty was
                        experienced in picking them out when several large boats flying their
                        distinguishing Hugs were near the mast. Two auxiliary landings for small
                        boats have been added on the jetty, also a dressing room under the starter’s
                        kiosk. </p>
                    <p>A proposal was put before the General Com mittee on December 19th that a boat
                        shed and slip, which is badly needed for hauling up the members' boats, be
                        built in the Arsenal, the cost being estimated at L.E. 100, but this was
                        rejected as costing too much ; instead it was decided to build entrance
                        doors and windows on the North side of the corridor of the Club at a cost of
                        L.E. 30, and this is now being done. </p>
                    <p>The buffet has easily covered expenses, its receipts exceeding its
                        expenditure by L.E. 21.010 m/m. </p>
                    <p>Presentation cups and prizes have cost approximately L.E. 45 and this sum has
                        been expended mostly in gold and silver jewellery, enamelled to order with
                        the club burgee. </p>
                    <p>A new system of awarding the prizes was instituted, viz., that of giving
                        points for three consecutive races only, and a prize given to the boat which
                        scored the highest number of points in each set of three races; The old
                        system of dividing the boats into two classes was still maintained. </p>

                    <p>Suggestions are invited from members as to the best way of awarding prizes
                        for the current year. </p>
                    <p>Of the L. E. 35.490 m/m. for “extra wages” most of it has been expended on
                        auxiliary waiters on regatta days. </p>
                    <p>The number of regattas held during the year was 23 and the average number of
                        boats sailing in the same was 12; they were handicapped according to
                        results, and the handicaps were eventually adjusted so finely that in the
                        regatta of August 31st 5 boats crossed the finishing line within 65 seconds,
                        and in the regatta of September 14th 6 boats within 2 3/4 minutes. </p>
                    <p>His Highness Prince Aziz on March 15th, as Commodore, on behalf of the Club,
                        challeng ed the Delta Barrage Bailing Club to race his ,one-rater “Haddayah”
                        against their best one-rater, which was the “Isis,” the stakes to be (euro)5
                        a-side the boats to be handicapped on rating and to sail three races on the
                        Nile at Cairo. On this being done the “Haddayah” won easily. </p>
                    <p>On June 1st His Highness gave a cup to each class for the best boat
                        handicapped on rating only. Class 1 was won by the “Hans” and Class 2 was
                        won by the “Cattelaya. ” </p>
                    <p>On July 27th an “At Home” was given by the Club in honour of the visit of the
                        British Fleet, a cup being given for a sailing race for the officers, which
                        was won by the whaler of H.B.M.S. “Surprise;” there were no less than 65
                        boats started ; there was also a pulling race for the men which was won by
                        the 14-oared cutter of H. B. M. S. “Prince of Wales,” each man of which was
                        awarded a money prize of half a sovereign. </p>
                    <p>The Commodore’s challenge cups were raced for on September 7th and won as
                        follows : Class 1, Air. McClure in the “Jenny. ” Class 2, Sagh. Phillips in
                        the “ Akraba.” </p>
                    <p>A. Chitty Bey very kindly gave a prize which was raced for and won by Captain
                        Arbuthnot in the “Shamrock,” who scored the highest number of points out of
                        three races. </p>
                    <p>At the special regatta on October 26th given in honour of the race for the
                        Challenge Cup of His Highness the Khedive the “ Masr ” won on her time
                        allowance, as it was such a calm day that the boats could only complete one
                        round. Each holder of the cup, from the time of its institution as a
                        challenge cup, has been awarded a pretty miniature of the same, and these
                        will continue to be awarded yearly. </p>
                    <p>On the occasion of the visit of the Greek Squadron an “ At Home ” was given
                        by the Club to the officers of the Fleet which was a great success ; a cup
                        was given for a race between the Club boats of Class 2 which was won by the
                        “ Tantah ” ; and a pulling race which was won by a 12-oared cutter of the
                        H.H.M.S. Hydra, the coxswain of which elected to have a silver plate
                        engraved and enamelled with the design of the Club burgee which will he
                        affixed to the bows of the winning boat. The prizes were awarded by Madame
                        Benachi, wife of the President of the Greek colony at Alexandria, at the
                        request of the Vice-Commodore. </p>
                    <p>This regatta concluded the season’s racing. </p>
                    <p>For the providing of the two “At Homes ” given to the Fleets a subscription
                        was got up amongst the members of the Club, and put into a special fund
                        called the “Entertainment Fund.” This was so well responded to that there
                        was a balance of L. E. 12,703 m/m. Out of this the silver plate for the
                        Greek Fleet prize will be paid, value L.E. 4.500 m/m. It has been ordered
                        from Europe ; when it arrives it will be sent on to the winner. The
                        Committee gratefully acknowledge the kind assistance rendered and facilities
                        offered by the officials of the Ports and Lighthouses Administration, also
                        the kindness of the members of the Alexandria Municipality, who have voted
                        the Club a yearly grant of L. E. 50, besides repairing the road and

                    <head>BRITISH RIFLE CLUB, ALEXANDRIA. </head>
                    <p>REPORT OF COMMITTEE. </p>
                    <p>The following is the text of the report of the committee of the B. R. C.,
                        Alexandria, for 1904:- </p>
                    <p>The Committee now beg to present their report on the working of the Club
                        during the fifth year of its existence. </p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, the number of members, which had increased to 94 in 1903-4,
                        fell off again last season to a total of 77, composed of 49 ordinary members
                        and 28 from the Staff of. the Eastern Telegraph Coy., Ltd. </p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding this smaller total, the number of members who made use of the
                        range was well maintained and a higher standard of efficiency in
                        marksmanship was attained. </p>
                    <p>The G. O. C. and the Head Quarter Staff of H.M.’s forces at Alexandria, as
                        well as Col McCracken and Officers of the 2nd Royal Berkshire Regt., have
                        again earned the thanks of the Club for their unvarying kind assistance.
                        Among other facilities granted by them, members were enabled, last summer,
                        to practise on the long ranges at Mex. </p>
                    <p>Of the 7 matches which the Club had the pleasure of shooting against teams
                        from various units of H. M.s Army and Navyv our team won 4 and lost 3. The
                        usual match with the Cairo B.R.C. could not, unfortunately, be an ranged. </p>
                    <p>The Competitions for Mr. Allen’s spoons were, as heretofore, an additional
                        means of keeping up interest in the shooting, for which we have again to
                        thank that gentleman. The winners of the spoons were, in Class I., Messrs.
                        W. B. Carlisle, W. Lucas, P. Schilizzi (twice), C.W. Strickland and H.
                        Waddington; in Class II., Messrs. S. A. Betts, W. B. Carlisle, R. H. Plank
                        and L.H. Rickards ; in Class III., Messrs. S. A. Betts, T. E. Brown, J.
                        Gordon, IL W. Grant and R. H. Plank. Three spoons, not won, will be put up
                        for competition again shortly. </p>
                    <p>The year’s Champion Cups were won in Class I. by Mr. W, Lucas and in Class
                        11. by Mr. W. B. Carlisle. </p>
                    <p>N.R.A. Skilled Shot” certificates were gain-ed during the season by 7
                        members, Mr. W. Lucas qualifying for the N.R.A. silver badge, by obtaining
                        10 such certificates, and the new N.R.A. “Rifleman ” certificate was granted
                        to Messrs. S. A. Betts, S. E. Brown and R. H. Plank, the “Donegall ” bronze
                        badge being won by Mr. P. Schilizzi. </p>
                    <p>Owing to the loss entailed by supplying ammunition to members at half its
                        cost, and the small number of members subscribing, the funds of the Club are
                        practically exhausted, as will be seen from the annexed statement of
                        accounts, and it will be a question for the Committee to consider means to
                        replenish the drain upon its resources. It is probable that any increase in
                        the amount of subscription would result in a falling off in the membership,
                        and the Committee, therefore, feel that they have no alternative hut to
                        suggest raising the price at which ammunition is sold on the range. </p>
                    <p>The Committee would point out that the benefits of the Club are not confined
                        to permanent residents only, hut are extended also to a considerable number
                        of those who are only here temporarily, and who are continually being
                        replaced by new arrivals. </p>
                    <p>Owing to the range at Mustapha being closed for repairs at the end of October
                        last, our shooting season then terminated, which was about a month earlier
                        than usual, and, consequently, not as much shooting could begot through. </p>
                    <p>The duties of Hon. Treasurer, Hon. Secretary, and joint Hon. Secretary, were
                        performed by Messrs H.F. Dickson, P. Schilizzi and A. S. Preston,
                        respectively, and the Committee again beg to acknowledge, with thanks, the
                        assistance of these gentlemen, as well as of their president, Mr. F. Allen.

                    <p>(From our Correspondent). </p>
                    <p>London, February 23. Lieutenant-Colonel F. W. N. McCracken, D.S.O.,
                        commanding the 2nd Battalion Royal Berks Regiment in Egypt, has been
                        promoted brevet colonel after less than two years’ service at its head.
                        Congratulations ! </p>
                    <p>Lieutenant-Colonel Magill, C.B., R.A.M.C., the newly-appointed P.M.O. in
                        Egypt, has been promoted colonel, to the gratification of his many friends. </p>
                    <p>The Service members of the House of Commons have commenced a vigorous
                        campaign against the new short rifle on the grounds that whilst it is a very
                        good cavalry arm, it is a useless infantry one, being much too short and
                        inferior in accuracy and penetration to the Lee-Enfield, which went
                        successfully through the late war. Between the short rifle, obsolete
                        fieldguns, army reform, and the death of recruits, the Army Council will
                        have an indifferent time of it this parliamentary session. </p>
                    <p>The vacancy for a quartermaster in the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, caused
                        by the retirement of Major Williams, has been filled by the promotion of
                        Quartermaster Sergeant W. A. Morris to be quartermaster with the honorary
                        rank of lieutenant Lieutenant Morris served with the 1st Battalion through
                        the Boer War, for which he holds the medals with clasps. </p>
                    <p>The Admiralty has placed an order with Hadley and Co., Sheffield, for eight
                        hundred 12-iuch armour-piercing shells. These shells are for the primary
                        guns of the battleships in commission and in reserve. There,are 450 of these
                        guns on the battleships afloat and in reserve. Each 12-inch gun weighs 50
                        tons, throws a 480-lb. shell of the above type with accuracy up to ten
                        miles, and nearly twice that distance at extreme elevation. All this does
                        not look like the millennium. </p>
                    <p>Brevet-Colonel. H. S. B. Hodgkinson, North Staffordshire Regiment, will
                        vacate the command of the 1st Battalion at Lichfield on tho 14th March.
                        Under ordinary circumstances the command should go to Major T. M. Haw-tayne,
                        second in command of the 2nd Battalion at Umballa. Major Hawtayne served
                        with the Egyptian Army in the Sudan campaign of 1885 (medal with clasp and
                        4th class Medji-dieh) ; the Gambia Expedition 1892, in command of the Gambia
                        police(medal with clasps), and the Boer War 1900-02 (medal with clasps).

                    <head>EGYPTIAN COLLECTIONS AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM. </head>
                    <p>An important addition has been made to the Egyptian collections at the
                        British Museum and will shortly be open to the public. Dr. Bridge has taken
                        over, piece by piece, the whole of the sculptures and inscriptions which
                        decorated the walls of the tomb of an Egyptian official of the Sixth
                        Dynasty, named Ptah-urt. The tomb was carefully drawn and measured, and has
                        now been reconstructed, so that one may see one of these interesting private
                        tomb exactly as it stood in the necropolis at Sakkara. The sculptures are
                        painted, and represent scenes in the life of the owner, the presentation of
                        cattle, the various occupations of his servants; and there is a remarkably
                        spirited scene representing wrestlers, similar to the great painting at Beni
                        Hasan. </p>

                    <head>SUPERB EGYPTOLOGY. </head>
                    <p>There was inaugurated last week in the museum of the Louvre, perhaps the
                        finest collection of Egyptian antiquities existing in Europe, or, indeed,
                        anywhere outside Egypt. They are the result, mainly, of the energy and
                        activity displayed by M. Benedite, Conservator of National Museums, during
                        his mission of two years ago. It is not alone in bulk that the collection is
                        rich. The gems which it contains are of the rarest, going back in some
                        instances 5,000 years before our era. The grandest object of all is a
                        mortuary chapel, or tomb, transported bodily with all its sculptures and
                        superb decorations perfect. They are of the best period of ancient Egyptian
                        art, and are strikingly beautiful. </p>

                    <head>MYTHOLOGIE EGYPTIENNE </head>
                    <p>La mythologie égyptienne a eu les honneurs de la dernière séance de
                        l’Académie des inscriptions de Paris. M. Guimet a expliqué que l’on
                        rencontre souvent dans les laraires ou sépultures de la Basse-Egypte, un
                        jeune dieu dont la tête est coiffée de deux bourgeons. Il se combine parfois
                        avec Horus sous sa forme romaine et devient ainsi un dieu funéraire,
                        agricole et nourricier, présidant à la résurrection des âmes comme à la
                        résurrection des plantes. </p>
                    <p>Quand il est représenté tenant sur son bras le jeune Horus, ce dernier
                        devient son “double,’’ forme sous laquelle il doit s’incarner. </p>
                    <p>Poussant l’idée plus loin, les statuaires le font vieux, décrépit et toujours
                        portant Horus; c’est alors l’hiver annonçant le printemps.</p>

                    <p>British Chamber of Commerce.—We would call the attention of persons
                        interested in Egyptian trade to the work of the British Chamber of Commerce
                        of Egypt, whose office in Alexandria gives information as to standings,
                        trade, &amp;c., to its members, and whose monthly publication reviews our
                        commerce. The annual subscription is £1 and all British traders should
                        become members. Our London office, 36, New Broad-street EC., acts as London
                        agency to the Chamber. </p>

                        well as FLIES, gnats and all-flying insects, are set at defiance. It is
                        absolutely infalliable as a preventive, and is guaranteed to be free from
                        barbonic and other deleterious ingredients. It is neither sticky nor greasy,
