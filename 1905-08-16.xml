                    <head>Army Problems.</head>
                    <p>To the many and eminent services which Lord Roberts has rendered to his
                        country he has now added another by throwing all the weight of hie authority
                        and experience into an effort to arouse the public to a sense of the
                        dangerous inefficiency of the land defences of the Empire. It is an
                        encouraging symptom that his previous utterances on this vital subject led
                        the London Chamber of Commerce to invite him to address a special meeting,
                        for which the Mansion-house was placed at disposal by the Lord Mayor. These
                        is always good hope of a movement which interests the City of London to this
                        extent, and we trust that his reception may not only convince Lord Roberts
                        that he is producing an effect upon public opinion, but may lead other
                        important public bodies to lend their aid. much of the difficulty of his
                        task arises from the dual nature of the problem of Imperial defence. The
                        public are accustomed to think of the British Army as an organisation
                        maintained at vast expense lor the purpose chiefly of sending regular drafts
                        to India, occasionally carrying on small frontier wars with turbulent tribes
                        in various parts of the world, and pro viding a second line of defence for
                        these islands. There is endless discussion of the intelligently conducted,
                        either by military men or by the public. It resolves itself too</p>
                    <p>often into a mere shuffling about of Regulars, Militia, and Volunteers, each
                        of which has its convinced advocates always regarding the others with a
                        jealousy which is fatal to progress. The essential limitations of all three
                        are. continually ignored. About our Regular Army, the cardinal fact is that
                        it is a voluntary army, which has to go into the labour market for recruits,
                        and that taking one year with another the number of useful recruits may be
                        put at about 30,000. Army reformers may be clever, though sometimes they are
                        not, but were they gifted with absolute genius they could not make 30,000
                        men into anything more than thirty thousand. They are always trying
                        experiments and putting forth schemes which one and all involve the hopeless
                        attempt to make that number do duty for a larger one. The Militia and
                        Volunteers are counted in and scored out again, pretty much as an Oriental
                        jeweller makes a solid ring mostly consisting of base metal, dissolves-out
                        the bare metal, and has for remainder a ring indeed, but one which is no
                        stronger than the original gold which suffices to form it.</p>
                    <p>There is another aspect of Imperial defence which all this peddling puts out
                        of sight altogether. Even if the Army were made thorough-ly adequate for the
                        purposes we have named, there would remain the question what we are to do in
                        case our possessions are attacked by one of the gigantic armies of modern
                        days, drawn by conscription from populations often greatly outnumbering our
                        own. When we have counted up everything that has ever stood in front of a
                        sergeant, we have nothing adequate for such a contest The Norfolk
                        Commission, we have no doubt quite rightly, has declared that neither
                        Militia nor Volunteers are fit to face the thoroughly trained soldiers of
                        States that put most of the population through the ranks. Were they fit they
                        could not be compelled to go abroad, and were they compelled to go there is
                        no organisation or equipment fitted for a serious war. Taking such forces as
                        are usually contemplated in a vague way without question of their actual
                        efficiency, <personName>Lord Roberts</personName> tells us that for serious work, say on the frontier
                        of India, there would be a shortage of 7,000 officers. The medical service
                        would not suffice for 100,000 men in real war against a civilised foe. Men
                        of sorts could perhaps be scraped together, as in the Boer war, to the
                        number of 350,000, but that was the limit of our resources even with unfit
                        material, while in a serious war we should need to put in the fighting line
                        quite that number of trained soldiers and then furnish extensive reserves
                        and reinforcements. That is the aspect of Imperial defence to which Lord
                        Roberts desired to call attention when he said in the House of Lords that
                        the British Army is no better prepared for war than before the South African
                        troubles began. He had no thought of denying that reforms have been made in
                        such Army as we have, but he was speaking of that larger Imperial defence
                        for which we have made no preparations that can be regarded as serious.</p>
                    <p>Now what are the preparations which he regards as serious and possible. Not
                        an army of conscripts, which he regards as unsuited to the conditions of
                        this country, though that would be preferable to total unpreparedness wants
                        universal training in drill and in shooting, carried out in all sorts of
                        ways to suit all conditions of men. That would give us a population out of
                        which we could form efficient soldiers in large numbers, with the very short
                        preparation which the Japanese have found adequate, thanks to the practical
                        efficiency of their education. What harm would it do to divert some of the
                        energies of our schoolboys from games into the path of ordered exercises,
                        which would fit them in a great emergency to save the Empire! What harm
                        would it do the classes from which officers are drawn so to modify their
                        education and their amusements as to make them embryo officers! Drill for
                        everybody, familiarity with a rifle for everybody, and higher education as
                        applied to war for all who possess superior intelligence would do nothing
                        bnt good all round. No one surely can look upon the crowds of slouching
                        figures to be seen in our streets without thinking what a pity it is that
                        they were not taught at school to hold themselves erect. No one can consider
                        the mental slouch of so many of his fellow beings without regretting that
                        they were never taught alertness and discipline. What was begun in school
                        would be willingly carried on afterwards. We should have real Volunteers
                        with real officers; and we should have a hundred for one. The talk about
                        militarism is cant. A citizen army never fights for the fun of it Militarism
                        is the vice of an army irresponsibly governed, or of an army of citizens who
                        have no voice in their own affairs. Besides, with a population trained as
                        Lord Roberts desires, and treated afterwards as it would demand to be
                        treated, we should inspire abroad a kind and degree of respect which would
                        go far to curb the ambitions of militarism everywhere.</p>

                    <p>Forged Diplomas. - Our Greek contemporary "Phôs” states that in accordance

                        Government has made an enquiry into the, origin of no less than four forged
                        diplomas possessed by Greek pharmacists practising in Egypt. It appears that
                        a regular manufactory of false diplomas exists at the University of Athens,
                        of all places</p>
                    <p>Tram Collision.—At 8.30 p m. yesterday evening tram No. 17 had just left the
                        halt at the Café du Nil, Rae Tewfik, and had moved on the single line
                        section of the tramway when tram No. 12, coming from the opposite direction
                        collided with it. Considerable material damage was done, the roof of one of
                        the collid ing trains being wrecked. The Tramways Company informs us that no
                        personal damage was inflicted on any of the passengers, one of whom lost a
                        hat and stick in the accident We hear, from other sources of bruises
                        sustained through the shock, but it appears that, whatever really occurred,
                        no one sustained any serious hurt. We hope that the Tramways Company will
                        lose no time in fixing the responsibility for the accident, and making a
                        public statement of its causes.</p>

                        <head>EXPORTS TO U.S.A. INCREASE</head>
                        <p>We congratulate the Customs Administration on the rapidity with which it
                            has completed and published its monthly report for July. Up to the
                            present the report has not appeared nearly so quickly, the returns for
                            May and June, for example, appearing on or about June 25 and July 25
                            respectively, so that the July return is a good ten days in advance of
                            the usual date of publication. We hope that the Administration will
                            persist in this excellent innovation.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the figures for the past month, we note that the imports
                            totalled LE. 1,509,986 against L.E. 1,525,104 during the corresponding
                            month of the past year, showing a slight decrease.</p>
                        <p>The increase of the exports as compared with the July returns for 1901 is
                            very remarkable, amounting to L.E. 342,504, the figures being L.E.
                            1,174,409 against L.E. 831,905 in 1904.</p>
                        <p>Taking the figures for the first seven months of the year 1904-1905 we
                            have a decline on exports amounting to no less a sum than L.E.
                            1,103,293, in the present year, though imports show an increase of L.E.
                            732,023 between January 1 and July 31,1905, as compared with the
                            corresponding period in 1904.</p>
                        <p>In July British imports—in which we include imports from Cyprus, Malta
                            and Gibraltar,—were valued at L.E. 526,255, against L.E.. 526,772, in
                            July 1904, while for tho first seven months of the year they totalled
                            L.E. 3,760,459 against L.E. 3.525,814, showing a decided increase. The
                            increase of French imports is proportionately even higher for the seven
                            months in L.E. 1,160,411 in 1905 against L.E. 976,579 during the
                            corresponding period in 1904, without counting the French Mediterranean
                            possessions. German trade shows a huge decline for the month, L.E.
                            56,968 as against L.E. 86,587 for the month of July 1904, and a marked
                            falling off in the first seven months of 1905.</p>
                        <p>The export statistics continue to show a decline. England is still by far
                            Egypt's best customer, followed by Germany and France. The exports to
                            the U.S.A. have sprung up from L.E. 392,230 in the first seven months of
                            1904 to L.E. 648,394 during the corresponding period this year, and
                            those to Turkey show an increase both for July, and for the seven months
                            period, owing we believe to the fact that Egyptian rice is highly
                            appreciated in Palestine and Syria. But the fact that there is a
                            district shrinkage in Egypt's export trade with most of her customers is
                            explained by the lower price of cotton, which has not been
                            counterbalanced by the increase—205,505 cantars—-in the quantity
                            exported.</p>

                        <p>The raising of the sunken dredger Pharaon II is a matter of hours only.
                            The last of the four pairs of lighten was finally put into position
                            to-day, and was securely lashed with chains to the dredger, as were the
                            others. All four were filled as soon as they were completed, aud after
                            being tested, were sunk to the harbour bottom, where a small army of
                            divers made them ready for the pumping out. The placing has been going
                            on all the morning and I believe the pumps well be started to-day, or at
                            latest in the morning of Tuesday.</p>
                        <p>The method used, that of converting pairs lighters into boxes by bolting
                            their tope together, and providing piping from the reversed bottom of
                            the upper one, through which the suction hoses will be led, is worthy of
                            all praise. It is a very clever idea and I believe quite original. The
                            staff of the Canal Company are to be congratulated and should it prove
                            successful, of which there is every probability, one of the best pieces
                            of salvage</p>
                        <p>work of the day will stand to their credit.</p>

                        <p>The British second class cruiser Flora,which</p>
                        <p>arrived here on Saturday, is to sail for the China station to-morrow. She
                            was built in 1893, and is armed with eight six-inch guns, in additions
                            to those of smaller calibre.</p>
                        <p>SCENE IN THE CUSTOMS YARD.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the case of molestation</p>
                        <p>of an Italian lady which I noted a few days ago, there was a considerable
                            disturbance in the yard of the Custom house on Sunday, when a relative
                            of the lady met the Arab who, it is alleged, insulted the lady in
                            question. From words the affair become more serious, and the
                            intervention of a number of police under Major Bonelli, and that of the
                            Italian Consul was necessary to quell the disturbance, which attracted
                            numbers of idlers.</p>

                        <p>Information having reached the police that a certain house in the
                            Koronfish district of Cairo was used as a hashish dépôt by an Israelite
                            called Selim Ibrahim, several agents of the secret police, the moawin of
                            the Monski caracol, a captain of the police, and a shawish surrounded
                            the house with the purpose of searching it. The door of the house was
                            opened by the proprietor himself who recognized the police agents and
                            tried to close it again, being assisted in his endeavours by his parents
                            and some companions. A fierce struggle, in which nabouts and revolvers
                            played a formidable part, ensued. The shawish, an Italian of the name of
                            Pietro Giuliana, was severely wounded in the face, receiving a deep cut
                            running from his left eye to the upper lip, and he was also very much
                            bruised. Several others of the party were more or less severely injured
                            before an entranoe could be effected, one of them receiving a wound in
                            the abdomen from a revolver bullet Selim Ibrahim, who is a local
                            subject, was arrested in the evening.</p>

                    <byline>BY WILHELM MEISTER</byline>
                    <p>(Continued from August 5.)</p>
                    <p>With regard to these Christian Nationalities of the East we may say that,
                        while before recent events that have sealed the union of England, France and
                        Italy, they might have, in some cases, shown scruples as to aiding a
                        military occupation of Syria on the part of the British, they know full well
                        to-day that, for the sake of their Latin sisters and for themselves, they
                        will have to render England all possible aid, and that on the success of her
                        attempt to rescue them from their miserable fate, depends the future of
                        civilisation itself, and liberty in the near East. Centuries of struggle
                        have only won. for the Lebanon a factitious and derisory indépendance, which
                        weakens every year under the solvents of the pernicious and futile regime of
                        a succession of inept Mutassarrifs who are the creatures of the Porte. Its
                        people have learnt by emigration, or in European schools, to appreciate the
                        beauties of civilisation, but dare not do more than parade their knowledge
                        for fear of awakening the barbarism that surrounds them, and being engulfed
                        in its waves.</p>
                    <p>We believe that we have sufficiently demonstrated the fact that at this
                        moment in the world’s history, an attempt by Great Britain to establish
                        herself in Syria, with a view to preserving her threatened authority in the
                        near East, would run no risk of being thwarted by any power or combination
                        of powers, capable of successful opposition. What was impossible but
                        yesterday, before the fruitful treaty of April 8, 1904, before Mukden and
                        Tsushima, before the Franco-Italian rapprochement, and before the
                        arbitration treaties, owing to the association of four powers France,
                        Germany, Russia, and Turkey, all interested, each according to its own
                        views, in maintaining the status quo in Syria, has to-day, through the
                        dissociation that has sprung up between them, and the overthrow of the most
                        enterprising member of the informal league, become not only possible, but
                        eminently practicable, not to say indispensable, for the future of
                        civilisation in the East, and the safety of the United Kingdom. Similar
                        moments are rare in history, and rare and fleeting are the combinations of
                        circumstances that offer suoh possibilities of success to a”bold policy. But
                        it is essential to recognise the fact that what is easy enough to-day will
                        be impossible tomorrow, through the modification of the position of each of
                        the footers in the problem, notably of Turkey, and that England, if she
                        refuses to take advantage of her position as first of the Oriental Powers,
                        will have one day to strike her tents.</p>
                    <p>If she permit’s Von der. Goltz's plan to mature and develope, and waits in
                        false security till the Turk has completed his railway communication from
                        Stamboul to the Egyptian frontier, and completed too his subsidiary military
                        reforms, her last hour will have struck and the last hour—alas ! -of
                        civilisation on the near East. If on the contrary, she profits by the moment
                        of grace allowed her and the marvellous chance it offers, and is the first
                        of the powers to drive in the wedge of her influence, and, taking advantage
                        of the example of Mohamed the Conqueror, to continue her efforts till firmly
                        established in the Asiatic and African territories that are the bridge heads
                        of the Suez Canal, she is saved.</p>
                    <p>Let England emulate the sagacity of Japan, and by prompt and decisive action
                        baffle the formidable and deadly designs of her German and Ottoman enemies!
                        Britain’s great work will be preserved from ruin, her African Empire set on
                        a firm basis, India saved, and civilisation and freedom for ever established
                        in the East</p>

                    <p>E.T.C v. MR. DAWSON’S XL</p>
                    <p>This match was played on the A.C.C's ground yesterday and resulted in the
                        severe defeat of the E.T.C., who won the toss but could do nothing against
                        the bowling of H. B. Carver and P. P. Graves, both of whom came out with
                        gcod analyses. Dawson kept wicket extremely well, and stumped two batsmen
                        very smartly. The whole side was dismissed for 30, G. Mclean, who hit a
                        couple of fours, being the highest scorer.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dawson’s XL took matters fairly easily when they went in. Birley and Peel
                        were the highest scorers, the latter playing a vigorous but streaky innings
                        of 77. Me hit 14 fours but gave numerous chances ; none the less his innings
                        gave his side a long lead. Of the other batsmen Lucas did best, staying in
                        some time for a cautious 19.</p>
                    <p>The E.T.C. XL went in again at 5.15 p.m. and started so disastrously that it
                        looked as if they might lose the match by an innings. A freely hit 90 not
                        out by Byrne saved them and the score at the close was 56 for 7 wickets.</p>
