                    <head>Army Problems.</head>
                    <p>To the many and eminent services which Lord Roberts has rendered to his
                        country he has now added another by throwing all the weight of hie authority
                        and experience into an effort to arouse the public to a sense of the
                        dangerous inefficiency of the land defences of the Empire. It is an
                        encouraging symptom that his previous utterances on this vital subject led
                        the London Chamber of Commerce to invite him to address a special meeting,
                        for which the Mansion-house was placed at disposal by the Lord Mayor. These
                        is always good hope of a movement which interests the City of London to this
                        extent, and we trust that his reception may not only convince Lord Roberts
                        that he is producing an effect upon public opinion, but may lead other
                        important public bodies to lend their aid. much of the difficulty of his
                        task arises from the dual nature of the problem of Imperial defence. The
                        public are accustomed to think of the British Army as an organisation
                        maintained at vast expense lor the purpose chiefly of sending regular drafts
                        to India, occasionally carrying on small frontier wars with turbulent tribes
                        in various parts of the world, and pro viding a second line of defence for
                        these islands. There is endless discussion of the intelligently conducted,
                        either by military men or by the public. It resolves itself too</p>
                    <p>often into a mere shuffling about of Regulars, Militia, and Volunteers, each
                        of which has its convinced advocates always regarding the others with a
                        jealousy which is fatal to progress. The essential limitations of all three
                        are. continually ignored. About our Regular Army, the cardinal fact is that
                        it is a voluntary army, which has to go into the labour market for recruits,
                        and that taking one year with another the number of useful recruits may be
                        put at about 30,000. Army reformers may be clever, though sometimes they are
                        not, but were they gifted with absolute genius they could not make 30,000
                        men into anything more than thirty thousand. They are always trying
                        experiments and putting forth schemes which one and all involve the hopeless
                        attempt to make that number do duty for a larger one. The Militia and
                        Volunteers are counted in and scored out again, pretty much as an Oriental
                        jeweller makes a solid ring mostly consisting of base metal, dissolves-out
                        the bare metal, and has for remainder a ring indeed, but one which is no
                        stronger than the original gold which suffices to form it.</p>
                    <p>There is another aspect of Imperial defence which all this peddling puts out
                        of sight altogether. Even if the Army were made thorough-ly adequate for the
                        purposes we have named, there would remain the question what we are to do in
                        case our possessions are attacked by one of the gigantic armies of modern
                        days, drawn by conscription from populations often greatly outnumbering our
                        own. When we have counted up everything that has ever stood in front of a
                        sergeant, we have nothing adequate for such a contest The Norfolk
                        Commission, we have no doubt quite rightly, has declared that neither
                        Militia nor Volunteers are fit to face the thoroughly trained soldiers of
                        States that put most of the population through the ranks. Were they fit they
                        could not be compelled to go abroad, and were they compelled to go there is
                        no organisation or equipment fitted for a serious war. Taking such forces as
                        are usually contemplated in a vague way without question of their actual
                        efficiency, <persName>Lord Roberts</persName> tells us that for serious
                        work, say on the frontier of India, there would be a shortage of 7,000
                        officers. The medical service would not suffice for 100,000 men in real war
                        against a civilised foe. Men of sorts could perhaps be scraped together, as
                        in the Boer war, to the number of 350,000, but that was the limit of our
                        resources even with unfit material, while in a serious war we should need to
                        put in the fighting line quite that number of trained soldiers and then
                        furnish extensive reserves and reinforcements. That is the aspect of
                        Imperial defence to which Lord Roberts desired to call attention when he
                        said in the House of Lords that the British Army is no better prepared for
                        war than before the South African troubles began. He had no thought of
                        denying that reforms have been made in such Army as we have, but he was
                        speaking of that larger Imperial defence for which we have made no
                        preparations that can be regarded as serious.</p>
                    <p>Now what are the preparations which he regards as serious and possible. Not
                        an army of conscripts, which he regards as unsuited to the conditions of
                        this country, though that would be preferable to total unpreparedness wants
                        universal training in drill and in shooting, carried out in all sorts of
                        ways to suit all conditions of men. That would give us a population out of
                        which we could form efficient soldiers in large numbers, with the very short
                        preparation which the Japanese have found adequate, thanks to the practical
                        efficiency of their education. What harm would it do to divert some of the
                        energies of our schoolboys from games into the path of ordered exercises,
                        which would fit them in a great emergency to save the Empire! What harm
                        would it do the classes from which officers are drawn so to modify their
                        education and their amusements as to make them embryo officers! Drill for
                        everybody, familiarity with a rifle for everybody, and higher education as
                        applied to war for all who possess superior intelligence would do nothing
                        but good all round. No one surely can look upon the crowds of slouching
                        figures to be seen in our streets without thinking what a pity it is that
                        they were not taught at school to hold themselves erect. No one can consider
                        the mental slouch of so many of his fellow beings without regretting that
                        they were never taught alertness and discipline. What was begun in school
                        would be willingly carried on afterwards. We should have real Volunteers
                        with real officers; and we should have a hundred for one. The talk about
                        militarism is cant. A citizen army never fights for the fun of it Militarism
                        is the vice of an army irresponsibly governed, or of an army of citizens who
                        have no voice in their own affairs. Besides, with a population trained as
                        Lord Roberts desires, and treated afterwards as it would demand to be
                        treated, we should inspire abroad a kind and degree of respect which would
                        go far to curb the ambitions of militarism everywhere.</p>

                        had left for three months only to return to her again, killed him by

                    <p>Forged Diplomas. - Our Greek contemporary "Phôs” states that in accordance

                        Government has made an enquiry into the, origin of no less than four forged
                        diplomas possessed by Greek pharmacists practising in Egypt. It appears that
                        a regular manufactory of false diplomas exists at the University of Athens,
                        of all places</p>
                    <p>Tram Collision.—At 8.30 p m. yesterday evening tram No. 17 had just left the
                        halt at the Café du Nil, Rae Tewfik, and had moved on the single line
                        section of the tramway when tram No. 12, coming from the opposite direction
                        collided with it. Considerable material damage was done, the roof of one of
                        the collid ing trains being wrecked. The Tramways Company informs us that no
                        personal damage was inflicted on any of the passengers, one of whom lost a
                        hat and stick in the accident We hear, from other sources of bruises
                        sustained through the shock, but it appears that, whatever really occurred,
                        no one sustained any serious hurt. We hope that the Tramways Company will
                        lose no time in fixing the responsibility for the accident, and making a
                        public statement of its causes.</p>

                        <head>EXPORTS TO U.S.A. INCREASE</head>
                        <p>We congratulate the Customs Administration on the rapidity with which it
                            has completed and published its monthly report for July. Up to the
                            present the report has not appeared nearly so quickly, the returns for
                            May and June, for example, appearing on or about June 25 and July 25
                            respectively, so that the July return is a good ten days in advance of
                            the usual date of publication. We hope that the Administration will
                            persist in this excellent innovation.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the figures for the past month, we note that the imports
                            totalled LE. 1,509,986 against L.E. 1,525,104 during the corresponding
                            month of the past year, showing a slight decrease.</p>
                        <p>The increase of the exports as compared with the July returns for 1901 is
                            very remarkable, amounting to L.E. 342,504, the figures being L.E.
                            1,174,409 against L.E. 831,905 in 1904.</p>
                        <p>Taking the figures for the first seven months of the year 1904-1905 we
                            have a decline on exports amounting to no less a sum than L.E.
                            1,103,293, in the present year, though imports show an increase of L.E.
                            732,023 between January 1 and July 31,1905, as compared with the
                            corresponding period in 1904.</p>
                        <p>In July British imports—in which we include imports from Cyprus, Malta
                            and Gibraltar,—were valued at L.E. 526,255, against L.E.. 526,772, in
                            July 1904, while for tho first seven months of the year they totalled
                            L.E. 3,760,459 against L.E. 3.525,814, showing a decided increase. The
                            increase of French imports is proportionately even higher for the seven
                            months in L.E. 1,160,411 in 1905 against L.E. 976,579 during the
                            corresponding period in 1904, without counting the French Mediterranean
                            possessions. German trade shows a huge decline for the month, L.E.
                            56,968 as against L.E. 86,587 for the month of July 1904, and a marked
                            falling off in the first seven months of 1905.</p>
                        <p>The export statistics continue to show a decline. England is still by far
                            Egypt's best customer, followed by Germany and France. The exports to
                            the U.S.A. have sprung up from L.E. 392,230 in the first seven months of
                            1904 to L.E. 648,394 during the corresponding period this year, and
                            those to Turkey show an increase both for July, and for the seven months
                            period, owing we believe to the fact that Egyptian rice is highly
                            appreciated in Palestine and Syria. But the fact that there is a
                            district shrinkage in Egypt's export trade with most of her customers is
                            explained by the lower price of cotton, which has not been
                            counterbalanced by the increase—205,505 cantars—-in the quantity
                            exported.</p>

                            others. All four were filled as soon as they were completed, aud after
                            being tested, were sunk to the harbour bottom, where a small army of
                            divers made them ready for the pumping out. The placing has been going
                            on all the morning and I believe the pumps well be started to-day, or at
                            latest in the morning of Tuesday.</p>
                        <p>The method used, that of converting pairs lighters into boxes by bolting
                            their tope together, and providing piping from the reversed bottom of
                            the upper one, through which the suction hoses will be led, is worthy of
                            all praise. It is a very clever idea and I believe quite original. The
                            staff of the Canal Company are to be congratulated and should it prove
                            successful, of which there is every probability, one of the best pieces
                            of salvage</p>
                        <p>work of the day will stand to their credit.</p>

                        <p>arrived here on Saturday, is to sail for the China station to-morrow. She

                        <p>SCENE IN THE CUSTOMS YARD.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the case of molestation</p>
                        <p>of an Italian lady which I noted a few days ago, there was a considerable
                            disturbance in the yard of the Custom house on Sunday, when a relative
                            of the lady met the Arab who, it is alleged, insulted the lady in
                            question. From words the affair become more serious, and the
                            intervention of a number of police under Major Bonelli, and that of the
                            Italian Consul was necessary to quell the disturbance, which attracted
                            numbers of idlers.</p>

                        <p>Information having reached the police that a certain house in the
                            Koronfish district of Cairo was used as a hashish dépôt by an Israelite
                            called Selim Ibrahim, several agents of the secret police, the moawin of
                            the Monski caracol, a captain of the police, and a shawish surrounded
                            the house with the purpose of searching it. The door of the house was
                            opened by the proprietor himself who recognized the police agents and
                            tried to close it again, being assisted in his endeavours by his parents
                            and some companions. A fierce struggle, in which nabouts and revolvers
                            played a formidable part, ensued. The shawish, an Italian of the name of
                            Pietro Giuliana, was severely wounded in the face, receiving a deep cut
                            running from his left eye to the upper lip, and he was also very much
                            bruised. Several others of the party were more or less severely injured
                            before an entranoe could be effected, one of them receiving a wound in
                            the abdomen from a revolver bullet Selim Ibrahim, who is a local
                            subject, was arrested in the evening.</p>

                    <byline>BY WILHELM MEISTER</byline>
                    <p>(Continued from August 5.)</p>
                    <p>With regard to these Christian Nationalities of the East we may say that,
                        while before recent events that have sealed the union of England, France and
                        Italy, they might have, in some cases, shown scruples as to aiding a
                        military occupation of Syria on the part of the British, they know full well
                        to-day that, for the sake of their Latin sisters and for themselves, they
                        will have to render England all possible aid, and that on the success of her
                        attempt to rescue them from their miserable fate, depends the future of
                        civilisation itself, and liberty in the near East. Centuries of struggle
                        have only won. for the Lebanon a factitious and derisory indépendance, which
                        weakens every year under the solvents of the pernicious and futile regime of
                        a succession of inept Mutassarrifs who are the creatures of the Porte. Its
                        people have learnt by emigration, or in European schools, to appreciate the
                        beauties of civilisation, but dare not do more than parade their knowledge
                        for fear of awakening the barbarism that surrounds them, and being engulfed
                        in its waves.</p>
                    <p>We believe that we have sufficiently demonstrated the fact that at this
                        moment in the world’s history, an attempt by Great Britain to establish
                        herself in Syria, with a view to preserving her threatened authority in the
                        near East, would run no risk of being thwarted by any power or combination
                        of powers, capable of successful opposition. What was impossible but
                        yesterday, before the fruitful treaty of April 8, 1904, before Mukden and
                        Tsushima, before the Franco-Italian rapprochement, and before the
                        arbitration treaties, owing to the association of four powers France,
                        Germany, Russia, and Turkey, all interested, each according to its own
                        views, in maintaining the status quo in Syria, has to-day, through the
                        dissociation that has sprung up between them, and the overthrow of the most
                        enterprising member of the informal league, become not only possible, but
                        eminently practicable, not to say indispensable, for the future of
                        civilisation in the East, and the safety of the United Kingdom. Similar
                        moments are rare in history, and rare and fleeting are the combinations of
                        circumstances that offer suoh possibilities of success to a”bold policy. But
                        it is essential to recognise the fact that what is easy enough to-day will
                        be impossible tomorrow, through the modification of the position of each of
                        the footers in the problem, notably of Turkey, and that England, if she
                        refuses to take advantage of her position as first of the Oriental Powers,
                        will have one day to strike her tents.</p>
                    <p>If she permit’s Von der. Goltz's plan to mature and develope, and waits in
                        false security till the Turk has completed his railway communication from
                        Stamboul to the Egyptian frontier, and completed too his subsidiary military
                        reforms, her last hour will have struck and the last hour—alas ! -of
                        civilisation on the near East. If on the contrary, she profits by the moment
                        of grace allowed her and the marvellous chance it offers, and is the first
                        of the powers to drive in the wedge of her influence, and, taking advantage
                        of the example of Mohamed the Conqueror, to continue her efforts till firmly
                        established in the Asiatic and African territories that are the bridge heads
                        of the Suez Canal, she is saved.</p>
                    <p>Let England emulate the sagacity of Japan, and by prompt and decisive action
                        baffle the formidable and deadly designs of her German and Ottoman enemies!
                        Britain’s great work will be preserved from ruin, her African Empire set on
                        a firm basis, India saved, and civilisation and freedom for ever established
                        in the East</p>

                    <p>E.T.C v. MR. DAWSON’S XL</p>
                    <p>This match was played on the A.C.C's ground yesterday and resulted in the
                        severe defeat of the E.T.C., who won the toss but could do nothing against
                        the bowling of H. B. Carver and P. P. Graves, both of whom came out with
                        gcod analyses. Dawson kept wicket extremely well, and stumped two batsmen
                        very smartly. The whole side was dismissed for 30, G. Mclean, who hit a
                        couple of fours, being the highest scorer.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dawson’s XL took matters fairly easily when they went in. Birley and Peel
                        were the highest scorers, the latter playing a vigorous but streaky innings
                        of 77. Me hit 14 fours but gave numerous chances ; none the less his innings
                        gave his side a long lead. Of the other batsmen Lucas did best, staying in
                        some time for a cautious 19.</p>
                    <p>The E.T.C. XL went in again at 5.15 p.m. and started so disastrously that it
                        looked as if they might lose the match by an innings. A freely hit 90 not
                        out by Byrne saved them and the score at the close was 56 for 7 wickets.</p>

                    <p>“Times."</p>
                    <p>Nothing can be more natural or more in accordance with the spirit of this
                        civilisation and of the age than that two peoples who have so much in
                        common, who know each other so well, who owe each other so much, and who
                        esteem each other so highly, should wish to be firm friends. In the past
                        there have been serious and manifold obstacles to such a friendship. France
                        and England have important material interests all over the globe, and at a
                        number of points those interests have stood in conflict. It was natural that
                        the local repre sentatives of the two Powers in remote regions should attach
                        an importance which sometimes was perhaps exaggerated to the particular
                        differences at issue in their own immediate sphere. It was natural that the
                        Govern-ments and the nations at home should support the views of their
                        agents abroad. Distrust begat distrust, and suspicion suspicion. Neither
                        nation desired war, but so long as these differences remained outstanding, a
                        situation existed which put peace at the mercy of an accident, or an
                        imprudence. Happily for both coun-tries aud happily for mankind, the conduct
                        of French and English affairs has been in the hands of statesman who felt
                        that a conflict between them would be an irreparable calamity to both, a
                        grief to their friends, and a joy to their enemies. Frenchmen and
                        Englishmen, even when the irritation between them was most acute, never
                        forgot that, valaable as might be the actual or prospective interests which
                        they were disputing in distant lands, they had an interest of immeasurably
                        greater vaine at home, and that interest was and is peace.</p>
                   <p>“Standard.”</p>
                    <p>When Frenchmen feel at home in England and Englishmen in France, the era of
                        lasting peace and a good understanding will have, indeed, commenced. French
                        fleets have visited Spithead before, and their welcome has not been lacking
                        in magnificence ; but the value of the present demonstration lies not in the
                        round of public gaiety which has been prepared, but in the easy sociability
                        which, inaugurated by the King last night, will permeate every event of the
                        visit. Formal functions there must necessarily be ; but it is the change of
                        seeing English cities, the English country side, and something of English
                        life, which our visitors anticipate moat keenly. The permanent good likely
                        to result from the visit is not worse but better assured, because no</p>
                    <p>one, for the moment, is thinking of it, but each and all are hoping that our
                        guests may have a good time.</p>
                    <p>“Echo de Paris.”</p>
                    <p>Never will the illustrious naval port have rendered a greater homage to any
                        nation in the world than to the French nation. The splendid demonstration
                        now being prepared is significant for both countries. It is not merely a
                        final paragraph added to the act of reconciliation of two nations that have
                        been too long separated. It is above all the striking affirmation of a
                        lasting friendship.</p>
                    <p>“Petit Parisien.”</p>
                    <p>The Englishman, is of a rather cold temperament, but when be lets himself go
                        he does so with a vengeance, and this is just as true of public as of
                        private life. No nation is more reserved, more self-contained, but when once
                        the Englishman's sympathy has been won it can be counted upon.</p> </div><div type="item">
                    <head>BRITISH EAST AFRICA.</head><p>“Morning Post.”</p>
                    <p>Sooner or later the necessity for the creation of a separate department for
                        dealing with the affaire of our possessions in Equatorial Africa will have
                        to be recognised. No doubt, in the orthodox British manner, we shall reach
                        that goal by stages, and Mr. Lyttelton might do worse than consider whether
                        the time has not come to take a preliminary step in the direction of a more
                        efficient system on the lines which have already bean sketched in these
                        columns. But in the meantime East Africa and the non-official population
                        must be heard. Their statement of grievances is a lengthy one, and amounts
                        to little less than an indictment of the whole system under which they live.
                        Even when every allowance is made for the exaggeration which may be looked
                        for in an ex parte statement, made by men smartirg under a sense of
                        injustice and neglect, it is impossible to escape from the conviction that
                        there are many things in the actual condi tion of the Protectorate which
                        merit the most earnest consideration at the hands of the Secretary of State
                        for the Colonies. We need not stay to consider whether the system
                        established by the Foreign Office, was suited to the requirements of the
                        Protectorate before the advent of European settlers. It is evident that, in
                        many important respects, it no longer meets the needs of the situation.
                        Whether the remedies which the non-official population suggest are those
                        best suited to remove the grievances of which they oomplain, we cannot
                        undertake to say. But all the traditions of British Colonial administration
                        are in favor of associating the</p>

                    <p>THE FUTURE OF MOROCCO.</p>
                    <p>It is somewhat remarkable, considering the proximity of Morocco to Europe,
                        that it is only during the last two or three years that any real activity
                        has been shown on the part of the various European Powers to explore and
                        exploit its commercial possibilities. The little that is so far known of the
                        Moroccan Empire points to its becoming in the future, one of the richest of
                        the many rich African countries. It is wonderfully fertile, especially in
                        those provinces situated within the "Tell” region. It has rich pasturages,
                        and although still in avery primitive condition, sheep-farming has proved
                        itself to be a most successful pursuit. Cereal, moreover, of every
                        description flourish, and by proper management Morocco is capable of
                        becoming one of the world's largest granaries. Its mineral wealth is
                        considerable, and it possesses at least three of the most important minerals
                        from a commercial point of view— namely, iron, tin, and coal—besides lead
                        and antimony and others. It is favored with an excellent climate, and in
                        order to enable it to become a prosperous country, it merely re quires the
                        reorganisation of its entire administrative system. At the present moment it
                        is one of the most lawless and uncivilised of countries, and it is
                        imperative that something should be done without further loss of time to
                        bring about a change in the present state of its internal affairs.</p>
                    <p>France, Spain, and Great Britain are the Powers which have the most natural
                        political and commercial interests in Morocco's future. France should be
                        given a free hand as far as the reorganisation of the administration of
                        Morocco is concerned, and in abolishing the present chaotic state of affairs
                        and it is the joint duty of both Spain and England to loyally support France
                        in her endeavours to effect this. If rapine and brigandage can be stamped
                        ont, the prosperity of the country will be ipso facto assured. With regard
                        to safeguarding the commercial interests of the four Powers, guaranteeing
                        the independence of Morocco, viz, France, Spain, Germany, and England, it
                        might be advisable to have a permanent Commission sitting at Tangiere for
                        this purpose,and for each of the signatory Powers to depute a delegate to
                        it. This Commission should also have the supervision of the Moroccan
                        finances, and be ran very much on the same lines as the International
                        Commission sitting in Athens. At the same time the policy of the “open door”
                        should be most rigidly enforced, and fair play be shown to all commercial
                        enterprises, respective of the nationality of their promoters.</p>

                    <p>THE TSAR’S “OCCULTISM.”</p>
                    <p>The secret of the Tear’s hypnotist, who caused considerable talk in Europe
                        some eighteen months ago, is out at last. There has just died at Arbreste,
                        in the French Department of the Rhone, a man named Philippe Landard, who
                        enjoyed such a high repute in France for his power in magnetism that he was
                        known as "Philippe the healer.” He was originally a butcher's assistant at
                        Lyons, but becoming aware of his powers as a hypnotist, he began to practise
                        magnetism, and soon made a fortune. Several years ago he visited Russia,
                        where his fame had preceded him. While there he made some demonstrations
                        before the Tsar’s Court. From this grew the legend.</p>

                    <p>Letters received in Rome from Janina depict the condition of Upper Albania as
                        deplorable. Law, order, and public security have entirely disappeared, and
                        pillage and homicide prevail everywhere. Brigands prey upon the public on
                        ever highway and line of traffic. Even the public coaches have to be guarded
                        by armed police parties, but as the men are badly fed and paid, they
                        sometimes render indirect aid to the brigands. In the same way public
                        officials, unpaid and in want, levy blackmail an the public, and justice is
                        sold with scarcely the pretence of secrecy.</p>

                    <p>VALUABLE GIFT TO SOUTH KENSINGTON MUSEUM.</p>
                    <p>There are now in the Natural History Museum at South Kensington some rare
                        specimens of the skull of the giant pig of Central Africa. These are the
                        gift of Lieutenant R. Meinertzhagen, of the East African Rifles. Zoologists
                        for some years past have been aware of the existence of a large pig-like
                        animal in the Central African forests, the first account being brought by
                        Sir H.M. Stanley, who gained his information from the natives during his
                        Emin relief expedition of 1888-90. Sir Harry Johnston later also heard of
                        it, and thought that the animal might be a pigmy hippota-mus. Besides the
                        skulls, only one of which is perfect, pieces of skin were sent</p>
                    <p>The animal, it seems, belongs to an intermediate species between the wart hog
                        and the river hog, being more closely allied to the former. Mr. C. W.

                        obtain a complete skin and skull without success, states that the natives
                        say that before the great rinderpest plague of 1891 these animals were very
                        numerous in the forests of West Nandi, but the plague killed nearly all.
                        According to them, it has occasionally attacked women sent into the forest
                        to gather firewood.</p>
                    <p>It is hoped by the Museum authorities that a perfect specimen of the animal
                        will be obtained, when it will be publicly exhibited.</p>

                    <p>A WOMAN ON SHOP-GAZING.</p>
                    <p>NOT A PLEASURE BUT A PRETENCE</p>
                    <p>The unsympathetio man will never understand why women find an innocent
                        enjoyment in shopping and window gazing ; and only women will believe there
                        are times when shopping means anxiety more than pleasure. As one lady
                        explains: “I simply had to pretend to look in a shop window till I felt able
                        to go on, otherwise I should have fallen down. This was through sudden
                        attacks of dizziness in the street. I am forty years of age, and would not
                        complain of ordinary indispositions, but really I did not know what to do in
                        my agony. I know now, for in Dr. William's pink pills for pale people I
                        found renewed health and complete relief.”</p>
                    <p>The speaker, Mrs. Barnacle, 200, Great Lister street, Birmingham, added : “I
                        feared to eat anything, for I was a martyr to indigestion. I was often sick,
                        and had such giddy turns going upstairs that at times I almost fell
                        backwards. On getting out of bed I invariably felt faint. Nor did my
                        troubles end there. The least exertion made me breathless ; my liver was
                        sluggish ; and altogether I fell into a low, weak state through anaemia. My
                        lips were bloodless and my cheeks saffron coloured. For two years I did not
                        know what it was to feel well, though treated at two Birmingham
                        hospitals.</p>
                    <p>“But this is how I found my cure. I read in a pamphlet the plain statement of
                        one who had been cured by Dr. Williams’ pink pills, so putting aside
                        ordinary medicine as useless, I began these pills. I felt a decided
                        improvement from one box. Giddiness and indigestion became a thing of the
                        past I could enjoy meals without suffering afterwards, and as the pills
                        supplied new blood so all the signs of anaemia vanished, and I could do my
                        work without feeling exhausted. I know now there is new strength for women
                        in Dr. Williams’ pink pills.” </p>
                    <p>The quiet recommendation of so many ladies is eloquent proof of the high
                        opinion held by them of Dr. Williams’ pink pills, which supply strength and
                        new blood, and are invaluable to maid and matron. They have cured Anæmia,
                        indigestion, palpitations, consumption, pains in the back, neuralgia,
                        nervous disturbances, and the other ailmeuts that women try to disregard ;
                        also rheumatism, St. Vitus’ dance, sciatica, paralysis, and locomotor ataxy.
                        Dr. Dr. Williams’ medicine co., Holborn-viaduot, London, will forward one
                        box, post free, for two shillings and nine pence, or six boxes for thirteen

                    <p>NOTICE.</p>
                    <p>The General Administration of the Egyptian Wakfs informs the public that
                        fifteen plots of land, of which two are situated at Ibrahimieh and are known
                        as Nos. 192 and 452, six at the place called “Cleopatra,” bearing the
                        numbers 78, 167, 201, 202; 203, 816, and the other seven at the place called
                        “Abou Nawater,” bearing the numbers 4 of the square 21, 8 or the square 22,
                        10, 12, and part of 7 of the square 25, 1 of the square 28, and 12 of the
                        square 32 are connected with the Wakfs of Sidi Gabr and el Ansari.</p>
                    <p>A hekr tax is payable on the said plots by virtue of just claims. Therefore,
                        the Administration, not knowing at the present the holders of the said
                        plots, has had sign posts planted on them. It therefore invites all
                        interested persons to present themselves at the Delegation of the Wakfs of
                        Alexandria, Rué elMtroalri, within three months time from this date,
                        furnished with documents establishing their rights of possession in order to
                        pay the amount of hekr due. Should any one fail to present himself in that
                        time, the Administration will dispose of the said lots of land, as being
                        their true and lawful proprietor. </p>

                    <p>NICOSIA &amp; ITS SURROUNDINGS</p>
                    <p>(From a Correspondent.)</p>
                    <p>It is well to spend at least a week in Nicosia in order to see the sites of
                        the town, and to make the several excursions that are of interest around.
                        But during the spring and early summer the climate is so delightful, that
                        many will wish to remain in this quaint old town for a long period.</p>
                    <p>The most important excursion from Nicosia is the drive to Kyrenéa, the
                        northern part of the island, which is charmingly situated at the foot of the
                        mountains, 16 miles by road from Nicosia. With this can be combined a drive
                        up to the mediaeval abbey and monastery of Bella pais, about an hour's
                        distance up the slopes of the mountain, to the latter through groves of
                        olives and carob trees, the latter of which simply abound in this part, and
                        whose fruit is exported to Manchester and elsewhere iu large quantities.
                        They say that this fruit forms the basisof the nourishment in Mellin’s and
                        Morley s food.</p>
                    <p>This ruin is the finest in the whole island. It is absolutely unique in its
                        situation. The cypress trees around its gates are far-famed, and the view of
                        the peaks of Hilarian (to the west; from the roof of the cloisters is
                        probably unsurpassed anywhere, especially at sunset. The whole landscape of
                        the wooded mountain slopes, the Caramanian sea beyond, and the Anatolian
                        hills, rising up like a wall behind it, makes a magnificent picture. Rider
                        Haggard of it as the finest he had ever seen.</p>
                    <p>Thia view is best obtained from the pulpit window in the refectory. This
                        monastery, like many other fine buildings in Cyprus, dates back from the
                        time of the influences of the Lusignan dynasty, to whom King Richard I. sold
                        the island on his return from the crusades, after having vainly tried to
                        reduce it to order, by handing it over to the Knights Templar, during his
                        absence. His connexion with Cyprus will be touched on when we come to
                        Limassol.</p>
                    <p>The best description of the monastery is found in Mr. Enlart’s "L’histoire de
                        l’art Gothique et la Rénaissance en Chypre,” which book can be obtained on
                        loan from the club at Nicosia. One English lady, who lived at and was
                        enamoured with Kyiénia and its environs, says that the most beautiful time
                        of all to see</p>
                    <p>Belia-pais is by moonlight. The stars peeping over the mountains and out at
                        sea must be simply lovely to look upon.</p>
                    <p>The next day the Venetian fort must be inspected early, a pass having been
                        obtained from the Commandant of the Police on the previous evening. Then a
                        drive should be taken to see Lapithos with its perennial stream,
                        corresponding to Kythréa on the other side of the range. The picturesque
                        village lies nestling under the hills to the west of Hilarian and Kyrenéa.
                        All lovers of architecture should then drive down a narrow lane to the
                        sea-side, where will be found a sweet little bay of ancient fame, and the
                        church and monastery of Ache ripiton. The interest of this church lies in
                        its being one of the rare instances of a building shaped like the Jerusalem
                        cross, and consequently possessed of double transepts. The western portion
                        and the porch are Gothic, but the rest is Byzantine. It is a pity that this
                        gem of an ancient sanctuary is kept so unclean by the Greek priest, who
                        inhabits the place ; I think it is probably more thickly populated by
                        insects than any church I bave seen. The priest, as is usual,knows nothing
                        whatever about the building or its history. The tourist has yet to produce
                        in Cyprus a demand for informing guides returning fur lunch to Kyréuia,a
                        distance of 12 miles from Laputhos, which takes about</p>
                    <p>two hours each way, the pass should then be climbed, as it was descended the
                        previous day. At the rest house near the top, a ride on mules, or a rough
                        walk, should be take to the castle of Hilarian (40 minutes) while the
                        carriage waits. If mules are required they can be ordered iu Kyrénia
                        beforehand and sent on to the rendezvous. The normal price for a mule per
                        diem in this part of the is-land is two shillings. The path is very steep iu
                        places and the panoramic views are magnificent. The animals will have -to be
                        discarded at the foot of the last climb, which is a good deal steeper than
                        the ascent to Carisbrooke Castle (I. of W.). The idea of utilising the rock
                        of such a precipitous crag for the walls of one’s home is very suggestive of
                        the character of the inmates. But when one reads that Queen Charlotte lived
                        here, when in fear of the bastard James, her illegimate brother, who seized
                        the throne of the island that rightly belonged to her and her delicate boy,
                        one is amazed at the daring of the woman. The drop is simply precipitous for
                        1,000 ft. and the sea 3,000 feet below seems close at hand. From the top of
                        the steps, now ruined, can be seen Bella-pais through a shoulder in the
                        opposing hill. And one cannot help contrast ing the two ; the rough and
                        rugged haunts of the Lusignan Queen, with the chaste and yet imposing home
                        of those religious men of old. How delicate was their taste ! How ex quisite
                        their sense of proportion, and of art</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>How noble was the pile they reared on the mountain side, so well-founded and
                        finished that the high and massive frontal wall still stands intact while
                        Hilarion is fast perishing. It is an allegory which speaks of the different
                        characteristics and aims of the state and the church in those mediæval days.
                        Each could look upon the other. But the one was an abode of terror, the
                        other of prayer and peace, and it is obvious which has lasted longest and
                        best amid all the changing scenes of Cypriot history.</p>
                    <p>The valley of Kythréa has already been described, in my last article. It is
                        reached by an interesting drive of eight miles through the plain that
                        surrounds the capital. But when once the drive is over, the valley well
                        repays a visit.</p>
                    <p>The site of the ancient Idalion (Dali) is well worth a visit if the visitor
                        has time. This can be approached either from the Larnaca or Limasol road,
                        about ten miles to the south of ; the city.</p>
                    <p>The walks and short drives around the capital are delighted. The Abbot of
                        Kykkon, the most famous Greek monastery in the Island, has a charming garden
                        about 1 1/2 miles out of Nicosia which he is always delighted to show to
                        Englishmen. He is a thoroughly cultured and enlightened man, and appears to
                        have used his wisdom to the great advancement of the financial value of the
                        monastery’s property.</p>
                    <p>The High Commissioner's grounds are within an easy walking distance, while
                        all the southern approaches to the town are lined with beautiful avenues of
                        eucalyptus trees, which grow in this lovely climate at an extraordinary
                        rate. All these avenues, and the trees which now adorn the city moat, have
                        been planted since the British occupation.</p>
                    <p>The sights in Nicosia itself are many, though difficult to find, as few
                        regular guides are available for the purpose. But the residents are very
                        kind in giving visitors the information they require, and those in the
                        island interested in antiquities gladly welcome any kindred spirits.</p>
                    <p>The ancient Cathedral of St. Sophia, like the one at Famagusta, is well worth
                        a visit, and if possible it should be paid on a Friday about 11.30 a m., so
                        as to witness the midday prayers of the followers of the Prophet. The sight
                        is more picturesque than the corresponding one in Constantinople, as the
                        dress of the villagers, who come in to market and to prayers on Fridays from
                        all the country round, is much more picturesque. A good view can be obtained
                        from the gallery in the north transept, to which both sexes are admitted. As
                        the Qiblah faces almost due south from Cyprus, it is fixed in the southern
                        transept, whither at the appointed time the Imam and the faithful gather.
                        The carpets have lately been renewed, and combined with the garb of the
                        worshippers make a very impressive sight.</p>
                    <p>As I have already said the building is Gothic, and was built by the Lusignans
                        in the 13th and 14th centuries. The eastern part is the older of the two,
                        the porch being more decorated than the nave and aisles, which are quite
                        austere in character. It is a great pity that the Turks have disfigured the
                        east end, by making an entrance in the apse and adding sundry open gratings
                        in the walls which have weakened the structure.</p>
                    <p>Opposite the southern entrance to the northern porch, and across the road, is
                        the Greek church of St Nicholas, which is now partly used as a grain store,
                        and partly for collecting antiquities. It used still further to be profaned
                        by being employed as a market for bargaining, but that era has, happily,
                        passed away. As with all true Greek churches there are no traces of side
                        altars. The patterns on the door are evidently copied from foreign designs.
                        If the visitor has time, a short visit should also be paid to Yeni Jamia,
                        and the Armenian church which has some interesting French epitaphs in the
                        nave.</p>
                    <p>When Mr. Jeffrey, the honorary curator of the antiquities in the island, is
                        in residence, he will gladly show the tourist over the Museum. At present
                        this place is in a wretchedly housed condition, and hardly ever visited, but
                        though it contains very little ancient pottery of value, it has some most
                        interesting specimens of Greek and Mediæval art. Unfortunately Cyprus, like
                        Athens, has been largely denuded by the explorer, and Cesnola and Richter
                        have carried away a great deal to America and Germany respec tvely. A large
                        number of duplicates are said however to be piled up in Larnaca awaiting the
                        day when the Government can spare some money to property preserve its anti
                        quities. </p>
                    <p>Lastly, plenty of exercise can be obtained by joining the club during one’s
                        visit. Golf tennis, etc., are the order of the day, and when dinner is over
                        and the moon gets up and the mountain breezes blow with their spicy and
                        bracing force, the Anglo Egyptian marrvels that so few of his compatriots
                        have found their way across the water to Cyprus and how little the
                        recuperative powers of its climate, and the value of the land as a sana
                        torium close at band is realised by English doctors in Egypt.</p>

                    <p>FORTY YEARS AGO.</p>
                    <p>ENGLISH AND FRENCH VI8ITS EXCHANGED.</p>
                    <p>It is a fact worth recalling, in connection with the visit of the French
                        fleet to British waters, that exactly forty years ago, an Anglo-French
                        festival was held at Portsmouth on much the same lines as those on which the
                        late fête has been carried out. As was the case in 1865, the British
                        warships in the first place paid a visit to the French shores. Cherbourg was
                        then the place chosen as the most befitting to do justice to the “friends of
                        France.” Only a few years previously additional fortification had been made
                        at Cherbourg. When the work was commenced it was intended as a menace to
                        England, but when completed by Napoleon I. in 1858, it was celebrated by a
                        visit to the place by our late Queen Victoria, when the most pacific
                        assurances passed between the two Sovereigns.</p>
                    <p>During the stay of our ships at Cherbourg, everything that was possible was
                        done to entertain our men, and, as characterised the recent visit, there
                        could not have been more cordiality or marks of esteem displayed.</p>
                    <p>At a banquet given by M. de Chasseloup Laubat Minister of Marine, to the
                        Lords of the English Admiralty, Rear-Admiral Dacres, and the principal Naval
                        and Military officers, His Excellency, in the course of a long speech, made
                        the following remarks :—</p>
                    <p>“Gentlemen,— I propose to you the health of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, It is
                        a great honor, and a real satisfaction to me, to pro-pose this toast to-day.
                        It is a very great honor, for I come here in the Emperor’s name to welcome
                        the representatives of the British Navy, and I thank them, with the French
                        Navy, for having joined us on the fête day of our august Sovereign. It is
                        also a very sincere satisfaction to me, and this feeling should be shared by
                        every sincere friend to his country and humanity. It is a still greater
                        satisfaction to see this cordial and fraternal union in a port which has
                        already witnessed the meeting of the Queen and the Emperor. Thank God,
                        gentle-men, the time of hostile rivalry is past ; emula-ion alone remains in
                        all that can advance the cause of liberty and civilisation in the world.
                        Believe me, that will be a grand and noble page, in which, narrating the
                        reign of our Emperor and your Sovereign, history shall tell how, entering
                        upon an entirely new era, our flags no longer meet but to open in union new
                        and vaster horizons to human activity, and how, in our disinterestedness, we
                        summon all nations to share the reward of our efforts. That will be a noble
                        page, also, which shall how old prejudices eradicated from the hearts of the
                        two nations, and their manufactures hand in hand, advancing unceasingly to
                        diffuse prosperity among all men, thus displaying their wonders in those
                        splendid tournaments to which we by turns invite the workers of the world.
                        Yes, gentlemen, freedom of the seas, the pacific contests of labour, and the
                        beneficent conquests of commerce, such is the signification of these two
                        noble flags to-day united before us. May God ever protect them, and for you,
                        gentlemen, may He preserve to you your gracious Sovereign. “To Her Majesty
                        the Queen of Great Britain !”</p>
                    <p>After this toast, which was received with applause, the Duke of Somerset
                        spoke as follows</p>
                    <p>“Gentlemen,—I have heard with great pleasure the toast proposed by the
                        Minister of Marine, as well as the speech by which it was accompanied. All
                        Englishmen will feel a strong sentiment of gratitude in learning that upon
                        this auspicious day, in the midst of this select assembly, the first toast
                        proposed by the French Minister was the health of the Queen of England. We
                        accept it as a proof of the cordial amity the Government of France, and I
                        trust the entire nation, feels for our gracious Sovereign and our country. I
                        reply on the part of the British Government, and I feel confident that I
                        also express the views of the great majority of the English people, when I
                        say that we are actuated by the same senti ments with regard to the
                        Sovereign of France and the French people. We wish that the good
                        understanding which now exists between the two countries may be of long
                        duration. To the health of the Emperor and Empress and the Imperial Prince.
                        Long live the Emperor I’</p>
                    <p>The foregoing speeches are sufficient to show the mutual feelings which then
                        existed</p>
                    <p>On the return visit being made by the French Fleet about a fortnight later, a
                        pro gramme worthy of the occasion was arranged, On the morning of the 29th
                        of August, the French Fleet hove in sight, and the Master Attendant
                        proceeded to the Solferino, accom-panied by pilots for the different ships
                        to conduct them to their appointed berths. The Solferino, on approaching
                        Spithead, saluted the Admiralty flag with nineteen guns, which was returned
                        by the senior officer. The “Reine Hortense,” followed by the Os borne, then
                        proceeded into harbour. As she passed the Spitbuoy, the Victory saluted the
                        flag of the Minister of Marine with 19 guns, having the French flag at the
                        fore, and manning yards as the Reiue Hor tense passed. The other ships in
                        harbour also manned yards at the same time. When the last ship of the French
                        Squadron had anchored, the Solferino saluted the British flag at the main
                        with 21 guns. This salute was returned immediately by the garrison, gun for
                        gun. After the French Squadron had an chored, the Rear-Admiral commanding
                        the English Squadron visited the officer command ing the French squadron,
                        who afterward returned the visit. Later, the Minister of Ma rine and his
                        staff, with the flag officers and captains of the French Squadron, were
                        invited to a private dinner by the Duke of Somerset The following day
                        (August 30), the Neva establishments were visited, and a dress dinne</p>
                    <cb n="4"/>
                    <p>was given at the Royal Naval College to the Minister of Marine .and officers
                        of the French Squadron. The toasts, “The Emperor of the French,” "The Queen
                        of England.’’“The French Navy,” and The British Navy," were proposed. and on
                        the health of the two Sovereigns being drank, the ships of both squadron
                        fired a Royal salute and then illuminated. On the 31st a visit was paid to
                        our ships. September 1 was noteworthy, for a brilliant ball, given by the
                        Admiralty to the French officers. The departure of the fleet was made on
                        September 2. The weather during the whole of their stay was everything that
                        could be desired. A correspondent who went on one of the French vessels says
                        that he heard very good English spoken by the majority of the French
                        tailors, and always with the most sincere desire to afford any information
                        that might be interesting.</p>
                    <p>Commenting on the visit,‘The Globe" of the day remarked: ‘There need be no
                        reason why such friendly reunions should not oftener occur, and, indeed, it
                        may almost appear a matter of surprise that they have not taken place
                        before, considering how near we lie to each other. The meeting of the fleets
                        is a demonstration of mutual respect and friendly feeling on the part of the
                        brave services of two great nations, whose political relations are known to
                        the world, and whose common interest in the perpétuation of peace and
                        friendship it needs no accredited public instructor to demonstrate.”</p>
                    <p>After the return to France of the fleet, the “Moniteur du Soir” published a
                        long article, of which the following are a few extracts : ‘The Imperial
                        squadron has returned in England the visit paid to France by the British
                        fleet, and has experienced at Portsmouth a reception worthy of that the
                        English flag had received at Cherbourg. The Emperor's Government is not the
                        first Administration in France which has wished to keep up the relations of
                        confidence and friendship with the Cabinets of London. The good relations of
                        France and England are founded upon mutual interests. There exists at all
                        times between them a further tie in the conformity of their principles in

                    <p>POLITICAL RETIREMENTS IN CANADA.</p>
                    <p>Political retirements are the order of the day in Canada. Sir Wilfrid Laurier
                        is losing two of his veteran Ministers, Sir Richard Cartwright and the Hon.
                        R.W. Scott. The latter has been in public life for more than half a century,
                        and his name has been prominently identified with educational and temperance
                        legislation. Another Ministerial vacancy will be created by the approaching
                        elevation of the Hon. Charles Fitzpatrick, Minister of Justice to the Chief
                        Justiceship of Quebec.</p>
                    <p>The Conservatives are losing Sir Mackenzie Bowell, formerly Prime Minister of
                        the Dominion, and during recent years leader of the Opposition in the
                        Senate. Sir Mackensie is eighty-two, an age at which he thinks he ought to
                        hand over the reins of leadership to younger hands. He sat twenty-fire years
                        in the Canadian House of Commons, and has spent a dozen years in the Senate.
                        He was one of the most trusted advisers and colleagues of the late Sir John
                        A. Macdonald, the ‘ Canadian Disraeli,” who ruled the Dominion for seventeen
                        years. After the death of Sir John Macdonald, Sir John Thompson dbecame
                        Prime Minister. He died with tragic suddenness at Windsor, while on a visit
                        to Queen Victoria, and Sir Mackenzie Bowell then became Prime Minister. He
                        is a native of Suffolk, a oounty that supplied another Prime Minister to
                        Greater Britain, in the person of Sir Gordon Sprigg, of Cape Colony.</p>

                    <p>CORSICA’S NEW CÆSAR.</p>
                    <p>France can dispense with her monarchs, but she finds it necessary to retain a
                        courtier, whose office is permanent. This office is held by M Paoli, the
                        official of the Protocol, as he is styled, the introducer of Ambassadors,
                        the gentleman usher, without any rod, to all Sovereigns who may visit Paris.
                        Presidents and Ministers come and go, but Paoli stays on for ever, and upon
                        questions of courtly etiquette his word is law. Within his own sphere, he is
                        as autocratic as the Tear. The departure of the Shah aud the arrival of the
                        King of the Hellenes almost clashed, but Paoli saw one to the frontier and
                        was smiling at his post to receive the other as if he had bad nothing else
                        to do. That is one of Paoli’s little secrets. The clash had been almost, but
                        not quite. Paoli had seen to that, as he always does. One of the curious
                        things about Paoli—most Parisian of Parisians —is that he is not a Parisian
                        at all, but the native of a little village in Corsica— La Porta, whither he
                        dreams of taking his rest on the dawning of some Utopian day when he can be
                        dispensed with.</p>

                    <p>FRONTIER ARTILLERY</p>
                    <p>Whatever may be the truth about the diplo matic situation in Morocco,
                        information reach ing Paris from Alsace Lorraine represents Ger many as
                        energetically pushing forward impor tant changes of armament on the
                        frontier. The heavy fortress artillery, is especially being overhauled. The
                        big guns of the armoured turrets a of the three forts known as the Kaiserin,
                        Kron-prinz, and Haeseler, at Me'z, are now being re-placed by Naval guns of
                        the newest type,and of longer range than the present heavy artillery. The
                        three forts command the French strategic railways Pagny Nanay,
                        Pagny-CoDfbns, Lon gnyon, and Verdon, and coold easily prevent all
                        communication between Nancy and Verdon. These more powerfal guns entail, of
                        oonrse, an important strengthening of the emplacements. Everything is to be
                        completed by the end of September.</p>

                    <p>BURIED ALIVE WITH A CORPSE</p>
                    <p>THE SEQUEL TO A WEIRD VILLAGE DANCE AT MIDNIGHT.</p>
                    <p>A pope, or Russian village priest, has been buried alive by a mob of peasants
                        in the Crimea, says a telegram from Odessa to the “Express.”</p>
                    <p>The people had ascribed the prolonged drought which has ruined their crops
                        their season to the death of a certain old man who had been .regarded as a
                        wizard, no rain having fallen since his burial in March last.</p>
                    <p>According to the popular superstition, it was necessary, in order to appease
                        the sorcerer's spirit, that his remains should he exhumed at midnight, and,
                        after being sprinkled with holy water by a priest, replaced in the
                        grave.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly on Sunday night a procession of villagers, headed by boys and
                        girls carrying torches and accompanied by fiddlers and flautists playing
                        dismal dirges, set ont for the cemetery.</p>
                    <p>The body of the dead wizard was duly ex-humed, and placed ,in a sitting
                        posture against a tree, around which forty or fifty of the peasants danced a
                        weird dance to the accom paniment of the village musicians.</p>
                    <p>In the midst of the curious ceremonial Father Constantin, the village pope,
                        arrived, and up braided them for their superstition.</p>
                    <p>The crowd at this grew indignant Some among them who were under the influence
                        of vodka, shouted that he was the real wizard, as the spirit of the dead man
                        had entered into his body. The priest was accordingly seized, and despite
                        his shrieks for mercy was hurled by four of the men into the reopened grave,
                        the remains of the corpse being flung in after him with earth and
                        stones.</p>

                    <p>REVIVING ANCIENT NORMANDY.</p>
                    <p>The fêtes of the Souvenir Normand, which are being held at Caen, are part of
                        a general movement which is as familiar in Great Britain as it is in France-
                        The obverse and counterpart of the modern tendency for large differences of
                        race to become less marked is the tendency for the smaller differences
                        inside the great homogeneous economies to be revived and cherished. Thus in
                        Great Britain there is the revival of the Irish language and the, growing
                        insistence on the fact of Welsh nationality by means of the Eisteddfod and
                        other channels of expression, and the numerous, societies in London which
                        prevent the micro-, scopic patriotism of each country from losing itself in
                        a colourless human ocean. So it is in France. No province has remained more
                        faithful to its customs and legends than Normandy. Paris is the great
                        centraliser of France. All the provinces, conscious of their own existence
                        therefore resist, but none more heartily than Normandy. The people of
                        Normandy do not regard even the Frenchmen of other provinces as true
                        Frenchmen. Those who are not Normans are horsainst that is to say,
                        “outsiders.” How strong is the tie which binds all those who have the
                        singularly exclusive good fortune to be Norman is proved, by the distance
                        from which the devotees have, come to the fêtes—not only from England,
                        Scotland, and Ireland, but from Scandinavia, Canada, Sicily, and Russia. Of
                        all the Norman ancestors, William the Conqueror was the greatest. No
                        procession is complete without him, and the difficulty which Frenchmen and
                        Englishmen must feel in adjusting their claims to proprietorship is just one
                        of those things which can be left only to the inspiration of the place and
                        the good humour of the moment</p>

                        Messageries Maritimes, s’est exprimé en ces termes au sujet des perspectives
                        de l’exercice actuel:</p>
                    <p>‘‘Ndus touchousA trois ou quatre jours prè3, à la clôture du premier semestre
                        de l’exercice 1905, ht à l’heure précise où je vous parle, nos recettes
                        purement commerciales sont on pro grès de pins de cinq millions sur celles
                        de l’année dernière a pareille date. D’autre part, les primes à la
                        navigation que nous avons acquisps dépassent do plus de un million celles
                        dont nous avions bénéficié l’année dernière à pareille époque. Cela fait
                        environ, tant en recettes commerciales qu’en prime?, un excédant de six
                        millions et demi en faveur de 1905.</p>
                    <p>“Il est vrai qu’il y a à imputer sur ces six millions et demi les dépenses
                        afférentes à environ 50,000 lieues marines, qui ont été parcourues eu plus,
                        mais même eu faisant cotte détalcetion, une partie considérable, partie très
                        considérable, mais dont je me garderai bion de préciser lo chiffre, demeure
                        acquise en recettes nettes a votre exploitation. Je souhaite de tout cœur
                        ijue cette situation se maintienne, mais il me serait impossible de m’eu
                        porter garant, encore; qae votre personnel s’y emploio de son mieaxj</p>
                    <p>“Notre industrie dépend de tant d’éléments intérieurs et extérieurs, qu’il
                        faut noos résigner a vivre au jour le joar. Cependant, si cette progrosaioQ
                        continue, et encore une fois tom uf/i efforts tendent à ce bat, il sera très
                        aisé do donner pour l’exercice 1905, aux actions de priorité, le dividende
                        statutaire de 5 %, et d'assurer le même dividende aux ancienne! actions
                        ordinaires, tout en entrant très largement dans la voie très sage, très
                        judicieuse, qui vous a été tracée par MM. les Commissaires aux comptes.</p>
                    <p>"Gui, il faut renforcer vos amortissements, il faut doter largement votre
                        fonds d'assurance. Le dividende est une chose très appréciable, je le
                        reconnais très volontiers, mais la valeur intrinsèque de l’action n’est pas
                        une chose négligeable non plus, et lorsqu’on améliore son capital, on
                        travaille tout autant pour soi que lorsqu’on améliore son revenu.”</p>

                    <p>OUR PARIS LEITER.</p>
                    <p>(From our Correspondent.)</p>
                    <p>Paris, August 8.</p>
                    <p>Frenchmen continue to talk and write with enthusiasm of the Anglo-French
                        fêtes at Ports-mith. We are far from the days of the vitriolic articles
                        against England, the violent squibs and caricatures. All that is forgotten
                        in the splendid demonstrations of amity at Brest, Cowes, and Portsmouth.
                        Auspicious name, that of Portsmouth, says one writer to-day. In the American
                        Portsmouth the negotiations for an honorable peace are being conducted by
                        the Russian and Japanese plenipotentiaries. At Portsmouth on the Solent the
                        French and English fleets meet to consolidate the friendship begun at
                        Brest.</p>
                    <p>Admiral Caillard, Commander-in-Chief of the french Northern Squadron now at
                        Portsmouth, who has been appointed by his Majesty King Edward VII. an
                        Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished Order of 8t. Michael
                        and St. George is barely fifty-nine years old. He first distinguished
                        himself in the naval contingent which assisted in the defence of Paris
                        during the German invasion in December, 1870. On the 21st of that month he
                        was wounded grievously at Le Bourget, and next day he was promoted to be a
                        lieutenant iu the navy. He was then in bis twenty-fourth year. He was
                        subsequently captain of a despatch-boat in the Pacific, second in command of
                        a cruiser under Admiral Courbet iu China, and commander of a battleship.
                        Admiral Caillard was for a time Chief of the General Staff of the Navy, bat
                        resigned this office for the command of a division of the Mediterranean
                        Squadron, and took part iu the Mitylene demonstration. Three years ago he
                        became Vice-Admiral, and was appointed to the command of the Northern
                        Squadron, which, in the opinion of competent judges, he has raised to a high
                        state of efficiency. Here in Paris the Admiral is hailed now as the man of
                        the day, as his squadron ia being received in so splendid a manner at
                        Portsmouth, and as he is taking so prominent a part in the consolidation of
                        the “entente cordiale”. The honours conferred on Admiral Caillard and his
                        colleagues and subordinates of the French navy by King Edward are much
                        appreciated here.</p>
                    <p>The French naval manœuvres in the Mediterranean have been of considerable
                        interest, and Admiral Fournier, who has acted as "admiralissimo,” has won
                        golden opinions. It is yet too early to disengage any lessons of practical
                        value, but some points may be noted. The tactical exercises have had the
                        object of investigating new battle formations, and it appears to have been
                        concluded that those formations were best, and least liable to mask the fire
                        of one ship, or division,by the position taken by another, which had
                        undergone least change in the presence of the enemy. The value of the
                        autonomous groupes conjugét increased, as tho officers in command gaiued
                        greater confidence in occupying the positions indicated by the
                        circumstances. The idea has been to test the system of independent, but
                        related, divisions of ships operating for a common object. The submarines
                        are understood to have been very successful, but, of course, the battleships
                        have placed themselves iu position to be attacked. On one occasion the
                        Korrigan, a sister of the unfortunate Farfadet, well placed on the line of
                        approach of the squadron, succeeded in torpedoing the Brennus, which was the
                        leading ship, without being perceived, aud emerged at a distanoe of 200
                        metres. The officers and men of the Korrigan were warmly to congratulated on
                        their success, especially in view of the anxious period through which they
                        had passed, owing to the sad disaster to the sister vessel. The torpedo
                        flotilla attacked the squadron near Bizerta on a later occasion, but the
                        night being clear with bright moonlight, they were unsuccessful. The final
                        review was a very successful event.</p>
                    <p>It may be remembered that the Superior Council of the French navy
                        recommended, as the force adequate to the requirements of France, the
                        constitution of five squadrons, each composed of 6 battleships with 4
                        reserve ships, five divisions of 3 armoured cruisers with 3 reserve
                        cruisers, 12 second-class armoured cruisers with 6 as a reserve, 6 scouting
                        vessels, 1 destroyer for each ironclad with 6 for the Far East, 58 torpedo
                        craft for torpedo boat and submarine divisions, with 15 as areserve. Under
                        this programme the French fleet would in 1919 muster 486 nuits. There remain
                        to be constructed 11 battleship*, 1C armoured cruisers, 6 seoond-class
                        armourer cruisers, 6 scouting vessels, 66 destroyers, a large number of
                        submersibles and submarines, and 50 torpedo boats. The annual cost would not
                        exceed for new construction £4,840,000, and a margin would thereby be left
                        for the Payment of the vessels now under construction. The estimates for
                        1906 provide for the laying down of 8 battleships, 10 destroyers, and 20
                        submersibles. The battleships to be begun next year will have a displacement
                        of about 3,000 tons more than the Kèpoblibne class, and will carry four
                        12in. guns, twelve 9 4in., sixteen 12pr. semi-automatic guns, and eight
                        6pr., also semi-automatic. They will have a speed of eighteen knots. The
                        destroyers will be of the Claymore type, but a little larger. The submarines
                        or submersibles will have a displacement of from 400 to 500 tons. The navy
                        estimates for 1906 provide for the vote of credits amounting to about
                        £13,000,000</p>
                    <p>Parisians have, during the past few days, been much interested in what might
                        be de ecribed as the rise and fall of Jaluzot. Jalazot is the name of the

                        the "universal providing" order, and as he belongs to the race for which
                        money-making has no secrets, he has within, the past ten</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>years been a power to reckon with in a oapital which worships the man with
                        the money-bags. 1 have heard a story, which is not very edifying as to how
                        M. Jalazot first obtained the money to start in business, and he has never
                        treated his employés in a manner that would justify the Printemps being
                        taken as a model by workmen’s organisations. Bat be has made money, and
                        although he has pocketed thousands of pounds from English customers, no
                        sheet in the world—one cannot, call them papers—has heaped, more virulent
                        abase on the English, and told more lies about our countrymen than the
                        “Patrie” and the “Presse,” two organs of the gutter press belonging to M.
                        Jalazot. This Hebrew speculator succeeded, some years ago, in getting
                        himself elected as a deputy in the French Parliament, but I can find no
                        record of any signal service that he has rendered to his adopted country.
                        Not content with his earnings from the Printemps warehouse and the two
                        “rags” he runs, he must needs try conclusions with the sugar brokers on the
                        Bourse de Commerce. Thia time, however, he met those who could not be taken
                        in with flashy wares or spurious sentiment. He ran op against business men
                        who knew him, and had little liking for him, and the result has been
                        disastrous for the Israelitish speculator. Now he cries out that he is
                        ruined. He did not mind if others were ruined, but now that his own purse
                        feels the pinch, he does not like it. Parisians, however, are not likely to
                        waste much sympathy on M. Jalozot They have seen his kind before, and they
                        will hardly believe that he is ruined. He has lost money, of course. But he
                        has no intention of submitting to his passing ill-fortune. And at this
                        present moment, I am certain he is looking round for some other means of
                        making money in the future as easily as he has made it in the past</p>
                    <p>One of the most recent developments of the system of police identification
                        methods of M. Bertillon, who has done so much in that direction, is the
                        “spoken portrait.” The idea is by a minute analysis of the face from a
                        photograph to so describe a man that even if you never saw him you would
                        recognise him at once from the analytical details supplied. The nose, for
                        example, is divided into three general categories, large, medium, and small,
                        which in turn are subdivided into concave, rectangular, and convex. The
                        ears, the lips, and other features are treated in the same way, and the eyes
                        are the subject of very elaborate description. The details thus obtained are
                        added to a dossier containing the thumbprints and other human documents
                        concerning criminals, and the result is a personal reoord which leaves a
                        prisoner, who has once been in the hands of the police, very little chance
                        of passing unrecognised. That the system has been proved to be a serviceable
                        one is evident from the fact that in the Paris police force M. Bertillon's
                        latest development of the “spoken portrait” has been made a subject of
                        compulsory study, and the members of the force are taught to recognise each
                        other from the analysis of the photographs furnished to them.</p>
                    <p>There are various ways of launching a new magazine. This is the method
                        adopted by the publishers of the latest Parisian review, “Je sais tout” M.
                        Georges Daniel, a well known Paris journalist, wrote for this magazine an
                        article entitled “La tournée des grands-ducs.” The article was accepted by
                        the editor, but the author was considerably surprised when it appeared to
                        find that it was signed, not by his name, but by that of an author with some
                        reputation, M. Jean Lorrain. M. Georges Daniel wrote to M. Jean Lorrain
                        protesting, and the latter at once replied, recognizing in the most
                        unconcerned fashion that the editor of “Je sais tout” had, as a matter of
                        fact, requested him to contribute an article on “La tournée des
                        grands-ducs.” He had replied that he had not the time, and thereupon he had
                        been informed that no refusal would he accepted, and that his task would be
                        facilitated by means of ‘ documents' that would bo famished to him. The
                        “documents” were, it appears, the article of M. Georges Daniel. M. Joan
                        Lorrain “resigned” himself to the proposed plan, but he protests that ho was
                        not aware that his signature was to be apposed to the article of a confrère.
                        And he terminates his letter, couched in charming language, by offering to
                        his oon-frère all his regrets, and the assurance of his distinguished
                        consideration. A few days later M. Daniel recieved from the manager of “Je
                        sais tout” a letter asking him to call at the offices of the magazine, and
                        when he put in an appearance there he learned that he had been accused by
                        the editor of an attempt at blackmail. An exchange of seconds followed. To
                        the seconds of M. Daniel those of the editor denied the accuracy of the
                        accusations for which an excuse, or “reparation par les armes,” was
                        demanded, but he recognised having said that “the habit of the firm was to
                        attach the signatures of well-known writers to articles written by those of
                        less notoriety.” Now the public is warned, and has only itself to thank if
                        it is deceived. Bat the practice which has just been exposed in connection
                        with “Je sais toot” is, I am informed, the recognised custom in most
                        publishing houses in Paris, when writers with a name do not themselves write
                        the articles attributed to them. The conclusion of the foregoing incident
                        will probably be heard in the Law Courts.</p>
                    <p>At the present moment, when the Esperanto Congress at Boulogue-sur-Mer has
                        brought the question of a universal language to the front again, it is
                        interesting to learn that if we cannot hit upon a tongue which will serve
                        for humanity the world over, we may still accomplish something in the way of
                        facilitating communication between people of different languages. The Swiss
                        are a practical race, and one of their latest achievements is the creation
                        of a telegraphic code destined to serve travel lers of all nationalities in
                        the selection of</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>apartments. A curious prospectus which I have received contains certain
                        reflections which will appeal to any man of common-sense. The Swiss hotel
                        keeper has said within himself; “I must make it easy for everybody to
                        communicate with me, and for that purpose I shall draw up a code of easy
                        words, which shall be significant of much, and not to be mistaken. The
                        average man, when be wants to telegraph for rooms at a hotel, has to spend
                        much time and money, and even then he is not always understood. I shall show
                        him how he may avoid all trouble.” And so the International Telegraphic
                        Hotel Code is the result. “Alba” means a room with one bed, “arab” a room
                        with two beds, “abeo” the same with three beds, etc. The central letters in
                        these code-words words have no importance. Only the first and last letters
                        are of value. The first letters indicates the number of rooms, the last the
                        number of beds. Four formulae are reserved for the hour of arrival,
                        “Granmatin” means that you will arrive between midnight and seven in the
                        morning, “matin” between seven o’clock and midday, “sera” between midday and
                        seven o’clock, and “gronsera” between seven in the evening and midnight Once
                        yon know the code, all you will have to telegraph if you want to say :
                        “Reserve me for-to-morrow two one-bedded rooms for one night ; we shall
                        arrive between seven o'clock a.m. and midday,” will be “De main belab pass
                        matin.” Could anything be easier? But it is not very euphonie.</p>
                    <p>The Paris Sunday is an institution which never fails to interest the visitor
                        from England, and even more the visitor from Scotland. A great deal has been
                        said about the Continental Sunday, and. as usual, those who know least have
                        had most to say about it. We know what Sunday is like at home. In Scotland
                        it is apt to be a dreary round of uninteresting religions functions, engaged
                        in, first of all, because it is the Sabbath, and, secondly, because
                        centuries of tradition have taught us that the Sabbath must be devoted to
                        all that is dull and irksome. In England, if it is not quite so cheerless,
                        it is at least a day upon which most of os have to do things we would rather
                        not do, or, at least, upon which we are deprived of those things- we want
                        most. The Nonconformist conscience broods over everything, and—if it does
                        not rain—the sun shines upon a people whose faces and demeanour are eloquent
                        confirmation of the charge that, if Sunday be a pleasure, and surely it is
                        meant to be, then we do, indeed, take oar pleasures sadly.</p>
                    <p>On the Continent it is otherwise, and by otherwise I do not mean that, as
                        some would lead you to believe, the day is given over to liberty and
                        licence. Nothing of the kind. There are those in Paris—jaataa there are in
                        London or Glasgow—to whom release from work means alcohol and saturnalia,
                        but they are an infinitesimal minority. And when I drove through the Bois de
                        Boulogne lately with a Scotchman and his wife, and watched the Parisians
                        enjoying the Sunday in their own characteristic fashion, he remarked : “If
                        this is the Continental Sunday, then I have nothing to say against it” And
                        he added that what surprised him mostt was the fact that, although the
                        wineshops, cafés, and brasseries were wide open, and were well patronised,
                        no one seemed to be intoxicated. “I have not seen a single drunk man,” he
                        said. “And I have rot heard any bad language.” He would not probably have
                        recognized it if he had, but still, I was able to assure him that he had
                        heard much less than if he had been in the vicinity of many a crowd of my
                        own countrymen. We left the centre of the city and travelled to the Porte
                        Maillot, the most popular entrance to the wood, by the “Tabs,” and although
                        the train was crowded uncomfortably there was no rude pushing and shoving,
                        no inhuman and ungal-lant elbowing-out of women and children so that the
                        lords of creation might take their places. The Frenchman is a philosophic
                        per-son, and if he does not get the first train he waits for the next and if
                        two or three have no room for him he consoles himself by grumbling, and
                        going somewhere else. He does not fight.</p>
                    <p>We are a pugnacious race, and if we do not get what we want, we want to have
                        it out with someone. Not so the Frenchman, and in his never mind,
                        indifferent attitude he very often chooses the better part He does not think
                        that the matter is worth losing his temper about and most times he is right.
                        He argues that he has come out to enjoy himself, and it would be poor
                        enjoyment to begin by putting himself in a bad mood. So instead of the
                        overcrowded train he takes a 'bus or a tram-car, or he hires a “taxametor,”
                        and when he reaches the splendid wood that the Paris Municipality maintains
                        for his enjoyment he arrives in a good mood, and he, and his wife and
                        children are ready to smile and laugh and feel contented at everything that
                        happens.</p>
                    <p>If it be a workmen's family, they have brought little, light wood seats with
                        them,and while paterfamilias and materfamilias squat on these the chicks run
                        about on the grass and chase the elusive butterflies Or the father gets out
                        his fishing rod, and there he sits and angles while mother takes the little
                        ones for some milk and cakes. And when the sun goes down and it is time to
                        return home for the evening meal, it is a happy, if tired, company that
                        makes its way once more towards the city. The Bois de Bonlogoe crowd on a
                        Sunday is not exclusively composed of poor folks. At this time of year, of
                        course, the wealthy are not numerous in Paris, but last Sunday they were not
                        all at the seaside or in the mountains, and the humble perambulator, and the
                        modest donkey-chaise were frequently passed by elegant broaghams and
                        snorting automobiles. I my friend if be had remarked anything wrong in tbe
                        Continental Sunday. “No," was his reply, “I think we have something to learn
                        from the French."</p>

                    <p>London, Ang. 7th.</p>
                    <p>Under the auspices of the Kaiser, the German agitation to close the Baltic
                        against the war ships of this country finds a ready echo in the press of the
                        Fatherland, but without any practical result so far as this country is
                        concerned. The Channel Fleet will go through its manœuvres, let it please
                        our cousins or not. Old William of Prussia, who, with the assitance of
                        England, laid the foundations of the German Empire, tried on the same game
                        with Denmark in the long ago, and signally failed. The German scheme of
                        to-day has not even the merit of originality. A quarter of a century ago the
                        Iron Chanoellor invented the 4'pin-prick policy” by which he hoped to drive
                        England into a sort of alliance. Whilst the object was legitimate enough the
                        mode of procedure was rather singular. Bismarck’s idea was to annoy England
                        all over the world and thus worry her into accepting German friendship, or
                        German hostility. Germany seized part of New Guinea, the*Cameroon!, etc,
                        etc, in pursa-anoe of this policy,bat Salisbury was more than a match for
                        the German, and all that the latter gained was several useless oolonies,one
                        of which has cost a tidy sum in men and money in the past few months, and is
                        likely to cost more, and, what was worse, the kindly feeling which Britons
                        felt for their “cousins” has gone the way of many another friendship. The
                        good feeling between Franoe and Great Britain has simply set Germany crazy,
                        and the main object of her present polioy is to upset that good feeling, the
                        basis of which was so happily laid by our gracious sovereign, King Edward
                        the Peacemaker. Another unlooked result of this policy is that England has
                        concentrated an enormous naval force within a few hours steam of the shores
                        of the Fatherland.</p>
                    <p>Sir A. Berkley Milne, Bart, a well-known north country officer, has been
                        appointed second in command of the Atlantic Fleet from the 25th inst This
                        gallant officer entered the Royal Navy in 1869, served in the Trans-kei
                        campaign 1877-78, in the Zulu War, as aide de camp to Lord Chelmsford,
                        including the battle of Ulundi, where he was wounded, and in the Egyptian
                        Campaign, 1882, including the battle of Tel-el-Kebir. He was latterly
                        employed as rear-admiral in command of the Royal yachts.</p>
                    <p>The 1st Battalion Royal Dublin Fusiliers will leave Malta on the 16th
                        November for Egypt. The battalion is due at Alexandria four days later. It
                        relieves the 2nd Battalion Rifle Brigade, which goes to Chabuttia,
                        India.</p>
                    <p>The British battalion and detachments, stationed at Khartoum, in the future
                        will be under the supervision and command of the Governor of the Sudan, who
                        will communicate direct with the War Office on all matters relating to them.
                        This is a step in the right direction, and another move io decentralisation,
                        which has long hampered official life.</p>
                    <p>It is announced that that the Khedive’s decoration, granted for the
                        operations against the cannibal Niam-Niams, in the Southern Bahr-el-Ghazal
                        is not to be issued to the Imperial officers employed in the expedition.
                        Why?</p>
                    <p>The Asseye is the first transport to leave Southampton for Bombay this
                        trooping season. She is due to leave there on the 6th September, and her
                        principal freight will be the 17th Lancers, under the command of Lieutenant
                        Colonel B. P. Portal, D.S.O.,with Major N. T. Nickalls second in command.
                        The Asseye is due at Bombay on the 28th following. On her return voyage she
                        will convey to England time expired men and various details.</p>

                    <p>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</p>
                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
                        vitality—vigour--</p>
                    <p>VITAL STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY</p>
                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night
                        succeeds the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the
                        celebrated life-reviving tonic</p>
                    <p>THERAPION No.3</p>
                    <p>than by any other known combination. So surely as it is taken in accordance
                        with the printed directions accompanying it, will the shattered health be
                        restored,</p>

                    <p>and a new existence imparted in place of what had so lately seemed worn-out,
                        "used up,” and valueless. This wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and
                        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative
                        essence, which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had
                        preceded it for this wide-spread and numerous class of human ailments.</p>
