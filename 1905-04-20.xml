                            statutes, which was approved with some slight changes. According to
                            these statutes an International Society is constituted at Alexandria for
                            the suppression of the white slave traffic, in order to put a stop by
                            all due methods to this scandal. The society’s governing body consists
                            of a general committee, of which tho Governor is chairman. This
                            committee selects nine persons as.an executive' committee, which for the

                            committee is that of forming a committee of ladies to assist them in
                            their work. Subscriptions to this society consist of three categories,

                            which he has conducted in Egypt, the directors believe that the whole of

                        <p>Mr. Justice Kekewich, in the Chancery Division last week, had before him
                            the matter of Brown v. Haig and Oxley, arising out of a pending action
                            by Mr. Archibald Knox Brown, a mining engineer, against the defendants
                            with regard to a disputed partnership in some mining concessions in
                            Egypt and the Sudan. Mr. P. Ogden Lawrence, K.C., for Mr. Haig, said the
                            application against the plaintiff was that he should be ordered to give
                            security for costs in a pending action, and he would also submit that
                            the notice of trial was irregular. After hearing Mr. Terrell for the
                            plaintiff, his lordship ordered the plaintiff to give security for £100
                            to each of the defendants. As to the notice of trial his lordship found
                            that the rules had not been observed, and he therefore set aside the
                            notice of trial on this, plaintiff's counsel at once gave fresh notice
                            of trial </p>

                        <p>While in matters financial the same conditions on the Stock Markets have
                            ruled as were ruling last week the issue of the South African Trust, and
                            the most recent Egyptian companies have thrown extraordinary light upon
                            the amount of capital ready for investment The applications in England
                            and France for that company are stated to have amounted to £20,000,000,
                            showing there are still in these two countries investors with sufficient
                            confidence in the future of “Kaffirs" to put in as much again as has
                            been invested up to the present This, taken in conjunction with what we
                            call attention to below, would seem unmistakably to point to ranch
                            enlarged markets in the future, and considerably higher prices for
                            investments, even in the mining class The future of cheap money seeming
                            to be assured, it would look as if a return to these conditions most
                            lead to an altogether higher level of prices, especially when considered
                            in conjunction with the Government plans of not making any further issue
                            of Consols this year. As soon as the new issue of £10,000.000 Exchequer
                            Bonds, which has been greatly sought after, is out of the way, a
                            considerable rise in Consols would appear to be inevitable if the
                            political barometer is undisturbed. There is much leeway yet to be made
                            up by first-class investment securities, and as soon as these have
                            appreciated, the demand for more speculative stocks is sore to follow.
                            The accounts of the Easter holidays will no doubt delay events for a
                            short time. </p>

                            money alone. The number of applicants exceeded 5,000,. The allotment of
                            the shares will be made to-day. It will take place simultaneously in
                            London and Egypt and each distribution is independent of the other. The
                            price of the shares is nominally 5/8 premium, although we doubt if they
                            could be bought even at 3/4 premium. We understand the rush for the
                            prospectus was so great that, although the London Bank applied for more
                            copies a day or two before the issue was made, the company were unable
                            to famish them Cut enough, to-keep pace with the demand. The Egyptian
                            market, with the exception of the mining section, which is weak, keeps
                            fairly firm. Dairas hold their price well at 27 1/8, and both National
                            and Agricultural Banks keep strong, though both these prices really look
                            quite high enough at 27 1/8 and 13 3/8. Egyptian Markets have come in
                            for some attention this week, and have hardened to 1 3/8, and look good
                            for a further improvement The issue of shares at 2 has not affected the
                            price of Delta Lands. </p>
                        <p>The remarkable success of the last new issue, the Egyptian Trust and
                            Investment, Ltd., has been referred to above. The Egyptian Laid and
                            General Trusty issued two days previously, iras also largely
                            oversubscribed, and the shares stand at 1/2premium. This company. is in
                            good hands as far as the market is concentrated, and should do well. </p>
                        <p>In the mining section the North Nile Company's report was a weak point,
                            and upset what was already a dull market, so that prices have given way
                            considerably. Fresh capital requirements are spoken of in several cases.
                            What business there is is of a very professional nature. </p>

                            erected in the south porch of the church. This tablet will record with
                            dates the chief points in the history of the church, and will give a
                            list with date of consecration, of Anglican Bishops in Jerusalem and the
                            Bast and also a list of the chaplains of St Mark's. The winged lion of
                            St Mark, with opened book of the Gospels, the Arms of the Bishopric, and

                        <head>LEGAL NOTES MIXED COURT OF APPEAL</head>
                        <p>At yesterdays sitting of the Court of Appeal, presided over by M. de
                            Konmu, several interesting cases were beard. One concerned the question
                            as to whether, in consequence of the decree of November, 1904 (following
                            the Anglo-French Agreement), the Egyptian State, Railways, in relation
                            to treaties, were still under the jurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunals.
                            The point was a purely legal one, and the arguments were a ably put
                            forward by Counsel for the appellants, and Sciarahati Bey for the
                            Government. A claim for damages amounting to £7,500 against the
                            International 'Sleeping Car Company was disposed of A waiter in the
                            service of the company was injured in accident which occurred in 1908.
                            The patient was doing well under the. treatment of the company's
                            doctors, Dr. Madden and Dr. Phillips, but he developed “railway spine”
                            after the unusual period of nine months after abandoning the company’s
                            doctors. The Cairo Tribunal granted him £1,400 instead of £600 which the
                            oompany offered as equivalent to his net salary of £4 a month for his
                            lifetime. Both parties appealed The claimant set forward his points
                            through Me. Volpini, replacing Me. Ballis of Cairo. Me. Carton de Wiart
                            appeared for the company and forcibly pat forward its position,
                            maintaining the offer in spite of the curious circumstances of the case.
                            There was also an action for the illegitimate use of tobacco packing
                            cases, in which Me. Manusardianly defended the Salomon Cigarette
                            Company, whilst Me. Carton de Wiart strongly advocated the appeal of
                            Messrs. Sabi Bros., the Cairo merchants. The case of Boustros Bros. v.
                            the Alexandria Stockbrokers’ Association will be heard on the 26th inst
